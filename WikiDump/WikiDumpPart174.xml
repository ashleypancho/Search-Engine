      <text xml:space="preserve">I thought it would be best to open this discussion page since there's more than one group working on the project! This way we can all work together! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 13:16, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Sounds good. So I was just talking to my group and for some reason we didn't quite realise that there will be LOADS of groups working on the same topic and people have actually started writing stuff. We thought it would only be fair if we did this in a '''structured''' way, so dividing the whole topic &quot;online identity&quot; between all of us so no one ends up being left out. Ok? As other people have already started working on the intro, theories and important characters we thought about picking the whole social media aspect in relation to online identity (because that seems like something that hasn't been addressed directly yet)- mainly focusing on the development of online identities (user names, avatars and actual profiles, anonymity etc) and associated privacy issues, security settings and so on. Would that be ok with you guys?! Just making sure that we're all happy here and get a fair share of contribution. Please give feedback as soon as possible as we want to start writing! (-Team TenaciousD) --[[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 13:27, 23 March 2014 (UTC)


Agreed, and to get the ball rolling, I'm thinking of looking at the security side of things. Which means I'll be looking at information online, how secure/insecure our online profiles and interactions are, how this has changed over time etc. Any problems or questions just contact me! [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 13:56, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Yeah well as I was speaking for the whole group that section should be saved for you, Martin. Just need the overall permission of other groups. Or we could just be very authoritarian here and say that section is ours, end of discussion. ;) --[[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 14:08, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Okay, I was thinking of making a start on the issues surrounding impression management. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 10:39, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

This all sounds good to me, I think I shall have a look at profile pictures and the connections they have in connection with persona and impression management. Do people think its a topic worth talking about on its own, or perhaps a subtitle to impression management? [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 11:15, 24 March 2014 (UTC) 

I would maybe say within impression management. However, once it is on the page and would look better as a separate section we could always edit it? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 11:24, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

That all sounds fine by me! I was thinking about doing a bit about how the development of social media sites has effected on how online identities are created. [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 14:18, 24 March 2014 (UTC) 

Thats true, we can always change it towards the end if we think it will look better another way. I think persona was also an interesting topic covered in the lecture which could be relevant in the wikibook, for example the idea of wearing a mask as being similar to our online identities. I believe it was C.G. Jung that spoke about this, so maybe he is a theorist we'd like to consider as well. [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 16:06, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

Sounds good. I'm currently looking into personalised adverts, so how online advertisement is changing due to companies gathering and using personal user information from e.g. social networks like facebook. [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 20:07, 24 March 2014 (UTC)


Just to let people know, I'm working on a section on blending online and offline identities. It would be handy for everyone working on the Online Identity chapter to put a wee note in this discussion so that every person knows which areas are being covered. [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 18:04, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

RedGebsKasia, I am late too this as I have been so busy and have just realised that you are doing profile pictures. I may have added a small amount of text to that section without checking here first, sorry! There are so groups making it difficult to choose a certain theme. I am going to try and gather information on the risks of online identity, discussing bullying, paedophilia etc as oppose to genuine security and fraud issues. Does anyone have any objections? [[User:Debsi91|Debsi91]] ([[User talk:Debsi91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Debsi91|contribs]]) 16:13, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
 
No worries at all! We can all add to any sections if we have something to add anyway! That sounds like a good idea to me! [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 17:16, 27 March 2014 (UTC)


Hey there, I just wanted to check what everyone's attitude is towards editing or adding to what other groups have written about? My group are still in the process of doing research, so we haven't got round to posting our stuff up. When we do, there will probably be some overlap with what the rest of you have written. Would you like us to ask here before we add stuff to or edit other people's sections, should we just crack on with it or should we try to just create our own little subheadings? Just thought I better check in case we inadvertently start causing chaos! [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 20:49, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE SilentJamie''' Regarding editing, I think it's inevitable that we'll step on each other's toes a little with there being so many individuals working on the topic. I'm totally comfortable with people editting anything I write and, so far, the team members I have conferred with are also comfortable with it. (Perhaps it is worth leaving a note that one has edited on the discussion page.) [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 11:34, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Kriscampbell91''' That's grand! I can't see anyone having to do any major edits because the work that's been done so far looks great, but I might add a few paragraphs to some of the sections at some point. Still, I'll make sure my group is aware that we should leave a little note here if we're going to do any editing. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • 
[[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 12:26, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys, im a bit late to the game here, my laptops been in the shop all week, i was supposed to get it back tuesday but no such luck. The section I decided to work on was interlinking your web use with your social media. However, i'm starting to think this subject could be quite limited so if anyone has any suggestions as to directions i could that would be a big help. Im already looking at how it hinders your anonymity online so whoever is doing anonymity has covered anything concerning this help would be welcome
[[User:EuanWhitelaw|EuanWhitelaw]] ([[User talk:EuanWhitelaw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/EuanWhitelaw|contribs]]) 15:46, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE: SilentJamie and editing''' you may want to think about looking to see who’s work you are editing before you edit it and then leave them a note on their discussion page telling then why you thought best to edit it, ie. Spelling mistakes, wrong or misleading information, that sort of stuff. [[User:SmithBiancaAnn|SmithBiancaAnn]] ([[User talk:SmithBiancaAnn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SmithBiancaAnn|contribs]]) 22:41, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE: EuanWhitelaw''' I don’t think you should worry about the section being limited as online identity follow many different routes and then branch off even feather from then on. Your best bet if you are worried about the overlap in information is too try and source things that no one else would have looked at, i.e., perhaps look at some key reading for simple concepts but to follow up names of references in those book to gain knowledge and research that no one else has yet to look into. But if you’re wanting to look into anonymous/anonymity then perhaps you could look into online gaming alongside RedGebsKasia as online gaming is a platform for shielding ones true identity, especially if you look at reality games such as Second Life or IMVU, which I am sure you will have seen advertised at some point online. For these avatar creating is necessary, potentially re-designing yourself and concealing ones identity. [[User:SmithBiancaAnn|SmithBiancaAnn]] ([[User talk:SmithBiancaAnn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SmithBiancaAnn|contribs]]) 22:41, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE: EuanWhitelaw ''' If you are struggling on deciding what to wright on online identity, here are some of the most interested topics to wright about on online identity, the development of identity, security, impression management, gaming and the blending of online to offline identities.

I will be discussing online identity using theorists that are well established in the psychology sector as they offer many incites to how online and offline interactions have impact one ones identity and identity of self. I will also hopefully also be talking about this in relation to the ‘project of self’ which is a theoretical theory of how a person gradually builds up their identity, this can also relate to J Lacan’s Mirror Theory which I am sure many of you may wish to refer to or wright about. [[User:SmithBiancaAnn|SmithBiancaAnn]] ([[User talk:SmithBiancaAnn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SmithBiancaAnn|contribs]]) 22:45, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE: BerlinLea and Advertising''' you may wish to look into how Huru, which is an online TV streaming sight that allows to you watch TV episodes at any time, allows you to choose which ad’s are relevant to you. [[User:SmithBiancaAnn|SmithBiancaAnn]] ([[User talk:SmithBiancaAnn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SmithBiancaAnn|contribs]]) 22:49, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE: SmithBiancaAnn''' Thanks for the suggestion! I will definitely give it a look and see if I can include this as some kind of case study. However, I think we should all try to narrow down our focus as much as possible as there are so many people involved in this project and it would be a shame if there was a lot of energy wasted on something that someone else is already covering... Of course once we've got our texts posted we should read over each others' stuff and add more information/ material etc wherever it's needed. Concerning your suggestions for Euan- these are really the most popular fields relating to online identity and are already being covered by people in our group (and probably others as well). So I think if you're still happy to focus on interlinks between websites and social media, Euan, you should give it a try and see how much you can find on it. If not there is loads of other stuff that can be considered. Remember- it's not about quantity but quality! :) [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 08:58, 29 March 2014 (UTC)


I would like to briefly touch upon Lanier's views of social network sites compared to homepages of the 1990's and how he feels that SNSs are not allowing people to express their identites and creativity. I am unsure where this would fit however; does anyone have any suggestions? In the Main theorists section? Or in the social media sites section? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:20, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

RE: ButtonsElizabeth I think that maybe it would go better in the social media section if you are just briefly touching on something? I think if it were in the main theorist section that would require a greater body of working other than this topic of SNS. Otherwise, I think his work is a really good point to bring up! [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 15:08, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for your feedback Kasia. I put it in Theorists last night but now I am not sure. What do you think? Do you think that it fits in that section or should I move it? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:18, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

'''catfish'''
Hi guys, I've been having a look online for some different material to add to the page and I've been doing a lot of reading about Catfish and I was wondering what people thought about adding an entire sub-heading for it or if it would seem better for me to just add the text below anonymity. I also noticed that &quot;catfish&quot; was in the glossary but I couldn't see any text on the page about it, so I wasn't sure how relevant it would seem unless we used the word in context? Let me know what you think! [[User:Megan4pmGlasses|Megan4pmGlasses]] ([[User talk:Megan4pmGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Megan4pmGlasses|contribs]]) 11:10, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Catfish''' I actually had Catfish in mind as I was reading around disembodiment and multiplicity! I think it would be a great modern and current representation of the theories we are exploring! You could explore the term Catfish and perhaps go on to explore the ways in which play with their identity exemplified in the documentary and in the TV show! I am looking at extending the multiplicity section a little, so adding to this idea is perfect timing!

Hey guys! I wasn't sure where to write this on the page but I just wanted to let people know that in reference to groups using this page for their own discussions (Team Axe and Team Straight Outta Compston (excellent!)), you may want to create a group page and hold your discussion re. presentations etc. on there so that you don't have to be scrolling through all of this every time you want to make a suggestion to your group.

==Gaming==

I was thinking of some more ideas for the main body of our wiki, and was wondering about the gaming culture as being a kind on online identity? I'm not greatly familiar with gaming, so I was wondering on people's thoughts of gaming acting as an online identity in the virtual world, for example The Sims. Or could any game be considered an online identity? [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 18:09, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

RE: Gaming for RedGebsKasia, not all games are online so I wouldn't say all of them are online identities. From my own experience the best thing to look at if you're looking for online identity is MMORPGs - for example World of Warcraft or EVE Online - they're places where people truly establish secondary identities. Of course Second Life is about as extreme an example as you can get of online vs offline identity if you want to go that route. Hopefully that helps :). [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 18:17, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

RE: RedGebsKasia, In terms of referring to the online gaming identities, I would say that it is a brilliant thing to talk about as it is no secret that people often gender swap on these online games such as WOW aka world of warcraft, and this obviously reflects some of the major ideas talked about by online identity theorists, this idea that the choice of identity swapping is so easy and the idea that we can dibble and dabble in it if we so wish. Of course this in terms of gaming can in turn spill over into our real life. Here it would be perfect to talk about Second Life as there has been many reports of instances in which individual, who spend all of their time in this virtual reality, lose track of what is and is not considered to be appropriate in actual physical society. However, I would suggest that you steer clear of defining Second Life as an online game as it is more of a virtual reality. One of the cases I can think of the top of my head is how a middle aged male went into a supermarket dressed in nothing other than an extremely large nappy, this occurred as he blurred the boundaries between virtual and actual reality. In Second Life it was his fetish to be a baby and so his avatar of course was a baby, and too much time spent on this virtual site had lead him to forget perhaps that in fact he actually was not a baby. I am aware that there are plenty of other similar cases out their regarding the blurring of boundaries from online to off. You may also wish to talk about how people become to blur the boundaries in the first place, for example it was obvious that this person has some incessant need or longing to be seen as a baby and essential Second Life only offered him a way to be this, arguably he may have always wanted to be seen as a baby. Therefor it could also be argues that online just offers us an extension of our selves. So you may wish to also look at it that way.

RE: Gaming: these all seem like great ideas! Looking into gaming seems like a good idea, perhaps there is someway we can divide this topic up since there seems to be others who know more about minecraft, whereas I'm less aware of what it is as i've never played it? I'll look into the idea of having a secondary life, and also the blurring of reality and online identities, as it seems like a really interesting point of discussion!

RE: Gamaing: this seems like a pretty solid section and think it links well together with belonging section as many people who use these games are escaping the real world to enter an online community where they can meet like minded people and achieve that feeling of belonging. If that's something you are interested in looking at. I also just noticed that one of Van Koten's main research questions is; What are the main forces at work in the production &amp; consumption of digital representation? and get had suggested this means; what makes digital media so popular? So you could look at it from the perspective of the online identity you adpot in these games, this is what draws people in.

I also found an interesting thesis paper that explores various topics within online identity but has a particularly interesting section on gaming and player involvement that may be useful to you it's called; Selling Your Self: Online Identity in the Age of a Commodified Internet, by Marwick, A.E.(2005)You can find the whole thing online.

It may be good to look at the huge rise in Player vs Player gaming, and how their online identity of playing the game transcends that of offline identities such as gender, race, political viewpoint and so on. It, ''potentially'', can often reduce or challenge the pre-existing ideas or stereotypes they have of that identity.

==Anonymity==

At the end of the impression management section I think we need to address whether or not it is deception and a negative thing. Do you think that would then lead on well to the issue of anonymity? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 17:06, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE: Anonymity for ButtonsElizabeth.''' -- I understand you've taken on Impression Management and have its material covered. I also see you have posted a question about linking it onto anonymity. I'm not sure it's a seamless link insofar that impression management seems to entail [for the most part] a balance of sharing, withholding, and distorting information instead of being totally negative. Written the right way it could flow into anonymity really well though! I have also already starting drafting some ideas for anonymity (particularly the dishinibition effect and trolling online) so perhaps we could converse and work to have our sections flow into one another. You can message me on my discussion page? [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 12:30, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

I am also going to point out '''the disembodiment effect''' - how the idea of agency outwith the physical realm of our bodies is what differentiates online activity and online behaviour from our own behaviour in real life. This, I will '''lead into anonymity and the disinhibition effect.''' The idea of losing oneself in one's online behaviour without one's body to be held accountable. I will '''also touch on multiplicity''' - the idea of taking on various online identities within the disembodied state! I am disembodied writing this, right now! [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 12:39, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Do you mind if I add a bit to this section? I was going to bring up the fact that our online identities can be used for deception, but conclude with the fact that it is actually only a minority that use it as a negative outlet; many use anonymity in a constructive and progressive way. If you have already started to cover this no worries. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 10:21, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi, guys! I was thinking today that we haven't really talked about anonymous bulling that happens online. For example when people create fake online identities to harass people they know in real life and sometimes that can have really terrible consequences like suicides. And also that sometimes people create online identities just for 'trolling'. I think that's something to write about, but I'm not sure. What do you guys think? [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 14:54, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I think it is a good idea that has lots of potential, and you have linked it well to online identity, so good shout. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:20, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yes I agree Liisa! That's definitely something we should consider. I'd actually be able to provide some case studies I think as I had to do loads of research on cyberbullying for a psychology internship. [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 12:02, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Perhaps it would be a great run in after disinhibition effect? Could be a good flow... I'm working on posting disinhibition now!!! [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 12:43, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I just added something as 'Cyberbullying' but it's pretty basic stuff, so you guys can add more to it if you want to! Like Lea, if you want to add an example from a case study?

Hi, I was wondering if I could write something in Anonymity about how online chat rooms can make people feel more confident and open because they don't have to face a person? [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 16:36, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

That sounds like a really good idea, Caroline. The anonymity changes the way they present themselves, so their identity is different online then it would be in reality. [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 16:43, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I hope that it is okay that I added a statistic/quote about Koreans and how anonymity has affected their sense of blurred identities into the Dissociative Imagination section. I thought it fit quite well and was a good stat to get in.

'''RE: Cyberbullying''' Just added a case study to the cyberbullying bit. It's kind of an intersection between cyberbullying and catfishing actually, but I still put it under the cyberbullying heading. Hope that's ok.

==Referencing==

I would like to ask '''what everyone is thinking about referencing''', I've noticed there haven't been any made yet within the references section. A lot of my content so far is from academic reading and I wish to reference it. Does anybody know the guidelines as to how to do it? Peace!

I asked the general world of wikibooks about referencing and a gentleman called Martin sent me a link on how to reference. If you go onto my UserTalk page you should be able to see what he sent me, and I think it is a big help. let me know if you can't find it.

Regarding referencing, does everyone think that we should stick to the APA referencing style of the CMC division and our course? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 20:53, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah i think that would be a good referencing system to use since we should be familiar with it! As long as we all use the same system so its consistent [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 13:46, 2 April 2014 (UTC)
 
I'm really struggling on how to use referencing, I used the link that was given on '''ButtonsElizabeth's''' page as i'm trying to reference Papacharissi in the 'Profile Picture section.

Does anyone know what to do when we only have one reference for a large section of text that is split into several paragraphs? Should we just put in one reference at the end of the section or should we repeat the reference after each little paragraph? I'm not using any direct quotes so it seems a bit pointless to keep repeating the one reference. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 17:27, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Jamie''' Do not quote me on this, but I would guess that in your situation one reference at the end would be okay, as long as your are referencing. If you have time you could maybe ask someone on Reading Rooms and see if you get a reply before end of play on Friday? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 21:59, 2 April 2014 (UTC)


'''Jamie''' I agree, it's better to ask, but as long as you have only one reference for one long section, I don't think it is necessary to reference it after every short paragraph. It should be enough to reference it once in the end of the section. --[[User:Rekarippel|Rekarippel]] ([[User talk:Rekarippel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rekarippel|contribs]]) 23:36, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks guys! I'll ask on the Reading Room just to be sure, but I'm sure that the one reference at the end of the section should be fine. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 08:53, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Using the same reference for more than one paragraph''' - As I mentioned earlier, I asked on the Reading Room about whether we can just use one in-text citation in a section where there are separate paragraphs but only reference has been used. The answer came back that this is not the proper way to do it. Instead, separate citations should be used at the end of each paragraph to prevent confusion should a paragraph be moved during the editing process. Just thought I should let you all know as, like me, some of you thought that one citation would be enough.

Hi Guys, I've just added some references to the list and they seem to have come out ok. However, I am a bit concerned because I added them amongst the others already there and did it alphabetically. However, it looks to me as if the reference section is a bit messy and confused. Some people seem to be doing it alphabetically, and others are just adding their reference to the bottom of the pile. Do we have a plan of which way it is meant to be? [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 20:20, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I think alphabetically will look more professional. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 08:23, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

== Introduction ==

Thought I would start a new separate conversation for the introduction. I had made a start to it and was just briefly outlining some of the stuff I thought needed to and could be covered in later sub headings in the main concepts area. Obviously everything we could possibly cover is not there so here we can discuss what else needs to go in it and what needs to be removed and modified. And we can add parts to the intro as the main concepts section develops. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 10:33, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

Great - citations needed, however... [[User:GregXenon01|GregXenon01]] ([[User talk:GregXenon01|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GregXenon01|contribs]]) 15:01, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

== Narrative ==

I am working on a bit about narrative and think it would fit quite well just after the main theorists section, as it makes reference to a lot of the topics that others are going to discuss later. I am going to put it in, and if it doesn't work and when aspects need changed we can discuss it here. Let me know what you think. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 11:58, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Sounds like a good idea! The one thing I was wondering is whether it might be better to categorise your paragraph on narrative under the heading &quot;Forms of Digital Representation&quot;? That way, if someone is writing a paragraph on realism they could put it there as well since the two concepts are kind of related. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 16:58, 28 March 2014 (UTC) 

I am more than happy to do that, good suggestion. I am going to put it up later tonight and please give me some feedback upon what you feel should be changed and added; I feel like I am struggling to expand it a bit. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 10:36, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

I've just taken a look at what you've written and it looks good to me. Admittedly, I've not read much into the whole concept of Narrative so I'm probably not in the best position to help you expand on what you've written. Having said that, the one thing I can think of adding off the top of my head would be something about the psychological component of narratives. Quite a few slides from the lecture on Online Identity were given over to the discussion of this, so it would probably be a good idea to explore it in relation to Facebook posts and profile pictures which I noticed you only briefly mention. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 20:37, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi, can I add something into the narrative section? I was thinking about writing how different Facebook pages deal with narratives? Some people put on everything, but others are a lot more critical about what they post? In a sense it is an edited narrative? Also, I was thinking of writing something on how people can have false narratives on chat rooms or dating sites because they feel their lies are safe and they feel liberated being somebody new? [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 16:33, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that is a good idea Caroline, especially as I was feeling that the section was looking a bit thin but have been struggling to pad it out. I like that you are approaching the negative side of the argument too. You could maybe even link it to the concept of realism, can we can put a definition of realism in the glossary. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 19:19, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've added two sections to narrative and I can add a definition of realism to the glossary [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 20:39, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I recognise some material in this section from my lectures. It would be *really* nice (and, indeed it is a requirement and a convention of commons attribution - therefore ethical!) to cite the key thinkers used. In this case... me!

== Blended Identities ==

Just thought I'd start this separate little conversation in case anyone else from another group was planning on writing a section about blended identities. It should be a relatively short section since as far as I can tell, there's not that much research on the subject, but if anyone wants to contribute feel free to let me know here! [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 16:58, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey there Jamie, I'm working on blended identities too. I've done a little research and constructed a paragraph, would you like to show me some of your work so that we can both make this a good, coherent section? Here's mine thus far:
&quot;When those who have only previously communicated online meet in a real world situation, this is referred to as 'blending identity', wherein the online and offline identities of a person merge. For example, in the case of online dating, the users first interact through the website's chat interface having approved of the other person's profile (their online identity). They then may decide to interact outside of the Internet in a different social context, which is when they meet each other's offline identities. Fandom is another instance in which the two identities merge, as a user will construct an online identity for pursuing an idol/celebrity then proceed to reveal their offline identity when they meet.&quot;
So far, very basic. I'd like to perhaps include a proper definition of 'offline identity' and better link this to the lecture/seminar material. Any thoughts? [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 19:38, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey Imara, I'm still in the process of doing research but I'll get it all written up and post it here as soon as possible so as you can have a look through it. A lot of what I've found relates to blended identity in online fan communities, so that should fit nicely on to the end of your paragraph. What you've written looks great so far! Are you planning on putting your definition of &quot;offline identity&quot; in the main article on blended identities or is that something that you think would be better getting added to the glossary section? Also, when you mention linking what you've written to the lecture/seminar material; are you talking about your definition of offline identity or your main paragraph on blended identities? [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 16:34, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

Also, do you think we should be posting our work under the Forms of Digital Representation section or the Impression Management section? [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 18:56, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey Jamie, I am wanting to write something about how people blend various online identities and in return, their natural identity becomes unclear and confused because they are displaying multiple personalities. [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 16:11, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Caroline, I've created a section for Blended Identities on the Wikibook so feel free to create a subsection for what you'd like to write about. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 21:57, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I'd also like to add something to this section found a great book by Geerit Lovink that looks at celebrating multiple identities if that fine with everyone. [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 12:12, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

No problem! As I said to Caroline, I've created a section for Blended Identity on the Wikibook so feel free to create a sub-section within that and add what you've found in the Lovink book.

Hi, I've just contributed and I hope what I have written is ok. [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 15:11, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

What you've written seems grand to me. What does everyone else think? [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 17:05, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Everyone's written some really great stuff! I'd like to add in a section about blended identities in online dating, possibly using Tinder as an example. I hope this sounds alright! [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 20:22, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

That sounds great to me. I look forward to reading it! [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 20:38, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I really like this section; I think it is really well researched. However, perhaps a couple of sentences about Lanier's view should be inserted somewhere, maybe linking in his analogy of the MIDI note, and whether people are becoming like them- overtly defined and restricted in practice to what is represented in a computer? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 21:18, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Have written up a section on online dating for the page and posted it for approval, and am currently forming some add-on text regarding the use of Tinder. Great idea to try and link in Lanier, Elizabeth! This page is looking awesome, hopefully I can improve my section to be good as well, just wanted to get the basis down. [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 22:04, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm currently in the process of adding a few more bits and pieces to the text that I've already added to the Wikibook. I felt that I needed to add a bit more personal analysis to what I'd written. Hope nobody minds! [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 11:06, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

In the fan culture section do you think it would be possible to split it into smaller subheadings? I got advised to do that for the social network sites section as that was considerably longer than any other section, and it did make the whole thing look a bit better and fit in a bit more. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 22:08, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, that's fine. I agree that it needs to be split up into smaller subheadings. I'm just unsure as to what headings I'll use at the moment. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 08:57, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

== Social Media Security ==

Hi everyone, I'm doing the security side of social media but during my research this topic very frequently ends up being tied to user privacy and online privacy. Is anyone else doing that side of things? If not, is it okay if I incorporate that into my side of things? :) [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 18:57, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

I was going to do a small section on online safety which I guess is linked to the security side of things that you're wanting to cover. Do you think we should create a sub-section on Security, Privacy and Safety Issues where we can both post our work? Also, to answer your original question; if I do cover issues of privacy, I'll be doing it in a way that relates to online safety rather than security. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 00:00, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Jamie, I think we could definitely do a subsection on that yes, I will be concentrating on the social media side of things but we can either create a collaborative topic or write seperate parts of the online security thing under subsub headings, if you follow? Any thoughts or preferences? I'll keep hammering away at my bit for now and we can change things up as we go :) [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 14:25, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm only touching on the social media aspect, looking at it more of the perspective of how it encourages a sense of belonging and enables obsessive fan culuture. On the topic of social media secuirity I noticed in the class blog it was a quite common view that secuity varies from site to site maybe you could looking closer at the reasons for this if you're going anywhere near that angle.[[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 15:58, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

That's a good idea actually Claire, I'll do some research around that topic and see what I can add to my drafts so far. Thanks for the suggestion. [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 13:39, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Just thought I'd leave a quick message to say that I've decided to scrap my idea of doing a section on online safety due to time constraints. I don't think writing about it will necessarily add anything to the Wikibook which hasn't been touched upon by other people writing in other sections. Having said that, if anyone feels like taking over and writing about it then go ahead! [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 18:48, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

No worries Jamie. I'll at least be trying to touch upon online security in some way as it's directly related to my topic so it'll be in there in some form, and if this books gets edited by other wikipedians I'm sure they'll expand on it too. [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 22:16, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

&lt;b&gt;Clairepporter&lt;/b&gt; I agree that we should maybe focus on individual social media networks and refer to their privacy policies to see how each one differs. I've done this for dating apps such as Tinder, but I feel that this would be really interesting to do both facebook and twitter.

==Belonging==

I'm definitely interested in looking into the fan culture side of belonging. Perhaps looking at some of the more serious cases and seeing if there has been any particular academic studies on this area.[[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 15:50, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Fan culture does seem like a very relevant and influencial aspect of online belonging.
I am wanting to look at the concept of online social identities as being part of a performance art, along with a need to proove yourself to others through what you post online. [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 16:01, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

This sounds good so far. I have been looking into how blogging is one of the ways in which users can achieve a sense of belonging. I am going to post it shortly so let me know what you think. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:11, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Also, is there any objection if I do a couple of introduction sentences just to link the belonging section into online identity? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:11, 31 March 2014 (

RE: Blogging: Not quite sure who wrote this section but I think it has a lot of good ideas. The only part a would suggest a small edit is the section that says 'it is a difficult thing to get your thoughts and opinions published' I thought it was quite informal maybe something along the lines of 'It is difficult for a notice writter to get their thoughts and opinions published'. Its not major change but just an idea. 

I hoping to add to my fan culture section today when I find some more readings, anyone have any thoughts on it so far? [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 11:33, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

No objections that perfectly fine.[[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 16:24, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

ButtonsElizabeth, do you mind if I add something to the section you have just put up on, &quot;blogging?&quot; [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 16:41, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

You are more than welcome Caroline. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:43, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

For the Welcome/Unwelcome section maybe (sorry, not sure which member of our group wrote this particular section) you could round it up a little bit more in relation to online identity, maybe about how welcome or unwelcome aspects affects our online identities? It just jarred a little bit when I was reading it.[[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 19:10, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Caroline, I really like your piece, but I would maybe suggest putting a description of persona in the glossary, especially as I suspect the word is going to come up quite a bit throughout the book. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 19:10, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Elizabeth, I can do that... or at least try. Also my reference in my last edit did not come out right. Can somebody advise what I did wrong? [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 20:45, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I have come across something in my readings which might be useful. I was thinking that online identity and by extension, 'belonging' could be viewed from the perspective of social networks interacting with the media. This would ultimately discuss citizen journalism and communication as people are now getting more involved with news and becoming a part of the process…Does this sounds like something that I could tie into our sub-category? [[User:Debsi91|Debsi91]] ([[User talk:Debsi91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Debsi91|contribs]]) 22:27, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Debbie, yeah I think that would work especially after what Greg said this morning in the lecture about citizen journalism he seemed keen for us to tie other topics into our sections. Also social networks are probably the biggest example of the belonging idea anyway. [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 11:40, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi guys, whats gone up so far looks really good! I was wondering what kind of words we could consider putting in the glossary? I think Persona would be one of these, as Elizabeth says. I think its difficult for us to establish what words online audiences might find contentious considering there may be a variable amount of knowledge on the topic. I'm going to ask with other wikipedians what the situation on this may be, and as to whether there are particular rules/ conventions to follow when looking at the glossary. What does everyone think? [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 14:45, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I think persona, I added in disinhabition because until this module I didn't know what that meant. I read through the belonging section but they're aren't any other words in particular I noticed but I'll have a double check. Let me know if you get any feedback from other wikipedians Kasia.

Great, that's perfect! I will also note any glossary worthy words. I take it we are keeping all of our sections from 100-200 words. I'm not sure if other groups are keeping to a word count or if it depends on the depth of information available on each topic.

I added, &quot;persona to the glossary,&quot; so I don't know why it is not comming up for you to see, but I will take a look. [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 16:29, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I think I am going to add to some of my posts in this section and add some references because a couple of my entries have none so far and I think it would look better if I evidenced the research, so just to let you know that they will be updated later today.

== Main Theorists ==
Hi guys, i'm trying to add to the main theorists section of the wikibook with a few articles by theorists i have found. Yet I realise you will all be looking at the same stuff as this for your own research so i thought it would be a good idea that everyone could simply add to the theorists section as they go along? just post a link to whatever article you're using with the name of the theorist and a short description of their argument. Obviously if you feel like you are just repeating yourself thats ok, and if any of you would like just post a link to any writing under this topic and i can try and write a short summary for the section myself i'd be more than happy to, just an idea. If anyone has a better plan or thinks this wouldn't work so well please feel free to say so.
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 17:41, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I was thinking that should danah boyd be mentioned? She has written a lot of especially about social networking sites but I'm not sure if she can be considered as a main theorist? What do you guys think? [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 18:15, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

well I guess we don't have to define it as &quot;Main Theorists&quot; that was just what I choose to begin with, we cold define it as something else in order to try and incorporate as many theorists as we'd like to use i guess. Would that be alright? just leave it as &quot;Online Identity Theorists&quot; or something.
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 18:42, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I am up for changing it to online identity theorists, as I have some nice information on Lanier but did not know where to put it. Have you done some work on Lanier yourself and I can add to it if need be, or shall I go ahead and you can add to it? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 18:56, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

You could just change the title to &quot;Theorists&quot;? That way people can write about theorists that aren't necessarily defined as &quot;online identity theorists&quot; who have something important to say about online identity. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 19:43, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

That sounds right, I agree with Jamie on this one. I was just about to look into Lanier but i'd say simply add whatever you've got Elizabeth and if i ever find anything else to add i'll do so. It would be good if we could somehow link the theorists section to the section of the book they are referenced in somehow, is it possible to place a link to something further down the page?
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 19:50, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

In the Lanier piece I have tried to relate it to some of the sections further on in the book. Do you think that is okay? I am unsure of how else we could do that, unless anyone else has a suggestion? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 20:35, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I was looking at the theorists section and thought that we might want to add info on McLuhan to it, so I'll get the ball rolling with that, if that's alright? [[User:Megan4pmGlasses|Megan4pmGlasses]] ([[User talk:Megan4pmGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Megan4pmGlasses|contribs]]) 12:29, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

There is a section written about McLuhan and Williams under 'Cultural Theories applied to Online Identity' but maybe adding some more information about them to the 'Theorist' section is also a good idea, as it will make it look more organised and easier to find. --[[User:Rekarippel|Rekarippel]] ([[User talk:Rekarippel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rekarippel|contribs]]) 15:30, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks &lt;b&gt;Rekarippel&lt;/b&gt;! I've added a small section but will look at the Cultural theories sections so that I'm not duplicating any information!

==Social Networking Sites==

Hi, I'm going to add a bit on this about how the development of SNS has caused people to need more authentic online identities. I hope I'm not stepping on anyone's toes and if someone has anything to add to that, they're more than welcome! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 18:08, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I was maybe going to write a little bit about how people tend to present themselves differently to different groups of people in their life and then this is reflected in the use of multiple social media accounts on different sites. (Like how someones facebook may seem professional, then instagram and snapchat could represent a whole other identity) Don't know if that treads on what you're trying to say though? or It could just be an extension to what you're saying, if you maybe angle it that because alot of social media is linked these days it causes individuals to stick to the one online profile? just a few ideas, feel free to write what you want. 
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 18:55, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

For the profile pictures section, I don't want to write anything  incase it is being worked on, I think we need to develop the persona side of the argument, maybe describing what it is and bringing in briefly Jung's psychological dimensions and how he used the notion of persona to explain phenomena of role-playing. Thoughts [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 19:30, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Shayman1''' You're welcome to write about that, and maybe to add to that could be how business companies have profiles on social media and certain people who manage them. So, they're basically creating an online identity for their business e.g. all of the things a gym would post on their Facebook would be about fitness or healthy eating. Actually, I think I might want to write about that, if that's cool? We could collaborate the two together? [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 19:44, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm going to write about youtube as being a social media site and form of online identity because i don't think its really been looked at yet, and it could tie in with the whole anonymity thing, sort of as a counter argument, ive not done much work on it yet but i'll keep you posted on the direction im going with it, and if anyone else would like to collaborate with me just put a wee reply.

Hi guys. I'm from one of the groups doing Always-On Culture and I just wanted to ask if I could put a link in my paragraph to your paragraph about social media sites? I wanted to link my paragraphs about teens and always-on back to online identity and thought it would be good if the pages were interlinked.

'''RE Shayman1''' When talking about the online identities of a business, I think it would be important to note their use of social media as a means of seeming less like a business, and make them appear more 'human like', which is against the grain for most businesses who wish to keep a professional standard - for instance, O2 and Tesco Mobile bantering between each other on Twitter.  [[User:Jack.oldfield|Jack.oldfield]] ([[User talk:Jack.oldfield|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jack.oldfield|contribs]]) 19:30, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Jack.oldfield''' That's actually a really good point as well! it would be quite interesting to put in a section discussing how a company's SNSs profile is used in order for it to appear more friendly and relatable to their consumer audience instead of just thinking of their customers as just money making opportunities, Is that something you'd like to write about '''jack.oldfield''' or Is that something I could add to your section '''Liisamy'''?
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 20:58, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE KathrynHairUpAndGlasses''' yeah that would be great! I was thinking about referencing how our online identity is constantly kept up and updated more than ever before through the use of always-on culture so would it be alright if I could link to you also? If theres any other sections of cross-over it would be good to continue the link between our pages to deepen the information we have.

'''RE Shayman1''' I'm guessing that I will put my section under 'promotion of identity'.

'''RE Jack.oldfield''' That's a really good point to focus on, big companies and corporations using social networking means to create an online identity synonymous with their marketing demographic! I have friends who have started businesses, some in fashion, some in hospitality, some in photography and they even use SNS as a sole place to set up an image and identity that they can market to people!   It's all about the demographic and reaching them through a constructed online identity!

'''To whomever has written about &quot;Flexibility of the Self&quot;''' I think you have articulated the point really well! Your section is a SNS specific example of the idea of &quot;'''Multiplicity'''&quot; posted earlier under the Anonymity heading. Would you be open to editting this slightly to highlight the link between this idea as exemplifying the term multiplicity which is explained prior to your section? It would really connect and link the entire page together! [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 14:12, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Jack.oldfield''' yes definitely! It would be great to see some statistics of some sort of how social media marketing has grown over the years, and possibly mention how other media outlets that used to make their money from advertising are at a huge loss because of it (newspapers etc.). It could also be linked to always-on culture seen as it allows company's to advertise whenever/however much they like without the restrictions of newspaper or television advertising and so on.
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 15:38, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Shayman1''' I never thought of comparing it to always-on, or look at the fall of traditional media that relied on advertising. I also think that 'creating an online identity synonymous with their marketing demographic' is a really key point '''Kriscampbell91''', there could even be an expansion on that, in the idea that they are catering to the demographic of social media as well, broadening their scope of their target market. [[User:Jack.oldfield|Jack.oldfield]] ([[User talk:Jack.oldfield|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jack.oldfield|contribs]]) 15:54, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm sure I already mentioned it somewhere but I'm currently working on something about online (customised) advertising in social networks. I'd also like to point you towards a dissertation that I found particularly helpful in my research process. It contains loads of theoretical background information to our topic as well: http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/files/2013/10/A_critique_of_identity_representation_in_social_media.pdf [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 16:16, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi '''Kris''', I have tried to link the flexibility of self section to multiplicity. Do you think it is okay? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 19:32, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE ButtonsElizabeth''' I think it reads really well. I especially enjoyed your quotation from academic reading 'Physically attractive people will get noticed at a party, but articulate, insightful and witty people who know how to spell will get noticed online.' I remember noting it when reading and thinking what an interesting aspect, building identity through manipulation of witty language. Do you know you to set an in-page link from the word 'multiplicity' that can link to the multiplicity section and I could edit 'flexibility' into my text to link to your section. It would link these ideas as they are stemming from the same root of multiple images of identity online. It would really strengthen the page as a collaborative work! I'm not sure how to go about finding out how to do it, I have tried to speak to reading room before regarding how to put notes in the page but heard nothing back - luckily a classmate came to my rescue - so I am reluctant to ask reading room again.

==Glossary== 

I was having a quick scan through the Wikibook earlier and I noticed that although we have an awful lot of stuff written up, we only have three terms in the glossary. I thought it might be a good idea to create this little section so that if anyone comes across any terms that they think should be clarified in the glossary, they can put a little note here so that someone can sort it out. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 21:19, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Yeah this is a good idea, I had added a word to it yesterday and noticed the same thing. Not sure who wrote the section of technological determinism under the cultural theories heading but maybe you could add 'technological determinism' to the glossary, as I know before this module I wouldn't have know what it was. [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 11:51, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, I agree with you about that. I think that section was done by someone in my group so I'll ask them to add &quot;technological determinism&quot; and &quot;cultural determinism&quot; to the glossary. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 13:31, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi guys, I've consulted other Wikipedians asking on some general advice on the content we should consider putting in our glossary, so they should hopefully get back to me soon.

'''Hi Clairepporter''' to link a word to a Wikipedia page, put this type of bracket [ before the Wikipedia web page address, then leave a space and type the word you want to link to then finish off with a ] bracket.

Hi there, I have heard back about information from the Reading Room about Glossary help. They were very helpful, saying that as a writer they considered that very little words were needed to be used in the glossary, however as a reader they would link words that were particularly difficult and perhaps link them to other wiki's or dictionaries to give a description on the word [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 09:51, 3 April 2014 (UTC)


Hi, I've added a glossary entry on, &quot;realism,&quot; but when I looked the word up in the dictionary and on wikipedia I found that it has loads of different meanings in relation to different fields such as: philosophy, sciene, social sciene, media, art and so on. I added the definition that seemed most the central and holistic, but feel free to add to it if you feel it does not involve the notion of online identity and realism. [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 09:57, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

==Layout==
Hi all, since there is so many of us working on the project, a few of us where discussing today that it is quite difficult to organise our Wikibook to make it look aesthetically appealing. I was wondering what people thought about the general layout of the page, and whether things needed to be swapped around to make it look better? For example, I was considering the 'Contents' tab being at the top of screen, whereas the title 'Online Identity' is below this, and not very visible on first glance of the Wiki. What do people thing about putting this below the introduction? [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 15:01, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I was wondering about the layout also. I agree that the content tab should be below the title, so that it would be more clear what we're writing about. I was also thinking about pictures, since that's common especially on Wikipedia and I've seen them on Wikibooks, too. It could make the page flow a bit better and it wouldn't be all text, which looks quite boring to be honest. Should we post pictures if it relates to the subsection that we're writing about or will it be too crowded then, what do you guys think? [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 15:28, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that sounds like a good idea. I think it will definitely make the Wiki look a lot more appealing. As you say, I think there being a lot of writing can possibly make it long to read, especially since there is so many topics! However I think we will have to be careful when posting pictures due to copyright. Also we probably won't need pictures for every section. What are peoples thoughts on this? And also which topics would be suitable for pictures and others not so? [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 15:37, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that all sounds good. I was going to ask what people thought about the balanace of the page as we were talking about it with Greg in class today in terms of how well balanced text will make it more asthetically pleasing. Most of the sections are pretty equal apart from the section on social media sites under the impression management heading. Maybe the person who wrote this could consider putting in a sub-sub heading in this just to break it up a little as it is quite a large piece of text. What do people think? [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 15:55, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm wondering what everyone else thinks about the &quot;Main Concepts&quot; section? It seems a bit odd to me to call a section &quot;Main concepts&quot; and then talk about theorists rather than purely concepts. Also, it makes it seem like all the other sections of the Wikibook aren't main concepts, which isn't necessarily the case. Do you think it would be best to change the name of the section to &quot;Theorists&quot;, rather than having that as a sub-heading? [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 19:27, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, I was wondering whether the overall structure perhaps needs to be changed ever so slightly to make the Wikibook a bit neater? I was having a look at the page for Always-On Culture and the way they have their work arranged seems to make a bit more sense as well as making it far easier to read and navigate. Perhaps some of you could take a look at their page if you have a spare moment and tell me what you think about doing the same sort of thing with our page? [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 19:35, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I also agree about the content tab needing to be moved, however I am at a bit of a loss how to do that, so someone else might have to give that a shot. As far as pictures go, I think it would be nice to break up the content, but the only thing I can think of for pictures would be generic Google images of people using the internet or avatars, and I am not sure how much that would add to the page. Also, Claire, I wrote a bit of the SNSs section, so I will have a look at it and see what I can do. Do you have any suggestions as of yet though? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 20:47, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

As for the Main Concepts Section I agree that it looks a bit odd that Theorists is a sub heading. Do you think we should move it to its own heading, maybe before the glossary, or even before the Cultural Theories section? It would make it a lot neater. As far as comparison the Always-On page, I think this page is inevitably going to look a bit more chaotic (and I am not saying it is too chaotic) as at the moment we have more content. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 20:52, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE ButtonsElizabeth''' I'm sure for the pictures there would be plenty of images used within our source material that would fit in nicely into any information we have taken from them, plus for the mention of certain sites (facebook etc.) we could just add in company logos to try and separate the text. Might be quite nice to add a picture of the theorists to their section, i do agree the theorists section should be moved too or come under it's own sub-heading anyway, it would flow a lot better with the layout.
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 21:59, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE ButtonsElizabeth'''Thanks so much for rearranging the SNS section, it looks much better now! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 13:46, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I think perhaps our page doesn't look as good as Always-On because we simply have more content, as Elizabeth has already mentioned. It's great stuff though, so we wouldn't be wanting to delete it. Perhaps if people can give their sections a quick scan to determine if some could be made more concise? Other than that, it's all pretty relevant so there's probably no harm keeping it. With pictures, we may have to be careful not to detract from the professional look of the page. Do you think company logos will be allowed or will there be copyright issues? Does anyone have any knowledge of rights we would need to attain to include certain images beside our text?

'''Hi guys''' - George here from Always On - your stuff looks great! When I was doing my bit for our section I thought I could contribute a wee bit to your book from what I had found in my research - it relates to SNS and probably fits best with what you have headed up as 'Complications'. Here is what I've got re complications - if you're happy with it I can post it where I've suggested - or if you want to post it I can give you the references. Just let me know what you think. &quot;Jaron Lanier said that the most important thing about a technology was how it changed people (Lanier 2011) and warns of the restrictions of being ‘Locked-in’ to a particular technology. There is support for this concern in terms of online identity within social networks from Geert Lovink (Networks Without  A Cause: A Critique of Social Networks, 2011). He argues that there is little freedom to present yourself in different ways online and social networking sites only offer users a limited choice of presenting their personal and professional information to the world. He goes on to quote critic Zadie Smith who challenges this narrow choice forced on users by Facebook in saying, “What kind of living is this? Step back from your Facebook Wall for a moment:  doesn’t it, suddenly, look a little ridiculous? ''Your'' life in ''this'' format”. This seems to crystallise Lanier’s point about the problems with being Locked-in to a particular technology – our online identities – a presentation of our lives – force-fitted into a format to enable social networking sites to neatly package users’ information to monetise the content.&quot; Cheers.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:38, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi everyone, i was wondering on peoples thoughts on where abouts on the Wikibook page I should place 'gaming.' I shall put it somewhere for now, however as many of us are aware many ideas link together so i'm unsure where it will fit into the book best. Some feedback would be great, and also if anyone feels it would be better off in another section then please let me know!

For now i have put it in the belonging section. It is clear to see that gaming allows a sense of belonging in online communities, however, gaming also has the ability to be under many other sections of the blog, as I'm not sure how well it fits in belonging.

Yup, I’m just typing them out now and will run them by you before I post as I’m not quite sure where to put all of my work, it has to be together and I was perhaps thinking of just putting it in under the main researchers because all my work is from this one guy pretty much but it does obviously cover some other topics that are sub headed in the wiki book contents page, so I’m not quite sure just yet.

Also, &lt;b&gt;RE:&lt;/b&gt;Group Presentation on Tuesday. As I understand it, we have to make the entire seminar as interesting and engaging as we can for the rest of the class and I thought that we could do this by using different kinds of tools throughout, for example using the online application, Prezi, to make our presentation - it's similar to powerpoint but is slicker and more modern. I also thought that we could use relevant Youtube videos &amp; maybe discuss real life examples that we had experienced with regard to online identity and maybe use one of our Facebooks as a source and example of how online identity is compared to our offline identity. Just some thoughts! :) I'll also let you know &lt;b&gt;Bianca&lt;/b&gt; :) [[User:Megan4pmGlasses|Megan4pmGlasses]] ([[User talk:Megan4pmGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Megan4pmGlasses|contribs]]) 14:20, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Aye that sounds grad, I know an amazing presentation site, its way better than power point and make it look really slick and smart so we can use that!!! [[User:SmithBiancaAnn|SmithBiancaAnn]] ([[User talk:SmithBiancaAnn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SmithBiancaAnn|contribs]]) 14:26, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Prezi is a pretty good shout. Seems ''way'' better than Powerpoint. On top of our own experinces, we could ask the seminar group of theirs, and then relate them to each other, or academic research. [[User:Jack.oldfield|Jack.oldfield]] ([[User talk:Jack.oldfield|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jack.oldfield|contribs]]) 14:50, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I think the presentation sounds like a great idea, It will make it a lot more engaging for the rest of the seminar group to enjoy, once we sort out the presentation we should definitely look into what we should do as our seminar activity. maybe a group discussion incorporating what '''jack.oldfield''' said about the whole seminar's experiences? we should also get into making handouts as well whenever one of us has time.
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 14:59, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Prezi sounds like the way to go. We should also start looking for various multimedia elements we can include within the presentation, like Youtube videos and whatnot, like Megan said. I just wrote up an entry on reputation systems. [[User:Mattfinitejest|Mattfinitejest]] ([[User talk:Mattfinitejest|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mattfinitejest|contribs]]) 15:17, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Getting up in front of the class and talking ONLINE IDENTITY!''' Prezi could be fun. Is it more user-friendly than Wiki? :/ LAWL I am so down for this idea. We could use one of our facebook's to really tease out differences from the online self and offline self. I am pretty loud online compared to my offline self (who isn't entirely mute)- with regard to playing to an audience (as I'm sure you'll know, girls) We could use the ideas represented in the presentation to hold a mirror up to the class and help them see deviations from their offline self, in their online self too - like perhaps gets some disclosure from them and accounts of their own online behavior? Personalising the seminar could make a really poignant point that will stick with the class and have them really engage with the topic. That's why I was drawn to it in the first place, online identity, through contemplating my own usage! Thoughts, crew? [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 16:30, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've never actually used Prezi, only seen it used, but I'd assume it's more user friendly than Wiki. And I'm definitely for the idea of personalizing elements of the discussion on online identity. Maybe use one of our profiles as an example and then invite the class to discuss/think about how their real-life selves differ from their online selves. [[User:Mattfinitejest|Mattfinitejest]] ([[User talk:Mattfinitejest|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mattfinitejest|contribs]]) 17:00, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Should we meet up soon then in order to create the slideshow and assign the roles for the presentation for the class? and would anyone like to nominate their facebook for an example to use? i don't think mine would be the best example to use, it's rare that i update it these days. I think it would be really good for after the presentation like '''Kris''' said to allow the class to look at themselves and let them look into how they act differently online than they do offline, that could then lead into a group discussion of what interesting points people managed to find? just a few ideas.
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 17:28, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok so should we start to delegate roles? I'm guessing that a lot of this may have to be split up and done over the weekend? I guess one person could collate all of the presentation info &amp; we all paste them our individual info on their discussion tab, another person could make handouts of that for the class, another could look on youtube or other sources for other resources that we could use, another could organize class discussion points and another could analyse how to use real life social media experience? [[User:Megan4pmGlasses|Megan4pmGlasses]] ([[User talk:Megan4pmGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Megan4pmGlasses|contribs]]) 10:32, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Yes AXERS. It's time, let's now get together and share the group presentation ideas we've been working on.''' We must Orchestrate, Delegate, &quot;Schedulate&quot;? I am happy to offer my Facebook for use, I would ask that someone, '''Megan''' maybe, log in and take the sufficient screen shots and elements from my Facebook as I am still on my 40 day social media hiatus. I can pass my login details but no monkey bidnezz! Just kidding. I think we should have a structured exercise which requires the class to analyse their own SNS activity - without forcing them to vocally disclose examples or 'outing' them if they prefer not to disclose. Enough that the exercise can have them engage in small groups and be able to reflect on the media we show them and in turn on themselves. They can perhaps reflect on the SNS examples we show them, have them try and identify some of the theoretical approaches we have discussed throughout the module i.e. disinhibition effect, multiplicity etc perhaps, and have them feedback? We can use multimedia sources (i.e. videos, blogs, vlogs etc) to introduce academic ideas and then have the class identify these in real live examples (our case study, and themselves) '''I am available before 1pm or after 5pm tomorrow. I've cancelled a trip to Glasgow to make this work so I sincerely hope you guys can try to make it to. We'll get a booth, we'll binge eat and talk Online Identity! Let me know.''' My number is on my userpage for you both. (Jack and Matt).

Definitely agree with the structured exercise - the class could look at each of their SNS, then look to see which one they use the most, and even which one they consider to be the 'truest' reflection of their offline identities, and why.

As I am sure most of you are aware, I will be home from Friday through till late on Monday so obviously I won’t be able to meet up to collaborate on how the presentation is going to run smoothly in class which is very annoying indeed ! But however, if we keep in contact via this wiki chat then I can be kept up to date and I am more than happy to make worksheets for the class so long as I know what you would all like me to put on them, that way it’s still a group thing and everyone gets a say. But everything looks great and you can also use my Facebook as well if you are wanting to maybe compare them to illustrate certain points. 
In terms of Prezzi, does it work like a sight in which we have to have an email and password to get on it, one which we would all have and use? If so this is helpful as I can edit it and add things to it from home. I shall also scope the web for illustrating pictures, YouTube videos, diagrams memes etc. Anything which I think will help get our point across and keep the class interested!

Chris has given me his login details so that I can look past his privacy settings.

I think the most important things to take from Kris's facebook would mainly be profile pictures and different status', posts etc. that's what will show his online identity mostly, we can talk further when we meet up on monday, then once we've delegated all of the roles we could have a quick runthrough of our seminar plan on Tuesday just before we go in seen as it's at 4? i'll be free from about 12-4 anyway, If that sounds alright with people?

==Impression Management==
HI '''Kriscambell91''' I was just reading about your section on multiplicity and managed to find this great article covering the topic by a guy called Jonathan Vanasco, he has a lot of great things to say on the subject. http://www.destructuring.net/IdentityResearch/Essays/2007_11/01/2007-11-01--II_theory.html you can find it all there, I was wondering if i could edit your piece to incorporate some of what this writing is saying?

'''RE Shayman'''  Sean, the article reads really well. I would be okay with you editting and putting some of your ideas from this into the piece. I am working on the dishinibition effect specifically at the moment and will be adding this after the multiplicity section. Maybe we round off multiplicity on the potential  negative use of multiple identities to flow nicely into dishinibition effect. I've also noticed that under blended identities there has been a &quot;Multiple identities&quot; section written which will potentially just regurgitate what we have already started. Perhaps we can negotiate to collaborate all the efforts made on the multiplicity idea?. [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 13:22, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Kriscambell''' Yeah that sounds good, i'll try to add in the negative effect in to make it flow nicely, It can be said that since so many social networks are linked these days through your accounts and email addresses it can be hard for someone to hide one online identity from others. If you think that would flow? or is there another angle you'd like me to take? yeah we should definitely discuss that with whoever wrote it, It would make sense not to repeat ourselves within the book.
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 14:08, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Shayman''' I have posted in the SNS discussion section asking whoever wrote it if they would mind adding a sentence with the term multiplicity into their section as it is basically the core idea they are basing their content on. I think the page can work with both sections, as long as it marked that the SNS section is a social networking specific example of multiplicity. If the author doesn't see it first, I'm sure someone who co-authored the piece will allow it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Motivation =
You want to access a web service that takes a JSON document as a query parameter using REST that returns a JSON document as a result.  This example uses Freebase, a popular open database that was purchase by Google.

= Basic Example =
We will create a Freebase query that will return the names of the first three albums with the artist ID: '/en/bob_dylan'.

We will use the EXPath http client library and send a HTTP GET request to the freebase server using a URI to encode our query.

== Sample Code ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;3.0&quot;;

let $freebase:=&quot;https://www.googleapis.com/freebase/v1/mqlread?query=&quot;

let $queries:= 
   (
     '[{
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/music/album&quot;,
        &quot;name&quot;:null,
        &quot;artist&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/en/bob_dylan&quot;},
        &quot;limit&quot;:3
      }]','cursor'
   )
 
let $responses := http:send-request(&lt;http:request
     href=&quot;{$freebase || string-join(for $q in $queries return encode-for-uri($q),'&amp;amp;')}&quot;
     method=&quot;get&quot;/&gt;)
                           
return
&lt;results&gt;
  {if ($responses[1]/@status ne '200')
     then
         &lt;failure&gt;{$responses[1]}&lt;/failure&gt;
     else
       &lt;success&gt;
         {util:base64-decode($responses[2])}
         {'' (: todo - use string to JSON serializer lib here :) }
       &lt;/success&gt;
  }
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Results ==
The result returned is a string in JSON format.  I have added spaces to show the structure of the result
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;success&gt;
     {&quot;cursor&quot;: &quot;eNp9js1qxDAMhB-ml5hiVrKUWBJl6XuYHNz80EBJQtIuyz59nW7p3joXgUajb7qvbV82ix2wpcWoTbMhREIAZWrz3NsT-LIBFmkILVha99txuFwM2mqcrkNv9-GnPRtJYCmJhjU2wsE-Xnx1mVZTFWTS8PgWbHvWACFLwQOUCI4Cv0LMg_SDPzdYK2oQl96n-bMwnasO0E-toygz_UFQaqbA9PD4P8hdnT8fOaiFnEvrthTICZGCgp5e45tGZB6ZQKJmBCSAbyilTh0=&quot;,
   &quot;result&quot;: 
   [
      {
         &quot;artist&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;/en/bob_dylan&quot;}, 
         &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;, 
         &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/music/album&quot;
       },
       {
         &quot;artist&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;/en/bob_dylan&quot;},
         &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Love and Theft&quot;,
         &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/music/album&quot;
       },
       {
           &quot;artist&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;/en/bob_dylan&quot;}, 
           &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;,
           &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/music/album&quot;
       }
   ]}
   &lt;/success&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Freebase API Key ==
Here is a link to a blog that  describes the process of obtaining a Freebase API key

http://anchetawern.github.io/blog/2013/02/11/getting-started-with-freebase-api/

= Using Cursors to Get Additional Data =
The default freebase query limits the number of results returned. Freebase provides database cursors to facilitate retrieval of the entire set of query results. You ask for a cursor (see the example API call below for
the form of the initial request) to be returned with your query results and this acts as a link to the next set of query results.

https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/mql-overview#querying-with-cursor-paging-results

The next set of results is obtained by supplying the value of the cursor returned from the previous invocation. Along with that next set you get another cursor that points to the set after that. When the final set of results are retrieved the cursor is set to the string 'false'.

The example on the Freebase query overview webpage has sample Python code that invokes libraries to take care of all
the cursor handling for you.

https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/mql-overview#looping-through-cursor-results

However the same thing can easily be achieved from XQuery with a little bit of tail recursion. We will use as an example the following MQL query that returns all films with their netflix_id's.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
[{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/film/film&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: null,
  &quot;netflix_id&quot;: []
}]
&lt;/source&gt;

A few brief comments about MQL. You ask for something by giving the field name and a value null. Null gets replaced by the actual value. However if the field can have multiple values MQL will return an array and cause your null query to error. This may happen even when you are expecting a singular value so you can avoid this problem by using the
symbol for an empty array instead of null as in the query above.

You can paste the query above into http://www.freebase.com/query to see the results (we will take care of the cursor in the code example). Now to the code, which assumes XQuery 3.0

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;3.0&quot;;
import module namespace xqjson=&quot;http://xqilla.sourceforge.net/lib/xqjson&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Freebase returns JSON  so we use the above package to convert it to XML. From eXist you can install the package by just clicking it on the eXist Package Manager which you can get to from the eXist Dashboard.

We declare a variable for our query.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare variable $mqlQuery {'[{
   &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/film/film&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: null,
  &quot;netflix_id&quot;: []
}]'};

declare variable $freebase {'https://www.googleapis.com/freebase/v1/mqlread'};
declare variable $key {obtain an API key from freebase and puts it's value here'};
&lt;/source&gt;

Since we are going to be doing tail recursion we need to put the API call in a function that will will make the API call and store the results in the db.

   declare function local:freebaseCall($cursor as xs:string,$i as xs:integer)

This function will take two parameters.  The first is the cursor and the second an integer that provisions an auto-incremented unique file name.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:freebaseCall($cursor as xs:string, $i as xs:integer)
{
  if ($cursor eq 'false')

    (: termination condition :)
    then $i || ' pages loaded'
    else

     let $params :=  ('query=' || encode-for-uri($mqlQuery), 'key=' ||
       $key, 'cursor=' || encode-for-uri($cursor))

     (: Above uri encodes the parameters to the API call - we have three the
       MQL query, the API key and the cursor :)

      let $href := $freebase || '?' || string-join($params, '&amp;amp;')

     (: This constructs the API call - again thanks to Michael Westbay for
      showing the correct way to do this by string joining the parameters
      with a separator of &amp;amp; :)

     let $responses :=
       http:send-request(&lt;http:request href=&quot;{$href}&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;/&gt;)
      (: Make the API call. :)

    return
        if ($responses[1]/@status ne '200')
            then &lt;failure
                   href=&quot;{xmldb:decode-uri(xs:anyURI($href))}&quot;&gt;{$responses[1]}
                &lt;/failure&gt;
            else

        let $jsonResponse:= util:base64-decode($responses[2])
        (: Standard EXPATH http error checking - don't forget to base64 decode
           the body of the response.
         :)

         let $freebaseXML:= xqjson:parse-json($jsonResponse)

    (: Convert the returned JSON to XML because we are going to construct an
       http PUT to store it in our xml db. :)

      let $movieData := http:send-request(
         &lt;http:request
            href=&quot;{concat(path to store the data in your repostiory,$i,'.xml')}&quot;
               username=&quot;username&quot;
               password=&quot;password&quot;
               auth-method=&quot;basic&quot;
               send-authorization=&quot;true&quot;
               method=&quot;put&quot;&gt;
              &lt;http:header name=&quot;Connection&quot; value=&quot;close&quot;/&gt;
              &lt;http:body media-type=&quot;application/xml&quot;/&gt;              
          &lt;/http:request&gt;,
          (),
          &lt;batch cursor=&quot;{$cursor}&quot;&gt;{transform:transform($freebaseXML,doc(identity.xsl'),())}
          &lt;/batch&gt;)

         (: Standard EXPATH PUT request. On the last line we are wrapping the
            returned XML with an element that carries the value of the cursor that
            was used to obtain the page. Identity.xsl is of course the standard
            XSLT identity transform, you can use it as a placeholder for the
            insertion of your own custom transform.
         :)

          return local:freebaseCall($freebaseXML//data(pair[@name=&quot;cursor&quot;]), $i + 1)

         (: Finally the tail recursive call. We extract the cursor from the
            returned JSON for parameter 1 and increment $i to give us a unique
            document name for the next page to store.

};
&lt;/source&gt;

To kick it all off pass the null string as the initial cursor value and initialise your counter

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   local:freebaseCall('',1)
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively you can prime the function call with a cursor to restart retrieval from where you left off. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   local:freebaseCall($freebaseXML//data(pair[@name=&quot;cursor&quot;]), $i + 1)};
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>/* Two clocks with 50% duty-cycle and separated by 90° */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Many practical (slave) clock recovery circuits with a PLL architecture require some type of frequency acquisition aid. 

Exceptions are only found where  very stable VCOs, such as crystal oscillators, are used to insure that the frequency error is never larger than the natural acquisition range of the PLL          ( a range that is close to the PLL closed-loop bandwidth ). 

Excluding these stable VCOs, and other acquisition aids, such as frequency sweeping, a frequency discriminator is required as an integral part of any phase-detector for modern monolithic CDRs (&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omnisterra.com/walker/pdfs.papers/BBPLL.pdf|title=Designing Bang-Bang PLLs for Clock and Data Recovery in Serial Data Transmission Systems|author=Richard C. Walker|year=2003|publisher= pp. 34-45, a chapter appearing in &quot;Phase-Locking in High-Performance Sytems - From Devices to Architectures&quot;, edited by Behzad Razavi, IEEE Press, 2003, ISBN 0-471-44727-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; pages 259..260 ).



===Frequency (comparison and) detection===
A serial stream of NRZ data arriving at a pulse frequency f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is not distinguishable form a stream at 2f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; made of pairs of identical pulses, nor from a stream at 3f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; made of triplets of identical pulses.
[[File:100 percent frequency uncertainty.pdf|center|600px|A serial NRZ stream of data can be regenerated with a clock at frequency f, or 2f, or 3f, or higher multiple.#A serial NRZ stream of data can be regenerated with a clock at frequency f, or 2f, or 3f, or higher multiple.]]
Some additional information about the absolute value of f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is necessary to correctly recover clock and data. Since the uncertainty comes in steps of 100% of f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, an indication of f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;  with an approximation of +/- 50% is  (barely) sufficient.

In practical CDR applications the uncertainty is always contained within ± 25%  and in most cases within ±5% (most of this uncertainty comes from the inaccuracy of the VCO free running frequency) . Additional circuitry that can detect the frequency of the incoming data in that range will be adequate, as it will be shown.

::&lt;small&gt;In frequency synthesisers the problem of frequency aided acquisition is equally important as in CDRs, but in synthesisers the incoming signal and the local clock are both perfectly periodic waveforms and a phase and frequency detector with a simple architecture can be used &lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhas.ac.id/rhiza/arsip/research-stuffs/Phase-Locked/218-PhaseDetector-2.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;. A straight forward comparison of the respective cycle period is possible, and effective. On the other hand, synthesizers often require capture ranges well in excess of +/- 25%.&lt;/small&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;In CDRs instead, the missing transitions of the incoming signal make the frequency comparison with the local clock a more complex affair.&lt;/small&gt;




====Need for frequency detection (in addition to phase detection) in CDRs====

A loop filter is inserted between phase comparator and VCO, in CDRs where jitter and noise performances are important [[Clock and Data Recovery/Introduction/Models can only be linear..#Just three architectures are of practical use|(Architectures 2 - 1 and  2 - 2)]].

Both for architectures 2-1 and 2-2, when high transmission speed is involved, a jitter-out / jitter-in bandwidth of about 1/1000 of the bit rate  is specified by most standards &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tek.com/document/primer/clock-recovery-primer-part-2| Clock Recovery Primer, Part 2 by Guy Foster, par.10: Survey of Clock Recovery Used in Selected Standards]&lt;/ref&gt;. 
::&lt;small&gt;The &quot;jitter-out /jitter-in&quot; bandwidth, called &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; in the modeling of these 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order loops, is therefore specified and made by design to be around  &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/1000 ( &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the angular frequency of the pulses of the received stream, 2&amp;pi; f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/small&gt;
A significant ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; / &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; mismatch (much larger than the capture range) is often the case, in particular in '''large volume, cost-effective monolithic implementation, where the VCO free-running angular frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; is no more accurate than about +/- 5%''' ( ICs manufacturing tolerances are not tighter than ± 25 %, but recourse to end-of-production trimming can correct them and reduce the inaccuracy range to something like within ± 5 % ).
::&lt;small&gt;The accuracy of f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is not the problem in modern networks,  where it is better than +/- 50 ppm. It is the poor accuracy of the VCO free-running frequency  f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; that makes the aid to the acquisition necessary. ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 &amp;pi; f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;; ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;  = 2 &amp;pi; f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;There are many more slave nodes than master nodes in a network, and the master nodes are more critical than the slaves. A larger cost (-&gt; including a tighter accuracy) can be afforded for the masters, making ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; ''-that originates in a master node-'' (much) more accurate than ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; ''-that originates in a slave receiver-''.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Without aids the the capture range of the CDR is approximately coincident with +/-( jitter-in / jitter-out bandwidth) around the free-running frequency of the VCO.&lt;/u&gt; 

If the free-running frequency is so shifted (away from the incoming pulse frequency) that the capture range does not include the frequency of the data to lock into, the phase comparator alone cannot make the acquisition possible.
::&lt;small&gt;The data transitions pass in front of the local clock faster than it can shift its frequency to catch one of them, with no chance to achieve phase lock.&lt;/small&gt; 
::&lt;small&gt;In fact, these CDRs react in a time of about 1/(2 times the the capture range), and a new input transition shifts inside the range of the phase comparator (while the previous one drifts away), before a significant part of that time has elapsed.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The PLL goes through alternate periods of accelerating and decelerating, with slips in between, but never achieves phase lock.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;Sometimes, when ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is close to ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; ± ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;, a series of slips may eventually end in a good phase lock. The acquisition may be achieved but with slips and unpredictably long times.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;Aided acquisition is then mandatory.&lt;/small&gt;

In such cases the acquisition must be aided by ''additional'' circuits that widen the capture range.
::&lt;small&gt;Inside a complex equipment another clock with good enough accuracy may be available. A frequency close to f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; can be easily synthesized, and a frequency detector of clock differences can be used. Its output will be summed to the CDR PD output.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;There have been also cases where frequency sweeping was used to have the capture range overlap f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;Note that the VCO must be driven by a unique signal, even if the drive signal is obtained by combination of two separate ones. (A VCO with two inputs is a &quot;bad idea&quot; within the scope of stable control systems, see also &lt;ref name=&quot;Buchwald free book&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobius-semiconductor.com/whitepapers/IntegratedFiberOpticReceivers_crop.pdf |title=Integrated Fiber-Optic Receivers|author = Aaron BUCHWALD Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology, Kenneth W. MARTIN University of Toronto Toronto, Ontario, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; at page 261).&lt;/small&gt;

Tight jitter bandwidth and wide acquisition range can be achieved together if the CDR includes a [[w:Phase frequency detector|Frequency Detector (FD)]] in addition to its [[w:Phase detector|Phase Detector  (PD)]], as it is often the case&lt;ref&gt;Behzad Razavi, Design of Monolithic Phase-Locked Loops and Clock Recovery Circuits-A Tutorial, 4.6 Aided Acquisition, downloadable at: http://itee.uq.edu.au/~coms3100/coms3100/Lecture%20Notes/Razavi1996_PLL_IEEExplore.PDF &lt;/ref&gt;. 
::&lt;small&gt;Sometimes a separate FD for CDRs is used in parallel to the PD, but this is a rare occurrence.&lt;/small&gt;

The two blocks are normally physically and functionally combined, and the overall block/function is named [[w:Phase detector#Phase-frequency detector|phase-frequency detector]] PFD, which also offers the benefit of automatic transition from the operation of the one to the other as soon as lock is achieved.

A PFD may incorporate one to two linear PDs, but more often incorporates bang-bang PD(s) &lt;ref&gt;S. Tontisirin and R. Tielert, 2.5 Gbps clock data recovery using 1/4th-rate quadricorrelator frequency detector and skew-calibrated multi-phase clock generator, Adv. Radio Sci., 4, 287–291, 2006   http://www.adv-radio-sci.net/4/287/2006/ars-4-287-2006.pdf  © Author(s) 2006. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons License. Advances in Radio Science &lt;/ref&gt;. 

The bang-bang structure of the PFD in practical applications is a consequence of the application requirements. It will be shown that the (bang-bang) PFD is used in CDRs of the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Applications of the 2nd order type 2 architecture|2-2 type]], that are made with bang-bang phase detectors. 
:&lt;small&gt;Architectures of the 2-1 type normally find application in association with accurate VCOs, and architectures of the 1-1 type are used for phase aligners that have a perfectly accurate local clock by definition.&lt;/small&gt;

The frequency detection in practical applications is part of a monolithic implementation of the CDR, working at the highest speed that the chip technology allows. Then the implementation will be based on discrete time instants and binary signal levels, as mentioned already for PDs&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omnisterra.com/walker/pdfs.papers/BBPLL.pdf|title=Designing Bang-Bang PLLs for Clock and Data Recovery in Serial Data Transmission Systems|author=Richard C. Walker|year=2003|publisher= pp. 34-45, a chapter appearing in &quot;Phase-Locking in High-Performance Sytems - From Devices to Architectures&quot;, edited by Behzad Razavi, IEEE Press, 2003, ISBN 0-471-44727-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
:&lt;small&gt;To reinforce the general validity of the above point, another aspect of the IC industry must be appreciated. When a new, faster chip technology appears, it will be used to create new CDRs at higher speed, as the mentioned paper&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot; /&gt; emphasizes. But this new technology will NOT be used for a redesign of the CDRs made in an earlier technology pushing that technology to its speed limit. The semiconductor industry is always short of good designers, and at the same time it is difficult to replicate exactly the performances of an IC in a different, though older, technology. Additionally, customers are reluctant to undergo again the cost of chip qualification. Scarcity of design resources, risk of not making a good replica and customer reluctance for a re-qualification, all cooperate to the result that a successful mixed-signal chip is practically never redesigned. This also implies that architectural alternatives of an existing solution (that  become possible with the appearance of a later and faster technology) are practically never implemented!&lt;/small&gt;


In a CDR the Frequency Detector must accomplish a very basic, simple task: bring the VCO frequency close enough to the pulse frequency of the incoming signal, so that the Phase Detector can take effect and drive the phase lock. 

Simple tasks mean simple requirements: '''the Frequency Detector''' need not be linear, need not offer the highest gain possible, it shall j'''ust ensure a reasonably fast frequency acquisition for realistic frequency differences''' and must become unnoticeable as soon as the Phase Detector is able to take over. The important performance of the CDR are influenced by the PD, not by the FD: the FD is just required not to limit the PD performances. 


&lt;u&gt;The PFD used in CDRs are of the '''bang-bang''' type. The FD function is active outside of the frequency range where the PD can capture the incoming signal, and the FD effect disappears completely as soon as the PD function can take over.&lt;/u&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;This is why the Frequency Detector is normally neglected in modeling and often also in simulation of the CDRs.&lt;/small&gt;

===Methods of frequency detection in CDR===
Many different types of PFD for CDR can be conceived, with different levels of complexity and performance.
:&lt;sub&gt;As explained in the previous paragraph, the '''PFD for CDR''' is actually implemented in the '''simplest possible form'''.&lt;/sub&gt;


It has been shown earlier that to detect a '''phase difference''' in the CDR, the transitions of the data signal are compared with the transitions of '''one clock'''.

To detect a '''frequency difference''' f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;, the transitions of the data signal shall be compared with the transitions of '''two clocks''' of '''equal frequency''' (f&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;VCO&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) that just have a '''constant phase distance'''. (= difference):
&lt;center&gt;{{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ( ''φ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ''  -  ''φ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) '' )  /  (''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' -  ''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}&lt;/center&gt;  
&lt;center&gt;{{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;VCO&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ( ''φ&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;VCO&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ''  -  ''φ&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;VCO&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) '' )  /  (''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' -  ''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}&lt;/center&gt;

====Two comparators====
In the right hand side of the last equation,  the two  differences of the nominator have been highlighted with bold characters and underlined.

They represent  the outputs of two phase comparators, the first comparing the data transitions with transitions (&amp;nbsp;of a VCO clock&amp;nbsp;) in t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , and the second comparing the data transitions with transitions (&amp;nbsp;of a second -shifted- VCO clock&amp;nbsp;) in t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; .

:&lt;small&gt;Each individual phase difference will vary with time, and indicate a constant frequency difference if it exhibits a cyclic behavior, but neither alone can tell the sign of the frequency difference!&lt;/small&gt;

Combining the results of the two comparisons together it is possible to identify also the sign of the frequency difference.
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:em8; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;
:::&lt;small&gt;''( Provided the two clocks do not differ in phase exactly by 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; nor by 180&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;: the frequency difference signal would be completely attenuated in those two extreme cases! ''&lt;br&gt;
:::''The two phase comparators -different just because their two versions of the VCO clock are separated by 0° or by 180°- would always produce either coincident results or always complementary results, i.e. the very same information!''&lt;/small&gt;
:::&lt;small&gt;Note that phase comparators used in CDRs have a characteristic that is periodic with an odd symmetry and that is growing and monotonic inside each period.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The best discrimination (= the most robust signal) is obtained when the distance between the two identical comparators is chosen to be exactly 90&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (or 270&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;).


====Two clocks with 50% duty-cycle and separated by 90°====
Two clocks with 50% duty-cycle and orthogonal with each other (that is 90&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; or &amp;pi;/2 out of phase) make the two phase comparators divide all the 360&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; of their period into 4 quadrants.

The two phase comparators together indicate the quadrant where the data signal transition is located, and this info can be updated at every new data transition.

::&lt;small&gt;In the same paper Donald Richman first introduced the term &quot;quadricorrelator&quot; applying PFD to NTSC color carrier detection in color television and describing an analog version of the circuit that uses both '''an In-phase and a Quadrature clock''' to obtain a beat note at double frequency and a d.c. component proportional to the frequency difference. (Quadrants defined with Phase and &lt;u&gt;Quadrature&lt;/u&gt; clocks, hence the name quadricorrelator). Although the quadricorrelator operation may not be very good with the random transitions of a NRZ data stream without some modifications (&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchwald free book&quot; /&gt; page 269), the I and Q technique is good also for CDR PFDs.&lt;/small&gt;

*  I (lag in the figure), is the reference and defines with its positive transition the 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; instants. I stands for In-phase; &lt;small&gt;''(When PD and FD are combined and part of a CDR, then I is the clock used for data regeneration).''&lt;/small&gt;
* Q (lead by 90° in the figure) identifies the -90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; or 270&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;instants. Q stands for &quot;Quadrature&quot;.
[[Image:I and Q instants and time intervals.png|thumb|center|700px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Two synchronous clocks, 90 degrees distant from each other, divide each period T in two intervals, 1/4 T and 3/4 T.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;If the two clocks have 50% duty cycle, using their negative transitions, all 4 quadrants can be identified.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;I is the reference, In-phase clock, Q leads I by 90 degrees.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
::&lt;small&gt;Before lock, the data transitions shift with respect to the two clocks.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;When a data transition is first detected inside the interval &quot;I leads Q&quot; and then detected inside the interval &quot;Q leads I&quot;, the data transitions are shifting to the left.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The data transitions are therefore based on a frequency lower than the frequency of the two clocks.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;In such condition, the VCO of a PLL shall be driven towards a lower frequency, that is with a lower level of the VCO drive signal.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;When a data transition is first detected inside the interval &quot;Q leads I&quot; and then inside the interval &quot;I leads Q&quot;, the data transitions are shifting to the right.&lt;/small&gt; 
::&lt;small&gt;The data transitions are then based on a frequency higher than the frequency of the two clocks.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;In such condition, the VCO of a PLL shall be driven towards a higher frequency, that is with a higher level of the VCO drive signal.&lt;/small&gt;
If the two '''I and Q clocks have both 50% duty cycle''', using also their negative transitions, '''all 4 quadrants''' can be '''identified'''.
::&lt;small&gt;The frequency sign can be obtained each time the data transitions, after a detection in a given quadrant, cause a detection in a quadrant to the left (f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; lags f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;), or to the right. (f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; leads f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;

====Bang-bang = just the sign of the frequency difference====
The PFD is mostly used for [[monolithic CDRs made with the 2 - 2 architecture]], where the Phase Detector is of the bang-bang type.

Therefore the PFD will be of the bang-bang type as well.

# the two PDs of the PFD are of the bang-bang type to start with. Their outputs only give one bit indication. The nominator in the PFD formula is reduced to a sigle bit as well. ''(Or to a &quot;ternary&quot; type of output, if the overall CDR needs minimum jitter generation).''
# the time difference in the denominator of the PFD formula is a fixed fraction of the local clock (=VCO) cycle. It has always a positive sign, even if it may vary (inversely) with the VCO frequency. Therefore it is disregarded in a bang-bang PFD (replaced by a constant +1).
In other words, the PFD will just output an indication as simple (&amp;nbsp;'''binary or ternary'''&amp;nbsp;) as the phase detector that operates on its I clock.



===How a bang-bang PFD is made ===
It is made up of two PDs and one final block that processes the outputs of the two PDs.

One PD operates on the input data stream and on the VCO clock that shall be locked to the data. This clock is called the I (= In phase) clock.

The other PD operates on the input data stream and on a VCO clock that is 90°, i.e. &amp;pi;/2, out of phase with the previous one. This clock is called the Q (= Quadrature) clock. It could be be +90° or -90° out of phase with I : let's choose here +90°, which means that the Q waveform lags the I waveform.

In a typical example, the two outputs from the two PDs are put together in a following block that is essentially the same as the output stage of the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator#Bang-bang Phase Detector with “hold”|&quot;hold&quot; bang-bang PD]].
[[File:Bang-bang Phase and Frequency Detector.png|thumb|center|850px|&lt;center&gt;The scheme of principle of a bang-bang PFD for CDRs.&lt;/center&gt;]]

This structure works with signals as follows:
* the clocks of the first PD are:
:# the clock that regenerates the data and
:# its 180° shifted version
* the clocks of the second PD are both shifted versions of CK&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; that regenerates the data, respectively:
:# by 90° and
:# by 270°,
which partitions the VCO period into the four quadrants already mentioned.

The two clocks of each PD are 180° out of phase with each other.

The outputs of the two PDs are combined in a final stage identical to the final stage of the &quot;hold&quot; PD: this PFD becomes a &quot;hold&quot; (= binary) PFD.

The output of the PFD may be present a polarity inversion if:
# the shift of the Q clock of the second PD is -90° instead of +90° with respect to the clock I (the other clocks do not matter, as +180° is indistinguishable from -180°);
# the final stage either uses an inversion after the top flip-flop or an inversion after the bottom flip-flop.

An example of the waveforms in case of a constant frequency difference is shown in the following figure (note the inversion of the PFD output):
[[File:Bang-bang PFD with constant input difference.png|thumb|900px|center|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Simulation (with 3000 time points) of the waveforms inside a Phase and Frequency Detector of the bang-bang type.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;The detector is driven by one clock (input +) at 1 GHz (i.e. D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = 100%) and by another clock (input -) at 1GHz-398 ppm.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;After 1850 simulation samples, the input clock becomes noisy with the addition of a sinusoidal phase jitter of 0.3 rad of amplitude and of 10e+10 rad/sec of angular frequency.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Note the typical pattern of the slips of the outputs of the two Phase Detectors driven by I(lead) and Q(lag), that are orthogonal square waves separated by 1/4 of the beat period.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;The wave of the Q (lag) detector seems to lead the other: this is because the frequency difference is negative.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;This PFD is wired so that its output is low if the negative input receives a lower frequency than the positive input, and viceversa.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;In many cases the output polarity is the opposite.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
This system is a discrete time system with samples at frequency f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;, and a data transition should be sampled  at least once every time it drifts through one of the four quadrants. Each drift trough a quadrant should last at least 1/ (4f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;).

A data transition has been sampled inside one quadrant.
The following data transition (D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = 100%), while the data stream drifts across the quadrants defined by Q and I, should preferably be sampled (at least once) inside each quadrant.
The sampling takes place if  the period of 1/f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt; stays inside the range 1/&lt;sub&gt;fp&lt;/sub&gt; +/- 25%.

D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is normally lower than 100%. The maximum Δf that this type of PFD can detect is ±25%, even if the technique of &quot;hold&quot;ing the detection when no transition is present could extend the theoretical range to ±50%.

If the frequency difference to detect is in the range of ±15% or larger, then it is preferable that the two PDs  artificially '''&quot;hold&quot;''' the previous detection of the phase until a new significant detection can be made, and that the FD does the same ('''Binary PFD'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot;  /&gt; ).

If instead the frequency difference to detect does not exceed ±10%, then the two PDs might still be of the &quot;hold&quot; type, but the last PFD stage would be improved to a '''&quot;free running&quot;''' type ('''Ternary PFD''' &lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot;  /&gt;).

::&lt;small&gt;The feature can be obtained in principle by a retrofit that:&lt;/small&gt;
::*  &lt;small&gt;extracts also the T signal from the PD operating on the I clock&lt;/small&gt;
::*  &lt;small&gt;drives the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator#The charge pump inside a PLL comparator for clock and data recovery|charge pump]] following the PFD output with the two signals:   &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;UP&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; + E  ;  DOWN = T*E.&lt;/small&gt;



=====A bang-bang Phase Detector that &quot;holds&quot;, in a different representation=====
This kind of PD has already been [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator#Bang-bang Phase Detector with “hold”|introduced]] in the previous [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator|page about PDs]].

It is presented again here with identical behavior, but using a different set of circuit symbols that better represent the circuit elements of a high-frequency integrated circuit.

High frequency circuits are fully differential for noise immunity, making a signal and its complement always available together. Exchanging one wire with the other of a differential pair corresponds to the inversion of the signal: no inverter stage is needed. Multiplexers are easy to implement. Two flip-flops and a multiplexer make up a double edge triggered flip-flop DETFF.

In this case, the two DETFFs allow the use of clocks at half the frequency because both edges of the clocks are used (clocks must have 50% duty cycle). 

The clocks that drive the two flip-flops, are indicated as the I (lead) and Q (lag, i.e. 90° late) clock phases coming out of an oscillator that runs at half the data pulse frequency. They are equivalent to two clocks of double frequency and separated by 180°. 

This anticipates the incorporation of two of these PDs in a PFD that uses their outputs to detect the sign of the frequency difference, in a CDR that uses a muli-phase VCO at half the frequency.

[[Image:Phase Detector using DETFFs and clocks I (lead) and Q (lag) at f 2.pdf|thumb|center|850px|&lt;center&gt;A bang-bang PD with output held fixed if the incoming data miss one or more transitions, rendering the PD gain independent from the transition density.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The output of the first DTEFF carries the regenerated data, the output of the second DETFF carries the cross-over samples taken at the instant when a data transition is expected.

It may be noted that this PD is made up of three DETFFs, but the third is slightly modified with an inversion at the output of its upper flip-flop.

This inversion in the upper branch of the last stage sends to the output:
*the last cross-over sample when the data have a positive transition (and as long as they stay high);
*the opposite of the last cross-over sample when the data have a negative transition (and as long as they stay low).

Inverting on negative transitions and not inverting on positive ones makes the PD output go high if the clock lags the data, and viceversa.



=====A bang-bang PFD with reduced VCO frequency for easier implementation inside an IC&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchwald free book&quot; /&gt;=====
The following figure redraws the PFD presented earlier changing two aspects:
* the elementary blocks of high frequency monolithic circuits are used (DETFF, differential connections and the multiplexer),
* the input clocks come from a VCO at half the frequency.

''A very similar one, just with I that lags Q, is described in &lt;ref&gt;Jafar Savoj and Behzad Razavi, A 10-Gb/s CMOS Clock and  Data Recovery Circuit with a Half-Rate Linear Phase Detector, IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS, VOL. 36, NO. 5, MAY 2001,  http://www.seas.ucla.edu/brweb/papers/Journals/S&amp;RMay01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.''
[[File:Phase and Frequency Detector PFD.jpg|thumb|center|800px|&lt;center&gt;A bang-bang PFD that can be driven by a VCO at f/2&lt;br&gt;The inversion placed on the upper flip-flop of the final stage causes the PFD to a high output if the VCO frequency is lower than the data frequency, and viceversa.&lt;br&gt;The inversion on the lower flip-flop would cause a low PFD output when f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;  f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and a high output when f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;  f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Q clock lags the I by 90°. When acquisition is achieved, CK&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;( i.e. I) is where it should be. The PD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will output a constant 1, because Q is late by exactly 90° and should accelerate.

But in this condition the output of PD&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is replicated at the output of the PFD and drives the PLL alone. PD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remains constantly at 1, phase-locked into its 90° lag state by the PLL operation.

Otherwise said, when the PFD is part of a CDR that reaches the phase lock, its output replicates the output (or the inverted output) of the PD that acts as clock of the PFD final stage.

This means inverting the output of the top flip-flop in the final stage if the second PD uses a clock 90° late (like in the waveforms below and in the schematic of the figure above), and inverting the output of the bottom flip-flop in the final stage if the second PD uses a clock that is 90° early. 

The figures that follow represent the waveforms at the external connections as well as at the internal nodes of one PFD like in the figure above.

The first figure describes the case of an input signal with the highest possible DT (i.e. 100% and a data pattern 101010..).

The second figure describes the case of an input signal with a random data pattern.

In both cases the clocks (nominally at half frequency) and the input data of the PFD  correspond to frequency ratios different from the nominal value of 50%.
[[File:Bang-bang PFD waveforms constantDf 101010 input.png|thumb|center|900px|&lt;center&gt;Waveforms inside a bang-bang Phase and Frequency Detector for CDR use.&lt;br&gt;The PFD receives a fixed pattern 101010 of data NRZ input and the 4 phases of a clock at f/2&lt;br&gt;with a constant frequency difference between the data frequency and (twice) the clock frequency.&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the case of maximum transition density (in spite of a large frequency difference) the waveforms are as regular as it could be expected. The two phase detectors toggle at the beat frequency, and overlap each other transitions.

The PFD output (almost) immediately reaches a stable indication of the sign of the frequency difference. In a closed loop this means the fastest possible acquisition transient.

[[File:Bang-bang PFD waveforms constant Df random input.png|thumb|center|900px|&lt;center&gt;Waveforms inside a bang-bang Phase and Frequency Detector for CDR use.&lt;br&gt;The PFD receives a random data NRZ input and the 4 phases of a clock at f/2&lt;br&gt;with a constant frequency difference between the data frequency and (twice) the clock frequency.&lt;/center&gt;]]
With a random pattern of the received pulses, the waveforms are much less regular.

As a result, the PFD output is far from stable, but at least its average deviates from 50% enough to give a clear indication of the frequency difference.

Every time the generation and recording of these waveforms are repeated, the figure for 101010 data is practically the same.

The figure for random input data instead changes significantly with the change of the sample of the input pattern, but the average value of the PFD output, although variable as well, remains on the correct side of 50%.



===Acquisition of Frequency and Phase Lock===
The following example refers to a CDR with a 2 -2 architecture, incorporating a PFD like the one described in the previous paragraph.


[[File:Bang-bang PFD acquisition.png|thumb|center|1024px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Simulation of the acquisition phase of a PLL 2nd order type 2 with a bang-bang Phase and Frequency Detector.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
The figure is obtained by a simulation with 3000 time steps.

The waveforms of the two Phase Detectors are shown at the top, translated higher not to overlap the analog waveforms.
::&lt;small&gt;Neither the line pulse sequence nor its frequency are used in the simulation of the waveforms of the voltages and angular values depicted.&lt;/small&gt; 
::&lt;small&gt;Therefore the Q clock operation is simulated by the trick of replicating at the PD2 input the input signal phase with a 90° shift (= delay, Q lags I).&lt;/small&gt;
Initially (100 time steps) no signal is present, LOS is asserted and the VCO runs free. 

Then the signal appears (LOS=0), and the frequency locks begins. 
::&lt;small&gt;The PD1 and PD2 gains correspond to the maximum transition density, to simplify the simulation and to shorten the acquisition for easier fitting inside the figure.&lt;/small&gt;
After about half a μsec the square waves coming from the two PDs widen clearly their periods and the filter output follows a linear ramp towards the driving voltage that brings the VCO to the lock frequency.

After a little more than 3 μsec and some phase undershoot the acquisition is complete. 

The bang-bang tracking begins, and the output phase tracks the input (that has a slight downward slope because its frequency is slightly lower than its nominal frequency). 

The error function becomes stable at about -50 rad, that correspond to the slips before lock.

Sometimes later, a little before 6 μsec have elapsed, a substantial input sinusoidal jitter appears. The filter output shows that the limits of tracking ability of the loop are slightly exceeded during every jitter cycle. But not much, as the error function does not show a strong evidence of it.

;usage
This template forms an internal link to the [[Trainz]] wikibook with parameter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and incorporates an option to access a sub-sub-page given the optional 3rd default parameter: &lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as well allowing for as an optional pretty-link re-title parameter &lt;code&gt;'2' allowing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} and/or '|3=sub-page/' &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; formatted link calls ... all forming the link and all links in the wikimarkup as:&lt;br/&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/{{{3|}}}{{{1}}}|{{{2|{{{1}}}}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/code&gt;
* Users unfamiliar with wiki-markup parameter parsing, just focus on &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} or '|2=text' &lt;/nowiki&gt; overriding the presented text of the link, 
* and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}/  or '|3=sub-sub-linktext/' &lt;/nowiki&gt; giving a prefix to a sub-sub-page, so &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
: if and when given, &lt;u&gt;MUST HAVE&lt;/u&gt; a trailing '/' to form a proper link.
&amp;nbsp;
'''&lt;u&gt;Example-1, expanded paste down&lt;/u&gt;:'''
:This is because all template default parameters, formally 'numbered parameters' can also be specified like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL
 |1=Tips And Tricks
 |2=Tips
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 which wiki-markup language is processed exactly
 the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL |Tips And Tricks |Tips }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
;caution
When using a template such as this which forms a link, it is best to NOT use spaces between the pipe characters &quot;|&quot; as done for clarity above.
{{TrainzTip|Spaces in the 'pretty-text' part are fine!
}}
'''&lt;u&gt;In-line Examples&lt;/u&gt;:'''
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL|Tips And Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; links as: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the other formulation: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; both would.
:But... is much easier to edit around on a page when trying to get the best prose presentation.

* Similarly: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL|Tips And Tricks|Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; links as if the constructs: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is perhaps part of the phrase you want.

* Sub-subpage links will mainly be needed in the forthcoming Errorfixing series of tutorials and the Programmed Instruction (Trainz A-Z) linked progressive tutorials off their own sub-TOC base page. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:Planned use of Sub-sub-pages... '''Better than splitting the book down the multiple tracks'''... we're going to make ''a lot of new pages'' in the PI tutorials! Whether for beginners or intermediate Trainzers, they'll all end in content creation and other advanced topics like TransDEM map generation anyway.

*'''U. Colorado/Moffitt''' PMID 24485779 -- &quot;Sarcomas of the aorta: a systematic review and pooled analysis of published reports&quot; (Rusthoven CG, Ann Vasc Surg. 2014 Feb;28(2):515-25)
**Systematic review of 165 reported cases of primary aortic sarcomas
***Median age 60, male to female ratio 1.5 to 1.
***Median overall survival 11 months; 1-, 3-, 5-year rates of 47%, 17%, and 9%.
***High grade sarcomas (87%), arterial embolization (47%), and metastatic disease at diagnosis (45%) common 
***Most common sites of embolization were abdomen (23%) and extremities (21%). 
***Most common sites of metastases were bone (29%) and lung (16%)
***Reported histologies included undifferentiated (39%), angiosarcomatous (37%), leiomyosarcomatous (13%), and fibroblastic (7.3%) sarcomas
***Univariate OS analysis: absence of metastases at diagnosis (p&lt;.001), management with surgical resection (P&lt;.001), and chemotherapy (p=.02) beneficial. Multivariate: only metastatic disease (P&lt;.001) remained significant
**Conclusion: Poor prognosis overall. Long term survivors have been reported with aggressive management involving resection + adjuvant therapy. High embolic rates suggest a potential role for prophylactic anticoagulation</text>

=Trainz Advanced Content Creation=
&lt;!--- unless you know template coding, it would be best to leave this section unedited. It's an expanded double substitution of the template {{underconstruction}} altered to specify this page vice the book, which is undergoing revisions, including new construction. Bottom line, that template has the wrong message....

==Purpose==
[[File:Amoskeag' locomotive, No. 92, Amoskeag Manufacturing Company.jpg|thumb|right|The Trainz Content Creator may have little more than a picture like this to work with for developing Trainz models of older asset prototypes. Most locomotives take upwards of 6 months of diligent effort to make a good model, so send your favorite Content Creators chocolates or flowers today!]]
This Book Division index page is a master '''&lt;u&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/u&gt;''' page for Intermediate Skills and Advanced 3D Content Modeling and skills building topics. Just as Introductory Trainz pages linked above is for those just getting their feet onto the first slopes of the various Trainz learning curves, and Content Creation and References are for even more advance topics. If the reader visualizes a large reference work in a three ring binder with TABS sticking out to quickly switch between book sections, you see what we're trying to accomplish in your minds eye.
 
At the file structure level, some threaded materials will be linked both in-sequence (threaded page to page 1st to next page) and in collections of related material where it was relocated into various places such as '''[[Trainz/Appendices|Trainz Wikibook Appendix pages]]''', or other divisions of the Trainz Wikibooks. Consequenly, if you've seen such a page, with a slightly different look the chances are you have&amp;mdash;the magic of modern type setting technology in a Wiki allows that page to appear both ways! These Division TOC pages will also introduce new and older Trainzers to that of organization of the work, and give a greater sense of where to look for things when needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Prologue to History ==
There was no time. The was no space. There was simply nothing. The universe was but a state of immense heat and energy, and incredible density. Such a scale of energy and heat that was so compact was the precursor to all history, and by means still not exactly known, the dense state of heat and energy suddenly and rapidly expanded, travailing at a speed barely comprehensible. The Big Bang. Just a mere second after the universe came into existence it was at a temperature of 5.5 billion Celsius (10 billion Fahrenheit). This cosmic plasma soup contained a vast array of fundamental particles such as neutrons, electrons and protons, which as the universe gradually cooled died off. 13.798 ± 0.037 billion BCE. The start of history. Over the next billions of years the universe continued to cool off and expand, even to this day, it is still expanding from the force of the Big Bang. Eventually hydrogen, helium and lithium, created from particles formed by the Big Bang, started to come together to form heaver elements, which would in turn form stars.


Why does this matter? Why is Astronomy history being discussed in a world history wikibook? Because humanity itself is made from the big bang. Carbon-based lifeforms are made up of elements first conceived in the Big Bang. The particles of the early universe are what form our bodies. We are made of star stuff. Further more, the advancement of humanity is also possible only through the formation of the universe. The natural metal and ore deposits on Earth shaped history, as everything from weapons and armor to plows and eating utensils would not be possible if the right elements had not formed in the Big Bang. While obviously in the broad sense the Big Bang created history by creating time itself, the Big Bang contributed all of the necessary conditions and elements for human civilization to arise. People in the past were often fascinated by space and the stars, and rightfully so. Everything we know today came from the stars. Even you, the reader, has portions of the universe from the Big Bang flowing through your veins, beating in your chest. In order to understand and appreciate the proceeding guide through history, it is important to know that all of it was due to a cosmic coincidence that remnants of still can be seen today. Perhaps the amazement with the cosmos is symbiotic, as we continue to study the force that brought us into creation, that force also ever studies us, watching us grow and evolve as our society and civilizations advance. And in that cosmic sense, that is the essence of history

=== Constraints ===
:[[../Create_Table#Table_Constraint|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Denominate all contraints with an expressive name, eg.: abbreviations for
-- table name (unique across all tables in your schema), column name, constraint type, running number.
--
CREATE TABLE myExampleTable (
  id               DECIMAL,
  col_1            DECIMAL(1),   -- only 1 (signed) digit

  CONSTRAINT example_check_2      CHECK (LENGTH(col_2) &lt; LENGTH(col_3))
);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Foreign Key ===
:[[../Foreign_Key|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Reference to a different (or the same) table. This creates 1:m or n:m relationships.
CREATE TABLE t_hierarchie (
  id               DECIMAL,
  part_name        VARCHAR(50),
  super_part_id    DECIMAL,      -- ID of the part which contains this part
  CONSTRAINT hier_pk             PRIMARY KEY (id),
  -- In this special case the foreign key refers to the same table
  CONSTRAINT hier_fk             FOREIGN KEY (super_part_id) REFERENCES t_hierarchie(id)
);

-- -----------------------------------------------
--             n:m relationships
-- -----------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE t1 (
  id               DECIMAL,
  name             VARCHAR(50),
  -- ...
  CONSTRAINT t1_pk               PRIMARY KEY (id)

  t2_id            DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_pk            PRIMARY KEY (id),       -- also this table should have its own Primary Key
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_unique        UNIQUE (t1_id, t2_id),  -- every link should occur only once
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_1          FOREIGN KEY (t1_id) REFERENCES t1(id),
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_2          FOREIGN KEY (t2_id) REFERENCES t2(id)
);

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--      ON DELETE / ON UPDATE / DEFFERABLE
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- DELETE and UPDATE behaviour for child tables (see first example)
  -- Oracle: Only DELETE [CASCADE | SET NULL] is possible. Default is NO ACTION, but this cannot be
  --         specified explicit - just omit the phrase.
  CONSTRAINT hier_fk             FOREIGN KEY (super_part_id) REFERENCES t_hierarchie(id)
                                 ON DELETE CASCADE  -- or: NO ACTION (the default), RESTRICT, SET NULL, SET DEFAULT
                                 ON UPDATE CASCADE  -- or: NO ACTION (the default), RESTRICT, SET NULL, SET DEFAULT

  -- Initial stage: immediate vs. deferred, [not] deferrable
  -- MySQL: DEFERABLE is not supported
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_1          FOREIGN KEY (t1_id) REFERENCES t1(id)
                                 INITIALLY IMMEDIATE DEFERRABLE

-- Change constraint characteristics at a later stage
SET CONSTRAINT hier_fk DEFERRED; -- or: IMMEDIATE

&lt;/source&gt;

== Alter Table ==

:[[../Alter_Table|More Details]]

Concerning columns.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Add a column (plus some column constraints). Oracle: The key word 'COLUMN' is not allowed.
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN col_1 VARCHAR(100) CHECK (LENGTH(col_1) &gt; 5);

-- Change a columns characteristic. (Some implementations use different key words like 'MODIFY'.)
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 SET DATA TYPE NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 SET SET DEFAULT -1;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 SET  NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 DROP NOT NULL;

-- Drop a column. Oracle: The key word 'COLUMN' is mandatory.
ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN col_2;
&lt;/source&gt;

Concerning complete table.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- 
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD   CONSTRAINT t1_col_1_uniq UNIQUE (col_1);
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD   CONSTRAINT t1_col_2_fk FOREIGN KEY (col_2) REFERENCES person (id);

-- Change definitons. Some implementations use different key words like 'MODIFY'.
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER CONSTRAINT t1_col_1_unique UNIQUE (col_1);

-- Drop a constraint. You need to know its name. Not supported by MySQL, there is only a 'DROP FOREIGN KEY'.
ALTER TABLE t1 DROP  CONSTRAINT t1_col_1_unique;
-- As an extention to the SQL standard some implementations offer an ENABLE / DISABLE command for constraints.

&lt;/source&gt;

== Drop Table ==
:[[../Drop_Table|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- All data and complete table structure inclusive indices are thrown away.
-- No column name. No WHERE clause. No trigger is fired. Considers Foreign Keys. Very fast.
DROP TABLE t1;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Select ==
=== Basic Syntax ===
:[[../SELECT:_Fundamentals|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Overall structure: SELECT / FROM / WHERE / GROUP BY / HAVING / ORDER BY

--     constants, column values, operators,     functions 
SELECT 'ID: ',    id,            col_1 + col_2, sqrt(col_2)
FROM   t1
-- precedence within WHERE: functions, comparisions, NOT, AND, OR
WHERE  col_1 &gt; 100
AND    NOT MOD(col_2, 10) = 0
OR     col_3 &lt; col_1
ORDER BY col_4 DESC, col_5  -- sort ascending (the default) or descending
;

-- number of rows, number of not-null-values
SELECT COUNT(*),   COUNT(col_1) FROM t1;

-- predefined functions
SELECT COUNT(col_1), MAX(col_1), MIN(col_1), AVG(col_1), SUM(col_1) FROM t1;

-- UNIQUE values only
SELECT DISTINCT col_1 FROM t1;

-- In the next example col_1 many have duplicates. Only the combination of col_1 plus col_2 is unique. 
SELECT DISTINCT col_1, col_2 FROM t1;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Case ===
:[[../SELECT:_Case_Expression|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- CASE expression with conditions on exactly ONE column
SELECT id,
       CASE contact_type   -- ONE column name
         WHEN 'fixed line' THEN 'Phone'
         WHEN 'mobile'     THEN 'Phone'
         ELSE                   'Not a telephone number'
       END,
       contact_value
FROM   contact;

-- CASE expression with conditions on ANY column
SELECT id,
       CASE   -- NO column name
         WHEN contact_type IN ('fixed line', 'mobile')  THEN 'Phone'
         WHEN id = 4                                    THEN 'ICQ'
         ELSE                                                'Something else'
       END,
       contact_value
FROM   contact;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Grouping ===
:[[../SELECT:_Grouping|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
SELECT product_group, count(*) AS cnt
FROM   sales
WHERE  region = 'west'   -- additional restrictions are possible but not necessary
GROUP BY product_group   -- 'product_group' is the criterion which creates groups
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1000   -- restriction to groups with more than 1000 sales per group
ORDER BY cnt;

-- Attention: in the next example col_2 is not part of the GROUP BY criterion. Therefore it cannot be displayed.
SELECT col_1, col_2
FROM   t1
GROUP BY col_1;

-- We must accumulate all col_2-values of each group to ONE value, eg:
SELECT col_1, sum(col_2), min(col_2)
FROM   t1
GROUP BY col_1;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Join ===
:[[../SELECT:_Join_Operation|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Inner join: Only persons together with their contacts.
--             Ignores all persons without contacts and all contacts without persons
SELECT *
FROM   person p
JOIN   contact c ON p.id = c.person_id;

-- Left outer join: ALL persons. Ignores contacts without persons
SELECT *
FROM      person p
LEFT JOIN contact c ON p.id = c.person_id;

-- Right outer join: ALL contacts. Ignores persons without contacts
SELECT *
FROM       person p
RIGHT JOIN contact c ON p.id = c.person_id;

-- Full outer join: ALL persons. ALL contacts.
SELECT *
FROM      person p
FULL JOIN contact c ON p.id = c.person_id;

-- Carthesian product (missing ON keyword): be carefull!
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM   person p
JOIN   contact c;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Subquery ===
:[[../SELECT:_Subquery|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Subquery within SELECT clause
SELECT id,
       lastname,
       weight,
       (SELECT avg(weight) FROM person)    -- the subquery
FROM   person;

-- Subquery within WHERE clause
SELECT id,
       lastname,
       weight
FROM   person
WHERE  weight &lt; (SELECT avg(weight) FROM person)    -- the subquery
;

-- CORRELATED subquery within SELECT clause
SELECT id,
       (SELECT status_name FROM status st WHERE st.id = sa.state)
FROM   sales sa;

-- CORRELATED subquery retrieving the highest version within each booking_number
SELECT *
FROM   booking b
WHERE  version =
  (SELECT MAX(version) FROM booking sq WHERE sq.booking_number = b.booking_number)
;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Set operations ===
:[[../SELECT:_Set_Operations|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- UNION
SELECT firstname  -- first SELECT command
FROM   person
  UNION           -- push both intermediate results together to one result
SELECT lastname   -- second SELECT command
FROM   person;

-- Default behaviour is: 'UNION DISTINCT'. 'UNION ALL' must be explicitly specified, if duplicate values shall be removed.

-- INTERSECT: resulting values must be in BOTH intermediate results
SELECT firstname FROM person
  INTERSECT
SELECT lastname  FROM person;

-- EXCEPT: resulting values must be in the first but not in the second intermediate result
SELECT firstname FROM person
  EXCEPT   -- Oracle uses 'MINUS'. MySQL does not support EXCEPT.
SELECT lastname  FROM person;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Insert ==
:[[../INSERT_2|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- fix list of values/rows
INSERT INTO t1 (id, col_1, col_2) VALUES (6, 46, 'abc');

COMMIT;

-- subselect: leads to 0, 1 or more new rows
INSERT INTO t1 (id, col_1, col_2)
  SELECT id, col_x, col_y 
  FROM   t2
  WHERE  col_y &gt; 100;
COMMIT;

-- dynamic values
INSERT INTO t1 (id, col_1, col_2) VALUES (16, CURRENT_DATE, 'abc');
COMMIT;

INSERT INTO t1 (id, col_1, col_2)
  SELECT id,

           WHEN col_x &lt; 40 THEN col_x + 10
           ELSE                 col_x +  5
         END,
         col_y 
  FROM   t2
  WHERE  col_y &gt; 100;
COMMIT;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Update ==
:[[../UPDATE_2|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- 
-- basic syntax
UPDATE t1
SET    col_1 = 'Jimmy Walker', 
       col_2 = 4711
WHERE  id = 5;

-- raise value of col_2 by factor 2; no WHERE ==&gt; all rows!
UPDATE t1 SET col_2 = col_2 * 2;

-- non-correlated subquery leads to one single evaluation of the subquery
UPDATE t1 SET col_2 = (SELECT max(id) FROM t1);

-- correlated subquery leads to one evaluation of subquery for EVERY affected row of outer query
UPDATE t1 SET col_2 = (SELECT col_2 FROM t2 where t1.id = t2.id);

-- Subquery in WHERE clause
UPDATE article
SET    col_1 = 'topseller'
WHERE  id IN
  (SELECT article_id
   FROM   sales
   GROUP BY article_id
   HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1000
  );
&lt;/source&gt;

== Merge ==
:[[../MERGE|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- INSERT / UPDATE depending on any criterion, in this case: the two columns 'id'
MERGE INTO  hobby_shadow                    t   -- the target table
      USING (SELECT id, hobbyname, remark
             FROM   hobby
             WHERE  id &lt; 8)                 s   -- the source
      ON    (t.id = s.id)                       -- the 'match criterion'

  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (id, hobbyname, remark) VALUES (s.id, s.hobbyname, concat(s.remark, ' Merge / Insert'))
;

-- Independent from the number of affected rows there is only ONE round trip between client and DBMS
&lt;/source&gt;

== Delete ==
:[[../DELETE_2|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Basic syntax
DELETE FROM t1 WHERE id = 5;  -- no column name behind 'DELETE' key word because the complete row will be deleted

-- no hit is OK
DELETE FROM t1 WHERE id != id;

-- subquery
DELETE FROM person_hobby
WHERE  person_id IN
  (SELECT id
   FROM   person
   WHERE  lastname = 'Goldstein'
  );
&lt;/source&gt;

== Truncate ==
:[[../TRUNCATE|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- TRUNCATE deletes ALL rows (WHERE clause is not possible). The table structure remains.
-- No trigger actions will be fired. Foreign Keys are considered. Much faster than DELETE.
TRUNCATE TABLE t1;

The diagram someone has attempted to include has just come up as a file name in a box! I assume that is not what you wanted! Just thought i'd let you know. I tried taking a screen shot to show you but it turns out that putting an image in is not as straight forward as it seems because it doesn't let you choose from your own files. I will ask about it in the reading room.

==on it==
Hey Raf, the lack of referencing is my fault and i will fix it now.[[User:AlexandraChanner|AlexandraChanner]] ([[User talk:AlexandraChanner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexandraChanner|contribs]]) 14:00, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

[[User:JamesBeresford-Smith|JamesBeresford-Smith]] you said that you were having some problems with uploading photos. I suggest saving the file to your computer so that you can upload it using the 'embedded file' button that is located just above the type box. If this doesn't work please let one of us know before 5 so that we can help you find a solution. Alternatively, try asking in the reading room but you don't have too long to get a response![[User:AlexandraChanner|AlexandraChanner]] ([[User talk:AlexandraChanner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexandraChanner|contribs]]) 14:00, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Kylie- i did the first paragraph of Future of Crowdsourcing but i have no idea who did the other half- anyone? its not a direct quote but it does need to be referenced, something which i shall be sorting out now.[[User:AlexandraChanner|AlexandraChanner]] ([[User talk:AlexandraChanner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexandraChanner|contribs]]) 14:00, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

==Proofreading==
I spent a couple hours last night proofreading and made a few alterations this morning, please let me know if you don't agree with any of them. 

There are still a few things that need work, so from what I can see, can the authors of the things below change or shout at me for misunderstanding what you've written:
* Still no references in &quot;History of Crowdsourcing&quot;.
* 'Internet Gaming' need clarification on what Greenlight actually is (is it a website?).
* Rheingold references in the text should be referenced like other references with footnotes instead of in-text parenthesis.
* Is the Ghana example under 'Endorsement' part of (Rheingold) too? No reference. 
* I don't understand what Lush is doing that's crowdsourcing &quot;More people know about the companies than the charities&quot;- unsure what companies you mean.
* 'Future of Crowdsourcing' section:  'reports showed', 'Mark Prensky coined the term' and 'belief amongst academics' all need references.
* I don't fully understand the last few sentences of 'Future of Crowdsourcing' - starting with the challenges companies could face. The sentence structure was a little confusing too, I changed some already. 
* Reference 18 is a quote therefore needs a page number.
* References 13/19/ 20 are not MLA. I would do every citation in text with a separate footnote.
References are the most important, Wikipedians can delete sections at any time if we don't provide any evidence to support what we have written. 
Now be angry at me. Thanks!

Hey, [[User:JamesBeresford-Smith|JamesBeresford-Smith]] any luck on adding multimedia to the page as discussed in our meeting?

''From main book page:''
Whoever did the &quot;Future of Crowdsourcing&quot; section - is that a direct quote from an article somewhere? If so, please reference it!! Thank you [[User:Rkmraf|Rkmraf]] for fixing the referencing problem we were having, would you please tell me what you did? And is it an automatic format that it goes into? I wanted to fix the references that were just websites to the full citation, but it just takes me back to having the footnote &quot;1&quot;. Thanks! And also, we have only a couple more days so if [[User:JamesBeresford-Smith|JamesBeresford-Smith]]  and  [[User:JamieS TA|JamieS TA]] could let us know their sections, that'd be awesome.

::So, Wiki has some code that as far as I understand will automatically copy and sort the references chronologically, to activate it you have to type 'reflist' and some punctuation where you want it to appear. All it does is copy what we've written ourselves so you still have to write out the reference (or paste from RefWorks/EasyBib to make sure it's correct). So after the end of the text you're referencing paste the MLA reference in between a &lt; ref &gt; *&lt;u&gt;your reference&lt;/u&gt;* &lt; / ref &gt;. Once saved it will appear under the references heading. I've formatted &quot;2&quot; to MLA so try &quot;8&quot;. I also think the &quot;The key ingredients of crowdsourcing according to a few dozen scholars who have published on the topic&quot; needs a reference. If we say a few dozen, we ought to at least give one of them, could you add one in please [[User:AlexandraChanner|AlexandraChanner]]?.

Hello everyone! I just discovered that The Guardian website has a section with all of their articles relating to crowdsourcing, should be helpful for anyone who hasn't done any work yet or needs something to write about. [http://www.theguardian.com/technology/crowdsourcing Here!] Hope that helps. [[User:CiaranBC|CiaranBC]] ([[User talk:CiaranBC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/CiaranBC|contribs]]) 13:26, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys! I noticed that the References section has been deleted, so I am going to put that back in there. In addition, I am going to add a &quot;Contributors&quot; section so we can all just sign our names at the end, instead of having them on each piece (as Greg suggested). If you could just tell me the format we are using for the References, that'd be great and just pop them in there when you've got them. *SIDENOTE* Please make sure to go in order of the footnote numbers!

=== HOW TO PUT IN A REFERENCE=== 
Using the toolbar at the top of the typing box page, there's a little icon that looks like a open book. Just copy/paste the link that you used, or a full reference if it wasnt taken from online into the blank area after clicking the book, and then &quot;okay&quot;. It will come up as a whole huge mess, but if you preview/save page, you will see that it turns into a little number instead. 
&lt;s&gt;JUST KNOW THAT you still will have to do this reference again in the REFERENCES section at the bottom of the wikibook. It does not automatically fill that in.&lt;/s&gt; 
[[User:KylieMott|KylieMott]] ([[User talk:KylieMott|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KylieMott|contribs]]) 12:59, 30 March 2014 (UTC)
::When I first tried that (I was highlighting the referenced text/ saving) the referenced text would disappear! I've started doing it manually with the ref tag. I think the number should automatically take you to the correct reference so not sure what I'm linking them to just now. I keep doing that then will try to change them all at the end and hopefully fix them.

ALRIGHT y'all, I started on the INTRODUCTION section of the Wiki, just to get something down.

SIDENOTE: (I think this is a good place to start, given that there have been no lectures yet on crowdsourcing. This is just a definition I pulled offline and at least it could get us all acquainted with the term. I will let y'all know any new info I get. Cheers!) [[User:KylieMott|KylieMott]] ([[User talk:KylieMott|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KylieMott|contribs]]) 10:06, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

Should we make a mention that what a Wikibook -IS- is crowdsourcing? I think it is quite relevant and would be a good real-life example of what it is rather than a simple definition (Putting this here because everyone should get a notification, and it'd be information to consider for each part of the page.

Oh my gosh, I really need to figure out how to use this haha. Im not great. But I thought this may be helpful, it's about how CROWDSOURCING is being used to help locate the Malaysian Flight 370 that disappeared recently: http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/03/crowdsourcing-the-search-for-malaysia-flight-370/ 
We may be able to use this in the RESOURCES section, or something, just as a reference on how it is used today, again making it seem applicable. [[User:KylieMott|KylieMott]] ([[User talk:KylieMott|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KylieMott|contribs]]) 14:41, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

I know [[User:JamesBeresford-Smith|JamesBeresford-Smith]] had some examples of his own too. Under The Problems With Crowdsourcing I feel like we should add another specific example- how about the search for the Boston Marathon Bombing suspects using Reddit? I can tackle this unless you were already doing it yourself. Let me know. I've noticed Snowden is the only group doing Crowdsourcing so we don't have to worry about stepping on each other's toes after all.

The plane was a great idea!

I found a book on the future of crowdsourcing by Jeff Howe (some of you might have come across this already, and I notice this has already been a section on this put into the Wikibook) but there's some interesting ideas in there about the ways in which children and teenagers use digital media and how it could cause some things which are scarce to become abundant and it could cause issues for businesses which trade in those things (it uses gaming as an example so it links in nicely to the section on gaming, as well as having some links to other ideas such as collaboration). Do you guys think exploring these ideas could be something useful to add into the book? [[User:JamieS TA|JamieS TA]] ([[User talk:JamieS TA|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamieS TA|contribs]]) 16:01, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

:: Yeah his basic argument is about how crowdsourcing will shape the future of business so I think I'll go ahead and write some stuff about that, where do you think is best in the book for this to go?

&lt;u&gt;'''Referencing update'''
&lt;/u&gt;
Good news! I found a way for the references to automatically appear in the reference list! I simply went onto another WIki article and had a look at the code! From now on just reference in the text itself, the references will automatically appear at the bottom with the working numbered links.  If we accumulate a lot of them, we can change it so that appear in two columns. 
Remember that for consistency reasons we are using MLA 7th edition. [[User:Rkmraf|Rkmraf]] ([[User talk:Rkmraf|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rkmraf|contribs]]) 19:41, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi guys. Part of what I've discovered whilst doing my bit for &quot;Always On&quot; might be useful for your page regarding crowdsourcing and crowdfunding. I was going to post it straight on to your book as a contribution but thought I'd check in with you first. Here is the piece - I can give you the references or just put it straight on the book - just let me know. Cheers. 
&quot;Crowdfunding, which a part of crowdsourcing, can lead to a company becoming so attractive after start-up that the owners are tempted to sell to make a large financial gain, potentially upsetting early backers. This was the case recently when Facebook bought virtual reality technology firm Oculus VR for £1.2bn, a company that was started with crowdfunding.  After Oculus VR sold to Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg claimed that “virtual reality will be the next social communications platform” (The Guardian, 25th March, 2014). Reaction was the early backers were mixed with some against and some in favour (BBC, 26th March, 2014). Crowdfunding and crowdsourcing can clearly set in motion ideas and products that can become part of a global means of communication, as evidenced by the acquisition of such a product by Facebook, one of the world’s largest technology companies.&quot;[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 15:07, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Just noticed I probably put the above suggested contribution in a place in your discussion page that no one will see unless they are looking to check on referencing - so I'll post it now as the deadline is drawing near- I've edited it to fit in with what is already there under Crowdfunding - so if anyone wants to edit it further over the next 36 hours please feel free ... hope I don't mess up the referencing - will try not to![[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 09:34, 3 April 2014 (UTC)
::Thanks for the contribution, George!  Of course we appreciate any additions to the chapter as it's a collaborative and crowdsourced activity. I was somewhat confused that Facebook, out of all companies, bought Oculus VR with the Oculus Rift gaming VR system being so close to a consumer release. It could have been a response to Sony [http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/sony-unveils-project-morpheus-a-virtual-reality-rival-to-the-oculus-rift-9201428.html announcing]  their own plans in the market but these acquisitions are usually in talks for a long time. Acquisitions such as these probably raise questions of trust from backers and the ethicality of 'selling out'. Backers of these projects simply invest/ support the projects but often may not get any real value from doing so- except the satisfaction of helping a startup and the promise of an eventual product. In the case of Oculus VR, many backers are left with [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game/posts thank you notes, T-shirts and posters] even though without their initial support the project would likely not have existed at all. Are the backers left high and dry while the Oculus team are left with a company valued at $2 billion? You've got me thinking, I may add these thoughts as another criticism to crowdfunding, issues of ownership certainly come into play.

==''What is Growth Hacking?''==

Growth hacking is a method of rapidly and inexpensively growing a company’s user base, sales, or market share. &lt;ref&gt;http://blog.ourcrowd.com/index.php/2014/01/21/what-is-a-growth-hacker-and-why-every-startup-needs-one/&lt;/ref&gt; Coined by Sean Ellis in 2010, this low-cost strategy often employs technological solutions such as search engine optimization, website analytics,[http://www.creativeguerrillamarketing.com/what-is-guerrilla-marketing/ guerrilla marketing], optimizing user experience and user interface, and leveraging social media platforms to enhance user experience &lt;ref name= &quot;quicksprout&quot;&gt; [http://www.quicksprout.com/the-definitive-guide-to-growth-hacking-chapter-1/] &lt;/ref&gt;. Since being coined in 2010, the term and its associated marketing strategies have become popular in the tech industry and have begun to branch out into other sectors, leading to the first [http://growthhackersconference.com/ Growth Hackers Conference] in 2013.

==''Profile of a Growth Hacker''==

''“Many of the growth hacking descriptions on the web are unnecessarily restrictive. I don’t believe growth hackers must be formal engineers when many of the most well-regarded growth hackers don’t code regularly.&lt;ref name = quicksprout&quot;&gt;[http://www.quicksprout.com/the-definitive-guide-to-growth-hacking-chapter-2/] &lt;/ref&gt;” 
 -Gagan Biyani, Co-Founder of Udemy, Growth Hacker ''

A typical growth hacker is tech-savvy, highly analytical, and data-driven &lt;ref name=&quot;whenGHgoesbad&quot;&gt; [http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/03/when-growth-hacking-goes-bad//] &lt;/ref&gt;. Although many growth hackers are programmers, growth hackers can come from a variety of backgrounds. Though many growth hacking strategies are technical in nature, they often also require outside-of-the-box thinking, creativity, and comfort dealing with qualitative data and ambiguity &lt;ref name=&quot;whenGHgoesbad&quot;&gt; [http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/03/when-growth-hacking-goes-bad//] &lt;/ref&gt;. According to Aaron Ginn via [http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/21/defining-a-growth-hacker-building-growth-into-your-team/ TechCrunch], a strong growth hacking team typically consists of a programmer, analyst, and a marketer who combine their skills to achieve rapid growth. The web developer manipulates and designs marketing platforms, the analyst analyzes data to expose trends and motivate strategies, and the marketer pitches growth recommendations to clients.

='''Growth Hacking and Professional Ethics'''=
==''Knowing Where to Draw the Line''==

The term [http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/hacker hacking] is often perceived negatively due to its use to describe individuals who exploit security flaws in computer systems in an illicit manner. When used in the context of growth hacking, however, hacking should hold a neutral or positive association. [http://www.growtheverywhere.com/sean-ellis/ Eric Ellis], coiner of the term &quot;growth hacking&quot;, recommends that &quot;people don’t get caught up on the term “growth hacker” or even a specific definition for it&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;EllisQuote&quot;&gt; [http://blog.clarity.fm/what-300-years-of-growth-hacking-can-teach-us/] &lt;/ref&gt; , but rather &quot;focus instead on the concepts behind it.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;EllisQuote&quot;&gt; [http://blog.clarity.fm/what-300-years-of-growth-hacking-can-teach-us/] &lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellis, growth hackers simply manipulate data to find a marketing highway for growth. Though the most critical goal of growth hacking is growth, companies typically try to avoid growth hacking techniques that exploit users.&lt;ref name=&quot;ourcrowdblog&quot;&gt; [http://blog.ourcrowd.com/index.php/2014/01/21/what-is-a-growth-hacker-and-why-every-startup-needs-one/] &lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, the saying &quot;one bad apple can spoil the whole bunch&quot; &lt;ref name = &quot;bad apple&quot;&gt; [http://voices.yahoo.com/popular-phrases-origin-meaning-one-bad-apple-2718025.html?cat=37] &lt;/ref&gt; applies to growth hacking techniques. Some growth hackers work to achieve growth without regard to the best interests of the company reputation and customer well-being. Some such hackers rely on spamming, questionable means of obtaining user data and information, and practices that could be considered slander of competitors. While their tactics may result in quick money, sabotaging reputations and customer trust does not benefit the company in the long run. Furthermore, the &quot;bad apples&quot; sour the image of growth hackers and what they can do to help companies experience incredible growth and prosperity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ourcrowdblog&quot;&gt; [http://blog.ourcrowd.com/index.php/2014/01/21/what-is-a-growth-hacker-and-why-every-startup-needs-one/] &lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/unethical Unethical]and unprofessional tactics used by some growth hackers include, but are not limited too, taking aggressive action to obtain email addresses and personal information of a target population, [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Internet_Technologies/Email_spam spamming], inappropriately slandering competitor products, false advertising,and secretly tracking customer internet habits. &lt;ref name=&quot;whenGHgoesbad&quot;&gt; [http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/03/when-growth-hacking-goes-bad//] &lt;/ref&gt; As a company looking to hire growth hackers, it is key to note that growth hackers see their growth techniques as geared towards &quot;bringing in more traffic and putting more users at the top of the conversion funnel,&quot; not as ethical or unethical.&lt;ref name=&quot;kissmetrics&quot;&gt; [http://blog.kissmetrics.com/growth-hack-content-marketing//] &lt;/ref&gt; Growth hackers and their unique techniques need to be compatible with they work for so that the context of growth goals and objectives are clearly defined and understood.  In regards to professionalism, &quot;professionalism is about more than how you behave in practice;&quot; it also involves the core values and attitudes held by an individual&lt;ref name=&quot;Professionalism&quot;&gt; [http://www.southampton.ac.uk/medu/curriculum_design_and_delivery/professionalism.page] &lt;/ref&gt;.  The values and attitudes of individual growth hackers shape the image of the profession as a whole.

In the digital world, social messaging applications are often  known as a top offender of presumably unethical and unprofessional growth hacking techniques. &lt;ref name=&quot;whenGHgoesbad&quot;&gt; [http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/03/when-growth-hacking-goes-bad//] &lt;/ref&gt; For example, spamming techniques are common on applications like [http://www.gotinder.com/ Tinder], a dating application, and [http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2013/04/04/glide-brings-instant-video-messaging-to-mobile/ Glide], a video application.  These applications allow users to send non-users messages with links to download. Labeling content as spam is ultimately left up to the discretion of the receiver and if it is unsolicited and unwanted, the content is often seen as unethical. &lt;ref name=&quot;whenGHgoesbad&quot;&gt; [http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/03/when-growth-hacking-goes-bad//] &lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, there are also successful ethical growth hacking techniques. The most important ethical technique in growth hacking is reliance on data and data analysis. Data is what drives good, honest growth hacking.&lt;ref name=&quot;whenGHgoesbad&quot;&gt; [http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/03/when-growth-hacking-goes-bad//] &lt;/ref&gt; In the cases of Tinder and Glide, data analytics could have been utilized to pinpoint trends in the target populations instead of inundating users with spam. Furthermore, data analysis can highlight the behavior of users allowing growth hackers to tailor their marketing in a fashion that pulls the users in rather than pushing them away with unsolicited downloads.  Growth hacking techniques should be like an attractive side of a magnet; the techniques should be so enticing that the customer uses, clicks, downloads,or purchases on their own terms without being bombarded.

==''Normalization of Deviance''==
One aspect of professional ethics that pertains to growth hacking is [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professionalism/Diane_Vaughan_and_the_normalization_of_deviance Diane Vaughan's] theory of normalization of deviance. Growth hacking techniques are subject to gradually sway away from what the public may see as ethical. The sway may come in the form of content lacking integrity, spamming, slandering, or other unethical techniques discussed previously.  These techniques are often used by growth hackers who see growth as being more important than the reputation of a company or the well-being of the consumer. Though these techniques often lead to short term growth, they fail to lead to long term success. These unethical practices of growth hacking are often identified and exposed by the public, which can lead to a decrease in company credibility, faith, and ultimately growth.

='''Case Studies'''=

==''Leveraging''==
One of the most popular examples of growth hacking was [https://www.airbnb.com/ AirBNB's] leveraging of Craigslist to rapidly expand its user base. In the two years following AirBNB's 2008 launch, AirBNB's marketing team employed several growth strategies aimed at tapping into Craigslist's then much larger user base. First, AirBNB engineers reverse engineered Craigslist's posting mechanism. In doing so, AirBNB was able to offer its users an option to post a new AirBNB listing directly to Craigslist in the form of a Craigslist post that would then link back to AirBNB. This tactic both enabled early AirBNB users to advertise their listings to a much wider audience and brought many Craigslist users to the AirBNB platform. Though not an illicit tactic per se, Craigslist eventually resolved the vulnerability that enabled external sites to create listings, thus bringing an end to that functionality for AirBNB users&lt;ref name=&quot;The Definiteive Guide to Growth Hacking&quot;&gt; [http://www.quicksprout.com/the-definitive-guide-to-growth-hacking-chapter-1/]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The second tactic employed by AirBNB was to send messages recommending AirBNB to Craigslist users who posted rental listings similar to those found on AirBNB. This tactic, considered by some as [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Internet_Technologies/Email_spam spamming], was detailed most notably by web developer Dave Gooden, who works in the vacation rental industry and was curious about the source of AirBNB's rapid growth &lt;ref name=&quot;How AirBNB Became a Billion Dollar Company&quot; &gt;[http://davegooden.com/2011/05/how-airbnb-became-a-billion-dollar-company/]&lt;/ref&gt;. In his 2011 blog post &quot;How AirBNB Became a Billion Dollar Company&quot;, Gooden revealed his investigation into AirBNB's growth tactics. After posting a rental listing on Craigslist, he received an email from a random Gmail account recommending AirBNB. He then created his own rental site and listed one of the rental properties from that site on Craigslist, only to receive a similar email recommending he list his rental on AirBNB. So many Craigslist users likely received similar messages from AirBNB after posting rental properties and wound up listing their rentals on AirBNB as well.

Though neither of these tactics were illegal, they both call the ethics of growth hacking into principle. On one hand, AirBNB took advantage of another website's existing user base and sent spam. At the same time, AirBNB turned into a respectable service that now allows people to rent places to stay in 34,000 cities in 192 countries &lt;ref name=&quot;AirBNB&quot;&gt;[https://www.airbnb.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==''Incentivization''==
Many companies are offering incentives for users to refer friends in order to gain more exposure. [https://www.dropbox.com/help/15/en Dropbox], for one, gives a user 2 gigabytes of cloud storage space immediately when you sign up. Then once you're a user, you can send a referral link to your friends and if those friends use that referral link you and that friend both get added space onto your account; 500 megabytes per referral going up to 16 gigabytes for free users and 1 gigabyte per referral going up to 32 gigabytes for paid users. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dropbox.com/help/54/en]&lt;/ref&gt;. Referring a friend is not the only way to receive free space, giving feedback on the site, connecting social media accounts, using Dropbox as a primary photo storage, and linking an iOS mail account will all give users more free space &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dropbox.com/help/15/en]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Venmo is a mobile application that lets users pay friends or other users directly through the application. You can link credit cards, debit cards, and bank accounts in order to withdraw and deposit money &lt;ref&gt;[https://venmo.com/info/product]&lt;/ref&gt;. Their [https://help.venmo.com/customer/portal/articles/1322637-how-do-i-invite-new-users- incentive program] used to pay the user $5 for each friend they refer. Because the application is primarily used for payment purposes, an extra $5 on your account is something not many people will turn down.

Other companies who participate in bonuses for referring friends are [http://rewards.na.leagueoflegends.com/ League of Legends], [http://www.marriott.com/marriott-rewards/refer-a-friend.mi Marriot hotels], [http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/support/referral-rewards Verizon wireless], [https://www316.americanexpress.com/iFormsSecure/un/UK/Refer-A-Friend/iforms.do?cuid=emgmUpliftMGMER_en_GB&amp;evtsrc=link&amp;evttype=0&amp;mgmerSource=mgmerHub American Express], [http://www.orbitz.com/rewards/refer-a-friend/ Orbitz], [https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral Groupon], [http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/referral/referralProgram.jsp DirectTV], and many others.

='''Conclusion'''=
Because growth hacking is a relatively new concept and many of the key growth hacking strategies are still evolving, the ethics of growth hacking will continue to shift. In science and engineering fields, mistakes and poor decisions can potentially lead to loss of life or massive damage to property and the environment. Examples of such mistakes and poor decisions are illustrated by cases such as the [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professionalism/Therac-25 Therac-25], [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professionalism/Rodney_Rocha_and_Columbia Rodney Rocha and Columbia], and [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professionalism/Apollo_13 Apollo 13]. The greatest risks, if they can even be considered risks, currently posed by growth hacking are consumer annoyance (due to spam and similar methods) and possible theft of another company's user base. As growth hacking continues to become more commonplace among tech companies and expands into other industries, we will likely alter our definition and perception of growth hacking, particularly as it pertains to professionalism and ethics.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page has two purposes; first, to provide a location to bring together the content from each team members weekly wiki documentation in a central location to improve information sharing and access while documenting the progress of the project as a whole, and second, to provide a forum for bringing the project documentation into line with the CDIO documentation format.

The four types of project documentation come from the [http://www.cdio.org/files/project/file/cdio_syllabus_v2.pdf cdio.org's syllabus]. CDIO has a chance of evolving into a world wide engineering accreditation organization. CDIO is a world wide organization that evolved out of MIT aerospace engineering. As of fall 2012 there are 90 members worldwide including 15 US Universities. For a better introduction, read this [[b:General_Engineering_Introduction/CDIO|general engineering introduction]] wikibook page. 

These are links to the four CDIO syllabus sections. These links are a maximal set of possible engineering tasks that need to be documented. All engineering project tasks have to be named in the outline. No project or CDIO document is expected to do all tasks.  Copy text from the pages linked below and add information to document that your group has considered and addressed important areas of concern relative to your project.

*[[BDolge/BycycleTurnSignal/CDIO/Minimal_Conceive|Conceive]] CDIO
When initially tasked with engineering a bicycle turn signal, the first step in starting the project was deciding what would need to be accomplished in order for the project to be considered a success. While a bicycle turn signal seemed very straight forward,[https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:CFernandez I] knew that it would require a clear set of parameters in order to be completed- so I initiated a brainstorming session to help conceptualize the finished project. The group agreed that the light source utilized, as well as the form factor of the turn signal would be vital. The size of the turn signal needed to be large enough to allow visibility from distances of at least ten feet, and the light source needed to be visible in the late evening hours.

· Each year, more than 500,000 people go to the emergency room for bicycle injuries. More than 700 people die 
from those injuries. 
· Children 15 years and younger are the biggest risk. 
· Bicycle injuries and deaths cost $8 billion each year. 
After hours of brainstorming and defining the problem, we had agreed on a basic design for the bicycle turn signal. Our objective was to create a bicycle turn signal that would mounted on a back of a bicycle and it would have left and right signals to assist the rider make safe turns and warn traffic of their presence. Safety of the rider seemed like a huge priority for this project, so we tried to mold design around the safety concept. So our goal was to create a very simple but yet effective turn signal that would portable enough to have the ability to switch bicycles and deliver maximum safety. We plan to execute by having a big enough LED matrix on the back of a bicycle which could be seen at night by cars and pedestrians, the LED turn signal will controlled by 2 independent switch mounted on the front handle bars of the bicycle. So for week 1, the the team researched 4 major components of this project. We decided we need to focus on, and we came up with POSSIBLE options 
* Housing-Figure out ways to house the components and parts of the project.
           - 3D printed case
           - Factory manufactured housing from online
           - Use a med-kit type box
           - use everyday found boxes such as Altoids boxes to house the Arduino
* Power- Figure out ways to power the the device
            - Use a USB 
            - Battery 
            - Generator by using the mechanical kinetic energy of the spinning wheels
* Interface- Figure out a the main &quot;brain&quot; for our device, something that will control the LEDS through coding
              - Arduino 
              - Simple circuits
              - Direct wires from LEDs to battery
* Control Options
              - Voice control
              - Switches
              - Gyro meter, which would activate the turn signal when the bicycle leans left or right when making turns.

====Week 2====

After looking into many options for each of our issues we eliminated many pricier options to make it as cost effective as possible 

These were out final decisions:  

Housing - We decided that we will custom 3D printed back housing with our specifications. we measured the box would need to have the dimensions of about 3.6in x 5in x 1.8in to fit a Arduino and a battery.

Battery - We decided that a 9v alkaline battery would be efficient to power 20+ LEDs. For Interface- We decided that a Arduino would be the best because it of it huge coding availability which will allow us to have 100% control of the LEDs lighting sequence, and it would be also easier to implement a switch and a buzzer.

Control - We decided basic pushbutton would be great because it will be the most convenient and easiest to merge in with the Arduino and the LED. Simple switches eliminates the hassle of overdoing the project and it keeps true to its integrity as it maintains functionality.

====Week 3====

During this week of the project we finally had all the research we needed to draw up how we wanted our prototype to look. We looked online at what types of boxes were already made with the 3D printer that fit our dimensions so that it could be used as housing for the battery, Arduino and LEDs/bread board. We then measured how well it would fit to the bike and determined we would need about 2-3ft of wire to get from wire to get from where the housing, then the wire would follow the frame and end at the handle bars where our two push buttons and devices to hold them with would be.


All together what seemed pretty straight forward, building turn signals, turned into a great deal of work. We decided not to use Sketchup or CAD to draw up our project because each bike is different and what were making has no moving parts just light bulbs that have electricity passed through them. Next week we will try and finish our prototype by printing our housing on the 3D printer, since this week it was having problems keeping itself at the right melting temperature. If it is not working by next week we will have to come up with another option for housing the Arduino, LEDs/bread board and power source.

====Week 4====

During this week our group decided to go with a bigger platform for our LED lay out. We determined that the factory OEM cover for the brake reflector that came with the bike might be hard to see with the few amount of LEDs that can fit inside the housing and the contrasting colors (i.e. red/greed). To make it easier to see the lights we made a new housing out of the lego pieces for robots for a temporary period of time until we order or print our housing that will hold the power source, LEDs and arduino.

&lt;gallery/&gt;

Throughout the week we worked on soldering the necessary wires to the LEDs, shrink wrapped the exposed ends and placed the LEDs into the lego covers. Once everything looked nice and clean we needed to make sure it would work and from learning house to make a light blink during the first week of class we thought it would be easy and were so very wrong, so while we finish up the housing we will need to find or code a program for the arduino(s) that will make the LEDs blink for a set period of time from two switches that can be mounted on the handle bars of the bike. We are trying to keep everything easily removable because we want this in the end to be able to fit onto any bike. 

Our main goals we are trying to accomplish are to have a bike turn signal that blinks for a set period of time and then goes off in you forget or are not sure we wanted it to turn off, we want it to be durable and easily removable so the power source, LEDs and arduino(s) are all going into one rugged container that will have wires running from the housing to the push buttons mounted on the handle bars that will control the LEDs.

However, we have now determined our original plan to use just one arduino will most likely not work because there are too many wires and not enough connectors on the arduino so we will be working on next week a way to overcome this but trying to keep it all easily removable. One idea that is at that top of our list is have two arduino's running so that there will be enough spaces. Next week we will be finishing up our second prototype for the turn signal and then if that is accomplished we will determine if the wiring is possible for two arduino's because the middle two bars with LEDs that are not curved will need to light up with both switches.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Week 5====
Code for the Arduino 
 /*
   Blink
   Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
 
   This example code is in the public domain.
  */
  // Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
 // give it a name:
 int led = 13;
 // the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
 void setup() {                
   // initialize the digital pin as an output.
   pinMode(led, OUTPUT);     
 }
 // the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
 void loop() {
   digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
   delay(1000);               // wait for a second
   digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
   delay(1000);               // wait for a second
 }

====Week 6====

This week we designed our housing for the LEDs, battery and arduino(s) and are drawing the program in sketchup so that hopefully we may print by next week. We are currently still waiting on the LEDs we ordered and cannot set up or next prototype without these next multicolored LEDs.

=Problem Statement =
The challenge was to design a pet feeder that would allow the owner to limit a pet's access to food and control the quantity of food dispensed at a given time (HS).

= Conceive =
===Why===
The first step in any project needs to begin with defining a solid and concise statement. As our groups were first assigned [https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Merielle213 Heidi Schultz] had already had an idea of what she wanted to design. Even with a preliminary design [https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:MTomaselli I] knew that there were still a plethora of questions and concerns that needed to be addressed. The first and foremost, which I knew from previous experience, was establishing a client base. Knowing exactly what our customer market was would allow us to gear our design specifically for who we wanted to sell to. For example, I brought up the point that whatever our final product was going to be it needed to be of an appropriate size because having pets I knew that I wouldn't want another bulk item sitting in my living room. The conceive process in any project, especially a group project, is ultimately the most important task of them all. It not only drives a common agreement in moving forward but it is the decision that I refer back to every time there's a question regarding what, specifically, I need to accomplish (MT).

===Original Inspiration===
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YejpfCDh4Lc Timed Pet food Dispenser]
* [http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-controled-dog-foodtreat-dispenser/ Screw/rotating Feeder Inspiration]
*[http://www.instructables.com/id/RFID-pet-feeder/ RFID-triggered feeder]
* [[File:Heidi's Obese cat.jpg|Heidi's Obese Cat]]

=Design=


===Requirements===
*relatively small
*allow access to food relatively quickly when approached
*hide food relatively quickly if the wrong pet approached  
*easy to clean
*buildable using materials found in the HCC Engineering Lab
*dispense food in 1/4 cup increments
*act in response to a pet wearing or implanted with an RFID chip approaching the apparatus (HS).

===Design Alternatives===
*bowl rotator that would hide 3 bowls and make one accessible at all times- servos we had to work with were not powerful enough to turn a platform holding four bowls, and using a DC motor would have required adding sensors and became unnecessarily complicated.  
*&quot;screw&quot; feeder to dispense food, rather than the final rotating food dispenser.  The screw feeder would have been more complicated to measure the quantity of food, though it may have used less torque to control.

'''Other alternatives considered included:'''
* Automatically dispensed vs. owner-measured food
* Magnet vs. RFID control
* Food inside a transparent box with RFID triggered door-lock vs. food bowl inside containment.
* 3D-printed housing vs. handmade
* Battery vs. corded power supply
(HS).



===Initial Design===
*cylindrical or rectangular housing to hold pet food
*&quot;screw/twisting&quot; style dispenser below it. 
*Food from dispenser fed through a tube to a bowl on a rotating platform
* When a pet approached, an arduino received the signal from an RFID reader and instructed the appropriate bowl to rotate out of a covered compartment and into the open for access, then food would be dispensed into the bowl.  
*Then, the arduino instructed the food dipenser to release the appropriate number of 1/4 cup food increments into the bowl.  
*The RFID reader would read microchips that were either implanted under the pet's skin or worn on a collar.

===Prototypes Needed===
Prototype out of available materials scaled for a small dog or cat
Includes:
*Arduino for control 
*9 volt battery for power
*servos for movement
*Hosing from wood or plastic

The next step would be to create an improved prototype out of superior materials , taking into consideration any feedback or discoveries from Prototype 1 and making appropriate changes.  Once this prototype has been perfected we create scaled up versions in sizes appropriate for larger pets.  The larger versions may need increased torque from a servo and possibly increased power to support the torque-providing device (HS).

===Modeling and simulation===
Each piece of the physical unit was designed in [http://www.sketchup.com/?gclid=CLiC97vUvb0CFWuhOgodq1YAAg Sketchup2014] prior to prototyping.  This allowed for detailed evaluation of specifications and potential issues prior to creation.  I believe this led to a smoother constructions process (HS).  The file can be reached [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i5hj517087f35wr/uDpY-em4Nb here]

&lt;/gallery&gt;
 (HS)

===Aesthetics and human factors===

We attempted to keep the entire apparatus as small in overall size as possible. It takes up a floor space of 12&quot;x6&quot; and a wall space of approximately 6&quot; x 18-24&quot;.

The prototype is not nearly as attractive as the final product ought to be.  Ideally we would use a smooth, attractive plastic for most of the pieces to improve aesthetic value and make cleaning the unit easy.  The final product will also not allow easy access to the moving, electrical, and mechanical components - lids and covers will be secured with screws.


==Final Design==

*3x6x12 inch box with a groove 1/8 inch from the top edge for the lid to slide in
* right side is slightly larger to allow for a piece of rack gear to protrude into the compartment and link with the gear assembly and still be able to retract completely to open
* mounts for the servo (see the below image)
* converted the measurements to inches and used those illustrated in the image below.  
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Futabaspecs.png|Getting servo specs and converting to inches
File:Feeder box.png|Feeder box with gear assembly
&lt;/gallery&gt;

* box lid slides 5.75 inches but the box was only 3 inches high and the servo that turns the gears can only turn 180 degrees. So, any gear that fits inside the box would not have a large enough diameter to have a circumference (that moves the lid) large enough. 
*Gears 0.9 and 2.25 inches in diameter create the proper turning distance of 5.75 inches when the servo turns them '''105.4 degrees'''.

*Gear Creation:
#Sketchup plugin that allows for relatively easy gear creation can be downloaded at ||http://www.ohyeahcad.com/download/%7C%7C. 
# this plugin only works in Sketchup 8 or earlier versions, downloadable at ||http://google-sketchup-pro.en.softonic.com%7C%7C. 
# After downloading both of these files the plugin .rbz file must be manually placed into the Google &gt; Sketchup8 &gt; plugins folder. The gear function is found under menu item Draw &gt; Involute Gear. 
#I left the pressure angle at 20 degrees (If the gear teeth are not perfectly square, that is, they are slightly rounded or cut off at an angle, the pressure angle is the angle between the vertical side of the tooth and the line that angles away from it to the horizontal side of the tooth).
#The teeth and pitch radius determine whether the teeth of two gears fit together. Pitch radius 0.45 and 1.125 inches.  12 and 30 gear teeth respectively. 
# teeth:gear ratio must be the same for each gear  (See images below).

==Problem Statement==
The challenge was to design a pet feeder that would allow the owner to limit a pet's access to food and control the quantity of food dispensed at a given time.

==The Design Process==
=====Requirements for each element or component derived from system level goals and requirements=====
The pet food bowl housing needed to be relatively small, allow access to food relatively quickly when approached, and hide food relatively quickly if the wrong pet approached.  It also needed to be easy to clean and buildable using materials found in the HCC Engineering Lab.  The food &quot;hopper&quot; which holds the bulk food and dispenses it at the appropriate time also needed to take up as little space as possible, in conjunction with the bowl housing.  It was decided that it should dispense food in 1/4 cup increments.  It also had to be built out of materials in the Engineering lab.  Both of these would be required to act in response to a pet wearing or implanted with an RFID chip approaching the apparatus.


=====Alternatives in design=====
The group initially considered using a bowl rotator that would hide 3 bowls and make one accessible at all times.  This idea was set aside when it became clear that the servos we had to work with were not powerful enough to turn a platform holding four bowls, and using a DC motor would have required adding sensors and became unnecessarily complicated.  It also used a &quot;screw&quot; feeder to dispense food, rather than the final rotating food dispenser.  The screw feeder would have been more complicated to measure the quantity of food, though it may have used less torque to control.  

=====The initial design=====
The initial design consisted of a cylindrical or rectangular housing to hold pet food, with a rotating dispenser below it. Food from that dispenser was fed through a tube to the bowl housing.  The bowl sat in the forward compartment and the components that operate it in the rear compartment. When a pet approached, an arduino received the signal from an RFID reader and instructed the bowl housing to retract its lid.  Then, the arduino instructed the food dipenser to release the appropriate number of 1/4 cup food increments into the bowl.

==Idea==

Make a bicycle turn signal out of LEDs that can be mounted on almost any bike and that gives the user control of the turn signal without losing the ability to also use there arm as a turn signal.

==Problem Statement==
· Each year, more than 500,000 people go to the emergency room for bicycle injuries in the USA. More than 700 people die 
from those injuries. 

· Children 15 years and younger are the biggest risk. 

· Bicycle injuries and deaths cost $8 billion each year.  

·Adolescents/Young people(ages 15-24) and adults aged 45 and older have the highest death rates.

·Males are more likely to get injured than females.

·Most of all bicycle deaths happen in urban areas and non-intersection areas.

==Setting System Goals and Requirements==
===Market/Customer needs===

* Competitive Bike Riders
* Leisurely Bike Riders
* Supply a proactive safety mechanism to a market that lends to $8 billion in annual cost resulting from injury and death. By implementing an easily recognizable safety system, it is not only the biker community that benefits, but automobile operators, and local government- with benefits trickling down to taxpayers as well.

===Factors that set the context of the requirements===

* Customer Needs (MT)
* Cost of Materials (MT)
* Time/Duration of Project (MT)
* Aesthetics (MT)
* Practicality (MT)
* Marketability (MT)
* Available Resources (MT)

=====Enterprise goals and capabilities=====

* Simplicity
* Cost effectiveness
* Employ a product that can easily be integrated in any enterprise scenario that would call for such an item.

=====Competitors and benchmarking information=====



=====Ethical, social, environmental, legal and regulatory influences=====


===System goals and requirements===
=====Initial target goals (based on needs, opportunities and other influences)=====
=====System performance metrics=====

==Defining Function, Concept and Architecture==
===Necessary system functions===

* Provide luminance that projects a minimum of 10ft
* components mounted upon a surface area visible from a minimum of 10ft away
* LED placement distinguishable as arrows
* Ability to indicate movement of two directions (left and right)

===System concepts===

===Trade-offs among concepts===



===High level architectural form and structure===
===The decomposition of form into subsystems, assignment of functions to subsystems, and definition of interfaces===

==Modeling of System and Ensuring Goals Can Be Met==
===Appropriate models of technical performance===
===The plan of implementation and operations===
===Trade-offs among various goals and functions===

==Development Project Management==
===Project cost and schedule===

* Additional Costs (not originally provided by class)
* $7.50 - set of LED Holders
* $7.95 - 25 Pack of LED
* TBD - Cost of 3D printed housing

===Estimation and allocation of resources===
===Risks and alternatives===
*Users could depend on using general hand signals
*Risk of limited sight range

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is about the ''Math Builder'' tool in Microsoft Word versions 2007 and higher. It also applies to Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 and higher. Note that this is a different tool than the legacy tool ''Equation editior 3.0'' and ''Mathtype''.

Typesetting mathematics on a computer has always been a challenge. The mathematical community almost universally accepts a typesetting language called LaTeX. ''Math Builder'' is a much easier to use tool that has less more functionality than [[Wikipedia: LaTeX|LaTeX]] but more than typical document processing. Microsoft call this hybrid language the ''Office Math Markup Language'', or OMML for short. It is an appropriate tool for:
*Typing any document whose focus is not itself mathematics.
*Typing a short mathematics document quickly.
*A stepping stone between word processing (MS Word) and typesetting (LaTeX)
Note that Math Builder does not perform any mathematics: it is a took for displaying it.

== Pros and Cons ==
'''Pros:'''
*Math Builder is [[Wikipedia: WYSIWYG|WYSIWYG]]: after typing an equation you see immediately what it looks like.
*It's easy to get started: it's already built in to Microsoft Word. Common symbols have point-and-click icons.
*It's easy to use: Common symbols have keyboard shortcuts so that a veteran user need not use a mouse at all.
*Nearly all symbols use the same commands as LaTeX. 
*The format used is non-proprietary and given in Unicode Technical Note #28. 

'''Cons:'''
*Some uncommon symbols are not listed in the menu and require knowing the keyboard shortcut. Typically this is the LaTeX code for the symbol.
*There are differences between Math Builder and LaTeX code: advanced functionality that requires more than just a symbol tend to follow the same flavor but have slightly different syntax. Math Builder code tends to be shorter than LaTeX code and disappears upon completion to the WYSIWYG output. Examples here are matrices, multiple aligned equations, and binomial coefficients.
*No LaTeX typesetting tools such as labels and references are implemented.
*No highly advanced LaTeX tools such as graphing, commutative diagrams, or geometric shapes are implemented.
*Students studying mathematics might not be motivated to learn LaTeX because they might be able to get by with ''Equation Builder'' in Word to satisfy the vast majority of their needs. However, when such a student reaches the limits, unlike LaTeX there is absolutely no recourse to expand the program to satisfy it.

== Inserting an equation ==
Microsoft Word has two different typing environments: text and math. To obtain the math environment, click on &quot;Equation&quot; on the &quot;Insert&quot; ribbon. The keyboard shortcut is &quot;alt&quot;+ &quot;=&quot;. Everything you type in this environment is considered math: all automatic formatting of text is disabled. To exit the math environment, click on any text outside the math environment. One easy way to do this is by pressing the right arrow key.

== Common Mathematics ==
=== Fractions ===
There are multiple ways to display a fraction. The default is vertically aligned as illustrated below. Obtain this by typing the fraction and pressing space: '''1/2'''

&lt;MATH&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/MATH&gt;

=== Parenthesis, brackets, and braces ===
Grouping symbols will automatically size to the appropriate size. These symbols include &quot;(), {}, [], ||&quot;. For instance, the expression below can be obtained with '''(1/2(x+1))''':

&lt;MATH&gt;\left (\frac{1}{2}(x+1)\right )&lt;/MATH&gt;

(Be careful to press space after the &quot;2&quot; to render the fraction, otherwise Word might put &quot;x+1&quot; in the denominator.)
=== Exponents and subscripts ===
Exponents can be obtained by using &quot;^&quot; and subscripts by &quot;_&quot;. The monomial below can be obtained by typing '''x_2^5''' or '''x^5_2''' and pressing space. 

&lt;MATH&gt;x_2^5&lt;/MATH&gt; 

=== Symbols: &lt;MATH&gt;\neq, \leq, \subseteq, \vee, \rightarrow, \Rightarrow &lt;/MATH&gt; etc ===
These are all common symbols. The easiest thing to do would be to find a LaTeX reference sheet. A few of those symbols are shown here:
{| class = &quot;wikitable&quot;
|code
|output
|-
|\neq
|&lt;MATH&gt;\neq&lt;/MATH&gt;
|-
|\leq or &lt;=
|&lt;MATH&gt;\leq&lt;/MATH&gt;
|-
|\subseteq
|&lt;MATH&gt;\subseteq&lt;/MATH&gt;
|-
|\vee
|&lt;MATH&gt;\vee&lt;/MATH&gt;
|-
|\rightarrow
|&lt;MATH&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/MATH&gt;
|-
|\Rightarrow
|&lt;MATH&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/MATH&gt;
|}

=== Greek, Script, and Fraktur letters ===
The math environment implements 3 fronts in addition to the default. 
*Greek letters can be obtained by typing a &quot;\&quot; followed by the name of symbol. Capitalizing it creates a capital letter. '''\delta \Delta''' produces &lt;MATH&gt;\delta \Delta&lt;/MATH&gt;
*Script letters can be obtained by typing &quot;\&quot; followed by &quot;script&quot; followed by the letter. '''\scriptd \scriptD''' produces &lt;MATH&gt;\mathcal{d} \mathcal{D}&lt;/MATH&gt;
*Fraktur letters can be obtained by typing &quot;\&quot; followed by &quot;fraktur&quot; followed by the letter. Fraktur does not have capitals. '''\frakd''' prodouces &lt;MATH&gt;\mathfrak{d}&lt;/MATH&gt;

=== Blackboard Bold letters ===
Blackboard bold letters can be obtained by typing &quot;\&quot; followed by &quot;double&quot; followed by the letter. '''\doubled \doubleD''' produces &lt;MATH&gt;\mathbb{d} \mathbb{D}&lt;/MATH&gt;


=== Matrices ===
Matrices are obtained with the &quot;\matrix&quot; symbol. Use parenthesis to start and end the matrix. Use &quot;@&quot; to separate rows, and &quot;&amp;&quot; to separate columns. The matrix below can be created by typing '''[\matrix(1&amp;2&amp;3@4&amp;5&amp;6)]'''.

&lt;MATH&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;2&amp;3\\4&amp;5&amp;6\end{bmatrix}&lt;/MATH&gt;



=== Multiple Aligned Equations ===
Aligning equations can be obtained with the &quot;eqarray&quot; symbol. Use parenthesis to stat and end the matrix. Use &quot;@&quot; to separate equations. Use &quot;&amp;&quot; to specify alignment and whitespace. The first &quot;&amp;&quot; and then every other occurrence is alignment. The second and then every other occurrence is white space. The equations below can be obtained by typing the following text:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\eqarray(2&amp;x+&amp;3&amp;y=5@&amp;x+&amp;&amp;y=7)&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;MATH&gt;\begin{align}2&amp;x+&amp;3&amp;y=5\\&amp;x+&amp;&amp;y=7\end{align}&lt;/MATH&gt;

(The math environment here seems to be adding excess space between the alignments that doesn't occur in Word)

== Inline versus Display ==
Equations have two forms. '''Inline''' specifies that the equation is to be in line with text. This affects a few expressions to make them appear smaller. For instance fractions will use a smaller font. Summations and integrals will place the endpoints to the right of the symbol instead of below it.
'''Display''' specifies to use as much space as needed. Display mode equations must appear on their own line.

== Modifying and creating shortcuts ==
Everything in Math Builder requires special symbols that the computer knows how to interpret. These symbols are constructed with all the commands starting with &quot;\&quot; as illustrated in the above sections. This is implemented via ''math autocorrect'' which you can modify. For instance, you might like to use \ra instead of \rightarrow. You can do this by adding the command to the ''math autocorrect'' directory.</text>

==Dotting the t's and crossing the i's==
Hey, now more than ever I just wanted to suggest cleaning up what we've already got.  We have a ton of great info already, and I feel we've more than covered the appropriate areas, and rather than just throwing in more bits and bobs I'd say perfecting what we do should be a priority.  Generally just bringing formatting and such in line throughout the page, correcting any spelling or grammar errors, really just polishing what we've got till it's good an' shiny and professional!  Hope that's not a problem George? ;D [[User:Flailkerrin|Flailkerrin]] ([[User talk:Flailkerrin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Flailkerrin|contribs]]) 15:56, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I think its a good idea just to clean things up a bit because we have loads of information and I think we have covered pretty much everything. Adding some pictures is a good touch and maybe linking things to other pages ect. And also making sure all the grammar and spelling is correct. Do we have until the end of the day to do all of this yeah? [[User:Heyrach|Heyrach]] ([[User talk:Heyrach|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Heyrach|contribs]]) 16:10, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I don't know, timewise. I just know that Kelly.marvel and I have been doing some serious polishing/editing for consistency (like the 'always-on' stuff) as well as for content. If you others are confident in your formatting skills (I'm not so confident in mine), have at it! [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 16:13, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Hello there guys! Has anyone else been having some serious trouble with editing conflicts preventing them posting things to the Wikibook?  The past few times I've tried to add or edit it just won't let me and my text just disappears. I don't know it's just me are not... From now on I'm writing stuff on word like Greg suggested before,but it's been infuriating! How have other people been finding it? [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

Hi Lottie, don't know if this will be too late but when an editing conflict occurs you just need to click back the page to get your work back. Then just copy and paste it into the new version. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 16:36, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys. I was wondering if we should include sub headings within the Main concepts section for each concept ? Was thinking it would be a good way to organize the different concepts? What do you guys think ? ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 22:34, 24 March 2014 (UTC))


Hey. I agree, I think having subheadings will make the page look more organised and professional. I think that we should start with a detailed description of the actual idea of Always-On Culture and then move on to Turkle and Boyd's ideas, each under their own subheading. What does everyone think? Also, is there something obvious I have missed? [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 15:34, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Should we change the main concepts to be more a section for each thinker than each concepts, or just add each of the main thinkers at the end or start of the section ? ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 22:41, 27 March 2014 (UTC))

Hi guys. I wanted to put in something about the fact that teenagers are more associated with &quot;always-on culture&quot; than any other group of people. Any suggestions of where, under which sub-heading, I should put it? Thanks! [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 13:50, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

''''reduced context cues'''' why the double bold here and not elsewhere? Try to be consistent with formatting :o) [[User:GregXenon01|GregXenon01]] ([[User talk:GregXenon01|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GregXenon01|contribs]]) 15:07, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Sorry about the double bold on social context cues it was a mistake on my part when making the sub heading and i didn't notice the error till today, however I've fixed it now and will check more carefully next time. As for teenagers being more associated with 'always on culture' you could work it into the idea of being part of a network as they would presumably be the largest part of said network and the implications of that ? ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 22:58, 28 March 2014 (UTC))

We should be sure to remain consistent with danah boyd's name. Some people are capitalising it when she is known for having it in lower case (even her Wikipedia page has it in lower case). (If anyone is dead against lower case just say here so everyone knows to put it like that). Thanks! [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 16:53, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Should we capitalize boyd's name when it is in the beginning of the sentence? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 17:55, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Good idea about putting the idea about teenagers being more associated with always on in the networking section. Thanks. I think if her name is lower case even on her Wikipedia page that we should keep it lower case throughout. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:14, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I've noticed that there are several different ways that we are saying &quot;Always-On Culture&quot;. Some have upper and lower case, some all upper case, some all lower case and some are in and some are out of quotations. I think they should all be the same, with perhaps the exception of the first time it should be in upper case. Do you think it should have &quot;&quot; quotations or ''? [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:33, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I agree Kathryn that we need to be a bit more consistent in the formatting of the words &quot;Always On Culture&quot;. In the module handbook and all our other course material the topic is refered to as 'Always On' Culture - with the culture aspect being titled as 'Always On' not an entire clause phrase and capitalising the C in 'Culture'. I hope that's helpful, what do others think? [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

I think we should go with what the handbook says. Also, are we putting the references in alphabetical order? Do you think it would look better or do you think they should be in line with where they are in the text? As in, if the reference comes first in the text should it come first in the reference list?

I'm not sure about the references - alphabetical will probably look better but the majority of Wiki pages/books have them in the order they are references in [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:17, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I think we need to link our references to where they are located in the text. Also, the citations in the text are not all formatted in the same way. --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 14:29, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys I had a thought about smart mobs after today's lecture. More the fact that in order to fully function, and effectively act out 'spontaneous' action, the mob has to be always on i.e. in order to quickly muster for a project with a deadline (us) or for like a protest (like what happened in Eygpt). Anyone think its relevant enough to add in? Just to reference another chapter?

Oh yeh, just clocked the online identity page... They have a hell of a lot more content than us haha. We might have to do more reading, &lt;u&gt;if&lt;/u&gt; there is anymore stuff to read about this!

In Turkle's work on the 'tethered self' she tied in a lot of other topics such as &quot;connections that matter&quot; and &quot;new forms of validation.&quot; I think it would be useful to add in subheadings under the 'tethered self' discussing these topics as well. Some content that we can include is a portion about the positive and negative aspects of being 'always on.'  --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 16:17, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

If we do add a section related to the up and downsides to always being connected, one of the downsides could be the concept of &quot;Disconnectivity Anxiety&quot; --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 16:42, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I think the idea of putting in the section of smart mobs is a really good idea! That way, like you said, we have linked in to other topics. Do you think it should be under it's own heading or a sub-heading of something else?

Hi. I've added some more information to the introduction, so that it has a bit more depth. However, I do not think that the introduction should be too long.

I just wanted to say, I was going to link one of my paragraphs to the page on Online Identity. I saw that someone had put in a link to Shirley Turkle's wiki page and like the idea it all being interlinked.

I think we should definitely include the section on disconnectivity anxiety, it's not something that was covered in the lectures so I think it would be a good thing to research and add.

Hi - that's my stuff about &quot;Being 'On': the different means of getting connected&quot; moved over to the main page too - edit it as you want! I'll have a go at trying to put the increasing number of references into alphabetical order so that our collective page is a bit closer to &quot;ready&quot; for Friday night.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:49, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey George... just saw your additions to the main page! Looking good! However, I was wondering if that should maybe be moved down under the other main topics. I'm just opening that point up for potential discussion as it's still relevant but I think the book should start off with more about &quot;Always On&quot; itself. Readers who don't know what &quot;Always On&quot; is might need more information up front. Thoughts everybody? [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 12:02, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Sorry, I'm just coming onto the discussion page after a break so I'm still getting caught up, forgive me! Another thought I had while looking at the page that we've talked about but haven't put up yet is the younger gen/workplace differences in an &quot;Always On&quot; culture. I know in our 4KR group disc page we talked about this... here's a [[User_talk:RedheadRachel|link]]! I was going to include that section and have some information but if someone else is already on top of it, I am willing to add my sources and findings to the pot!

Hey guys, I found a book by Naomi Baron called &quot;Always On: Language in an Online and Mobile World&quot; dont think this has been mentioned yet so do you guys think it would be a good idea to put her under key theorists??

I think it's a really good idea to put that in! I think the more outside sources we have and information that wasn't in the lecture, the better it will be.

Hey guys. I just wanted to let you know that I have put a link in one of my paragraphs which will direct you to the page on Online Identity.

Also, do you think that where I have put the &quot;Connected Young&quot; paragraph makes sense? Do you think it fits in there or do you think it should be elsewhere?

I was going to add stuff to the advantages of always on although i am finding it hard to find things to back up what I think tha advatages are. Are we allowed to write advantages with having quotes from books? I thought a couple of advantages would be like 1. The idea of being always on means we are connected to the world 24/7 which means as soon as anything happens we can find out about it and we live in a world where everyone needs information fast which would then lead on the a second point 2. Information is so fast and always so available that being always on saves us a lot of time having when retrieving information 3. Always having such powerful technology at our finger tips is such a huge step in the technology world that it should always be a tool to help us rather than to put us at a disadvantage as it was designed to improve our lives and keep us connected. These are just some rough idea I had, if anyone has any sources that would back up my ideas and if you think they are good ideas we could maybe work on them together and come up with a couple of paragraphs.

A lot of content has been added today, some of it is really solid.  I was going to suggest the link to online identity, as that makes more sense than doubling up on semi-relevant information here.  I'd say go ahead and add to the advantages of Always-On, as it feels rather bare without.  We can then try and find academic work to back it up, however if we can't find it we can scrap it later if need be.  I think we really need to be careful with not putting in information just for the sake of information.  There is a whole ton of description of ethernet cables and the like that has no place here and just cluttters up the page.  These could instead be replaced with links to information if need be, but either way, we need to cut out a lot of it.

Hi guys - re Rachel and Kelly's input re the order of 'Being On' etc. I agree and have moved this down to the bottom of the list and changed 'Being' to 'Always' (no idea why I didn't do that in the first place!).

I agree that we need to be careful that we aren't just posting information for the sake of it. Our book needs to be full but it also needs to be full of relevant information.

Wow, the amount of work done to the page since I looked at it last 9 hours ago, it's black and white! Such an improvement guys! The page has more flow and so much information! Just looking over the page, I was wondering if anyone had any creative editing tricks to break up some of the longer paragraphs. For example, &quot;Tethering&quot; and &quot;Part of the Network&quot; contain great information but appears as a big block of text that I was tempted to skim rather than read. I'm reaching out to you guys because I'm not sure that I am familiar enough with wikibooks to do it! Any clever ideas?

 [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]], I saw that you added some stuff to the draft I had on my user page, do you mind if I go ahead and start the bit for the workforce? I'll put it up and add what you've come up with! 
I'm also jumping in on this a bit late but I like adding Naomi Baron to the theorists list because I actually included quite a bit from her book in my draft and thought it was a good source!

I'll take a look at it! Some of the sources I've read include non-technological media as a problem in an &quot;Always On&quot; culture. I wouldn't take it down but I'll look and see what I can add/change! [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 22:02, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

If I'm being completely honest I do think it sounds a bit too opinionated! It is good though. I'll have a search for some relevant sources related to newspapers just now and I'll add to it if I find anything good.

First off, I'm eternally sorry for completely spacing on the fact that the pages themselves have a discussion section. Can very much understand if this has caused irritation when I've edited things without warning or explanation. Way to do the whole 'civility' thing, me... Anyway; something I'm thinking is that at points the information seems rather jumbled? For instance; in the 'tethering' section, the second paragraph seems to be out of place when considering that the third explains that we are 'tethered' to our devices, when the second sounds like that concept's already been explained. Not too much of a major issue, but would be nice to tidy up shop, I guess? --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 22:52, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

No it's totally alright! I had no idea until seminar that our page had its own discussion page. Here I had been doing everything on my user page. Oh well. Before i jump into my comment, I do agree that we just need a pair of eyes or two to comb through the book for clarity, consistency, and flow. I'll do a sweep once I put my paragraphs in. Anyone else? 

Also, I have a section that relates to the &quot;Connected Young&quot; section; however, the information I have doesn't really belong under the disadvantages heading. Does anyone object if we make Young/Workplace its own subheading? Some of the existing information in Connected Young isn't necessarily negatives. I don't deny that it does pose a problem that we can't keep some of the information in the disadvantages category but a good point of &quot;Always On&quot; is how it directly affects youth and those in the workplace. Thoughts? [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 23:29, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I think it would depend on how much information was there? Simply because there isn't all that much of the 'connected young' section so far in the disadvantages? Even if the last line doesn't sound too much like a negative? (Maybe that would be a better quote for elsewhere?
I added a section to the end of 'part of the network' from a case study I found about the rates of depression going up when people experience 'internet stress'.

Hey, was just thinking the page was pretty intimidating with the sheer amount of block text there is, so it'd be good to add some pictures to break things up, like we did on the blog assignments.

I'm not sure if the first paragraph under the &quot;tethering&quot; section is relevant to our chapter. What do you guys think? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 10:58, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Just noticed that we have still been using various forms of 'always on' and I think we need to pick a definite way to use it espcially since it's the title our chapter. Does anyone have any preferences for which way we write it?

I think we don't need the first paragraph in 'tethering' if we add it to the glossary (I know we have one on the 'tethered self' but maybe just put in what the term itself means?) As for the 'always on' bit, I too have been irked by this! The title of our chapter seems to suggest that 'always-on' is the best way to go? (with the dash and without capitalization.) --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 11:19, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, should we split the 'advantages' section into further subsections? simply because it's a wall of text right now whereas the disadvantages is all broken up. --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 11:23, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree with using 'always-on', should I go through and make the changes now or wait until tomorrow when people are done adding and altering content? I think it's a good idea to add that paragraph of &quot;tethering&quot; to the glossary because it seems unnecessary in the section. --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 11:26, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Can't hurt to start changing it into 'always-on' now. If people slip up later we can do it then as well. As for tethering, I'll copy and paste that to the glossary now. --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 11:30, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Okay, I'll start that now. Also, is there a reason for the quotations in the &quot;Part of 'The Network'&quot; section being italicized and separated from the rest of the text? This is the only section with this type of formatting. --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 11:31, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi everyone, just a couple of little things: There is a section &quot;Change in the Workforce&quot; under disadvantages of &quot;Always-on&quot; with no content under it. Is someone still to add there? Also, is there a reason for danah boyd's name to be capitalised for the link to her wiki page?

[[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 12:06, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I just added headings to the advantages section to break it up as was discussed here. Does everyone think it looks okay? Could I also maybe suggest having some titles underlined to make the page more readable? It seems to be just a collection of slightly different sized fonts and sometimes proves difficult to separate sections when reading. Regarding the term &quot;disinhibition&quot;, it is referred to as &quot;dis-inhibition&quot; on the main page as if someone has just corrected it to Google's spell checker, but did Greg not say it wasn't a word anyway? I'm sure it is referred to without the hyphen in the lecture notes. Should we change it? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 12:20, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

To whoever wrote the section on cognitive surplus, I added in a few bits and bobs about that and 'smart mobs'. It's a little bit head-scratching at first, the example of the Taliban mainly, but I thought it was relevant + an interesting perspective. Have a read and let me if I should change anything. Plus (in general) I added in a section about privacy, which I thought was very interesting if anyone wants to add to it.

Hi Rob, that would be me. I'm glad you added to it as it felt like it needed bulked up. Thanks very much, great stuff! Regarding the privacy section - I totally agree that this should be here. Someone mentions in the Intro and later on that this is perhaps the most important issue, yet not a lot has been written about it. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 16:23, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''ATTENTION ALWAYS ON CULTURE'''. I'm sure you guys are all over your topic. I just thought to pass on a link to an interesting video that discusses your thesis colloquially and could be useful for your group presentations. '''http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZwJq88cWKY''' Hope it is useful! Keep up the good work! Page is looking impressive!  [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 13:05, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks so much for passing that along! [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 14:31, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, I'm our page has so much content already that I don't necessarily need to add another new idea so, for now, I'm combing through the current page, looking for consistency and flow. Sound okay? I already fixed some of the &quot;always-on&quot; that we had previously missed. Also, can I take off your contrib records? Other pages don't include the contribs in the actual text. It will still be obvious for a person going to look for your work (i.e. Greg) via page history/user history. Does anyone have a problem with this? 
Point number two, I'm going to add to the change in the workforce section as I just found a new source! [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 14:31, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey Rachel, I understand the whole contribs thing, I thought I had edited them all out. It's hard to sift through all the content on the page but I'll use search and replace and do that just now. What way are we deciding to write &quot;always-on&quot; &lt;&lt;Like this for all sections? Is there anything we can afford to lose as we seem to have so much information which may not be entirely necessary and difficult to navigate. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 15:17, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I think to make the chapter flow better we should move &quot;'Always-On': The Different Means of Getting Connected&quot; and &quot;Participants in an &quot;always-on culture&quot; to be the first main concepts to introduce firstly who participates and how we can be &quot;always-on&quot;. It makes more sense to start here instead of going straight into &quot;Tethering&quot;. What does everyone think? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 16:34, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree with that move! And as to the 'always-on'... &lt;--- that's how we're doing it! 'always-on' culture if you need it all! [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 17:31, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Rob, in reference to you adding the section on privacy. I found a quote from danah boyd on privacy but ironically she's arguing that social media gives you more real life privacy. I wanted to add it but I'm not quite sure where to put it as her view is that it's an advantage of being always on. Any ideas? [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 17:47, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree with you Gemma. I think it would have a much nicer flow, which I think is super important. You don't want to read something that jumps all over the place! [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 17:55, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys, under the &quot;Toxic disinhibition,&quot; &quot;Origins of the Internet and its Legacy,&quot; &quot;Youth: Unplugged,&quot; &quot;Uplugged: The study,&quot; Tethered to the Workplace,&quot; &quot;Instant Information,&quot; &quot;Development of Different Skills,&quot; &quot;The Connected Young,&quot; and &quot;Marshall McLuhan&quot; sections there are either unclear or absent references that need to be changed from APA to match the rest of the references. If you worked on one of these sections then please change them or put the reference information here so that I can insert the reference.--[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 18:01, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey. I noticed that the paragraph on &quot;Youth: Unplugged&quot; section was the same as the one I already did on the Connected Young so I have joined the two paragraphs together and put it back under the &quot;Youth: Unplugged&quot; heading and deleted my previous paragraph. I hope this is okay with everyone. In regards to the referencing, I will add the ones I have put in under this section now. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:09, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Looking good, guys! Though anyone adding something for 'Blurring between virtual and reality' under danah boyd? Looks rather strange just sitting there on its own. --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 18:53, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I think it's all looking really good! Whoever thought about the pictures - great idea! It look much better being broken up a little. Anything else need tidying up? I'm going to have a quick read through it all now and see if anything needs doing. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 20:03, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

The newspaper section under convergence still needs some work. It seems slightly out of place and doesn't read like the rest of the book. I think it has to be done more in relation to always on rather than just a focus on the decline of the newspaper industry. [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 21:31, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm not sure how to add photos or edit them, but I noticed that the McLuhan one doesn't have a title like the others. If someone could change that please? [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 22:13, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Siobhan - I just added the caption. Wasn't sure how to do it before but I managed to work it out. Thanks for pointing that out. I've changed the layout now, if I've missed anything let me know. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 22:41, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

The referencing section is super bugging me right now. Would anyone object to having the two parts divided into 'references' and 'notes' like the [[Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/Chapter_2:_Online_Identity#Notes|online identity page]] has done? --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 10:36, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

The problem at this stage is that everyone is still trying to add new information or expand greater on points that have already been made, but in many places it just reads badly as it's too repetitive. I'd say what we need to do now is look closely at each set ion and try and make certain parts more concise and to the point. [[User:Cir00004|Cir00004]] ([[User talk:Cir00004|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cir00004|contribs]]) 11:36, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks Gemma! It was bugging me a little. And yeah, I'm just going through the page at the moment and seeing which bits need little edits and which points are repeating themselves or need a little expansion. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 12:17, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

We have disinhibition in both the main concepts and definitions section. Should it just be put into one so it isn't repeating things? I can try to work it together somehow. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 13:10, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

After finally figuring out how to do the number reference thing, I've changed all my citations! Sorry about that. Also, I have my afternoon free so I'm comfortable with going through the page and editing. I agree that our page is unnecessarily long and if you read it top to bottom, there is more than one repetitive paragraph. I can see what I can do about that if you guys want. [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 14:00, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that's a good idea because there does seem to be repetitive information. I will try to go through and edit as well. --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 14:24, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Does anyone think we should add more to cultural determinism? It's looking a bit thin. --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 14:57, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Just noticed that we have two disinhibition sections, should we combine the two or just get rid of one? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 15:38, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Haha.... just had that same thought I was going to post! I think we should combine them under main concepts... thoughts? [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 15:28, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

For a stronger book chapter, I think we should lead with the main concepts. By leading with the definitions, we are introducing too many ideas too fast. Also, I'm combining the two disinhibition sections because they say nearly the same thing. [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 15:37, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree. I think that definitions and glossary are too similar of sections to have. Definitely combine the disinhibition sections. We might have to do that with the two determinism sections as well. --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 15:38, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I wonder if we should move the definitions sections (that aren't repetitive) as their own subheading under main concepts and then we can lead the main concepts section with the most relevant ideas to 'always-on'. Online disinhibition and the like is important to our topic but it's not the most important. [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 15:41, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that's a good idea. How should we approach the determinism sections? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 15:45, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I'll look at those now. [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 15:49, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

== Referencing ==

FOOTNOTE HELP. Am I being silly or have I missed how to add in a footnote? Had a look around my text box but can't find. Thanks for your time [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:20, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Actually Just to bring it to everyone's attention we have two types of referencing going on... we will need to go through and just have one type... [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:30, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree, what type of reference should we stick with? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 17:49, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I am thinking APA seen as most of it is styled with it, just means we would have to find those who have done the few parts in foot notes to change? I think it would be more difficult to footnote as we would have to go through all the references and match them up to specific numbers [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:58, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

My only concern is that footnotes look more like a Wikibook to me and less like an essay. What are your thoughts on that? If we decide to go with footnotes, I can go through and format all of them --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 18:12, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that would be ok, just if someone would help you or go over it to make sure nothing is missed or anything. It does look more like other projects. would be good to get some other people's opinion on it too but I think it sounds good. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 18:29, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey thanks for pointing this out Hollie. Wiki only asks that we are consistent so that is what we should aim for. I must admit, I like Kelly's idea of making it more like a Wikibook and although many have gone for APA (us included) if Kelly is offering to format it the way she suggests then I say we go for it. I was going to ask the rest of my own team but this might take a while to get overall consensus based on how Wiki works (!) so why don't we just ask the nice Kelly to change it to a single consistent format - that way we will be in line with Wiki's standards - and if anyone has any energy left to change it to another consistent format then they can feel free to do it. How does that sound?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:52, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey! I agree with you all concerning APA as my group chose that for referencing and I think it is the style most people have used.  I personally like the idea of footnotes but I don't mind if we don't use them.  Like George says, consistency is key. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 20:12, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

The APA style that seems to be mostly used at the moment sounds good to me! It shoudn't be too different to change the ones that don't fit the style on Friday if need be. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 20:17, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

About to fix some of my referencing, so is the consensus no footnotes? [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 20:25, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Sounds good, Kelly go ahead if you are feeling up to it, if not we can just style it all to APA on Friday [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 20:34, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'll get on it tonight! --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 21:35, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Ugh, I hate editing conflicts. I'll try this again. I was just saying that I think we should avoid APA in-text citations if possible as it reads more like an essay, instead of a Wikibook/Wikipedia page. I clicked on a random WikiBook page and found this one which I like the citation style it uses: [[Natural and Cultural History of North-East Australia's Wet Tropical Forests]]. It appears clearer but in the interest of time, I'll keep citing using APA. If, on Friday, we have time, we can work to change it to a different style. Unless Kelly is up for it! I don't want to be pushy! Kelly.marvel is a star! [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 21:46, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Like a few of the others have said, I'm sure we'll be fine using any of the suggested referencing styles as long as we keep it consistent throughout. It may be an idea to sneak a peek at the other book chapters and see how the other groups are referencing. [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 21:53, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've already started changing the citations to keep them consistent. However, under the &quot;toxic dis-inhibition effect&quot; section, there is a reference to BBC 2011 but I cannot find any link matching the name and date. Could someone let me know what this is referencing? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 22:13, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Same goes for the ABC 2011 reference in that section--[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 22:15, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Under the 'Advantages' section, there are two references (Fred Stutzman, Carnegie Mellon) and (Laura B. Weiss, 2012) that are not referenced at the bottom --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 22:32, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

This may be a silly question but how do we go about changing the citations to match this when we add new content. I don't want to mess up all of your hard work! [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 22:51, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

In order to figure out how to reference, all you have to do is look at the book through edit mode. I would show you exactly what to type but then it comes up as a citation on here. You can look at this &lt;ref&gt; insert full citation &lt;/ref&gt; on the edit mode of the discussion page in order to see the formatting if that is easier. I hope that helps! If you're having diffucltly then let me know what section you're working on and I can insert the reference --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 10:34, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Thank you, that does help. I'll give it a go and I'll let you know if I do get stuck, thanks. [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 17:14, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that the idea of making it more like a wikibook by using footnotes is a great idea! I am going to attempt to put the references I have used into footnotes but I see that Kelly is offering help if anyone needs it, there is a strong possibility I may so thanks in advance!

Is the information we we have to have in the footnotes the same that is in the APA reference? Also, are the reference in bullet points the ones that have to be deleted after they have been made into footnotes? [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:18, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Okay, so I have put in the footnotes in the paragraphs I have done. I'm still unsure about whether the references in bullet points have to be deleted when they are turned into footnotes. I'm assuming that we do so I am just going to delete them from that list. I have all of the information in case I wasn't supposed to so I can put them back in.

== Link to your page? ==

Hey guys, I'm doing the section on Technological Imperative from the Tech Determinism page - basically this idea is that whatever developments we could make with technology, we will just because we can. This fits with y'alls work on inhibition; people will lose sense of whether they should do something online simply because they can push the limits. Would it be alright if I linked to y'alls page from this section? 

Thanks!

== Glossary ==

Just a wee thought, would be good if we could keep the glossary in alphabetical order? I will do it the now and if any one adds any more just put in in the correct way. Looks neater and easier to read especially if more is to be added. Happy editing [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 14:17, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Actually the glossary is a bit of a riot and needs some TLC, there are repeats and the layout is all different so I will go ahead and edit it to make it all consistent [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 14:24, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Are we also going to add a list of 'contributors' at the end of our page? I notice that other groups have done so. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 15:14, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Some of my group, including myself, put our names under the 'contributors' title on the main page.  But it may be a good idea to add it to this page as well.

;usage
Use this page as if a template, but put the call into main space mode by inserting a leading colon just like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
 {{:Trainz/Trainz Highest Ver}}&lt;/pre&gt;
Otherwise, without the lead colon, the call will be processed to template namespace.

Just use in-line in a sentence following the V- or V like this:
* The version number (or Trainz-build value), range from V-1.0 to V-3.7, and corresponds to requirements Trainz places on 3D asset data definitions&amp;mdash;and ''when found in an asset {{TR|R|Config.txt file|p=configuration file}}, tells the software suite the way they are to be processed. The older the version, the more translation steps to display the 3D models in the current latest versions. It's a clever system that has allowed Trainz route builders access to literally hundreds of thousands of assets to 
&lt;hr&gt;
*where the sentence part is formed literally as shown here:
 range from V-1.0 to V-&lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Trainz Highest Ver}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and corresponds to

[[Category:Trainz|$Highest]][[Category:Trainz Templates|$Highest]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
	The use of photo manipulation software is not new, but it is recently generating a great deal of controversy. While the public generally accepts that Photoshop will be used for retouching purposes (lighting, flyaway hair, skin imperfections, and such), videos going viral demonstrate the astonishing transformation a model’s pictures undergo between a photo shoot and publication. This transformation is rooted in altering models’ bodies, often to the point where the original model is almost unrecognizable in picture. Cindy Crawford was once quoted saying, “I wish that I looked like Cindy Crawford.”  The alterations to body image set unrealistic expectations about how a person should look. Is the use of photo editing software highlighting the best the model could look, or is it simply displaying an altered reality?
==In The News==
Target recently received significant backlash for mistakenly published pictures on their website. These pictures advertised bathing suits in their Juniors department, but had blatant Photoshop errors, including jagged edges under the girl’s arm, a chunk missing at the apex of the girl’s thighs, and impossibly lengthened arms. The error was called out online, and went viral. Much of the outrage around this controversy stems from the fact that these products are marketed to juniors, who look to the media to set expectations about the way they should look. If the digital artist had used the correct tools and taken more time to edit precisely, or if the image was corrected before being published, many would have never guessed the images were Photoshopped. The response was as harsh as it was towards Target because the errors made it obvious that the intention of the Photoshopping of the picture was to alter the shape of the model’s body. The idea of altering body image is offensive to many, primarily because of the links between self-consciousness resulting from media images and psychological disorders such as depression.
==False Advertising==
Beyond the psychological implications of photo manipulation in magazines, there are problems with maintaining integrity in advertisements. Despite general awareness that photos in magazines are Photoshopped, most often a reader of a magazine does not consciously register that the images displayed have been drastically altered, which can affect their perception of the images seen. One industry in which honesty is especially difficult to regulate is the beauty industry. The goal of an advertisement is primarily to entice the audience to purchase a product, but to what extent is it ethical to represent a beauty product with a manipulated image? In some cases, companies have crossed this line. For example, a L’Oreal advertisement depicting Julia Roberts was banned in the United Kingdom because the makeup was advertised to removed wrinkles and crow’s feet, but the company used photo manipulation to remove these features from the picture. This type of false advertising can mislead consumers. Deception in advertising can drive uninformed purchases. If Kelly Clarkson appears on the cover of a magazine promoting a diet and exercise regimen she claims worked for her, the readers would expect that her picture conveys the results of this regimen. If the readers knew her figure had been altered in the picture, they could adjust their expectations, putting less faith in a regimen which has not demonstrated its results fairly to the readers.

{{Trainz-stub|This is a planned topic, earmarked for future development}}
Trainz pre-compiled asset Libraries, *.JA files can be uploaded into the next generation Trainz in most cases, and with some limitations. In point of fact, cross loading assets sometimes runs afoul of a incompatibility of scripts in *.gs files when doing so, and correcting these issues can be vexing, as where what changed, and which asset needs which change to work with the newer more modern *.gs files is not always immediately obvious. It takes a little sleuthing and trial and error, advice seeking on the forums, and is just a bother when an older asset runs afoul of a new system.

To be continued from that start

This page contains all of the Topic 2 outcomes from the IB Biology HL syllabus. These outcomes are the same for students studying Biology Standard Level. Each heading number corresponds to the syllabus outcome reference number.

All outcomes with the command term ''state'' have been left without notes except where further detail is required.

= Topic 2: Cells =

== Cell theory ==

=== Outline the cell theory. ===


The cell theory states that: 

# All living organisms are composed of cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms. 
# Cells are the smallest unit of life. 
# Cells come from preexisting cells and cannot be created from non-living material.  
=== Discuss the evidence for the cell theory. ===


*When viewed under a microscope, all living organisms are made of cells
*Cells taken from tissues can survive for some time.
*Smaller parts cannot survive (i.e. carry out the functions of life)

Test to prove cells come from pre-existing cells:
#Take two containers and put food in both of these
#Sterilize both of the containers so that all living organisms are killed
#Leave one of the containers open and seal the other closed
#In the open container mold will start to grow; in the container that was sealed no mold will be present.
#In the open container, cells are able to enter the container from the external environment and start to divide and grow. The seal on the other container prevents entry of cells and so no mold will develop, proving that cells cannot arise from non-living material. 

=== State that unicellular organisms carry out all the functions of life. ===


=== Compare the relative sizes of molecules, cell membrane thickness, viruses, bacteria, organelles and cells, using the appropriate SI unit. ===
Remember:
*1 millimeter (mm) = 10-3 meters
*1 micrometer (μm) = 10-3 millimeters 
*1 nanometer (nm) = 10-3 micrometers

*A molecule = 1 nm
*Thickness of cell membrane = 10 nm
*Viruses = 100 nm
*Bacteria = 1μm
*Organelles = up to 10 μm
*Eukaryotic cells = up to 100 μm


=== Calculate the linear magnification of drawings and the actual size of specimens in images of known magnification. ===

#Take a measurement of the drawing (width or length).
#Take this same measurement (width or length) of the specimen.
#Remember to convert units if needed.
#Substitute your values into the equation below.

&lt;math&gt; Magnification = \frac {length\ of\ drawing} {length\ of\ actual\ specimen} &lt;/math&gt;

*Conversion of units:
*1 centimeter = 10-2 meters
*1 millimeter = 10-3 meters
*1 micrometer = 10-6 meters
*1 nanometer = 10-9 meters

=== Explain the importance of the surface area to volume ratio as a factor limiting cell size. ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Header text !! 1 cm cube !! 3 cm cube !! 4 cm cube
|-
| Surface Area || 6 &lt;math&gt; cm^2 &lt;/math&gt; || 54 &lt;math&gt; cm^2 &lt;/math&gt; || 96 &lt;math&gt; cm^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Volume || 1 &lt;math&gt; cm^3 &lt;/math&gt; || 27 &lt;math&gt; cm^3 &lt;/math&gt; || 64 &lt;math&gt; cm^3 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Ratio || 6:1 || 2:1 || 1.5:1
|}

*Surface area of the cell is used for nutrient intake, temperature regulation, and waste excretion
*If there is more volume, more nutrients needed and more waste excreted. Also more volume needs regulated temperature.
*Rate of exchange for these materials is proportional to surface area; larger surface area = faster exchange of materials/heat


=== State that multicellular organisms show emergent properties. ===

*Multicellular organisms show emergent properties.
For example:
**cells form tissues
**tissues form organs
**organs form organ systems
**organ systems form multicellular organisms.


=== Explain that cells in multicellular organisms differentiate to carry out specialized functions by expressing some of their genes but not others. ===

*Each cell contains each of the genes of the organism.
*Activation of these genes varies from cell to cell.
*These differences in gene activation result in different cell types that carry out different functions.
*This is because genes encode for proteins, and proteins are related to structure, and structure is related to function.
*Keratin gene would be active in cells present in hair follicles
*These differences allow the cells in multicellular organisms to be more efficient than unicellular organismal cells.

=== State that stem cells retain the capacity to divide and have the ability to differentiate along different pathways. ===


=== Outline one therapeutic use of stem cells. ===

#At birth, cord blood containing stem cells are harvested from the umbilical cord.
#Can be used when needed. In leukemia, where the bone marrow cells divide uncontrollably, the cancerous bone marrow may be removed.
#The patient can then be given a transfusion of their cord blood containing hematopoietic stem cells.
#The stem cells will differentiate and divide to become the type of blood cell needed in bone marrow.

== Prokaryotic Cells ==

=== Draw and label a diagram of the ultrastructure of Escherichia coli (E. coli) as an example of a prokaryote. ===

=== Annotate the diagram from 2.2.1 with the functions of each named structure. ===


*Cell wall:
**Protects the cell from the outside environment and maintains the shape of the cell.
**Prevents the cell from bursting if internal pressure rises.

*Plasma membrane: Semi-permeable membrane that controls the substances moving into and out of the cell through either active or passive transport.

*Cytoplasm:
**Contains many enzymes used to catalyze chemical reactions of metabolism.
**Contains the DNA in a region called the nucleoid.
**Ribosomes are also found in the cytoplasm.
**Mostly water.

*Pili:
**Help bacteria adhere to each other for the exchange of genetic material.


*Flagella (singular flagellum):
**Made of a protein called flagellin.
**Helps bacteria move around by the use of a motor protein that spins the flagellum like a propeller.

*Ribosomes:
**They are the site of protein synthesis.
**Contributes to protein synthesis by translating messenger RNA.

*Nucleoid:
**Region containing naked DNA which stores the hereditary material (genetic information) that controls the cell and will be passed on to daughter cells.


=== Identify structures from 2.2.1 in electron micrographs of E. coli. ===
=== State that prokaryotic cells divide by binary fission. ===

Binary = two
Fission = splitting
Binary fission = reproduction by splitting into two

== Eukaryotic Cells ==

=== Draw and label a diagram of the ultrastructure of a liver cell as an example of an animal cell. ===

=== Annotate the diagram from 2.3.1 with the functions of each named structure. ===


*Ribosomes:
**Site of protein synthesis as they translate messenger RNA to produce proteins.
**Either floating free in the cytoplasm or attached to the surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and in mitochondria and chloroplast.
**Rough endoplasmic reticulum: Modifies proteins to alter their function and/or destination. Synthesizes proteins to be excreted from the cell.

*Lysosome:
**Membranous structure containing many digestive enzymes to hydrolyze macromolecules such as proteins and lipids into monomers.

*Golgi apparatus:
**Receives proteins on the cis side from the rough endoplasmic reticulum and may further modify them.
**It also packages proteins before the protein is sent to its final (intracellular or extracellular) destination from the trans side.

*Mitochondrion:
**site of aerobic respiration.
**Converts chemical energy from macromolecules into ATP using oxygen.

*Nucleus:
**Contains the chromosomes and therefore the hereditary material.
**It is responsible for controlling the cell through gene expression
**Control of cell: DNA → RNA → Protein → Structure → Function

=== State three differences between plant and animal cells. ===

Feature
Animal
Plant
Cell wall
No cell wall, just plasma membrane.
Both cell wall and plasma membrane.
Chloroplasts
No chloroplasts because animal cells DO NOT photosynthesize.
Has chloroplasts for photosynthesis.
Polysaccharides
As glycogen for storage.
As starch for storage. Also uses cellulose for structure
Vacuoles
Do not usually contain vacuoles.
Plants always have a large fluid-filled vacuole.
Shape
Can change shape; usually rounded shape.
Fixed regular shape due to cell wall.

=== Outline two roles of extracellular components. ===
Plant cell wall
maintains plant cell shape
allows high internal pressure
high pressure prevents excessive water uptake by osmosis
high pressure (turgor pressure) supports the plant
Animal cell glycoproteins
makes up the basement layer, a gel matrix
supports single layers of thin cells (capillaries)
used in cell to cell adhesion

=== Draw and label a diagram to show the structure of membranes. ===
=== Explain how the hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of phospholipids help to maintain the structure of cell membranes. ===

Phospholipids have a hydrophobic fatty acid tail and a hydrophilic phosphate head.
Phospholipids form a double membrane in water with the hydrophilic head on the outside of the membrane, and the hydrophobic tails on the inside of the membrane.
This structure is found in cell membranes.
It is a fluid structure, and it is difficult to break, maintaining the structure of cell membranes.

=== List the functions of membrane proteins. ===
Hormone binding sites: allows one specific hormone to bind; once it binds, a signal is transmitted to the inside of the cell
Enzymes: enzymes in membranes catalyze reactions inside or outside the cell, depending on whether the active site is on the inside or outside of the cell
Electron carriers: arranged in chains so electrons can pass from one carrier to another; key in respiration and photosynthesis
Channels for passive transport: similar to a pore, allows larger molecules and polar molecules to pass through the membrane; each channel protein is specific to one substance


=== Define diffusion and osmosis. ===

Diffusion: the passive net movement of particles from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration, down the concentration gradient.
Osmosis: the passive movement of water from a region of low solute concentration to a region of high solute concentration, across a semi-permeable membrane


=== Explain passive transport across membranes by simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion. 
Membranes are semi-permeable; they allow certain molecules through but not others.
The molecules can enter/exit through passive transport, which requires no energy source other than a concentration gradient.
Molecules will go from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration (see 2.4.4).

*Simple diffusion
Some substances can diffuse through the phospholipid membrane.
Usually non-polar lipid-soluble molecules because membrane is hydrophobic (non-polar) inside
Water can enter and exit through osmosis (see 2.4.4)

*Facilitated diffusion
For substances unable to pass through the membrane (due to size, polarity, charge)
Channel proteins allow these substances to pass through
They are specific to one substance (e.g.: one type for glucose, one for Na+, etc)


=== Explain the role of protein pumps and ATP in active transport across membranes. ===
Active transport involves the movement of substances through the membrane using energy from ATP.
Advantage: substances can be moved against the concentration gradient
Cell membrane has protein pumps embedded it which are used in active transport to move substances across by using ATP.
Each protein pump only transports certain substances so the cell can control what comes in and what goes out.


=== Explain how vesicles are used to transport materials within a cell between the rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane. ===
After proteins have been synthesized by ribosomes they are transported to the rough endoplasmic reticulum where they can be modified. Vesicles carrying the protein then bud off the rough endoplasmic reticulum and are transported to the Golgi apparatus to be further modified. After this the vesicles carrying the protein bud off the Golgi apparatus and carry the protein to the plasma membrane. Here the vesicles fuse with the membrane expelling their content (the modified proteins) outside the cell. The membrane then goes back to its original state. This is a process called exocytosis. Endocytosis is a similar process which involves the pulling of the plasma membrane inwards so that the pinching off of a vesicle from the plasma membrane occurs and then this vesicle can carry its content anywhere in the cell.
=== Describe how the fluidity of the membrane allows it to change shape, break and re-form during endocytosis and exocytosis. ===
The phospholipids in the cell membrane are not solid but are in a fluid state allowing the membrane to change its shape and also vesicles to fuse with it. This means substances can enter the cell via endocytosis and exit the cell via exocytosis. The membrane then returns to its original state. In exocytosis the vesicles fuse with the membrane expelling their content outside the cell. The membrane then goes back to its original state. Endocytosis is a similar process which involves the pulling of the plasma membrane inwards so that a vesicle is pinched off it and then this vesicle can carry its content anywhere in the cell.
=== Outline the stages in the cell cycle, including interphase (G1, S, G2), mitosis and cytokinesis. ===
The first stage of cell division is interphase which is divided into 3 phases; G1, S and G2. The cell cycle starts with G1 (Gap phase 1) during which the cell grows larger. This is followed by phase S (synthesis) during which the genome is replicated. Finally, G2 (gap phase 2) is the second growth phase which separates the newly replicated genome and marks the end of interphase. 
The fourth stage is mitosis which is divided into prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. During mitosis the spindle fibers attach to the chromosomes and pull sister chromatids apart. This stage separates the two daughter genomes. Finally, cytokinesis is the last stage during which the cytoplasm divides to create two daughter cells. In animal cells the cell is pinched in two while plant cells form a plate between the dividing cells.
=== State that tumours (cancers) are the result of uncontrolled cell division and that these can occur in any organ or tissue. ===
=== State that interphase is an active period in the life of a cell when many metabolic reactions occur, including protein synthesis, DNA replication and an increase in the number of mitochondria and/or chloroplasts. ===
=== Describe the events that occur in the four phases of mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase). ===
Prophase:
the spindle microtubules grow and extend from each pole to the equator
chromosomes super coil and become short and bulky
nuclear envelope breaks down.
Metaphase:
chromatids move to the equator
spindle microtubules from each pole attach to each centromere (central part of chromosome) on opposite sides.
Anaphase:
spindle microtubules pull the sister chromatids apart splitting the centromeres, splitting the sister chromatids into chromosomes.
identical chromosome is pulled to opposite poles.
Telophase:
spindle microtubules break down
chromosomes uncoil and so are no longer individually visible
nuclear membrane reforms
cell divides by cytokinesis to form two daughter cells with identical genetic nuclei.


=== Explain how mitosis produces two genetically identical nuclei. ===
Mitosis is divided into four stages; prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. During prophase, the chromosomes become visible under a light microscope as they super coil and therefore they get shorter and more bulky. The nuclear envelope disintegrates and the spindle microtubules grow and extend from each pole to the equator. At metaphase the chromatids move to the equator. The sister chromatids are two DNA molecules formed by DNA replication and are therefore identical. These sister chromatids are then separated in anaphase as the spindle microtubules attaches to centromere and pulls the sister chromatids to opposite poles. As the sister chromatids separate they are called chromosomes. This means that each pole has the same chromosomes (same genetic material). Finally the microtubules break down, the chromosomes uncoil and the nuclear membrane reforms. The cell then divides into two daughter cells with genetically identical nuclei.

=== State that growth, embryonic development, tissue repair and asexual reproduction involve mitosis. ===</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Bronze Age ==

Before the Bronze Age, humans started to form the early steps to civilization. Most people lived in small tribes composed of multiple bands or lineages. Humans slowly started to abandon their nomadic lifestyles, and started creating permanent settlements. Most importantly, they started to develop crop farming and cultivation. The previous reliance on an essentially nomadic hunter-gatherer subsistence technique was increasingly replaced by a reliance upon the foods produced from cultivated lands. These developments lead to the growth of settlements, since the increased need to spend more time and labor in tending crop fields required more localized dwellings. This evolution of nomadic to agricultural life is known as the Neolithic Revolution, which was the lead in to the Bronze Age.

Writing emerged in many different cultures in the Bronze Age. Examples are the cuneiform writing of the Sumerians, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Cretan hieroglyphs, Chinese logographs, and the Olmec script of Mesoamerica. The Chinese script likely developed independently of the Middle Eastern scripts, around 1600 BC. The pre-Columbian Mesoamerican writing systems (including Olmec and Maya scripts) are also generally believed to have had independent origins. It is thought that the first true alphabetic writing was developed around 2000 BC for Semitic workers in the Sinai by giving mostly Egyptian hieratic glyphs Semitic values

Unquestionably, the Bronze Age can attest to the rise of the first civilizations. While the use of stone tools wasn't completely erased by the Bronze Age, their use was starting to be largely replaced by copper and bronze tools. The Bronze Age was the start of the heavy usage of metal and devolving trade routes, and many civilizations were linked by trade. Most of the early civilizations started around the banks of rivers. The soil surrounding rivers was moist and fertile, allowing crops to grow in areas that were arid and desert, like the Fertile Crescent of Mesopotamia, the Nile river valley of Egypt, and the Indus river valley in India. The small farming settlements of these rivers began to be able to grow a surplus of food from the excellent farming conditions. Now with out worry of trying to supply for just a small community, a surplus allowed more people to move in. As the number of inhabitants grew, they came to build cities, to create writing systems, to experiment in techniques for making pottery and using metals, to domesticate animals, and to develop complex social structures involving class systems. Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing. Cultures in Mesopotamia (cuneiform) and Egypt (hieroglyphs) developed the earliest viable writing systems. These early cultures will be our first stops in our tour of history, taking us to six of the earliest human civilizations, and others that also arose along the way.

== Ancient Near East ==

The ancient Near East was the home of early civilizations within a region roughly corresponding to the modern Middle East: Mesopotamia (modern Iraq, southeast Turkey, northeastern Syria and Kuwait), ancient Egypt, ancient Iran (Elam, Media, Parthia and Persia), Anatolia/Asia Minor (modern Turkey and Armenia), the Levant (modern Syria, Lebanon, Israel, State of Palestine and Jordan), Cyprus and the Arabian Peninsula. The ancient Near East is studied in the fields of Near Eastern archaeology and ancient history. It begins with the rise of Sumer in the 4th millennium BCE, though the date it ends varies: either covering the Bronze Age and the Iron Age in the region, until the conquest by the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC or Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE.

The ancient Near East is considered the cradle of civilization. It was the first to practice intensive year-round agriculture, it gave the rest of the world the first writing system, invented the potter's wheel and then the vehicular- and mill wheel, created the first centralized governments, law codes and empires, as well as introducing social stratification, slavery and organized warfare, and it laid the foundation for the fields of astronomy and mathematics.

== Mesopotamia ==
In the narrow sense, Mesopotamia is the area between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, north or northwest of the bottleneck at Baghdad, in modern Iraq; it is Al-Jazīrah (“The Island”) of the Arabs. South of this lies Babylonia, named after the city of Babylon. However, in the broader sense, the name Mesopotamia has come to be used for the area bounded on the northeast by the Zagros Mountains and on the southwest by the edge of the Arabian Plateau and stretching from the Persian Gulf in the southeast to the spurs of the Anti-Taurus Mountains in the northwest. Only from the latitude of Baghdad do the Euphrates and Tigris truly become twin rivers, the rāfidān of the Arabs, which have constantly changed their courses over the millennia. The low-lying plain of the Kārūn River in Persia has always been closely related to Mesopotamia, but it is not considered part of Mesopotamia as it forms its own river system.

Mesopotamia, south of Ar-Ramādī (about 70 miles, or 110 kilometres, west of Baghdad) on the Euphrates and the bend of the Tigris below Sāmarrāʾ (about 70 miles north-northwest of Baghdad), is flat alluvial land. Between Baghdad and the mouth of the Shaṭṭ al-ʿArab (the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates, where it empties into the Persian Gulf) there is a difference in height of only about 100 feet (30 meters). As a result of the slow flow of the water, there are heavy deposits of silt, and the riverbeds are raised. Consequently, the rivers often overflow their banks (and may even change their course) when they are not protected by high dikes. In recent times they have been regulated above Baghdad by the use of escape channels with overflow reservoirs. The extreme south is a region of extensive marshes and reed swamps, hawrs, which, probably since early times, have served as an area of refuge for oppressed and displaced peoples. The supply of water is not regular; as a result of the high average temperatures and a very low annual rainfall, the ground of the plain of latitude 35° N is hard and dry and unsuitable for plant cultivation for at least eight months in the year. Consequently, agriculture without risk of crop failure, which seems to have begun in the higher rainfall zones and in the hilly borders of Mesopotamia in the 10th millennium BCE, began in Mesopotamia itself, the real heart of the civilization, only after artificial irrigation had been invented, bringing water to large stretches of territory through a widely branching network of canals. Since the ground is extremely fertile and, with irrigation and the necessary drainage, will produce in abundance, southern Mesopotamia became a land of plenty that could support a considerable population. The cultural superiority of north Mesopotamia, which may have lasted until about 4000 BCE, was finally overtaken by the south when the people there had responded to the challenge of their situation.

The present climatic conditions are fairly similar to those of 8,000 years ago. An English survey of ruined settlements in the area 30 miles around ancient Hatra (180 miles northwest of Baghdad) has shown that the southern limits of the zone in which agriculture is possible without artificial irrigation has remained unchanged since the first settlement of Al-Jazīrah.

The availability of raw materials is a historical factor of great importance, as is the dependence on those materials that had to be imported. In Mesopotamia, agricultural products and those from stock breeding, fisheries, date palm cultivation, and reed industries—in short, grain, vegetables, meat, leather, wool, horn, fish, dates, and reed and plant-fiber products—were available in plenty and could easily be produced in excess of home requirements to be exported. There are bitumen springs at Hīt (90 miles northwest of Baghdad) on the Euphrates (the Is of Herodotus). On the other hand, wood, stone, and metal were rare or even entirely absent. The date palm—virtually the national tree of Iraq—yields a wood suitable only for rough beams and not for finer work. Stone is mostly lacking in southern Mesopotamia, although limestone is quarried in the desert about 35 miles to the west and “Mosul marble” is found not far from the Tigris in its middle reaches. Metal can only be obtained in the mountains, and the same is true of precious and semiprecious stones. Consequently, southern Mesopotamia in particular was destined to be a land of trade from the start. Only rarely could “empires” extending over a wider area guarantee themselves imports by plundering or by subjecting neighboring regions.

The raw material that epitomizes Mesopotamian civilization is clay: in the almost exclusively mud-brick architecture and in the number and variety of clay figurines and pottery artifacts, Mesopotamia bears the stamp of clay as does no other civilization, and nowhere in the world but in Mesopotamia and the regions over which its influence was diffused was clay used as the vehicle for writing. Such phrases as cuneiform civilization, cuneiform literature, and cuneiform law can apply only where people had had the idea of using soft clay not only for bricks and jars and for the jar stoppers on which a seal could be impressed as a mark of ownership but also as the vehicle for impressed signs to which established meanings were assigned—an intellectual achievement that amounted to nothing less than the invention of writing.

Mesopotamia has had several cultures and civilizations take up its company through out its history, starting with Sumer. Along the way, some of the first empires arose, and Mesopotamia soon became one of the biggest centers of population in the Bronze Age.

== Sumer ==
No people has contributed more to the culture of mankind than the Sumerians. And yet, it is only comparatively recently that we have built up a knowledge of the existence of this ancient culture. Sumer was a civilization in  southern Mesopotamia that was most likely permanently settled between 5500 and 4000 BCE by non-Semitic people who could have spoke the Sumerian language. Like many early civilizations, Sumer was founded by agriculture on the banks of rivers, Euphrates and Tigris. Creating and maintaining irrigation canals for the frequent flooded rivers demanded a high amount of psychical labor. These intensive agriculture practices also demanded themselves a concentrated area of population in order to remain effective. A food supply is needed in order for a population to remain stable, which could have gave rise to permanent year-round urban settlement in the area of Sumer. However, much of Sumers' history has been lost forever to the sands of time. Only around 2500 BCE did a logographic system of writing come about, and only a handful of the clay tablets used to record said data have survived. For Sumerians, the clay writing tablets would quickly out live their usefulness after being sun hardened, as no more information could be written on them. Not worried about preservation of minor records, many clay writing tablets were used as scrap, thrown in with other scrap bits of clay and mud brick, and used as foundation leveling for buildings. In doing so, the passage of history has forever trapped the knowledge of the Sumerians in the realm of the unknown.

=== Life and Culture of Sumer ===

In the early Sumerian period, the primitive pictograms suggest that pottery was very plentiful, and the forms of the vases, bowls and dishes were manifold; there were special jars for honey, butter, oil and wine, which was probably made from dates, and one form of vase had a spout protruding from its side. Some of the vases had pointed feet, and stood on stands with crossed legs; others were flat-bottomed, and were set on square or rectangular frames of wood. The oil-jars - and probably others also - were sealed with clay, precisely as in early Egypt. Vases and dishes of stone were made in imitation of those of clay, and baskets were woven of reeds or formed of leather. A feathered head-dress was worn on the head. Beds, stools and chairs were used, with carved legs resembling those of an ox. There were fire-places and fire-altars, and apparently chimneys also. Knives, drills, wedges and an instrument which looks like a saw were all known, while spears, bows, arrows and daggers (but not swords) were employed in war. Tablets were used for writing purposes, and copper, gold and silver were worked by the smith. Daggers with metal blades and wooden handles were worn, and copper was hammered into plates, while necklaces or collars were made of gold. And, finally, time was reckoned in lunar months. 


There is considerable evidence that the Sumerians loved music, which seems to have been an important part of religious and civic life in Sumer. Instruments of Ancient Mesopotamia include harps, lyres, lutes, reed pipes, and drums. Many of these were shared with neighbouring cultures. The vocal tone or timbre was probably similar to the pungently nasal sound of the narrow-bore reed pipes, and most likely shared the contemporary &quot;typically&quot; Asian vocal quality and techniques, including little dynamic changes and more graces, shakes, mordents, glides and microtonal inflections. Singers probably expressed intense and withdrawn emotion, as if listening to themselves, as shown by the practice of cupping a hand to the ear (as is still current in modern Assyrian music and many Arab and folk musics). 


Though women were protected by late Sumerian law and were able to achieve a higher status in Sumer than in other contemporary civilizations, the culture was male-dominated. The Code of Ur-Nammu, the oldest such codification yet discovered, dating to the Ur-III &quot;Sumerian Renaissance&quot;, reveals a glimpse at societal structure in late Sumerian law. Beneath the lu-gal (&quot;great man&quot; or king), all members of society belonged to one of two basic strata: The &quot;lu&quot; or free person, and the slave (male, arad; female geme). The son of a lu was called a dumu-nita until he married. A woman (munus) went from being a daughter (dumu-mi), to a wife (dam), then if she outlived her husband, a widow (numasu) and she could then remarry.


Sumerian was the language of ancient Sumer. Sumerian is an agglutinative language, meaning that words could consist of a chain of more or less clearly distinguishable and separable affixes and/or morphemes.

Sumerian is a split ergative language. It behaves as a nominative–accusative language in the 1st and 2nd person of present-future tense/incompletive aspect (AKA marû-conjugation), but as ergative–absolutive in most other forms of the indicative mood. Similar patterns are found in a large number of unrelated split ergative languages (see more examples at split ergativity). In Sumerian the ergative case is marked by the suffix -e and the absolutive case (as in most ergative languages) by no suffix at all (the so-called &quot;zero suffix&quot;). Example of the ergative pattern: lugal-e e2 mu-un-du3 &quot;the king built the house&quot;; lugal ba-ĝen &quot;the king went&quot; (the transitive subject is expressed differently from the intransitive subject, as it takes the suffix -e). Example of the nominative–accusative pattern: i3-du-un (&lt; *i3-du-en) &quot;I go (away)&quot;; e2 ib2-du3-un (&lt; *ib2-du3-en) &quot;I build the house&quot; (the transitive subject is expressed in the same way as the intransitive subject, as both verbs take the same 1st person singular suffix -en).

Sumerian distinguishes the grammatical genders human/non-human (personal/impersonal), but it does not have separate male/female gender pronouns. The human gender includes not only humans but also gods and in some cases the word for &quot;statue&quot;. Sumerian has also been claimed to have two tenses (past and present-future), but these are currently described as completive and incompletive or perfective and imperfective aspects instead. There are a large number of cases: absolutive (-Ø), ergative (-e), genitive (-(a)k), dative/allative (&quot;to, for&quot;) (-r(a) for human nouns, -e for non-human nouns), locative (&quot;in, at&quot;) (-a, only with non-human nouns), comitative (-da), equative (&quot;as, like&quot;) (-gin), directive/adverbial (&quot;towards&quot;) (-š(e)), ablative (&quot;from&quot;) (-ta, only with non-human nouns). The naming and number of the cases varies in the scientific literature.

Another characteristic feature of Sumerian is the large number of homophones (words with the same sound structure but different meanings), which are perhaps pseudo-homophones, as there might have been differences in pronunciation such as tone or some phonemic distinctions that are unknown. The different homophones (or, more precisely, the different cuneiform signs that denote them) are marked with different numbers by convention, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; being often replaced by acute accent and grave accent diacritics respectively. For example: du = &quot;go&quot;, du3 = dù = &quot;build&quot;.


Cuneiform script is one of the earliest known systems of writing, distinguished by its wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, made by means of a blunt reed for a stylus. The name cuneiform itself simply means &quot;wedge shaped&quot;, from the Latin cuneus &quot;wedge&quot; and forma &quot;shape,&quot; and came into English usage &quot;probably from Old French cunéiforme.&quot; 


Sumerians believed in an anthropomorphic polytheism, or the belief in many gods in human form. There was no common set of gods; each city-state had its own patrons, temples, and priest-kings, however they were not exclusive. The gods of one city were often acknowledged elsewhere. Sumerian speakers were among the earliest people to record their beliefs in writing, and were a major inspiration later Mesopotamian mythology, religion, and astrology. These deities formed a core pantheon; there were additionally hundreds of minor ones. Sumerian gods could thus have associations with different cities, and their religious importance often waxed and waned with those cities' political power. The gods were said to have created human beings from clay for the purpose of serving them. The temples organized the mass labor projects needed for irrigation agriculture. Citizens had a labor duty to the temple, though they could avoid it by a payment of silver.


Sumerians believed that the universe consisted of a flat disk enclosed by a dome. The Sumerian afterlife involved a descent into a gloomy netherworld to spend eternity in a wretched existence as a Gidim (ghost).

The universe was divided into four quarters.

        To the north were the hill-dwelling Subartu who were periodically raided for slaves, timber, and raw materials.
        To the west were the tent-dwelling Martu, Semitic people living as pastoral nomads tending herds of sheep and goats.
        To the south was the land of Dilmun, a trading state associated with the land of the dead and the place of creation.
        To the east were the Elamites, a rival people with whom the Sumerians were frequently at war.

Their known world extended from The Upper Sea or Mediterranean coastline, to The Lower Sea, the Persian Gulf and the land of Meluhha (probably the Indus Valley) and Magan (Oman), famed for its copper ores.


Ziggurats (Sumerian temples) each had an individual name and consisted of a forecourt, with a central pond for purification.[37] The temple itself had a central nave with aisles along either side. Flanking the aisles would be rooms for the priests. At one end would stand the podium and a mudbrick table for animal and vegetable sacrifices. Granaries and storehouses were usually located near the temples. After a time the Sumerians began to place the temples on top of multi-layered square constructions built as a series of rising terraces, giving rise to the Ziggurat style.


It was believed that when people died, they would be confined to a gloomy world of Ereshkigal, whose realm was guarded by gateways with various monsters designed to prevent people entering or leaving. The dead were buried outside the city walls in graveyards where a small mound covered the corpse, along with offerings to monsters and a small amount of food. Human sacrifice was found in the death pits at the Ur royal cemetery where Queen Puabi was accompanied in death by her servants. It is also said that the Sumerians invented the first oboe-like instrument, and used them at royal funerals.


The Sumerians adopted an agricultural mode of life as by perhaps as early as c. 5000 - 4500 BCE the region demonstrated a number of core agricultural techniques, including organized irrigation, large-scale intensive cultivation of land, mono-cropping involving the use of plough agriculture, and the use of an agricultural specialized labour force under bureaucratic control. The necessity to manage temple accounts with this organization led to the development of writing. 

Sumerian agriculture depended heavily on irrigation. The irrigation was accomplished by the use of shaduf, canals, channels, dykes, weirs, and reservoirs. The frequent violent floods of the Tigris, and less so, of the Euphrates, meant that canals required frequent repair and continual removal of silt, and survey markers and boundary stones needed to be continually replaced. The government required individuals to work on the canals in a corvee, although the rich were able to exempt themselves.

The Sumerian Farmer's Almanac,  dated to around 1700 to 1500 BCE, is a cuneiform clay tablet  made by a farmer for his son. The document has prime importance in the history of agriculture and its techniques. The document consists of a series of instructions for the purpose of guiding one throughout their yearly agricultural activities. 

The instructions start with the flooding of the fields in the spring and ending with the cleaning and winnowing of the freshly harvested crops. The Sumer's soil was parched so irrigation was important. The almanac instructions began with advice concerning putting water into the fields and caring for the ground. The farmer was instructed to have his help prepare in advance all the necessary farming implements and tools. The farmer was instructed to make sure that he had an extra ox for the plow. The instructions were that before plowing, the farmer should have the ground broken up twice by the mattock and once by the hoe. The hammer was to be used to pulverize the clods. The farmer was instructioned to make sure he had a good manager to control the laborers to make sure they didn’t slough off.

The instructions from the Sumerian Farmer's Almanac were for the farmer to plow eight furrows to each strip of land, which was approximately 20 feet long. Plowing and sowing was carried on simultaneously. It was done with a seeder. A plow was used that had an attachment that carried the seed. A container dropped the seed through a narrow funnel down to even depths of just plowed furrows. The depth was to be that of the width of two fingers and if not the plow was to be adjusted to make it come out this way.

The furrows that had been plowed straight this year were to be plowed diagonal the next year and vice versa. The almanac gives instructions for the farmer to pray to Ninkilim, the goddess of field mice and vermin. This was so the pests would not harm the grain when it would start growing. There were special instructions on when to water the growing grain. There were three different watering times. If the farmer spotted reddening of the wet grain it was the dreaded samana-disease that endangered the crops. If the crop came out of this, then there was to be a fourth watering which usually yielded an extra ten percent.

When the farmer was to harvest the barley, he was not to wait, but was to harvest just at the right moment. This was when the barley stood tall and did not bend over under its own weight. Three men were to do the harvesting as a team using a reaper and a binder. The threshing was done by means of a sledge for a period of five days. This was a device drawn back and forth over the heaped-up grain stalks. The barley was then &quot;opened&quot; with an &quot;opener&quot;. A team of oxen drove this primitive machine to crush the barley-(sheaves). The barley, kernels and sheaves, were then winnowed-(of the sheaves) with pitchforks and laid on sticks to make clean.

The writer of the Sumerian Farmer's Almanac said that the agricultural instructions were not his, however those of the god Ninurta, the son and &quot;true farmer&quot; of the leading Sumerian deity, Enlil.



No architectural profession existed in Mesopotamia; however, scribes drafted and managed construction for the government, nobility, or royalty. The Mesopotamians regarded 'the craft of building' as a divine gift taught to men by the gods. The Tigris-Euphrates plain lacked minerals and trees. Sumerian structures were made of plano-convex mudbrick, not fixed with mortar or cement. Mud-brick buildings eventually deteriorate, so they were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. This constant rebuilding gradually raised the level of cities, which thus came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resultant hills, known as tells, are found throughout the ancient Near East. 

The Sumerians were the first society to create the city itself as a built form. They were proud of this achievement as attested in the Epic of Gilgamesh which opens with a description of Uruk, its walls, streets, markets, temples, and gardens. Uruk itself is significant as the center of an urban culture which both colonized and urbanized western Asia.

The construction of cities was the end product of trends which began in the Neolithic Revolution. The growth of the city was partly planned and partly organic. Planning is evident in the walls, high temple district, main canal with harbor, and main street. The finer structure of residential and commercial spaces is the reaction of economic forces to the spatial limits imposed by the planned areas resulting in an irregular design with regular features. Because the Sumerians recorded real estate transactions it is possible to reconstruct much of the urban growth pattern, density, property value, and other metrics from cuneiform text sources .

The typical city divided space into residential, mixed use, commercial, and civic spaces. The residential areas were grouped by profession. At the core of the city was a high temple complex always sited slightly off of the geographical center. This high temple usually predated the founding of the city and was the nucleus around which the urban form grew. The districts adjacent to gates had a special religious and economic function .

The city always included a belt of irrigated agricultural land including small hamlets. A network of roads and canals connected the city to this land. The transportation network was organized in three tiers: wide processional streets, public through street, and private blind alleys. The public streets that defined a block varied little over time while the blind-alleys were much more fluid. The current estimate is 10% of the city area was streets and 90% buildings. The canals; however, were more important than roads for transportation.

The materials used to build a Mesopotamian house were the same as those used today: mud brick, mud plaster and wooden doors, which were all naturally available around the city, although wood could not be naturally made very well during the particular time period described. Most houses had a square center room with other rooms attached to it, but a great variation in the size and materials used to build the houses suggest they were built by the inhabitants themselves. The smallest rooms may not have coincided with the poorest people; in fact, it could be that the poorest people built houses out of perishable materials such as reeds on the outside of the city, but there is very little direct evidence for this.


The Sumerians developed a complex system of metrology c. 4000 BCE. This metrology advanced resulting in the creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From c. 2600 BCE onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.  The period c. 2700 – 2300 BCE saw the first appearance of the abacus, and a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system. The Sumerians were the first to use a place value numeral system. There is also anecdotal evidence the Sumerians may have used a type of slide rule in astronomical calculations. They were the first to find the area of a triangle and the volume of a cube.


Discoveries of obsidian from far-away locations in Anatolia and lapis lazuli from Badakhshan in northeastern Afghanistan, beads from Dilmun (modern Bahrain), and several seals inscribed with the Indus Valley script suggest a remarkably wide-ranging network of ancient trade centered around the Persian Gulf. The Epic of Gilgamesh refers to trade with far lands for goods such as wood that were scarce in Mesopotamia. In particular, cedar from Lebanon was prized. The finding of resin in the tomb of Queen Puabi at Ur, indicates it was traded from as far away as Mozambique. The Sumerians used slaves, although they were not a major part of the economy. Slave women worked as weavers, pressers, millers, and porters. Sumerian potters decorated pots with cedar oil paints. The potters used a bow drill to produce the fire needed for baking the pottery. Sumerian masons and jewelers knew and made use of alabaster (calcite), ivory, iron, gold, silver, carnelian, and lapis lazuli.


The almost constant wars among the Sumerian city-states for 2000 years helped to develop the military technology and techniques of Sumer to a high level. The first war recorded in any detail was between Lagash and Umma in 2525 BCE on a stele called the Stele of the Vultures. It shows the king of Lagash leading a Sumerian army consisting mostly of infantry. The infantrymen carried spears, wore copper helmets and carried leather or wicker shields. The spearmen are shown arranged in what resembles the phalanx formation, which requires training and discipline; this implies that the Sumerians may have made use of professional soldiers.

The Sumerian military used carts harnessed to onagers. These early chariots functioned less effectively in combat than did later designs, and some have suggested that these chariots served primarily as transports, though the crew carried battle-axes and lances. The Sumerian chariot comprised a four or two-wheeled device manned by a crew of two and harnessed to four onagers. The cart was composed of a woven basket and the wheels had a solid three-piece design.

Sumerian cities were surrounded by defensive walls. The Sumerians engaged in siege warfare between their cities, but the mudbrick walls were able to deter some foes.


Examples of Sumerian technology include: the wheel, cuneiform, arithmetic and geometry, irrigation systems, Sumerian boats, lunisolar calendar, bronze, leather, saws, chisels, hammers, braces, bits, nails, pins, rings, hoes, axes, knives, lancepoints, arrowheads, swords, glue, daggers, waterskins, bags, harnesses, armor, quivers, war chariots, scabbards, boots, sandals, harpoons and beer. 


=== Early Sumerian History ===

By the late 4th millennium BCE, Sumer was divided into about a dozen independent city-states, which were divided by canals and boundary stones. Each was centered on a temple dedicated to the particular patron god or goddess of the city and ruled over by a priestly governor (ensi) or by a king (lugal) who was intimately tied to the city's religious rites.

The Sumerian king list is an ancient text in the Sumerian language listing kings of Sumer, including a few foreign dynasties. Some of the earlier dynasties may be mythical; the historical record does not open up before the first archaeologically attested ruler, Enmebaragesi (ca. 2600 BCE), while conjectures and interpretations of archaeological evidence can vary for earlier events. The best-known dynasty, that of Lagash, is omitted from the kinglist.


According to the Sumerian kinglist, Eridu was the first city in the World. The opening line reads,

            &quot;[nam]-lugal an-ta èd-dè-a-ba
            [eri]duki nam-lugal-la&quot;

            &quot;When kingship from heaven was lowered,
            the kingship was in Eridu.&quot;

Eridu (present day Abu Shahrein, Iraq) was considered the first city in the world by the Sumerians and, certainly, is one of the earliest recorded cities. Eridu was founded around 5400 BCE, and was believed by the Sumerians to have been created directly by the gods, as stated above in the kinglist. The future city-states of Mesopotamia looked back on Eridu as a golden-age metropolis. The city of Eridu features prominently in Sumerian mythology, not only as the first city and home of the gods, but as the locale to which the great goddess Innana traveled in order to receive the gifts of civilization which she then bestowed upon humanity from her home city of Uruk. The Eridu Genesis (composed c. 2300 BCE) is the earliest description of the Great Flood, pre-dating the biblical book of Genesis, and is the tale of the good man Utnapishtim (also known as Atrahasis or Ziusudra) who builds a great boat by the will of the gods and gathers inside 'the seed of life'. The Eridu Genesis may have been the first written record of a long oral tradition of a time around 2800 BCE when the Euphrates rose high above her banks and flooded the region.

The city was an important center for trade as well as religion and, at its height, was a great 'melting pot’ of cultures and diversity, as evidenced in the various forms of artistry found among the ruins. Eridu was abandoned intermittently over the years for reasons which remain unclear and, finally, left behind completely sometime around the year 600 BCE. The great Ziggurat of Amar-Sin in the center of the city has been associated with the Biblical Tower of Babel from The Book of Genesis and the city itself with the Biblical city of Babel. This association springs from archaeological discoveries (the claim that the Ziggurat of Amar-Sin more closely resembles the description of the Biblical Tower) and a reading of the Babylonian historian Berossus (c. 200 BCE) who seems to be clearly referring to Eridu when he writes of 'Babylon’. Today the ruins of Eridu are largely wind-swept sand dunes, and little remains to remind a visitor of the once mighty city which was founded by the gods.

After a flood occurred in Sumer, kingship is said to have resumed at Kish. The earliest Dynastic name on the list known from other legendary sources is Etana, whom it calls &quot;the shepherd, who ascended to heaven and consolidated all the foreign countries&quot;. Etana is estimated to have lived around 3000 BCE. Among the 11 kings who followed, a number of Semitic Akkadian names are recorded, suggesting that these people made up a sizable proportion of the population of this northern city. Afterwards, although its military and economic power was diminished, Kish retained a strong political and symbolic significance. Just as with Nippur to the south, control of Kish was a prime element in legitimizing dominance over the north of Mesopotamia (Assyria, Subartu). Because of the city's symbolic value, strong rulers later claimed the traditional title &quot;King of Kish&quot;, even if they were from Akkad, Ur, Assyria, Isin, Larsa or Babylon. One of the earliest to adopt this title upon subjecting Kish to his empire was King Mesannepada of Ur. A few governors of Kish for other powers in later times are also known. Kish continued to be occupied through the pre-Babylonian, old Babylonian, Kassite, and Neo-Assyrian Empire and Neo-Babylonian periods, and into classical Seleucid times, before being abandoned.

The dynasty of Lagash, though omitted from the king list, is well attested through several important monuments and many archaeological finds.

Although short-lived, one of the first empires known to history was that of Eannatum of Lagash, who annexed practically all of Sumer, including Kish, Uruk, Ur, and Larsa, and reduced to tribute the city-state of Umma, arch-rival of Lagash. In addition, his realm extended to parts of Elam and along the Persian Gulf. He seems to have used terror as a matter of policy—his Stele of the Vultures has been found, showing violent treatment of enemies. His empire collapsed shortly after his death. He is notable for the policy of having deliberately introduced the use of &quot;terror&quot; as a weapon against his enemies.

=== The Akkadian Empire ===

The Akkadian Empire was a Semitic empire centered in the city Akkad and its surrounding region in Mesopotamia which united all the indigenous Akkadian speaking Semites and the Sumerian speakers under one rule within a multilingual empire. During the 3rd millennium BCE, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Semitic Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism. Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennia BCE (the exact dating being a matter of debate). The precise location of Akkad had been lost to the sands of time. Its possible it was in the area of Sumer, but possible other locations lay along, or east of the Tigris.

=== Life and Culture of the Akkadian Empire ===

The population of Akkad, like nearly all pre-modern states, was entirely dependent upon the agricultural systems of the region, which seem to have had two principal centers: the irrigated farmlands of southern Iraq that traditionally had a yield of 30 grains returned for each grain sown and the rain-fed agriculture of northern Iraq, known as the &quot;Upper Country.&quot;

Southern Iraq during Akkadian period seems to have been approaching its modern rainfall level of less than 20 mm (1 in) per year, with the result that agriculture was totally dependent upon irrigation. Before the Akkadian period the progressive salinisation of the soils, produced by poorly drained irrigation, had been reducing yields of wheat in the southern part of the country, leading to the conversion to more salt-tolerant barley growing. Urban populations there had peaked already by 2,600 BCE, and ecological pressures were high, contributing to the rise of militarism apparent immediately before the Akkadian period (as seen in the Stele of the Vultures of Eannatum). Warfare between city states had led to a population decline, from which Akkad provided a temporary respite. It was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this time, giving Akkad its military advantage.

The water table in this region was very high and replenished regularly—by winter storms in the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates from October to March and from snow-melt from March to July. Flood levels, that had been stable from about 3,000 to 2,600 BCE, had started falling, and by the Akkadian period were a half-meter to a meter lower than recorded previously. Even so, the flat country and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than in the case of the Nile; serious deluges seem to have been a regular occurrence, requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems. Farmers were recruited into regiments for this work from August to October—a period of food shortage—under the control of city temple authorities, thus acting as a form of unemployment relief. 


The Akkadian government formed a &quot;classical standard&quot; with which all future Mesopotamian states compared themselves. Traditionally, the ensi was the highest functionary of the Sumerian city-states. In later traditions, one became an ensi by marrying the goddess Inanna, legitimising the rulership through divine consent.

Initially, the monarchical lugal was subordinate to the priestly ensi, and was appointed at times of troubles, but by later dynastic times, it was the lugal who had emerged as the preeminent role, having his own &quot;é&quot; or &quot;palace&quot;, independent from the temple establishment. By the time of Mesalim, whichever dynasty controlled the city of Kish was recognized as šar kiššati, and was considered preeminent in Sumer, possibly because this was where the two rivers approached, and whoever controlled Kish ultimately controlled the irrigation systems of the other cities downstream.

As Sargon extended his conquest from the &quot;Lower Sea&quot; (Persian Gulf), to the &quot;Upper Sea&quot; (Mediterranean), it was felt that he ruled &quot;the totality of the lands under heaven&quot;, or &quot;from sunrise to sunset&quot;, as contemporary texts put it. Under Sargon, the ensis generally retained their positions, but were seen more as provincial governors. The title šar kiššati became recognized as meaning &quot;lord of the universe&quot;. Sargon is even recorded as having organized naval expeditions to Dilmun (Bahrein) and Magan, amongst the first organized military naval expeditions in history. Whether he also did in the case of the Mediterranean with the kingdom of Kaptara (possibly Cyprus), as claimed in later documents, is more questionable.

With Naram-Sin, Sargon's grandson, this went further than with Sargon, with the king not only being called &quot;Lord of the Four Quarters (of the Earth)&quot;, but also elevated to the ranks of the dingir, with his own temple establishment. Previously a ruler could, like Gilgamesh, become divine after death but the Akkadian kings, from Naram-Sin onward, were considered gods on earth in their lifetimes. Their portraits showed them of larger size than mere mortals and at some distance from their retainers.

One strategy adopted by both Sargon and Naram-Sin, to maintain control of the country, was to install their daughters, Enheduanna and Emmenanna respectively, as high priestess to Sin, the Akkadian version of the Sumerian moon deity, Nanna, at Ur, in the extreme south of Sumer; to install sons as provincial ensi governors in strategic locations; and to marry their daughters to rulers of peripheral parts of the Empire (Urkesh and Marhashe). A well documented case of the latter is that of Naram-Sin's daughter Tar'am-Agade at Urkesh.


During the 3rd millennium BCE, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism. The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a sprachbund. Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BCE (the exact dating being a matter of debate), but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century CE. 


Sumerian literature continued in rich development during the Akkadian period (a notable example being Enheduanna). Enheduanna, the &quot;wife of Nanna [the Sumerian moon god] and daughter of Sargon&quot; of the temple of Sin at Ur, who lived around 2285–2250 BCE, is the first poet in history whom we know by name. Her known works include hymns to the goddess Inanna, the Exaltation of Inanna and In-nin sa-gur-ra. A third work, the Temple Hymns, a collection of specific hymns, addresses the sacred temples and their occupants, the deity to whom they were consecrated. The works of this poetess are significant, because although they start out using the third person, they shift to the first person voice of the poet herself, and they mark a significant development in the use of cuneiform. As poetess, princess, and priestess, she was a personality who, set standards in all three of her roles for many succeeding centuries.


The empire was bound together by roads, along which there was a regular postal service. Clay seals that took the place of stamps bear the names of Sargon and his son. A cadastral survey seems also to have been instituted, and one of the documents relating to it states that a certain Uru-Malik, whose name appears to indicate his Canaanite origin, was governor of the land of the Amorites, or Amurru as the semi-nomadic people of Syria and Canaan were called in Akkadian. It is probable that the first collection of astronomical observations and terrestrial omens was made for a library established by Sargon. The earliest &quot;year names&quot;, whereby each year of a king's reign was named after a significant event performed by that king, date from the reign of Sargon the Great. Lists of these &quot;year names&quot; henceforth became a calendrical system used in most independent Mesopotamian city-states. In Assyria, however, years came to be named for the annual presiding limmu official appointed by the king, rather than for an event.

=== The Akkadian Empire's History ===

Speakers of the Akkadian language seem to have already been present in Mesopotamia at the dawn of the historical period, and soon achieved pre-eminence with the first Dynasty of Kish and numerous localities to the north of Sumer, where rulers with Akkadian names had already established themselves by the 3rd millennium BCE. The king Sargon has often been cited as the first ruler of a combined empire of Akkad and Sumer, although more recently discovered data suggests there had been Sumerian expansions under previous kings, including Lugal-Anne-Mundu of Adab, Eannatum of Lagash, and Lugal-Zage-Si.

Sargon of Akkad, defeated and captured Lugal-Zage-Si in the Battle of Uruk and conquered his empire. The earliest records in the Akkadian language date to the time of Sargon. Sargon was claimed to be the son of La'ibum or Itti-Bel, a humble gardener, and possibly a hierodule, or priestess to Ishtar or Inanna. One legend related of Sargon in Assyrian times says that


&quot;My mother was a changeling, my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is Azurpiranu (the wilderness herb  
fields), which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates. My changeling mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket   of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose not over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me. Akki the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. While I was gardener Ishtar granted me her love, and for four and (fifty?) ... years I exercised kingship.&quot;


Later claims on behalf of Sargon, that his mother was an &quot;entu&quot; priestess. The claims might have been made to ensure a descendancy of nobility, considering only a high placed family can be made such a position.

Originally a cupbearer to a king of Kish with a Semitic name, Ur-Zababa, Sargon thus became a gardener, responsible for the task of clearing out irrigation canals. This gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers, who also may have served as his first soldiers. Displacing Ur-Zababa, Sargon was crowned king, and he entered upon a career of foreign conquest. Four times he invaded Syria and Canaan, and he spent three years thoroughly subduing the countries of &quot;the west&quot; to unite them with Mesopotamia &quot;into a single empire.&quot;

However, Sargon took this process further, conquering many of the surrounding regions to create an empire that reached westward as far as the Mediterranean Sea and perhaps Cyprus; northward as far as the mountains (a later Hittite text asserts he fought the Hattian king Nurdaggal of Burushanda, well into Anatolia); eastward over Elam; and as far south as Magan — a region over which he reigned for purportedly 56 years, though only four &quot;year-names&quot; survive. He consolidated his dominion over his territories by replacing the earlier opposing rulers with noble citizens of Akkad, his native city where loyalty would thus be ensured. Trade extended from the silver mines of Anatolia to the lapis lazuli mines in Afghanistan, the cedars of Lebanon and the copper of Magan. This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of northern Mesopotamia (Assyria) and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production.

Images of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia were also subjugated, and rebellions in Sumer were put down. Contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against Canaan and against Sarlak, king of Gutium. He also boasted of having subjugated the &quot;four quarters&quot; — the lands surrounding Akkad to the north, the south, the east and the west. Some of the earliest historiographic texts suggest he rebuilt the city of Babylon in its new location near Akkad.

Sargon, throughout his long life, showed special deference to the Sumerian deities, particularly Inanna, his patroness, and Zababa, the warrior god of Kish. He called himself &quot;The anointed priest of Anu&quot; and &quot;the great ensi of Enlil&quot; and his daughter, Enheduanna, was installed as priestess to Nanna at the temple in Ur.

Troubles multiplied toward the end of his reign. A later Babylonian text states;


&quot;In his old age, all the lands revolted against him, and they besieged him in Akkad &quot;...but &quot;he went forth to battle and defeated them, he 
knocked them over and destroyed their vast army&quot;.


It refers to his campaign in &quot;Elam&quot;, where he defeated a coalition army led by the King of Awan, where he forced the vanquished to become his vassals. Also shortly after, another revolt had been made;


&quot;the Subartu the upper country—in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote 

them grievously&quot;.


Sargon had crushed opposition even at old age. These difficulties broke out again in the reign of his sons, where revolts broke out during the 9-year reign, Rimush (2278–2270 BCE), who fought hard to retain the empire, and was successful until he was assassinated by some of his own courtiers. Rimush's elder brother, Manishtushu (2269–2255 BCE) succeeded and reigned for a period of 15 years. The latter king seems to have fought a sea battle against 32 kings who had gathered against him and took control over their country of what is today the United Arab Emirates and Oman. Despite the success, similarly to his brother, he seems to have been assassinated in a palace conspiracy.

Manishtushu's son and successor, Naram-Sin (2254–2218 BCE), due to vast military conquests, assumed the imperial title &quot;King Naram-Sin, king of the four quarters&quot;, the four quarters as a reference to the entire world. He was also for the first time in Sumerian culture, addressed as &quot;the god of Agade&quot;, in opposition to the previous religious belief that kings were only representatives of the people towards the gods. He also faced revolts at the start of his reign, But quickly crushed them.

Naram-Sin also recorded the Akkadian conquest of Ebla as well as Armanum and its king. Armanum location is debated, historian Adelheid Otto identify it with the Citadel of Bazi – Tall Banat complex on the Euphrates River between Ebla and Tell Brak, others like Wayne Horowitz identify it with Aleppo, and while most scholars place Armanum in Syria, Michael C. Astour believes it to be located north of the Hamrin Mountains in northern Iraq.

To better police Syria, he built a royal residence at Tell Brak, a crossroads at the heart of the Khabur River basin of the Jezirah. Naram-Sin campaigned against Magan which also revolted; Naram-Sin, &quot;marched against Magan and personally caught Mandannu, its king&quot;, where he instated garrisons to protect the main roads. The chief threat seemed to be coming from the northern Zagros Mountains, the Lulubis and the Gutians. A campaign against the Lullubi led to the carving of the famous &quot;Victory Stele of Naram-Suen&quot;, now in the Louvre. Hittite sources claim Naram-Sin of Akkad even ventured into Anatolia, battling the Hittite and Hurrian kings Pamba of Hatti, Zipani of Kanesh, and 15 others. This newfound Akkadian wealth may have been based upon benign climatic conditions, huge agricultural surpluses and the confiscation of the wealth of other peoples.

The economy was highly planned. Grain was cleaned, and rations of grain and oil were distributed in standardized vessels made by the city's potters. Taxes were paid in produce and labour on public walls, including city walls, temples, irrigation canals and waterways, producing huge agricultural surpluses.

=== The Akkadian Empire's Collapse ===

The Empire of Akkad collapsed in 2154 BCE, within 180 years of its founding, ushering in a Dark Age period of regional decline that lasted until the rise of the Third Dynasty of Ur in 2112 BCE. By the end of the reign of Naram-Sin's son, Shar-kali-sharri (2217–2193 BCE), the empire had weakened. There was a period of anarchy between 2192 BCE and 2168 BCE. Shu-Durul (2168–2154 BCE) appears to have restored some centralized authority, however he was unable to prevent the empire eventually collapsing outright from the invasion of barbarian peoples from the Zagros Mountains known as the Gutians.

Little is known about the Gutian period, or how long it endured. Cuneiform sources suggest that the Gutians' administration showed little concern for maintaining agriculture, written records, or public safety; they reputedly released all farm animals to roam about Mesopotamia freely, and soon brought about famine and rocketing grain prices. The decline coincided with severe drought, possibly connected with climatic changes reaching all across the area from Egypt to Greece. The Sumerian king Ur-Nammu (2112–2095 BCE) cleared the Gutians from Mesopotamia during his reign.

Eventually the Guti were overthrown by Utu-hengal of Uruk, and the various city-states again vied for power. Power over the area finally went to the city-state of Ur, when Ur-Nammu founded the Ur III Empire (2112–2004 BC) and conquered the Sumerian region. Under his son Shulgi, state control over industry reached a level never again seen in the region. Shulgi may have devised the Code of Ur-Nammu, one of the earliest known law codes (three centuries before the more famous Code of Hammurabi). Around 2000 BCE, the power of Ur waned, and the Amorites came to occupy much of the area, although it was Sumer's long-standing rivals to the east, the Elamites, who finally overthrew Ur. In the north, Assyria remained free of Amorite control until the very end of the 19th century BC. This marked the end of city-states ruling empires in Mesopotamia, and the end of Sumerian dominance, but the succeeding rulers adopted much of Sumerian civilization as their own.

=== Assyria ===

Assyria was a major Semitic kingdom, and often empire, existing as an independent state for a period of approximately nineteen centuries from c. 2500 BCE to 605 BCE, spanning the Early Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age. Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. The Assyrian King List mentions rulers going back to the 23rd and 22nd century BC. The earliest king named Tudiya, who was a contemporary of Ibrium of Ebla, appears to have lived in the mid-23rd century BCE, according to the king list.

The city of Ashur, together with a number of other Assyrian cities, seem to have been established by 2600 BCE, however it is likely that they were initially Sumerian dominated administrative centres. In c. the late 26th century BC, Eannatum of Lagash, then the dominant Sumerian ruler in Mesopotamia, mentions &quot;smiting Subartu&quot; (Subartu being the Sumerian name for Assyria). Similarly, in c. the early 25th century BC, Lugal-Anne-Mundu the king of the Sumerian state of Adab lists Subartu as paying tribute to him.

Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. In the Assyrian King List, the earliest king recorded was Tudiya. In initial archaeological reports from Ebla, it appeared that Tudiya's existence was confirmed with the discovery of a tablet where he concluded a treaty for the operation of a karum in Eblaite territory, with &quot;king&quot; Ibrium of Ebla (who is now known to have been the vizier of Ebla for king Ishar-Damu). This entire reading is now questionable, as several scholars have more recently argued that the treaty in question was not with king Tudiya of Asshur at all, but rather with the unnamed king of an uncertain location called &quot;Abarsal&quot;.

Tudiya was succeeded on the list by Adamu and then a further thirteen rulers (Yangi, Shuhlamu, Harharu, Mandaru, Imshu, Harshu, Didanu, Hanu, Zuabu, Nuabu, Abazu, Belu and Azarah). Nothing concrete is yet known about these names, although it has been noted that a Babylonian tablet listing the ancestral lineage of Hammurabi seems to include the same names from Tudiya through Nuabu in a heavily corrupted form.

The earliest kings, such as Tudiya, who are recorded as kings who lived in tents, may have been independent Akkadian semi-nomadic pastoralist rulers. These kings at some point became fully urbanised and founded the city state of Ashur.

During the Akkadian Empire (2334–2154 BCE) the Assyrians, like all the Akkadian Semites (and also the Sumerians), became subject to the dynasty of the city state of Akkad, centered in central Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire founded by Sargon the Great, claimed to encompass the surrounding &quot;four quarters&quot;. The region of Assyria, north of the seat of the empire in central Mesopotamia had also been known as Subartu by the Sumerians, and the name Azuhinum in Akkadian records also seems to refer to Assyria proper.

Assyrian rulers were subject to Sargon and his successors, and the city of Ashur became a regional administrative center of the Empire, implicated by the Nuzi tablets.

During this period, the Akkadian-speaking Semites of Mesopotamia came to rule an empire encompassing not only Mesopotamia itself but large swathes of Asia Minor, ancient Iran, Elam, the Arabian Peninsula, Canaan and Syria.

Assyria seems to have already been firmly involved in trade in Asia Minor by this time; the earliest known reference to Anatolian karums in Hatti, was found on later cuneiform tablets describing the early period of the Akkadian Empire (c. 2350 BCE). On those tablets, Akkadian traders in Burushanda implored the help of their ruler, Sargon the Great, and this appellation continued to exist throughout the Assyrian Empire for about 1,700 years. The name &quot;Hatti&quot; itself even appears in later accounts of his grandson, Naram-Sin, campaigning in Anatolia.

Assyrian and Akkadian traders spread the use of writing in the form of the Mesopotamian cuneiform script to Asia Minor and The Levant.

However, towards the end of the reign of Sargon the Great, the Assyrian faction rebelled against him; &quot;the tribes of Assyria of the upper country—in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote them grievously&quot;.

The Akkadian Empire was destroyed by economic decline and internal civil war, followed by attacks from barbarian Gutian people in 2154 BCE.

The rulers of Assyria during the period between c. 2154 BCE and 2112 BEC once again became fully independent, as the Gutians are only known to have administered southern Mesopotamia. However, the king list is the only information from Assyria for this period.

Most of Assyria briefly became part of the Neo-Sumerian Empire (or 3rd dynasty of Ur) founded in c. 2112 BCE. Sumerian domination extended as far as the city of Ashur, but appears not to have reached Nineveh and the far north of Assyria. One local ruler (shakkanakku) named Zāriqum (who does not appear on any Assyrian king list) is listed as paying tribute to Amar-Sin of Ur. Ashur's rulers appear to have remained largely under Sumerian domination until the mid-21st century BCE (c. 2050 BCE); the king list names Assyrian rulers for this period and several are known from other references to have also borne the title of shakkanakka or vassal governors for the neo-Sumerians.

The first written inscriptions by 'urbanised' Assyrian kings appear in the mid-21st century BEC, after they had shrugged off Sumerian domination. The land of Assyria as a whole then consisted of a number of city states and small Semitic Akkadian kingdoms, some of which were initially independent of Assyria. The foundation of the first major temple in the city of Ashur was traditionally ascribed to king Ushpia who reigned c. 2050 BC, possibly a contemporary of Ishbi-Erra of Isin and Naplanum of Larsa. He was reputedly succeeded by kings named Apiashal, Sulili, Kikkiya and Akiya (died c. 2026 BCE), of whom little is known, apart from much later mentions of Kikkiya conducting fortifications on the city walls, and building work on temples in Ashur.

The main rivals, neighbors or trading partners to early Assyrian kings during the 22nd, 21st and 20th centuries BCE would have been the Hattians and Hurrians to the north in Asia Minor, the Gutians and Turukku to the east in the Zagros Mountains of northwest Iran, the Elamites to the southeast in what is now south central Iran, the Amorites to the west in what is today Syria, and their fellow Sumero-Akkadian city-states of southern Mesopotamia such as Isin, Kish, Ur and Larsa.

Like many city-states in Mesopotamian history, Ashur was, to a great extent, an oligarchy rather than a monarchy. Authority was considered to lie with &quot;the City&quot;, and the polity had three main centres of power — an assembly of elders, a hereditary ruler, and an eponym. The ruler presided over the assembly and carried out its decisions. He was not referred to with the usual Akkadian term for &quot;king&quot;, šarrum; that was instead reserved for the city's patron deity Assur, of whom the ruler was the high priest. The ruler himself was only designated as &quot;the steward of Assur&quot; (iššiak Assur), where the term for steward is a borrowing from Sumerian ensi(k). The third centre of power was the eponym (limmum), who gave the year his name, similarly to the later archons and consuls of Classical Antiquity. He was annually elected by lot and was responsible for the economic administration of the city, which included the power to detain people and confiscate property. The institution of the eponym as well as the formula iššiak Assur lingered on as ceremonial vestiges of this early system throughout the history of the Assyrian monarchy.

In approximately 2025 BCE (long chronology), Puzur-Ashur I (perhaps a contemporary of Shu-ilishu of Larsa and Samium of Isin) is speculated (on the basis of his name being Akkadian rather than Hurrian) to have overthrown Kikkiya and founded a new dynasty which was to survive for 216 years. His descendants left inscriptions mentioning him regarding the building of temples to gods such as Ashur, Adad and Ishtar in Assyria. The length of his reign is unknown.

Shalim-ahum (died c. 2009 BCE) succeeded the throne at a currently unknown date. He left inscriptions in archaic Old Assyrian regarding the construction of a temple dedicated to the god Ashur, and the placement of beer vats within it.

Ilushuma(c. 2008–1975 BEC) took the throne in c. 2008 BCE, and is known from his inscription (extant in several copies) where he claims to have &quot;washed the copper&quot; and &quot;established liberty&quot; for the Akkadians in Sumerian city-states as far as the Persian Gulf. This was at first taken to imply that he made military campaigns into Southern Mesopotamia, however more recent scholarship has taken the view that the inscription means he supplied these areas with copper from Hatti, and that the word used for &quot;liberty&quot; (adduraru) is usually in the context of exemption from tariffs.

&quot;The freedom of the Akkadians and their children I established. I purified their copper. I established their freedom from the border of the marshes and Ur and Nippur, Awal, and Kish, Der of the goddess Ishtar, as far as the City of (Ashur).&quot;

Assyria had long held extensive contact with Hattian, Hittite and Hurrian cities on the Anatolian plateau in Asia Minor. The Assyrians who had for centuries traded in the region, and possibly ruled small areas bordering Assyria, now established significant colonies in Cappadocia, (e.g., at Kanesh (modern Kültepe) from 2008 BEC to 1740 BCE. These colonies, called karum, from the Akkadian word for 'port', were attached to Hattian cities in Anatolia, but physically separate, and had special tax status. They must have arisen from a long tradition of trade between Assyria and the Anatolian cities, but no archaeological or written records show this. The trade consisted of metals (copper or tin and perhaps iron; the terminology is not entirely clear) being traded for textiles from Assyria.

Erishum I(c. 1974–1935 BCE) vigorously expanded Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor during his long reign, the major ones appearing to be at Kanesh, Ḫattuša (Boğazköy) (the future capital of the Hittite Empire) and Amkuwa (Alisar Höyük), together with a further eighteen smaller colonies. He created some of the earliest examples of Written Law, conducted extensive building work in the form of fortifying the walls of major Assyrian cities and the erection of temples dedicated to Ashur and Ishtar. It is from his reign that the continuous limmum lists are known, however there are references to the eponym-books for his predecessors having been destroyed at some point.

Ikunum (c. 1934-1921 BCE)built a major temple for the god Ningal. He further strengthened the fortifications of the city of Assur and maintained Assyria's colonies in Asia Minor.

Sargon I (c. 1920-1881 BCE)succeeded him in c. 1920 BCE, and had an unusually long reign of 39 years. It is likely he was named after his illustrious predecessor Sargon of Akkad. He is known to have refortified the defences of major Assyrian cities, and maintained Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor during his reign. Apart from this, little has yet been unearthed about him. At some point he appears to have withdrawn Assyrian aid to southern Mesopotamia. It was during his reign in Assyria that the initially minor city-state of Babylon was founded in 1894 BCE by an Amorite Malka (prince) named Sumuabum.

Puzur-Ashur II (c. 1881-1873 BCE) came to the throne as an already older man due to his fathers long reign. Little is known about his rule, but it appears to have been uneventful.

Naram-Suen (c. 1872-1818 BCE) ascended to the throne in 1872 BCE, and is likely named after his predecessor Naram-Sin of the Akkadian Empire. Assyria continued to be wealthy during his 54 year long reign, and he defeated the future usurper king Shamshi-Adad I who attempted to take his throne.

Erishum II (c. 1818 - 1809 BCE) was to be the last king of the dynasty of Puzur-Ashur I, founded c. 2025 BCE. After only eight or nine years in power he was overthrown by Shamshi-Adad I, an Amorite usurper who claimed legitimacy by asserting descent from the 21st century BCE Assyrian king, Ushpia.

The Amorites were successfully repelled by the Assyrian kings of the 20th and 19th centuries BCE. However, in 1809 BCE the native Akkadian king of Assyria Erishum II was deposed, and the throne of Assyria was usurped by Shamshi-Adad I (1809 BCE – 1791 BCE) in the expansion of Semitic Amorite tribes from the Khabur River delta.

Although regarded as an Amorite by later Assyrian tradition, Shamshi-Adad's descent is suggested to be from the same line as the native Akkadian speaking ruler Ushpia in the Assyrian King List. He put his son Ishme-Dagan on the throne of a nearby Assyrian city, Ekallatum, and maintained Assyria's Anatolian colonies. Shamshi-Adad I then went on to conquer the kingdom of Mari (in modern Syria) on the Euphrates putting another of his sons, Yasmah-Adad on the throne there. Shamshi-Adad's Assyria now encompassed the whole of northern Mesopotamia and included territory in central Mesopotamia, Asia Minor and northern Syria. He himself resided in a new capital city founded in the Khabur valley in northern Mesopotamia, called Shubat-Enlil.

Ishme-Dagan(1790 - 1751 BCE) inherited Assyria, but Yasmah-Adad was overthrown by a new king called Zimrilim in Mari. The new king of Mari allied himself with the Amorite king Hammurabi of Babylon, who had made the recently created, and originally minor state of Babylon into a major power. It was from the reign of Hammurabi onwards that southern Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia.

Assyria now faced the rising power of Babylon in the south. Ishme-Dagan responded by making an alliance with the enemies of Babylon, and the power struggle continued without resolution for decades. Ishme-Dagan, like his father was a great warrior, and in addition to repelling Babylonian attacks, campaigned successfully against the Turukku and Lullubi of the Zagros Mountains (in modern Iran) who had attacked the Assyrian city of Ekallatum, and against Dadusha, king of Eshnunna, and the state of Iamhad (modern Aleppo).

Hammurabi, after first conquering Mari, Larsa, and Eshnunna, eventually prevailed over Ishme-Dagan's successor Mut-Ashkur, (1750 - 1740 BCE), and subjected him to Babylon c. 1750 BCE. With Hammurabi, the various karum colonies in Anatolia ceased trade activity — probably because the goods of Assyria were now being traded with the Babylonians. The Assyrian monarchy survived, however the three Amorite kings succeeding Ishme-Dagan, Mut-Ashkur (who was the son of Ishme-Dagan and married to a Hurrian queen), Rimush (1739 - 1733 BCE) and Asinum (1732 BCE), were vassals, dependent on the Babylonians during the reign of Hammurabi, and for a short time, of his successor Samsu-iluna.

The short lived Babylonian Empire quickly began to unravel upon the death of Hammurabi, and Babylonia lost control over Assyria during the reign of Hammurabi's successor Samsu-iluna (1750 - 1712 BCE). A period of civil war ensued after the deposition of the Amorite king of Assyria Asinum, (a grandson of Shamshi-Adad I) in approximately 1732 BCE by a powerful native Akkadian vice regent named Puzur-Sin, who regarded Asinum as both a foreigner and a former lackey of Babylon. A native king named Ashur-dugul seized the throne in 1732 BCE, probably with the help of Puzur-Sin. However, he was unable to retain control for long, and was soon deposed by a rival claimant, Ashur-apla-idi. Internal instability ensued with four further kings (Nasir-Sin, Sin-namir, Ipqi-Ishtar and Adad-salulu) all reigning in quick succession over a period of approximately six years between 1732 and 1727 BCE. Babylonia seems to have been too powerless to intervene or take advantage of this situation.

Finally, a king named Adasi (1726 - 1701 BEC) came to the fore c. 1726 BCE and managed to quell the civil unrest and stabilise the situation in Assyria. Adasi drove the Babylonians and Amorites from the Assyrian sphere of influence during his reign, and Babylonian power began to quickly wane in Mesopotamia as a whole, also losing the far south of Mesopotamia to the Sealand Dynasty, although the Amorites would retain control over a much reduced and weak Babylonia itself until 1595 BCE, when they were overthrown by the Kassites, a people from the Zagros Mountains who spoke a language isolate and were neither Semites nor Indo-Europeans.

Adasi was succeeded by Bel-bani (1700–1691 BC) who is credited in Assyrian annals with inflicting further defeats on the Babylonians and Amorites, and further strengthening and stabilising the kingdom.

Little is currently known of many of the kings that followed such as; Libaya (1690–1674 BCE), Sharma-Adad I (1673–1662 BCE), Iptar-Sin (1661–1650 BCE), Bazaya (1649–1622 BCE) (a contemporary of Peshgaldaramesh of the Sealand Dynasty), Lullaya (1621–1618 BCE) (who usurperped the throne from Bazaya), Shu-Ninua (1615–1602 BCE) and Sharma-Adad II (1601–1599 BCE). However, Assyria seems to have been a relatively strong and stable nation, existing undisturbed by its neighbours such as the Hatti, Hittites, Hurrians, Amorites, Babylonians, Elamites or Mitanni for well over 200 years.

Assyria appears to have remained strong and secure; when Babylon was sacked by the Hittites and subsequently fell to the Kassites in 1595 BCE, both powers were unable to make any inroads into Assyria, and there seems to have been no trouble between the first Kassite ruler of Babylon, Agum II, and Erishum III (1598–1586 BCE) of Assyria, and a mutually beneficial treaty was signed between the two rulers.

Shamshi-Adad II (1585–1580 BCE), Ishme-Dagan II (1579 - 1562 BCE) and Shamshi-Adad III (1562 - 1548 BCE) seem also to have had peaceful tenures, although few records have thus far been discovered about their reigns. Similarly, Ashur-nirari I (1547–1522 BCE) seems not to have been troubled by the newly founded Mitanni Empire in Asia Minor, the Hittite empire, or Babylon during his 25-year reign. He is known to have been an active king, improving the infrastructure, dedicating temples and conducting various building projects throughout the kingdom.

Puzur-Ashur III (1521–1498 BCE) proved to be a strong and energetic ruler. He undertook much rebuilding work in Assur, the city was refortified and the southern quarters incorporated into the main city defences. Temples to the moon god Sin (Nanna) and the sun god Shamash were erected during his reign. He signed a treaty with Burna-Buriash I the Kassite king of Babylon, defining the borders of the two nations in the late 16th century BC. He was succeeded by Enlil-nasir I (1497–1483 BCE) who appears to have had a peaceful an uneventful reign, as does his successor Nur-ili (1482–1471 BCE).

The son of Nur-ili, Ashur-shaduni (1470 BCE) was deposed by his uncle Ashur-rabi I (1470-1451 BCE) in his first year of rule. Little is known about his nineteen-year reign, but it appears to have been largely uneventful.

The emergence of the Mitanni Empire in the 16th century BCE did eventually lead to a period of sporadic Mitanni-Hurrian domination in the latter half of the 15th century. The Mitanni are thought to have conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous Hurrians. The Hurrians spoke a language isolate, i.e. neither Semitic nor Indo-European.

Ashur-nadin-ahhe I (1450-1431 BCE) was courted by the Egyptians, who were rivals of the Mitanni, and attempting to gain a foothold in the Near East. Amenhotep II sent him a tribute of gold to seal an alliance. It is likely that this alliance prompted Saushtatar, the Mitanni emperor, to invade Assyria, and sack the city of Ashur, after which Assyria became a sometime vassal state, with Ashur-nadin-ahhe I being forced to pay tribute to Saushtatar. He was deposed by his own brother Enlil-nasir II (1430-1425 BCE) in 1430 BCE, possibly with the aid of the Mitanni, who received tribute from the new king. Ashur-nirari II (1424-1418 BCE) had an uneventful reign, and appears to have also paid tribute to the Mitanni Empire.

The Assyrian monarchy survived, and the Mitanni influence appears to have been sporadic. They appear not to have been always willing or able to interfere in Assyrian internal and international affairs.

Ashur-bel-nisheshu (1417–1409 BCE) seems to have been largely independent of Mitanni influence, as evidenced by his signing a mutually beneficial treaty with Karaindash, the Kassite king of Babylonia in the late 15th century. He also undertook extensive rebuilding work in Ashur itself, and Assyria appears to have redeveloped a sophisticated financial system during his reign.

Ashur-rim-nisheshu (1408–1401 BCE) also undertook building work, strengthening the city walls of the capital, however it is likely that he paid tribute to Mitanni.

Ashur-nadin-ahhe II (1400–1393 BCE) also received a tribute of gold and diplomatic overtures from Egypt, possibly in an attempt to gain Assyrian support against Egypt's Mitanni and Hittite rivals in the region. However, the Assyrian king appears not to have been in a strong enough position to challenge the Mitanni.

Eriba-Adad I (1392-1366 BCE), a son of Ashur-bel-nisheshu, ascended the throne in 1392 BC and finally broke the ties to the Mitanni Empire.

There are dozens of Mesopotamian cuneiform texts from this period, with precise observations of solar and lunar eclipses, that have been used as 'anchors' in the various attempts to define the chronology of Babylonia and Assyria for the early 2nd millennium BC (i.e., the &quot;high&quot;, &quot;middle&quot;, and &quot;low&quot; chronologies.)


== Ancient Egypt ==

Ancient Egypt was an ancient civilization of Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations globally to arise independently. Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150 BCE (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh. The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable Kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.

Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom, in the Ramesside period where it rivalled the Hittite Empire, Assyrian Empire and Mitanni Empire, after which it entered a period of slow decline.

The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs.

The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known ships, Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known peace treaty, made with Hittites. Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.

=== Life and Culture of Ancient Egypt ===

Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land. Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members, and were constructed of mud-brick designed to remain cool in the heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread. Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.

The ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance. Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's income.

Music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, cymbals, tambourines, drums, and imported lutes and lyres from Asia. The sistrum was a rattle-like musical instrument that was especially important in religious ceremonies.

The ancient Egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities, including games and music. Senet, a board game where pieces moved according to random chance, was particularly popular from the earliest times; another similar game was mehen, which had a circular gaming board. Juggling and ball games were popular with children, and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at Beni Hasan. The wealthy members of ancient Egyptian society enjoyed hunting and boating as well.

The excavation of the workers' village of Deir el-Madinah has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world that spans almost four hundred years. There is no comparable site in which the organisation, social interactions, working and living conditions of a community were studied in such detail.

===== Cuisine =====

here are few precise accounts of how many meals were eaten, but it has been assumed that the wealthy would have two or three meals a day; a light morning meal, a larger lunch and dinner later in the evening. The general population would most likely eat a simple breakfast of bread, and a main meal with beer in the early afternoon.

Depictions of banquets can be found in paintings from both the Old Kingdom and New Kingdom. They usually started sometime in the afternoon. Men and women were separated unless they were married. Seating varied according to social status, with those of the highest status sitting on chairs, those slightly lower sat on stools and those lowest in rank sat on the bare floor. Before the food was served, handwashing basins were provided along with perfumes and cones of scented fat were lit to spread pleasant smells or to repel insects, depending on the type. Lily flowers and flower collars were handed out and professional dancers (primarily women) entertained, accompanied by musicians playing harps, lutes, drums, tambourines, and clappers. There were usually considerable amounts of alcohol and abundant quantities of foods; there were whole roast oxen, ducks, geese, pigeons, and at times fish. The dishes frequently consisted of stews served with great amounts of bread, fresh vegetables and fruit. For sweets there were cakes baked with dates and sweetened with honey. The goddess Hathor was often invoked during feasts. Food could be prepared by stewing, baking, boiling, grilling, frying, or roasting. Spices and herbs were added for flavor, though the former were expensive imports and therefore confined to the tables of the wealthy. Food such as meats was mostly preserved by salting, and dates and raisins could be dried for long-term storage. The staples bread and beer were usually prepared in the same locations, as the yeast used for bread was also used for brewing. The two were prepared either in special bakeries or, more often, at home, and any surplus would be sold.

The predynastic cuisine differed from later eating habits due to changes in climate. Egypt went from being a lush region to a drier climate. Initially, there was plenty of game such as antelope, gazelle, hippo, crocodile, ostrich, waterfowl, and fresh and saltwater fish. Smaller game like sheep, goats, cattle, and even hyenas were eaten. However, by dynastic times (around 3000 BCE) the availability of game had decreased considerably and was by then primarily a sport of the affluent, even though small game often would supplement the diet of the poor. The New Kingdom was a period with innovations in diet due to foreign trade and warfare. Pomegranates were introduced and almonds were imported. It is also possible that apples and apricots were imported on a small scale, and by Greco-Roman times quinces, pears, plums, peaches, filbert, walnut, pine nut, and pistachios were introduced.

Honey was the primary sweetener, but was rather expensive. There was honey collected from the wild, and honey from domesticated bees kept in pottery hives. A cheaper alternative would have been dates or carob. There was even a hieroglyph (nedjem/bener) depicting a carob pod that bore the primary meaning of &quot;sweet; pleasant.&quot; Oils would be made from lettuce or radish seed, safflower, ben, balanites and sesame. Animal fat was employed for cooking and jars used for storing it have been found in many settlements.

Egyptian bread was made almost exclusively from emmer wheat, which was more difficult to turn into flour than most other varieties of wheat. The chaff does not come off through threshing, but comes in spikelets that needed to be removed by moistening and pounding with a pestle to avoid crushing the grains inside. It was then dried in the sun, winnowed and sieved and finally milled on a saddle quern, which functioned by moving the grindstone back and forth, rather than with a rotating motion. The baking techniques varied over time. In the Old Kingdom, heavy pottery molds were filled with dough and then set in the embers to bake. During the Middle Kingdom tall cones were used on square hearths. In the New Kingdom a new type of a large open-topped clay oven, cylindrical in shape, was used, which was encased in thick mud bricks and mortar. Dough was then slapped on the heated inner wall and peeled off when done, similar to how a tandoor oven is used for flatbreads. Tombs from the New Kingdom show images of bread in many different shapes and sizes. Loaves shaped like human figures, fish, various animals and fans, all of varying dough texture. Flavorings used for bread included coriander seeds and dates, but it is not known if this was ever used by the poor.

Other than emmer, barley was grown to make bread and also used for making beer, and so were lily seeds and roots, and tiger nut. The grit from the quern stones used to grind the flour mixed in with bread was a major source of tooth decay due to the wear it produced on the enamel. For those who could afford there was also fine dessert bread and cakes baked from high-grade flour.

Along with bread, beer was a staple of the ancient Egyptians and was drunk daily. Like most modern African beers, but unlike European beer, it was very cloudy with plenty of solids and highly nutritious, quite reminiscent of gruel. It was an important source of protein, minerals and vitamins and was so valuable that beer jars were often used as a measurement of value and was used in medicine. Little is known about specific types of beer, but there is mention of, for example, sweet beer but without any specific details mentioned. Conical pottery from pre-dynastic times has been found at Hierakonpolis and Abydos with emmer wheat residue that shows signs of gentle heating from below. Though not conclusive evidence of early beer brewing it is an indication that this might have been what they were used for. Archeological evidence shows that beer was made by first baking &quot;beer bread&quot;, a type of well-leavened, lightly baked bread that did not kill the yeasts, which was then crumbled over a sieve, washed with water in a vat and then left to ferment. There are claims of dates or malts having been used, but the evidence is not concrete.

Microscopy of beer residue points to a different method of brewing where bread was not used as an ingredient. One batch of grain was sprouted, which produced enzymes. The next batch was cooked in water, dispersing the starch and then the two batches were mixed. The enzymes began to consume the starch to produce sugar. The resulting mixture was then sieved to remove chaff and yeast (and probably lactic acid) and was then added which began a fermentation process that produced alcohol. This method of brewing is still used in parts of non-industrialized Africa. Most beers were made of barley and only a few of emmer wheat, but so far no evidence of flavoring has been found.

Vegetables were eaten as a complement to the ubiquitous beer and bread, and the most common were long-shooted green scallions and garlic and both also had medical uses. There was also lettuce, celery (eaten raw or used to flavor stews), certain types of cucumber and, perhaps, some types of Old World gourds and even melons. By Greco-Roman times there were turnips, but it is not certain if they were available before that period. Various tubers of sedges, including papyrus were eaten raw, boiled, roasted or ground into flour and were rich in nutrients. Tiger nut (Cyperus esculentus) was used to make a dessert made from the dried and ground tubers mixed with honey. Lily and similar flowering aquatic plants could be eaten raw or turned into flour, and both root and stem were edible. A number of pulses and legumes such as peas, beans, lentils and chickpeas were vital sources of protein. The excavations of the workers' village at Giza have revealed pottery vessels imported from the Middle East, which were used to store and transport olive oil as early as the 4th Dynasty.

The most common fruit were dates and there were also figs, grapes (and raisins), dom palm nuts (eaten raw or steeped to make juice), certain species of Mimusops, and nabk berries (a species of the genus Ziziphus). Figs were so common because they were high in sugar and protein. The dates would either be dried/dehydrated or eaten fresh. Dates were sometimes even used to ferment wine and the poor would use them as sweeteners. Unlike vegetables, which were grown year round, fruit was more seasonal. Pomegranates and grapes would be brought into tombs of the deceased.

Meat came from domesticated animals, game and poultry. This possibly included partridge, quail, pigeon, ducks and geese. The chicken most likely arrived around the 5th to 4th century BCE, though no chicken bones have actually been found dating from before the Greco-Roman period. The most important animals were cattle, sheep, goats and pigs (previously thought to have been taboo to eat because the priests of Egypt referred pig to the evil god Seth). Beef was generally more expensive and would at most have been available once or twice a week, and then mostly for the royalty. However, excavations at the Giza worker's village have uncovered evidence of massive slaughter of beef, mutton and pork, such that researchers estimate that the workforce building the Great Pyramid were fed beef every day. Mutton and pork were more common. Poultry, both wild and domestic and fish were available to all but the most destitute. The alternative protein sources would rather have been legumes, eggs, cheese and the amino acids available in the tandem staples of bread and beer. Mice and hedgehogs were also eaten and a common way to cook the latter was to encase a hedgehog in clay and bake it. When the clay was then cracked open and removed, it took the prickly spikes with it.

===== Architecture =====

Due to the scarcity of wood, the two predominant building materials used in ancient Egypt were sun-baked mud brick and stone, mainly limestone, but also sandstone and granite in considerable quantities. From the Old Kingdom onward, stone was generally reserved for tombs and temples, while bricks were used even for royal palaces, fortresses, the walls of temple precincts and towns, and for subsidiary buildings in temple complexes. The core of the pyramids came from stone quarried in the area already while the limestone, now eroded away, that was used to face the pyramids came from the other side of the Nile River and had to be quarried, ferried across, and cut during the dry season before they could be pulled into place on the pyramid.

Ancient Egyptian houses were made out of mud collected from the Nile river. It was placed in molds and left to dry in the hot sun to harden for use in construction.

Many Egyptian towns have disappeared because they were situated near the cultivated area of the Nile Valley and were flooded as the river bed slowly rose during the millennia, or the mud bricks of which they were built were used by peasants as fertilizer. Others are inaccessible, new buildings having been erected on ancient ones. Fortunately, the dry, hot climate of Egypt preserved some mud brick structures. Examples include the village Deir al-Madinah, the Middle Kingdom town at Kahun, and the fortresses at Buhen and Mirgissa. Also, many temples and tombs have survived because they were built on high ground unaffected by the Nile flood and were constructed of stone.

Thus, our understanding of ancient Egyptian architecture is based mainly on religious monuments, massive structures characterized by thick, sloping walls with few openings, possibly echoing a method of construction used to obtain stability in mud walls. In a similar manner, the incised and flatly modeled surface adornment of the stone buildings may have derived from mud wall ornamentation. Although the use of the arch was developed during the fourth dynasty, all monumental buildings are post and lintel constructions, with flat roofs constructed of huge stone blocks supported by the external walls and the closely spaced columns.

Exterior and interior walls, as well as the columns and piers, were covered with hieroglyphic and pictorial frescoes and carvings painted in brilliant colors. Many motifs of Egyptian ornamentation are symbolic, such as the scarab, or sacred beetle, the solar disk, and the vulture. Other common motifs include palm leaves, the papyrus plant, and the buds and flowers of the lotus. Hieroglyphs were inscribed for decorative purposes as well as to record historic events or spells. In addition, these pictorial frescoes and carvings allow us to understand how the Ancient Egyptians lived, statuses, wars that were fought and their beliefs. This was especially true when exploring the tombs of Ancient Egyptian officials in recent years.

Ancient Egyptian temples were aligned with astronomically significant events, such as solstices and equinoxes, requiring precise measurements at the moment of the particular event. Measurements at the most significant temples may have been ceremonially undertaken by the Pharaoh himself.

===== Art =====

Much of the surviving art comes from tombs and monuments and thus there is an emphasis on life after death and the preservation of knowledge of the past. Symbolism also played an important role in establishing a sense of order. Symbolism, ranging from the pharaoh's regalia (symbolizing his power to maintain order) to the individual symbols of Egyptian gods and goddesses, is omnipresent in Egyptian art. Animals were usually also highly symbolic figures in Egyptian art. Colors were more expressive rather than natural: red skin implied hard working tanned youth, whereas yellow skin was used for women or middle-aged men who worked indoors; blue or gold indicated divinity because of its unnatural appearance and association with precious materials; the use of black for royal figures expressed the fertility of the Nile from which Egypt was born. Stereotypes were employed to indicate the geographical origins of foreigners

The Size the people are drawn indicates often relative importance in the social order. The king, or pharaoh, is usually the largest figure depicted to symbolize the ruler’s superhuman powers. Figures of high officials or tomb owner are usually smaller, and in smallest scale are shown servants and entertainers, animals, trees, and architectural details. 

Ancient Egyptian art forms are characterized by regularity and detailed depiction of gods, human beings, heroic battles, and nature, and a high proportion of surviving works were intended to provide solace and utility to the deceased in the afterlife. Artists endeavored to preserve everything from the present as clearly and permanently as possible. Ancient Egyptian art was created using media ranging from papyrus drawings to pictographs (hieroglyphics) and include funerary sculpture carved in relief and in the round from sandstone, quartz diorite and granite. Ancient Egyptian art displays an extraordinarily vivid representation of the Ancient Egyptian's socioeconomic status and belief systems. Egyptian art in all forms obeyed one law: the mode of representing Pharaohs, gods, man, nature and the environment remained consistent for thousands of years.

All Egyptian reliefs were not painted, and less prestigious works in tombs, temples and palaces were just painted on a flat surface. Stone surfaces were prepared by whitewash, or if rough, a layer of coarse mud plaster, with a smoother gesso layer above; some finer limestones could take paint directly. Pigments were mostly mineral, chosen to withstand strong sunlight without fading. The binding medium used in painting remains unclear: egg tempera and various gums and resins have been suggested. It is clear that true fresco, painted into a thin layer of wet plaster, was not used. Instead the paint was applied to dried plaster, in what is called &quot;fresco a secco&quot; in Italian. After painting, a varnish or resin was usually applied as a protective coating, and many paintings with some exposure to the elements have survived remarkably well, although those on fully exposed walls rarely have.[3] Small objects including wooden statuettes were often painted using similar techniques.

Many ancient Egyptian paintings have survived due to Egypt's extremely dry climate. The paintings were often made with the intent of making a pleasant afterlife for the deceased. The themes included journey through the afterworld or protective deities introducing the deceased to the gods of the underworld (such as Osiris). Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. Egyptian paintings are painted in such a way to show a profile view and a side view of the animal or person.

The monumental sculpture of Ancient Egypt is world-famous, but refined and delicate small works exist in much greater numbers. The Egyptians used the distinctive technique of sunk relief, which is well suited to very bright sunlight. The main figures in reliefs adhere to the same figure convention as in painting, with parted legs (where not seated) and head shown from the side, but the torso from the front, and a standard set of proportions making up the figure, using 18 &quot;fists&quot; to go from the ground to the hair-line on the forehead.

Ancient Egyptians used steatite (some varieties were called soapstone) and carved small pieces of vases, amulets, images of deities, of animals and several other objects. Ancient Egyptian artists also discovered the art of covering pottery with enamel. Covering by enamel was also applied to some stone works.

Different types of pottery items were deposited in tombs of the dead. Some such pottery items represented interior parts of the body, like the lungs, the liver and smaller intestines, which were removed before embalming. A large number of smaller objects in enamel pottery were also deposited with the dead. It was customary to craft on the walls of the tombs cones of pottery, about six to ten inches tall, on which were engraved or impressed legends relating to the dead occupants of the tombs. These cones usually contained the names of the deceased, their titles, offices which they held, and some expressions appropriate to funeral purposes.

Papyrus was used by ancient Egyptians (and exported to much of the ancient Mediterranean world) for writing and painting. Papyrus is relatively fragile, lasting at most a century or two in a library, and though used all over the classical world has only survived when buried in the very dry conditions of Egypt, and even then is often in poor condition. Papyrus texts illustrate all dimensions of ancient Egyptian life and include literary, religious, historical and administrative documents.</text>

== Abstract ==
This chapter aims to introduce the concepts and some basic properties of Shannon’s information measure - entropy, mutual information, and relative entropy. Inequalities involving these concepts will be introduced, too, to help reinforce readers’ understanding and enlarge their toolbox for future learning.

== Introduction ==
To undertand network coding, one need background knowledge in information theory. Among the essential concepts of information theory, a fundamental one is Shannon’s information measure - '''entropy''', '''mutual information''' and '''relative entropy'''. Instead of considering semantic aspects of information&lt;ref name=&quot;cesbell&quot;&gt;C. E. Shannon, &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication,&quot; The Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 27, no. July, October, pp. 379–423, 623–656, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;, the entropy measures the uncertainty of the outcome of a discrete random variable. Mutual information, as its name suggests, is how much information one d.r.v. contains about the other, or how much uncertainty one d.r.v. 'kills' for the other. Then we come to relative entropy, which can be seen as a generalization of mutual information. It measures the 'distance' between two d.r.v.s' probability distribution. After the three basic concepts are delivered, we introduce the inequalities that further characterize the properties of the information measures. 

To characterize '''uncertainty''', consider a coin flip. If the coin is not fair, say, the head has a 0.8 chance to turn up, while the tail only has a 0.2 chance. Then your uncertainty is low because you are quite certain that the head will turn up. However, if it is a fair coin, you will be more uncertain because the head and tail are equally likely to turn up. So if you were to use a mathematical expression to characterize the uncertainty of an outcome, this expression should be of the form of expectation, and reach its maximum when all choices are equally likely. Moreover, if we use dice instead of coin, or roulette instead of dice, then the uncertainty should grow as the number of choices grow. That is, the expression characterizing it should be increasing with the number of choices, i.e. the size of the alphabet. Lastly, if you roll two dices at once, the uncertainty of '3' and '4' turn up should be the same as that of rolling one dice then the other. So if sequential choices yield the same outcome as a single one, then the expressions of these choices should be able to combine and the combined result should be equal to that of the single choice. The three intuitive properties described above serves as criteria for choosing such expression.

== Definitions ==
'''Discrete Random Variable''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a discrete random variable with alphabet &lt;math&gt;??&lt;/math&gt; and PMF &lt;math&gt;P_X (x)=Pr(X = x),x \in X.&lt;/math&gt; Hereon, &lt;math&gt;P_X(x)&lt;/math&gt; is often written as &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; for convenience, and discrete random variable as d.r.v.

'''Entropy''' The entropy of a d.r.v. is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;H(X) = -\sum P(x)\log_b P(x)&lt;/math&gt;, in other words, the expectation of &lt;math&gt;log_b \frac{1}{P(x)}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Letter 'b' in the base specifies the unit of entropy. If b = 2, the unit is bit (binary unit, note the difference between this and the other 'bit' -- binary digit); b = e, it's nat (natural unit). Unless specified otherwise, we use bit. This form of expectation of negative logrithm is tailor-made by Shannon&lt;ref name=&quot;cesbell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for the three criteria we described in the last section.

'''Joint Entropy''' We defined entropy of a single d.r.v., the definition of two d.r.v.s is immediate:

&lt;math&gt;H(X) = -\sum_{x, y \in S(X, Y)} P(x,y)\log P(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Conditional Entropy''' The entropy of a d.r.v. conditioning on another d.r.v. is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;H(X|Y = y) = -\sum_{x \in X} P(x|y)\log P(x|y)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we can express the third criterion with conditional entropy: 

&lt;math&gt;H(XY) = H(X) + H(Y|X) = H(Y) + H(X|Y)&lt;/math&gt;. Rolling two dice at once or rolling one after the other should have the same uncertainty. And this can be extended to more than two d.r.v.s:

&lt;math&gt;H(X_1,X_2,...,X_N) = \sum_{n=1}^N H(X_N|X_1,X_2,...,X_{N-1})&lt;/math&gt;. This is called the '''chain rule of entropy'''.

PRINCE2 has seven '''principles''' of project management:
# continued business justification
# learn from experience
# define roles and responsibilities
# manage by stages
# manage by exception
# focus on products
# tailor to suit the project environment

And seven '''themes''':
# business case
# organization
# quality
# plans
# risk
# change
# progress

These principles and themes are encapsulated in the seven '''processes''' (which form the basis from which this book shall examine PRINCE2):

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Motivation =
You want to use environment variables to change the way an XQuery executes.

XQuery 3.0 introduced two new functions:

  available-environment-variables() as xs:string* - returns a sequence of strings of all the environment variables available

  environment-variable($name as xs:string) as xs:string? - returns the value of a specific environment variable

= Sample Program =
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;3.0&quot;;
&lt;results&gt;
    {
        for $variable in available-environment-variables()
        return
            &lt;var name=&quot;{$variable}&quot; value=&quot;{environment-variable($variable)}&quot;/&gt;
    }
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

= Sample Results =
Here are some sample results on a Windows 7 System:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;EXIST_HOME&quot; value=&quot;d:\eXist\exist-2.0&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;JAVA_HOME&quot; value=&quot;D:\Apps\java\java6&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;JAVA_OPTS&quot; value=&quot;&quot;-Xms128m -Xmx10024m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Djava.endorsed.dirs=&quot;d:\eXist\exist-2.0&quot;\lib\endorsed&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;JAVA_ENDORSED_DIRS&quot; value=&quot;&quot;d:\eXist\exist-2.0&quot;\lib\endorsed&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;JMX_PORT&quot; value=&quot;1099&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;JMX_OPTS&quot; value=&quot;&quot;-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false&quot;&quot;/&gt;

&lt;var name=&quot;PROCESSOR_LEVEL&quot; value=&quot;6&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;PROCESSOR_REVISION&quot; value=&quot;2a07&quot;/&gt;

&lt;var name=&quot;COMPUTERNAME&quot; value=&quot;DANS-NOT-A-MAC&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;SystemRoot&quot; value=&quot;C:\Windows&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;USERNAME&quot; value=&quot;Dan&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;USERPROFILE&quot; value=&quot;C:\Users\Dan&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;SystemDrive&quot; value=&quot;C:&quot;/&gt;

&lt;var name=&quot;Path&quot; value=&quot;D:\apps\exist\exist-2.0\bin;
   D:\apps\apache-ant-1.8.3\bin;D:\apps\git\bin;
   D:\Apps\maven\bin;D:\apps\tomcat\bin;&quot;/&gt;

&lt;var name=&quot;SESSIONNAME&quot; value=&quot;Console&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;MX&quot; value=&quot;10024&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;TMP&quot; value=&quot;C:\Users\Dan\AppData\Local\Temp&quot;/&gt;

      <comment>/* Example of Options */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Motivation =
You need to execute an external process such as shell command.

= Execute Process Command =

   process:execute($command as xs:string), $options and node()) as item()*

= Example of Options =

There are currently only two options documented.  The working directory and the value of the standard input:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;options&gt;
    &lt;workingDir&gt;PATH TO LOCAL FILE SYSTEM&lt;/workingDir&gt;
    &lt;stdin&gt;&lt;line&gt;INPUT STRING&lt;/line&gt;&lt;/stdin&gt;
&lt;/options&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

= Sample Program =

== XQuery File ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace process=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/process&quot; at &quot;java:org.exist.xquery.modules.process.ProcessModule&quot;;

let $cmd := 'D:\Apps\git\bin\ls.exe'
return
&lt;results&gt;
  {process:execute($command, &lt;options/&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Output ==
Here is an example of the git &quot;ls&quot; command being run without any options.  Note that the default is the EXIST_HOME directory.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;execution exitCode=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;commandline&gt;D:\Apps\git\bin\ls.exe &lt;/commandline&gt;
    &lt;stdout&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;Install_V2.0_20130212155217_6931977091675999583.log&lt;/line&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;LICENSE&lt;/line&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;README&lt;/line&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;VERSION.txt&lt;/line&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;atom-example.xq&lt;/line&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;atom-services.xml&lt;/line&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;autodeploy&lt;/line&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;backup.properties&lt;/line&gt;

Cool, this is just a quick, draft intro to get us started

Intro-
The definition of technological determinism can be regarded as the cultural implications of new media, by bringing into concern the history behind media theory and production and the way these frameworks develop social and cultural structures. With media technologies constantly developing allowing for instant and convenient communication, theorists have argued that this has influenced social progressions. New media technologies have revolutionised everyday life to an extent where humans are able to form self-identifications through social networking, consume media productions through television, computers and other means and also communicate from a local to a global scale. By assessing theorists work such as Marshall McLuhan who poses the idea that reforming media affects how humans distinguish and value the world around them and the differences between media such as what McLuhan states as ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ media, we can establish how technology is determined through the shaping of cultural and social formations.

Sickk! Well done - why don't you do just go ahead and have the intro as your section. I'll do Technological Imperative as mine. When do you think we should post them to the main page?

[[User:AlexaSoccer|AlexaSoccer]] ([[User talk:AlexaSoccer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexaSoccer|contribs]]) 10:46, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Technological Imperative
Technological imperative is the assumption that technology cannot be stopped in its development, and that technological progress is irreversible, unavoidable, and inevitable. Essentially, this theory assumes that because we are able to do something because of a particular technology, we ought to, must, or will do it. It is the theory that what can be done, will be done. 

This is important to technological determinism as it recognizes the influence of technology on action. It drives society to act on not only what they are able to do, but also push the boundaries and test limits because, as John von Neumann observed, “technological possibilities are irresistible to man”. (Mumford 1971, p. 186) With this, the theory acknowledges the shift from technology as a means to technology as an end.
Critics of the theory, including Jacques Ellul and Ivan Illich, argue that the theory of technological imperative cannot be fully accurate, as not all areas of available progress are being exploited. The main argument stems from the lack of drive to create renewable energy sources. 

Here's a start to my section!

I think we should aim to have a start of everybody's bit up by Wednesday?

[[User:AlexaSoccer|AlexaSoccer]] ([[User talk:AlexaSoccer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexaSoccer|contribs]]) 09:55, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Sweet! That's really good, yeah I forgot to reference mine, well done for remembering. Yeah Wednesday is a good aim!

Yeah think that's a good idea. So it's just context/origin, notable determinists and criticism/debate left? [[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 15:07, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Has anyone found any really good readings for our topic? 

[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 12:14, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I've looked at the lecture slides- Marshall McLuhan, Raymond Williams, Daniel Chandler, etc.
[[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 14:25, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Looked at a few of the other groups, how do you want to lay it out, shall we have theorists first and a bit about them, or concepts along with theorists? [[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 14:39, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I think we should seperate it into two main parts - technological determinism and the opposite view of cultural determinism. Then maybe outline the theorists and theories associated with each?
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 14:49, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, I think that's a good idea. It's tricky because everything overlaps/connects! [[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 16:55, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Well we should be able to talk about how we overcome that issue for our presentation, woo progress! Ok i'm happy to give &quot;Notable Determinists&quot; and try and have some content up for later this evening. I will make sure to link any sources i find to you guys [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 17:23, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok guys i found some useful academic reading available here [http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=WWztFfsA-QEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=technological+determinism&amp;ots=aEmmMMUboN&amp;sig=SS_5VzO_OBSiPSKGquTWsaVie3Q#v=onepage&amp;q=technological%20determinism&amp;f=false This link ][[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 17:45, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Some further reading that I believe will be useful for assisting in the writing of the origin/context sections http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/tecdet/tdet02.html  [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 18:00, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Ooh thats good, I'll have a look! I've just done a bit on television as being a technology with a cause an effect which I think links to cultural determinsim. I'll just post it up here first..

Raymond Williams ‘insists that the future of our media will depend on our capacity to make informed judgements and decisions about that future.’
Our world, society and history are continually altered by whatever new technology comes along: the steam engine, the automobile, the atomic bomb. (Williams, 2003:1). Technology such as television is often argued that it has effects on social behaviour and cultural and psychological conditions. However these effects are the result of the technology being the cause. The notions of a cause and effect between a technology and society, a technology and a culture and a technology and a psychology are quite complex to apply answers and theories to. Williams, however goes on to analyse specifically television as a technology that results in cultural pattern shifts. 
Williams states that television has altered our world. In this sense it has been created ‘as a result of scientific and technical research’ yet television has been used in many other forms:

•	As a tool for social communication to construct social relationships.

•	It provides us with certain perceptions of reality within the world

•	It provides a strong mode of communication through news and entertainment

•	Through television advertising is made possible to promote goods to society

•	It follows a set of systems to what society wants from television by attending to opinions and styles of behaviour from what is produced.

Arguably the development of television and overall technology cannot be assumed to purposefully direct society into conforming to change. Technology should be considered as a typical invention of which is accidental in its proceedings (Williams, 2003:5). 

On the other hand, technology through significant media forces has reshaped the way in which humans behave, the structure of human societies and even language. Media even has the power to change governments (Collins &amp; Evans, 2006:50). 
[[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 18:03, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Sweet! Ok I added subheadings to the main concepts section just thought i'd let you guys know [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 18:24, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

After reading through the introduction it might be better to have the definition subheading under introduction rather than main concepts if you would rather split your introduction paragraph up [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 21:06, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I think we could keep the definition section under main concepts and have a separate introduction because they are kind of different. Would give us more content too.
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 21:35, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

The introduction sounds great well done, I think I'm getting to grips with this now after today's seminar and messing about on this for a bit. I'll happily cover the criticism's bit of of this and have this in after some reading, I'll post it on here first so you lot can have your say on it. I'll try get a few general resources as well. Remember our main way of engaging will be done by commenting on other groups and their pages, linking in our technological determinism on the posts of the other groups would be great. Would everyone want to meet up on Thursday? We could get one of the seminar type rooms in the library and stay there for a bit? Plus, sorry that I chose 'the coMEDIAns' as our group name, it's pretty bloody awful. ([[User:TallNorthernIrishEthan|TallNorthernIrishEthan]] ([[User talk:TallNorthernIrishEthan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TallNorthernIrishEthan|contribs]]) 22:31, 1 April 2014 (UTC))

Top work guys. I've been swamped with work but I'm free from tomorrow now so I'll work on Context/Origin. Again, will post here first to make sure we're all happy with it first off. I'm more than happy to meet up on Thursday if needs be as I have a free day. Will have this done. [[User:ElliotNotEthan|ElliotNotEthan]] ([[User talk:ElliotNotEthan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ElliotNotEthan|contribs]]) 22:41, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I think that's a good idea to meet on Thursday and get a group study room. Can all work on it at the same time if we bring laptops. Haha nah I think the group name is pretty good actually! So could I work on the definition and bulk it out a bit?
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 22:50, 1 April 2014 (UTC)


Sick guys - Thursday sounds good! As for the tech/cultural determinism bit i think we should definitely stay heavier on the tech part because that's our actual topic. As for the subheadings it seems like we're getting more based on what we're doing with our original bit which is good! I think it's gonna be hard not to go to broad though so we should be careful. Also, we should think of ways to start linking to other groups? 
[[User:AlexaSoccer|AlexaSoccer]] ([[User talk:AlexaSoccer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexaSoccer|contribs]]) 07:40, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

For the cultural determinism bit, how heavy do y'all want to make the content? What if we put that in the criticism bit as an alternative view?
[[User:AlexaSoccer|AlexaSoccer]] ([[User talk:AlexaSoccer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexaSoccer|contribs]]) 07:44, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah Connor, do you want to just edit that bit then? Thursday sounds great! For cultural determinism yeah it's to do with the way humans formate and behave from the way we are raised rather than how technology influences us, so it's definitely different! I think we can relate the two with a bit about Karl Marx maybe? Marx seems to be quite a key figure in social formations/changes (yeh I know he's everywhere...) What do you think?
[[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 08:58, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Oh and we can put him down as a notable determinist! [[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 09:13, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I think you can have tech determinism as the main part then cultural/criticism as the alternative view point. Is it alright that I do definition? Think we should split the introduction and definition into two seperate parts and would like to work on bulking out the definition part a bit.
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 12:42, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Seems like a good idea Sophie it allows us to put more detail into it but remember to take it out of the intro so we are not repeating points, it might also be a good idea to include a section that shows how Technological determinism underpins other areas such as always on etc... any thoughts? [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 13:16, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Showing how it underpins other areas would allow us to make contact with other groups and have a decent area to start talking on when it came to the presentation I think. [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 13:18, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Brilliant, I'll get cracking on with that then. Yeah I think that's a really good idea too, can talk to other groups and get more contribution as you say.
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 13:25, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Aside from Marshall McLuhan who would be considered a notable technological determinist? Has anyone found any reading on the matter? The best I seem to be able to find is Van Koten from the resource list? [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 14:07, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi guys - was thinking about your bit when doing my piece on 'Always-on'. It ties in with McLuhan's work so I've written this extra bit (its at the end of this post) - I was going to post it on the main book but thought I'd check-in with you guys first. Let me know what you think. &quot;McLuhan’s assertion that the medium is the message is perhaps now becoming a less unlikely theory than was first thought. He asserted that technology is like a bodily extension just like a hammer is an extension of the arm (REF) and the recent announcements by Google, Intel, and Facebook all that they were investing heavily in wearable technology is testimony to McLuhan’s theory. Facebook recently bought virtual reality technology firm Oculus VR for £1.2bn and Mark Zuckerberg claimed that “virtual reality will be the next social communications platform” (The Guardian, 25th March, 2014). His statement that this wearable technology will “change the way we work, play and communicate” (BBC 26th March, 2014) directly supports McLuhan’s stance.
Google’s new smart glasses, called ‘Google Glass’ will be designed by the makers of Ray-Ban sunglasses and Oakley sports glasses to ensure they were at the cutting edge of fashion (The Guardian, 25th March, 2014; BBC 25th March, 2014). Google Glass is a small screen attached to a pair of glasses which can record video, access email, and retrieve information from the web by connecting wirelessly to a user's mobile phone. Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, increased its investment in wearable technology by buying Basis Science, a company that has devices and services for tracking a person’s health, and wanted to accelerate its position in wearable technology (BBC 26th March, 2014).&quot; Cheers.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 14:35, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Seems like a really good idea George, as I am currently doing a section on notable determinists would you be ok with me adding a link to your section under my explanation of McLuhans idea of technology extending the human body? [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 14:40, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys thats me finished the section on McLuhans Global Village still have to do a section of his idea of technology extending the human body.

This is a term coined by McLuhan in reference to what he calls the Electronic culture that arises with the increased use of televisions and computers. A way of understanding this is that the improvement in technology has allowed for much quicker communication. In theory this allows for the entire world to be compressed into a Global Village where everyone can quickly communicate with each other, whereas in practice this has manifested itself through the internet allowing for an individual to have a much larger number of  near constant social connections. A very recent example of this would be the case of popular social media site Facebook in which an average adult user is said to have 338 friends which clearly shows the breaking down of distance and ease of communication that McLuhan conveys in his idea of the global village.
McLuhan also suggests that the people who live in this electronic culture, or global village gain all the benefits and downfalls of new technologies and so whereas distances are no longer a problem for communication, technology barriers and development or lack of it can still provide issues(Smith,R and Marx,L. 1994.)   [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 15:17, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Connor - no problem with you making that link to our section under your explanation of McLuhans idea of technology extending the human body. Your material looks really good. Do you want me to paste the bit above onto your main page along with the references?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 15:29, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

That would be a great help and fits very nicely with our content thanks very much George. [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 15:34, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah that would be great George, thank you. I've booked a study room in the library for us all tomorrow if everyone can still make it. It's room 1 and booked from 12-4.
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 15:46, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I added a little more content to my Global Village part as i felt it was lacking

This puts people in potential contact with more people than they could meet or speak to in their lifetime and hence again strengthens the idea of the global village. Another idea of this is that through the quick access and speed of response that comes with this type of technology we are able to react to global issues far faster than previous. Therefore issues that may have once not have been of concern can be addressed by a much bigger crowd, this follows the same underlying concept of increasing technology reducing distances and effectively making the world a smaller more accessible place.

Ok will do - I'll transfer it across when you main page has its headings and subheadings etc. so that I know where to put it.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 16:18, 2 April 2014 (UTC)


Great work Connor! I've been using Harvard referencing, but how do you guys want to reference so they're not all different? I think we should all start posting up on the main page so it's easier for everyone to see what informations been posted so nothing is getting repeated! I'm going to post up my little section on Raymond Williams in the criticism and debate section if thats ok?

== Tech Imperative Posting ==

Hey guys - here's what I'm going to post to the main page for my section... I posted to the Always On folk about using their disinhibition stuff so hopefully i'll put that in there soon!
__________________________________

Technological imperative, also known as the inevitability thesis,  is the assumption that technology cannot be stopped in its development, and that technological progress is irreversible, unavoidable, and inevitable. Essentially, this theory assumes that because we are able to do something because of a particular technology, we ought to, must, or will do it. It is the theory that what can be done, will be done, whether or not it is moral, good, or productive for mankind. 


This is important to technological determinism as it recognizes the influence of technology on action. It drives society to act on not only what they are able to do, but also push the boundaries and test limits because, as John von Neumann observed, “technological possibilities are irresistible to man”. (Mumford 1971, p. 186) With this, the theory acknowledges the shift from technology as a means to technology as an end. Critics of the theory, including Jacques Ellul and Ivan Illich, argue that the theory of technological imperative cannot be fully accurate, as not all areas of available progress are being exploited. The main argument stems from the lack of drive to create renewable energy sources.


&quot;Arnold Pacey suggests that the technological imperative is commonly taken to be 'the lure of always pushing toward the greatest feat of technical performance or complexity which is currently available' (Pacey 1983, p. 79). The mathematician John von Neumann wrote with some alarm that 'technological possibilities are irresistible to man.' (in Mumford 1971, p. 186). Jacques Soustelle declared of the atomic bomb that 'Since it was possible, it was necessary' (in Ellul 1964, p. 99). And fatalists might add that since we can now destroy the planet, in time we will. The technological imperative is a common assumption amongst commentators on 'new technologies'. They tell us, for instance, that the 'information technology revolution' is inevitably on its way and our task as users is to learn to cope with it.&quot;[1]


According to McLuhan, the media dictates the message - an argument that becomes extremely relevant when according to technological imperative, society is unable to resist the development of technology and so also the continual development of media platforms.

'Deterministic perspectives have been common amongst commentators on communication technologies. Theorists who have argued that changes in communication technologies have had an important cultural impact have tended either to regard such changes as limited to social and institutional practices or, far more radically, have argued that such changes have also had profound psychological consequences, transforming the nature of human consciousness.' I'm adding this into my section on origin and content but if anyone thinks its more relevant to their section feel free to use it. Took it from this site which is quite useful - http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/tecdet/tdet11.html [[User:ElliotNotEthan|ElliotNotEthan]] ([[User talk:ElliotNotEthan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ElliotNotEthan|contribs]]) 12:56, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok guys thats me done (some) of the writing for McLuhans idea of extending the human body, its short but i was thinking we could put Georges piece as a follow on from mine? thoughts? --
This is the assertion by McLuhan that technology are tools that extend the human body and more accurately, extend or amplifies the abilities of the visual and aural senses mainly. Examples of this would be the television extending the visual senses or the telephone extending the aural. McLuhan goes on to say that technology in fact changes the way we act in society  and that nowadays people “wears its brain outside its skull and its nerves outside its hide” (McLuhan, 1966) (4.) Although at first this may seem an obscure and nonsensical view it can be comprehended in that much of the technology we use for interacting and viewing the world start at our fingertips and with the technology that we consume. [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 13:00, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok I've just added my bit on the overview and definition of technological determinism. I've added this part for introduction:
Technological determinism in its most basic form is the idea that technology has a significant effect on society. The theory presents the idea that technology is the reason for developments in our society, influencing our lives at a number of levels. Determinists believe that technology influences society on different levels; impacting on industry, the way we communicate and even shapes individuals. 

Then I've put in a heading 'overview' and moved Annie's section with my additional part on strong/weak determinism:

Technological determinism comes in two main variations – a strong and weaker form. 

•	Strong or hard determinism argues that technology is the foremost or sole reason for the way society is structured and any development in our culture. Technology is seen as the “prime mover in history” (Chandler, 2000:1).

•	Weak or soft determinism is a less extreme argument, more approved of by scholars. It sees technology as more of an enabler for societal change. Rather than viewing technology as the sole or primary reason for anything that happens in society, it takes into account other factors and argues that technology gives us opportunities for development but does not necessarily cause it.

Yeah Connor that's a good idea to put George's section in there and can add a link to their chapter.

Ok Sophie that's fine! I'll do the section on science, history and technology if that's cool and I've added a bit onto Karl Marx [[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 13:11, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Just about to add this to the criticisms bit, that okay? 

Further criticism of Technological Determinism is found in the idea that the theory is written in a broad sense. McLuhan also fails to mention how technologies are constructed yet implicitly speaks of the way in which humans interact with technology. McLuhan also fails to acknowledge the idea of ‘technological innovation’ this is despite the fact that this technologies are created through the human interplay with various technologies that McLuhan holds in high regard (Cana 2003).

I'll add the references obviously!

So the reading room told me how to set up a link between chapters so have put links to chapter 2 and 3 under the headings of online identity and always on. What sort of thing are you looking at Annie?
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 14:53, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Like how science and technology have advanced throughout history, and its effects on the world etc. I've done a little bit but it's getting good examples I think and sources. Connor, how about Ray Kurzweil as a notable determinist? [[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 15:00, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Ah ok, will have a look to find some sources to help with that. I've just added a paragraph to the section on how tech determinism links to always on.

After reading over the overview i realise it mentions hot and cool media types which we haven't discussed throughout the chapter yet so i will write a section up and put it under the Marshall McLuhan section [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 18:38, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Oh yeah, think we mentioned that before. Would you like me to help with any of the content? 
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 18:41, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

You could write the piece on Hamid Van Koten if you wanted to, my thought was to write about light on/through media and put it in the notable determinist section. I'd also mention how he had been fairly heavily influenced by McLuhan Reading from week 2 should help for this [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 19:08, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah that's brilliant, thanks! Will get on with that. Yeah sounds like it would be a good addition to the notable determinists section as we only have McLuhan right now. 
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 19:11, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks Sophie thats good! Ok well I'll help and do Ray Kurzweil as another one too [[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 19:23, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Does anyone know whether it was Van Koten who came up with the light on/light through notion? I know he writes about it but doesn't explicitly say who came up with it.
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 19:48, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Unfortunately im not sure Sophie, That's me done the Hot or Cool media section though im going to go ahead and post ti to the book  -- A way in which Mcluhan categorises different forms of media is through a temperature type scale in which there are both hot and cool types of media, as with much of McLuhan's writings this is not an initially intuitive process. A media type is considered hot if it heavily utilises and immerses one sense in particular. An example of this may be the comparison of a photograph which gives a large and detailed amount of visual information and hence a hot media form to a sketched cartoon which gives a minimal amount of information visually. (Van Koten, 2009) Furthermore McLuhan suggests that it is cool media that involves a higher amount of interpretation from the consumer than hotter forms of media. This can again be thought of as a photo presenting visual information more clearly where as a drawing may need to be interpreted in terms of shapes and colours and a have a meaning drawn less easily from this.  [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 19:59, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Also do you think it would be beneficial to add a table of different types of hot and cool media to this section? I was also thinking of adding a critisism section to hot and cool media and say why it is no longer applicable? [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 20:00, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok, no worries. Will just put it the light on/light through notion as an alternative to your section on hot and cool. Yeah think a table would be a good idea. There's quite a good one in the Van Koten reading or this website I found on hot and cool: http://tribes.tribe.net/marshallmcluhan/thread/72cd0899-94ec-42c2-a6db-2de4fa4cec1e and yeah criticism would probably be good too. 
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 20:10, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks Sophie that was very helpful, are you going to put it under Notable determinists or under criticisms? I thought you could have put it under notable determinists and mentioned that he was influenced by McLuhan and carried his ideas on. Just my thoughts on the matter, i'll get cracking with criticisms of hot and cool media categorisations. [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 20:29, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

No bother. Well I was going to put it under hot and cool media as it ties in really well with that and I can't find anything directly on Van Koten. He seems to have just written about other people rather than being a main theorist himself. Would that be ok with you? 

This is what I have written so far...Similar to McLuhan’s idea of hot and cool media is the notion of light on and light through media. ‘Light on’ media is where the light source bounces off a surface or object before hitting the viewers’ eyes. Therefore the light is projected onto a screen (Van Koten, 2009). ‘Light through’ media is where the light source is positioned in front of audience; therefore making the audience the screen by projecting light onto them (Van Koten, 2009). In likeness to hot and cool media, ‘light on’ would be described as hot because it is “all revealing” where ‘light through’ is less revealing, more “mysterious” so therefore cool (Van Koten, 2009, p.91). An example of ‘light on’ media is cinema, with light coming from behind the audience and no room for interaction. An example of ‘light through’ media is television where the light projects from the TV onto the viewers and gives them more room for interpretation and interaction. 
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 20:33, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

That seems fair, here is my peice that i will put under the critisism section of the book on hot and cool media -- As McLuhan has the tendency of doing in his writing the Hot and Cool media temperature scale comes with a number of criticisms due to the somewhat vague nature it is described in. Firstly there is no actual way of measuring the temperature of a media form and so being able to determine is one type of media is hotter or cooler than another. This means that it is a subjective scale and that any consensus comes down to the opinions of the people using it, therefore leaving it prone to bias and somewhat less useful. To add to this the scale can only be used when comparing two media forms that have somewhat similar aims or place emphasis on the same senses such as the radio and telephone. As much of McLuhan's work is not particularly recent it also does not include or take into consideration many recent updates in technology.Examples of this would be the improvement of televisions with high definition capabilities and video calling technology availability commonly on smart phones and therefore it can in many cases be discarded as a flawed method of gauging media.

I'll help you contribute to that glossary aswell now Ethan. My topic seems very short (the actual tech determinism wiki only has one sentence on origins!) so I'll dedicate a bit of time to that now.

No problem Elliot, sounds good. I'm starting with adding the terms 'technological innovation', 'hot and cold media' and 'online identity'.

Ok I've just posted this bit up on Ray Kurweil in notable determinists although I shall try to add a bit more about him.

Ray Kurzweil, a futurist specified in speech recognition technology and the future of technology such as robotics and biotechnology is notable as a technological determinist with his assessment of the history of technology and its rate of progress. 

Kurzweil assumes that the rate of progress of technology is at such a high speed that technological intelligence will surpass human intelligence within a few decades (Kurzweil, 382). He argues that although the future holds technological change so fast human nature will take longer to adapt to changes and the rapid pace of innovation.

I've added a few things to the glossary aswell including 'the medium is the message' 'non Marxist' and 'social media.

I'm going to try and add another few things to the glossary to beef it out further as it's one of the few things we can really add to at this stage, hope that's okay! I'll have another read through it and see if anymore edits need to be made aswell.

Yeah that's great. Saw you had put a bit up on online identity Alexa so have just added my section into what you had. 
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 14:53, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Just remember to press the minor edits button for those kind of things (spelling mistakes etc) [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 15:04, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I've just edged out a few things on the page there, does a minor edits button come up each time you edit the page? ([[User:TallNorthernIrishEthan|TallNorthernIrishEthan]] ([[User talk:TallNorthernIrishEthan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TallNorthernIrishEthan|contribs]]) 15:20, 4 April 2014 (UTC))

Yeah its a little tick box at the bottom, also guys you might want to add yourselves to the contributors section on the home page do this by using only 3 tildes (~)   [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 15:30, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I've just added myself to the main users page too.

Hi there! I'd be up for doing that! I should have the gaming part up today and how it blends the real and imaginary identities, so then I can try integrate your part :) This sounds like a really interesting point of discussion!

      <comment>/* Sample XUnit Test */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Background =
Git has many features for managing data when many users are changing files around the world.  Git has tools for seeing who has changed what data and how to view the differences.  These features are not available in eXist (yet).  However their is no standard REST interface for git.

= Installing eXgit =
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Note: this is a work in progress.  Not done!  We hope to have a packinging tool and
a simple to install .xar file in the future.&lt;/font&gt;

The software for eXgit is stored on github here:

   https://github.com/shabanovd/eXgit

This software depends on the Git Java library here:

   https://github.com/eclipse/egit-github

You will need to build this project but the ONLY jar you need is:

  org.eclipse.jgit.jar (Note, this is a 1.7MB file)

To build this I downloaded the zip file from github and did &quot;mvn install&quot;.  I did get errors so I had to do Mavin build with no tests:

   mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

Once you have both the jar files you can put them into $EXIST/lib/user

  eXgit-0.3.0.jar
  org.eclipse.jgit.jar

You can now build the &quot;xar file:

   $ ant

This will put a build/eXgit-0.2.2.xar (about 1.6MB with the two jar files)

You can then load this into your eXist dashboard.

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Note, for some reason the jar files are not working.  We removed the reference to them in exist.xml and the build file and just manually copied them into the $EXIST_HOME/lib/user area.&lt;/font&gt;

Note that now the .xar file is about 2K!

= Testing Installation =
You must have a local git checkout.

Use this as your import statement:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace git=&quot;http://exist-db.org/git&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample XUnit Test ==
To test this you can clone any git repository.  For example the following will make a copy
of the eXide project in /db/exide.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
import module namespace git=&quot;http://exist-db.org/git&quot;;
git:clone(&quot;https://github.com/wolfgangmm/eXide.git&quot;, &quot;/db/exide&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

After this test runs you will notice that a .git file has been created in /db/exide/.git with all the git administrative files

[[File:Git-clone-to-exist-result.png|center|frame|Screen image after git repository has been cloned into eXist.]]

= Sample Unit Test =

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace git=&quot;http://exist-db.org/git&quot;;

let $git-checkout-dir := 'd:\ws\exist'

return
&lt;testcase name=&quot;status&quot; classname=&quot;http://exist-db.org/git&quot;&gt;
   {git:status($git-checkout-dir, '', false())}
&lt;/testcase&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

A novel by Kurdish-Syrian novelit Haitham Hussein in Arabic (آرام سليل الأوجاع المكابرة)  publisher: Dar Al Yanabih, Sweden 2006, Second edition by Dar Al Nahrin, Damascus 2010.
&lt;ref&gt;http://kurdistantribune.com/2012/haitham-hussein-continuing-story-of-syrian-kurd-novelist/&lt;/ref&gt;This novel talks about the yearning for returning home. His two main characters have the same name, Aram, and reflect a general phenomenon, not just an individual case. One is trying to immigrate to Germany and the other Aram lived in Germany for years. Hussein shows how the Syrian government by commission played a role of pushing Kurdish youths to leave their cities for anonymous places. Aram lives the cultural shock in Germany but, at a certain point in life, he decides to return home despite the unfair practices against him. In the face of tyranny, he decides to agitate for a revolution, landing into prison where he is tortured.  He gets released and, unfazed, wants to start again in a show to his fellow desperate souls that life neither stops nor will the current slow down for a resistant fish and that beautiful days will come. This novel shows the psychological side of the Kurdish people and their rebellion before the Syrian Revolution.

== Explanation ==

Foreign Keys defines a directed reference from one table (the child) to another table (the parent). This reference act as long as the involved columns of the two tables contain identical values. It couples one row of the child table to a single row of the parent table - a row of the parent table may be coupled by many rows of the child table.

E.g.: You may have the table ''department'' with column ''id'' and the table ''employee'' with column ''dept_id''. If you want to assign an employee to a distinct department, you store the department-id in its column ''dept_id''. This can be done in every case - independent from any Foreing Key definition. But in such cases people often have two additional requirements: First, employees shall only be assigned to such departments, which really exists. Second, as long as employees are assigned to a distinct department, it shall be impossible to delete this department. The main purpose of Foreign Keys is to guarantee this two requirements.

With other words: Foreign Keys guarantee that '''no orphans''' will arise.

== Foreign Key vs. Join ==

Within rDBMS identical values are used to link rows of different - and sometimes of the same - table together. Because this linking works on the basis of values and not of any link or special reference it has no direction. In general we call this technic a '''JOIN'''. '''Foreign Keys''' have a very similar concept because they also link rows with identical values together. But there are important differences:

:*Foreign Keys have a direction. It is important to know which one of the two affected tables is the child table and which one is the parent table.
:*Joins must be expressed within every DML statement which is interested in this join (with the exception of views). In contrast Foreign Keys are part of table definitions. All DML commands bear them in mind without expressing them within a DML statement.

== Syntax ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
-- As part of CREATE TABLE command
CREATE TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; (
  ...
  CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint_name&gt; FOREIGN KEY (&lt;column_name&gt;) REFERENCES &lt;parent_table_name&gt; (&lt;other_column_name&gt;)
);

-- As part of ALTER TABLE command
ALTER TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; ADD  CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint_name&gt; ... ; -- same as above
ALTER TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; DROP CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint_name&gt;;      -- throw the definition away
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Rules:
:*FK-constraints can be defined during table definition (CREATE TABLE) or afterwards (ALTER TABLE). On this page we focus on the CREATE TABLE statement. The syntax of the ALTER TABLE statement is very similar.
:*FK-constraints belong to the child table definition.
:*Despite of an existing FK-constraint it is possible that rows of the child table don't belong to any parent row. This occures if the column value of the child row is NULL. If you want do avoid such situations, define the column as 'NOT NULL'.
:*Although the FK-constraints belong to the child table, they also have consequences for the parent table such that rows of the parent table, which have existing rows in the child table, can not be deleted.
:*The denoted parent table must exist.
:*The denoted column of the parent table must be its Primary Key or a column which is UNIQUE.
:*It is perfectly right to use the same table as parent and child table within one FK-constraint, see: [[Structured Query Language/Foreign_Key#Exercises|Exercises]].
:*One table may be subject of a lot of FK-contraints.

== Example ==
The example defines the tables ''department'' and ''employee''. The Foreign Key definition of ''employee'' declares ''department'' as the parent table of ''emploeyee''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- The parent table: DEPARTMENT
CREATE TABLE department (
  id         DECIMAL,
  dept_no    CHAR(10),
  dept_name  VARCHAR(100),
  CONSTRAINT dept_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- The child table: EMPLOYEE
CREATE TABLE employee (
  id         DECIMAL,
  emp_name   VARCHAR(100),
  dept_id    DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT emp_pk PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT emp_dept_fk FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES department(id)
);

-- This INSERT will fail because actually there is no department with id 10.
INSERT INTO employee   (id, emp_name, dept_id)  VALUES (1, 'Mike Baker', 10);
COMMIT;

-- It's necessary to store the department first.
INSERT INTO department (id, dept_no, dept_name) VALUES (10,'D10', 'E-Bike Development');
INSERT INTO employee   (id, emp_name, dept_id)  VALUES (1, 'Mike Baker', 10);
COMMIT;

-- The department may have a lot of empolyees
INSERT INTO employee   (id, emp_name, dept_id)  VALUES (2, 'Elenore McNeal', 10);
INSERT INTO employee   (id, emp_name, dept_id)  VALUES (3, 'Ted Walker', 10);
COMMIT;

-- This DELETE will fail because actually there are employees within the department.
DELETE FROM department WHERE dept_name = 'E-Bike Development';
COMMIT;

&lt;/source&gt;

This kind of modelling allows the representation of hierarchical tree structures. One or many child nodes (rows) belong to a single parent node (row). In the context of DBMS this kind of association is called a 1:m relationship.

== n:m Relationship ==
In the real world there are more association types than 1:m relationships. Often there are so called n:m relationships where objects (rows) belong to more than 1 other object (row). Thereby the meaning of parent/child tables gets lost. In our [[Structured Query Language/Example Database Structure#person_hobby|example database]] there is a table ''hobby'' and another table ''person''. One person may pursue multiple hobbies. At the same time multiple persons may pursue the same hobby. This can be designed by creating a third table between the two original tables. The third table holds the id's of the first and second table. So one can decide which person persues which hobby.

The technique to realize this n:m situation is the same as shown in the previous chapter with its 1:m assoziation - it is only used twice. We define two Foreign Keys which starts from the 'table-in-the-middle' and refers the two other tables. In a technical sense we can say, that the 'table-in-the-middle' is the child table for the two parent tables ''person'' and ''hobby''. ''person'' and ''hobby'' are at the same logical level.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
CREATE TABLE t1 (
  id               DECIMAL,
  name             VARCHAR(50),
  -- ...
  CONSTRAINT t1_pk               PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE t2 (
  id               DECIMAL,
  name             VARCHAR(50),
  -- ...
  CONSTRAINT t2_pk               PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE t1_t2 (
  id               DECIMAL,
  t1_id            DECIMAL,
  t2_id            DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_pk            PRIMARY KEY (id),       -- also this table should have its own Primary Key
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_unique        UNIQUE (t1_id, t2_id),  -- every link should occur only once
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_1          FOREIGN KEY (t1_id) REFERENCES t1(id),
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_2          FOREIGN KEY (t2_id) REFERENCES t2(id)
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== ON DELETE / ON UPDATE ==

So far we have assumed that rows of the parent table cannot be deleted if a row in the child table exists which refers to this parent row. This is the default, but all in all the SQL standard defines five options to handle this parent/child situation in various ways. The options extend the constraint definition. They are:
:*ON DELETE CASCADE: If a row of the parent table is deleted, then all matching rows in the referencing table are deleted.
:*ON DELETE SET NULL: If a row of the parent table is deleted, then all referencing columns in all matching rows of the child table are set to NULL.
:*ON DELETE SET DEFAULT: If a row of the parent table is deleted, then all referencing columns in all matching rows of the child table are set to the column’s default value.
:*ON DELETE RESTRICT: It is prohibited to delete a row of the parent table if that row has any matching rows in the child table. The point in time when checking occures can be deferred until COMMIT.
:*ON DELETE NO ACTION (the default): It is prohibited to delete a row of the parent table if that row has any matching rows in the child table. This holds true in ALL cases, even if checking is deferred (see next chapter).

Analog to the ON DELETE option there is an ON UPDATE option. It defines the same five options for the case of changing a column in the parent table which is referred by the column of a child table.
:*ON UPDATE CASCADE: Any change to a referenced column in the parent table causes the same change to the corresponding referencing column in matching rows of the child table.
:*ON UPDATE SET NULL: Any change to a referenced column in the parent table causes the corresponding referencing column in matching rows of the child table to be set to null.
:*ON UPDATE SET DEFAULT: Any change to a referenced column in the referenced table causes the corresponding referencing column in matching rows of the referencing table to be set to its default value.
:*ON UPDATE RESTRICT: It is prohibited to change a row of the parent table if that row has any matching rows in the child table. The point in time when checking occures can be deferred until COMMIT.
:*ON UPDATE NO ACTION (the default): It is prohibited to change a row of the parent table if that row has any matching rows in the child table. This holds true in ALL cases, even if checking is deferred (see next chapter).

If ON DELETE or ON UPDATE are not specified, the default action NO ACTION will occur. In some systems the NO ACTION is implemented in the sense of the RESTRICT option.

An Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
CREATE TABLE t1_t2 (
  ...
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_1 FOREIGN KEY (t1_id) REFERENCES t1(id)
                        ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT,
  ...
);
&lt;/source&gt;

Hint 1: The concept of updating Primary Keys is discussed controversial.
 
Hint 2: Not all DBMS supports all options.

== IMMEDIATE / DEFERRED ==
There is an additional option to decide at what point in time the evaluation of the Foreign Key definition shall occur. The default behaviour is to check it with each UPDATE and DELETE command. The second possibility is deferring the check until the end of the transaction, which is the COMMIT command. The purpose of this deferring is to put applications in the position to modify parent tables '''before''' child tables (which may be helpfull if they utilize [[w:Hibernate_(Java)|Hibernate]]).

To define this option the constraint definition must be extended by the key words [NOT] DEFERABLE, which are pre- or postfixed by INITIALLY IMMEDIATE (the default) or INITIALLY DEFERRED to specify the initial state after the CREATE TABLE point in time. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
CREATE TABLE t1_t2 (
  ...
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_1 FOREIGN KEY (t1_id) REFERENCES t1(id)
                        ON UPDATE CASCADE  DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE
                        ON DELETE RESTRICT DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED,
  ...
);
&lt;/source&gt;

Hint: MySQL does not support the DEFERRABLE option, but the Foreign Key checking can be activated and deactived dynamically by 'SET foreign_key_checks = 0/1;'

== The Chicken-Egg Problem ==

Sometimes applications run into cyclic dependencies: Table A contains a reference to table B and vice versa, e.g.: A table ''team'' contains the columns ''id'', ''team_name'' and ''team_leader'' (which is an id to a player) and the table ''player'' contains the columns ''id'', ''player_name'' and ''team_id''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
CREATE TABLE team (
  id               DECIMAL,
  team_name        VARCHAR(50),
  team_leader      DECIMAL,      -- ID of a player
  CONSTRAINT team_pk             PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE player (
  id               DECIMAL,
  player_name      VARCHAR(50),
  team_id          DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT player_pk           PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

ALTER TABLE team   ADD CONSTRAINT team_fk   FOREIGN KEY (team_leader) REFERENCES player(id);
ALTER TABLE player ADD CONSTRAINT player_fk FOREIGN KEY (team_id)     REFERENCES team(id);
&lt;/source&gt;

So far, so bad. When the first team-row shall be inserted, the player-row is missed. When the player-row is inserted first, the team-row is missed.

As we have seen above, there is a DEFER option. Using this option the FK-constraints must be defined such that they are not evaluated immediate with the INSERT commands. They shall be evaluated after all INSERTs at the COMMIT point in time.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Throw the above definitions away ...
ALTER TABLE team   DROP CONSTRAINT team_fk;
ALTER TABLE player DROP CONSTRAINT player_fk;
-- ... and use DEFERRABLE
ALTER TABLE team   ADD  CONSTRAINT team_fk   
                        FOREIGN KEY (team_leader) REFERENCES player(id) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
ALTER TABLE player ADD  CONSTRAINT player_fk
                        FOREIGN KEY (team_id)     REFERENCES team(id)   DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we can insert data in any sequence (don't miss to deactivate [[Structured_Query_Language/COMMIT_and_ROLLBACK#AUTOCOMMIT|AUTOCOMMIT]]).

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
INSERT INTO team   (id, team_name,   team_leader) VALUES (1, 'Wild Tigers',  1);
INSERT INTO player (id, player_name, team_id)     VALUES (1, 'Johnny Crash', 1);
-- No checking of Foreign Keys up to here
COMMIT;   -- Commit includes the check of Foreign Keys
&lt;/source&gt;

== DROP TABLE / TRUNCATE TABLE ==

Foreign Keys have implications to [[Structured_Query_Language/Drop_Table|DROP TABLE]] and [[Structured_Query_Language/TRUNCATE|TRUNCATE TABLE]] commands. As long as a Foreign Key refers a parent table, this table cannot be dropped (remove structure and data) or truncated (remove data only). This holds true even if there is no actual row refering any row in the parent table - the existence of the Foreign Key is sufficient to refuse DROP and TRUNCATE.

To use DROP or TRUNCATE it is necessary to drop the constraint first.

Hint: Some implementations offer a DISABLE/ENABLE command to deactivate constraints temporarily.


== Exercises ==

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Is it possible that the parent table of a FK-constraint contains 1 row and the child table is empty?
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
Yes. Parents without children are absolutly normal.
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Is it possible that the child table of a FK-constraint contains 1 row and the parent table is empty?
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
Yes. Although the main purpose of FK-constraints is the prevention of children without parents (orphans), this situation may occur.&lt;br /&gt;If the column of the child row contains the NULL value, this row relates to no parent row&lt;br /&gt;because 'null = &lt;any value&gt;' evaluates always to UNKNOWN and never to TRUE, even if that &lt;any value&gt; is the NULL value.
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Create a table ''genealogy'' which stores information about people and their anchestors. The columns are: id, first_name, last_name, birth_name, father_id, mother_id.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE genealogy (
  id             DECIMAL                           PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name     VARCHAR(100),
  last_name      VARCHAR(100),
  birth_name     VARCHAR(100),
  father_id      DECIMAL,
  mother_id      DECIMAL
);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Extend the table ''genealogy'' by two FK-contraints such that the columns 'father_id' and 'mother_id' refer to other rows of this table.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE genealogy ADD CONSTRAINT gen_fk_1 FOREIGN KEY (father_id) REFERENCES genealogy(id);
ALTER TABLE genealogy ADD CONSTRAINT gen_fk_2 FOREIGN KEY (mother_id) REFERENCES genealogy(id);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Insert some data into 'genealogy', e.g.: data from your personal family.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- For the first rows store NULL in 'father_id' and 'mother_id'!
INSERT INTO genealogy (id, first_name, last_name, birth_name, father_id, mother_id)
               VALUES (1,  'Mike',     'Miller',  'Miller',   null,      null);
INSERT INTO genealogy (id, first_name, last_name, birth_name, father_id, mother_id)
               VALUES (2,  'Eve',      'Miller',  'Summer',   null,      null);
INSERT INTO genealogy (id, first_name, last_name, birth_name, father_id, mother_id)
               VALUES (3,  'Marry',    'Dylan',   'Miller',   1,      2);
INSERT INTO genealogy (id, first_name, last_name, birth_name, father_id, mother_id)
               VALUES (4,  'Henry',    'Dylan',   'Dylan',    null,      3);
COMMIT;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>/* Using definitions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Template:Wikibooks:IB/Menu}}
== Definitions ==
=== Definition or glossary pages ===
Definitions in a particular subject should be found on a page of their own, for example:

 IB/Group 4/Computer Science/'''Definitions'''

i.e.

 IB/''Group''/''Subject''/'''Definitions'''

The definitions page should be ordered alphabetically using a alphabetic table of contents. A standard template for definition pages is:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{DISPLAYTITLE:Definitions}}{{CompactTOC8}}[[Category:IB/Definitions]]
===A===
===B===
===...===
===Y===
===Z===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== Adding definitions ===
To add a definition to the definition page, simply use the following markup:

 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;IB/Define|'''Term'''|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''The full definition of the term.'''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;#125;&amp;#125;

Notice that inside the definition there are html tags for &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This is important in abstracting the definition for later display.

The new definition markup will produce something along the lines of:
{{IB/Define|Term|&lt;onlyinclude&gt;The full definition of the term.&lt;onlyinclude&gt;}}

=== Using definitions ===
To display a definition in the body of some text you can use the following:
 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;IB/Definition|namespace|'''Term'''|float&amp;#125;&amp;#125;

The &lt;code&gt;namespace&lt;/code&gt; of the definition is an important attribute. It points the template to the correct definitions page, and for this reason it is the first attribute. The namespace must be the path to the subject, i.e. &lt;code&gt;''group''/''subject''&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;'''Term'''&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;u&gt;case sensitive&lt;/u&gt; and represents the definition found on the definition page. The &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; is optional and allows you to choose where the definition boxes lies; either on the &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;.

For example, this:

 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;IB/Definition|Group 4/Computer Science|Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU)&amp;#125;&amp;#125;

produces:

{{IB/Definition|Group 4/Computer Science|Absolute path}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">You suggest that Clay Shirky has come up with this concept. Ok - citation??? [[User:GregXenon01|GregXenon01]] ([[User talk:GregXenon01|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GregXenon01|contribs]]) 14:59, 28 March 2014 (UTC)


HI, I've noticed you mention Lanier and I think what he says really applies to what we have been writing about in our [[Digital Media and Culture Yearbook 2014/Chapter 5: Crowdsourcing|Examples and Applications]] section. We've discovered that indeed the collective can be brilliant, people working in collaboration and towards the same aim allows for amazing accomplishments. So far, we have only discussed the collective being 'stupid' in an example where crowdsourcing was used to hunt for the potential [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombings Boston Marathon Bombings] suspects and lead to false accusations from the online community. I'm wondering whether you plan to write about any other negative examples that we could collaborate on or discuss in relation to crowdsourcing?

Hi, I am also from the Crowdsourcing group and was wondering if it'd be alright with everyone that add a link to here from our page. It goes really well with our material and I think we could both draw on each other's info to make stronger pages. Cheers!

Hi, Rkmraf, I'm not sure if we have anymore negative examples, but I'm sure we could look for some then collaborate with you! Everything links together anyway, so I'm sure we will be able to discuss it in relation to crowdsourcing.

::I figure that Cognitive Surplus concerns, by and large, the creative (thus positive) contributions from people since it's the constructive use of time, as you have said, to create value. This is why there seems to be very little negativity surrounding the topic. I have read that this is one of the criticisms of Shirky's book however. Of particular interest was this short response to The New York Times review of the book: '[http://buzzmachine.com/2010/08/07/bad-things-could-happen/ Bad Things Could Happen]', it may be worth exploring the ''bad'' or the not-so-great side of Cognitive Surplus on the Internet. Hope you find it somewhat interesting! [[User:Rkmraf|Rkmraf]] ([[User talk:Rkmraf|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rkmraf|contribs]]) 18:10, 2 April 2014 (UTC)


Hi, Kylie, yes that would be absolutely fine to add a link, it's a great idea! [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 09:01, 2 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

{{quote|The Spanish Civil War of 1936 to 1939 was a class war, and a culture war. Competing visions of Spanish identity were superimposed on a bitter struggle over material resources, as the defenders of property, religion and tradition took up arms against a Republican government committed to social reform, devolution, and secularisation.|Frances Lannon, ''The Spanish Civil War''}}

{{quote|'A civil war is not a war but a sickness,' wrote Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. 'The enemy is within. One fights almost against oneself.' Yet Spain's tragedy in 1936 was even greater. It had become enmeshed in the international cibvil war, which started in earnest with the Bolshevik revolution.|From Antony Beevor, ''The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936−1936'', 2006}}

The Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936 after more than a century of social, economic and political division. Half a million people died in this conflict between 1936 and 1939.

== Long-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political instability (1920−1931) ==
In the 19th century, Spain had struggled between periods of conservatism and liberalism.

== Long-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political instability (1920−1931) ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Long-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political instability (1920−1931)}}}|Long-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political instability (1920−1931)|
* Struggle between conservatism and liberalism.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
=== Weakness of government ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Weakness of government}}}|Weakness of government|
* 1971 onwards Spain was a constitutional monarchy with a parliament that retained little power.
* Political control shifted between the wealthy oligarchs and their various cliques.
* Two main parties, Conservatives and Liberals, with very little difference between them.
* Elections were rigged or decided in private.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
=== The role of the Spanish Army ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The role of the Spanish Army}}}|The role of the Spanish Army|
* Army had powerful political position due to imperial past.
* It intervened in politics if a crisis occurred to defend its interests.
* It was unpopular, had a reputation for brutality, and was expensive and required heavy taxes.
* It was ineffective, as proven by: the loss of the Spanish Empire during the 19th century; the American war in 1898; and the struggle to keep Morocco between 1906 to 1926.
* It was too big with too many officers and overly middle class.
* Army was conservationist, traditional, nationalistic and 'Africannistas.'
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
=== The role of the church ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The role of the church}}}|The role of the church|
* Catholic church was rich and powerful, with guaranteed role in education and the economy.
* Its wealth was used to gain political and social influence.
* It used its power for economic conservatism and to oppose modernising and liberal forces.
* Defended the upper class as many of the clergy were aristocrats, who helped fund.
* In many urban areas and rural areas there were protests against the church.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
=== Economic causes ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Economic causes}}}|Economic causes|
* Spain was mainly an agricultural economy, and it was inefficient, thus not providing sufficient food and its work was seasonal.
* Most lived in abject poverty, with an enormous gap between rich and poor.
* Rioting and disorder often broke out in the countryside, with the Civil Guard deployed to ruthlessly repress.
* No support from Church made some groups support the anarchists who argued for land redistribution.
* Many small landholders were conservative, resisted socialist/anarchist ideas, and were exploited by the Catholic Agrarian Federation who provided support for their beliefs, only to later support Franco.
* There was a need for modernisation and reform, and was limited by endemic poverty.
* Workers in twos faced low wages, long hours, unregulated working conditions, poor housing, and little welfare provision.
* This situation led to a growth in trade unionism, which, however, failed to achieve anything substantial. 
* The workers' political parties had no real political power, with no legal means and violent uprisings.
* Spain's neutrality during WWI facilitated a short period of economic boom, however the increase in exports only increased inflation and shortages.
* By 1920s, there were major economic problems.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== The role of regions ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The role of regions}}}|The role of regions|
* Tension created by ongoing struggle between centralist state of Catalonia and Basque provinces, which wanted decentralisation and independence.
* The two regions had their own languages, cultures, economies and churches.
* Primo de Rivera took back the self-governing rights of Catalonia, and separatists forces supported the Republican movement that overthrew Alfonso in 1931
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Political opposition ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Political opposition}}}|Political opposition|
* Liberal movement achieved little in opposing convervative forces, though remained a political force and supported the revolution that ousted the King in 1931.
* Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) had grown in rural areas but had minimal impact.
* UGT was more visible in organising strikes/protests in rural areas.
* Following Bolshevik revolution, Communist Party emerged.
* Anarchists demanded land redistribution; popular with peasants.
* Anarchists argued for revolutionary methods and to boycott democratic processes.
* More extreme anarchists (FAI) perpetrated bombings and assassinations. 
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== The fall of the monarchy and the establishment of the Second Republic ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The fall of the monarchy and the establishment of the Second Republic}}}|The fall of the monarchy and the establishment of the Second Republic|
* Post WWI defeat and depression put pressure on King Alfonso XIII, and after 12 unsuccessful governments, a coup was thrown (1931, General Primo de Rivera).
* De Rivera tried to establish authoritarian right-wing regime; started infrastructure programmes for railways, roads, electrification, irrigation.
* Ended war in Morocco in 1925.
* All his efforts created massive debt and was not good when Wall Street Crashed.
* Resigned, and after municipal electrons in April, there was support for San Sebastian Pact (republicans, liberals, socialists, catalans) coalition.
* 'Velvent revolution' occurred and Second Republic was established as King went into voluntary exile.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Short-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political polirisation ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Short-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political polirisation}}}|Short-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political polirisation|
* Between 1931 and 1936 Spain became polarised due to the long-term structural problems and clear divisions.
* Paul Preston: &quot;no-one, except a tiny minority on the lunatic fringe on the extreme right or left, believe that Spain's problems could be solved only by war.&quot;
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
=== The Left Republic (April 1931−November 1933) ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The Left Republic (April 1931−November 1933)}}}|The Left Republic (April 1931−November 1933)|
* When Manuel Azaña became president he declared a &quot;democratic republic of workers of all classes.&quot;
* Key issue of tension before 'velvet revolution' in 1931 was the church's power.
* Azaña removed powers from the Church, prevented its control in education, and state payments to the clergy stopped.
* Army also affected; Azaña offered early retirement and closed military academies - this all backfired as those who remained where hard-core conservatives, nationalists, and Africanistas.
* Depression exacerbated the economic problems; agriculture prices were falling, wine and olive exports fell, peasant unemployment rising, industry output fell by as much as a half (steel).
* In 1932, law allowed estates to be taken over and redistributed to peasants, however it was expensive and ineffective; only 7,000 families benefited by 1933.
** Right wing saw all this as threat and similar to Soviet style system.
* Government introduced Assault Guard to increase left-wing military force to deal with civil unrest and violence.
* Both the left and right were rising against the slow pace of change, however these were suppressed as the army were loyal.
* Catalonia given its own parliament, some law-making powers, and dual control over education.
** Right-wing saw this as a threat and the first step to break-up Spain.
* Each reform was perceived as an attack on right-wing groups, causing new groups to protect against these changes.
* Political divisions increased under Second Republic.
* Historians see the land reforms as the central failing of the government in this period, however Paul Preston argues right-wing were never going to give Azaña a choice.
* Azaña lost left-wing, working-class support and resigned in 1933 after government guards 'smoked out' anarchists, killing 25.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
=== The Right Republic (November 1933−February 1936) ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The Right Republic (November 1933−February 1936)}}}|The Right Republic (November 1933−February 1936)|
* Republic swung right wing, members of CEDA (largest party) became war ministers.
* These two years are known as the &quot;black years&quot; as right-wing systematically tried to reverse everything; curch regained power, education, and land programme was halted.
* Catalonia declared itself independent when CEDA joined government, but autonomy was suspended after Astrurian miners' uprising 1934.
* Historians argued that valiont suppression of left uprising created likelihood for civil war.
* Right lost support from Basques.
* Caballero suggested CEDA was Spanish Nazi party, and seek solution to Soviet-style Spain.
* Gil-Robles demanded shift to authoritarian approach of control, which led to ...
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
=== The Popular Front (February−July 1936) ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The Popular Front (February−July 1936)}}}|The Popular Front (February−July 1936)|
* February 1936, 'Popular Front' was an anti-fascist pact made up of various left-wing groups including socialists and communists.
* Identical front as Stalin's policy in 1935.
* For many, it was final attempt to uphold democracy and peace, others associated it with Stalin and extreme communism.
* Government wanted to restore reforms of 1931-33 regime; political prisoners released.
* Caballero's socialists did not join government and right did not accept restoration of old reforms.
* Increase in violence in countryside as anarchists encourage peasants to seize land.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Immediate causes of the Spanish Civil War ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Immediate causes of the Spanish Civil War}}}|Immediate causes of the Spanish Civil War|
* Military officers began planning a coup as soon as Popular Front gained power
* Catalyst of coup was the murder of popular CEDA leader on 13 July 1936.
* Azaña knew about the coup and moved key military figures to remote posts.
* When details about the coup were discovered, it was made a day earlier on the 17th of July, from Morocco.
* Spread to mainland, took northern Spain and parts of Andalusia.
* Rising failed to take main industrial areas, or Madrid.
* Half of the army remained loyal to Republic, coup technically unsuccessful.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== The course of the Spanish Civil War ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The course of the Spanish Civil War}}}|The course of the Spanish Civil War|
* With assistance of Nazi Germany, Franco airlifed 24,000 Spanish troops from Africa to Spain, using a policy of terror has the main force against Madrid.
* Coup aimed to crush the 'left revolution,' but actually politicised and radicalised many Spaniards towards the left.
* Supports of the Republican regime (1936) were 'Loyalists,' and rebels called themselves 'Nationalists.'
* Workers supported Republic, and middle, upper class and the church supported Nationalists.
* Nationalists did make some progress, but the Republic controlled major cities, key industrial areas, Spain's gold reserves, and important elements of the military (air force and navy).
* Nationalists, slowly, pushed backed the Republic.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Why did the Nationalists win the Spanish Civil War? ==
=== Republican weaknesses ===
==== Political disunity ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Political disunity}}}|Political disunity|
* Republicans were politically divided and subscribed to different ideologies; between the Communists and Socialists who both believed the 'revolution' should be postponed until after the war and t he Anarchists who argued the war can only be won through a revolution.
* Historians argue that the Anarchists' 'revolution from below' added a crucial hurdle for the Republic to regain centralised control, with more influence in Madrid and Valencia. 
* War increased in popularity with communists; July 1936 40,000 members, October 1937 400,000 members.
* Republic had clear foreign support from USSR.
* Communists wanted victory in war, anarchists wanted revolutionary regime.
* Communists used 'terror' tactics.
* Four days of street fighting in Barcelona 1937 - communists and socialists versus the anarchists illustrated the lack of unity.
* After May Days (see above), the Worker's Party of Marxist Revolution took up a authoritarian regime. 
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Military problems ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Military problems}}}|Military problems|
* Lacked strong military and no unified command.
* Anarchists and communists would not work together.
* Basques refused to be led be a central command structure and would not permit their forces outside of their own territory.
* Loyal army forces were not trusted by the Republic.
* Military fought series of local battles instead of overall campaign and this meant they could not be supported by the airforces, or to sustain an offensive campaign.
* Only until end of 1939 that Republicans started to replace militias with 'Popular Army'.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Economic problems ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Economic problems}}}|Economic problems|
* Areas under the anarchists were the industries, public utilities and transport - these were taken over by workers' committees, however they were unable to meet the demands of the war.
* Historians argue that this was not due to a badly run government but due to the war, however the government is partially to blame.
* Production fell by two-thirds between 1936 to 1939, with many food and raw material shortages.
* Inflation was a problem; rose 300% during the war.
* The Non-Intervention Committee (NIC) was set up by France and Britain in 1936.
** Prevented an influx of support for warring parties in Spain, making the Republic lose all credit and USSR was the only willing trader.
* Paul Preston: communist control ultimately improved the situation by centralising control, but too late to save Republic.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Foreign assistance ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Foreign assistance}}}|Foreign assistance|
* Role of foreign aid was exaggerated, but aid given to Republic was far less than that of the Nationalists.
* Republic's main ally was USSR, who saved them and enabled it to fight the civil war by supplying aircraft (1,000) and tanks (750), but the Republic had to pay for this.
* No Soviet troops were sent.
* International Brigades were another ally, organised by Soviet Comintern, with 35,000 volunteers sent to fight in Spain.
** Had very little overall impact, only in Madrid.
* 1938, Soviets withdrew support and International Brigades went home, major blow for Republic.
* France sent aid initially, but stopped when it joined the NIC - this was driven by anti-communist sentiments.
* Francisco J .Romero Salvadó (on NIC): &quot;preserved consensus [in France] and [avoided] confrontation with Germany and Italy.&quot;
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Nationalist strengths ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|X}}}|X|
* 
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
==== Political unity ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Political unity}}}|Political unity|
* 1936, Nationalists almost dived as Republics; but had a common aim of overthrowing the government.
* Franco assumed political and military control and became head of government and head of state.
** Due to his position in command of the Army of Africa because important German aid came through him.
* Merged two parties into the Spanish Traditionalist Phalanax (FET).
* Franco used a mixture of propaganda and terror in areas under his control.
** Historians argue that Soviet involvemenet led to this, however others suggest it was power and authority gained during the war.
* Supported by the church which denounced atheist communism and called for a crusade to protect Christian civilisation.
* Nationalistic politics of Franco were not undermined by foreign support from Germany or Italy.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Military unity ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Military unity}}}|Military unity|
* Nationalists had similar problems to the Republicans with regard to 'columns' of militias, however these were quickly put into a regular army unit.
* The Army of Africa fought for the Nationalists and were the most effective force in the Civil War.
* Had unified command and Franco's leadership was accepted by other generals and right-wing parties.
* Italian forces under Nationalist command.
* Successful in pushing on and winning offensives, and adopted effective defensive tactics.
* Had sound communications, and equipped the growing army. 
* Franco's concern for his troops ensured the majority were obedient.
* Franco was a sound military and political leader.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Economic advantage ====

== Overview: foreign intervention ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Overview: foreign intervention}}}|Overview: foreign intervention|
* Foreign intervention lengthened and intensified the war.
* It meant Spanish issues were submerged by wider ideological battles taking place in Europe.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
=== Britain ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Britain}}}|Britain|
* Feared the war would become a general European conflict so set up the NIC.

}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== France ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|France}}}|France|
* Support for Republic was inconsistent, and reflected complexity of its position towards the war.
* French did not want a right-wing border (joining Italy and Germany), but French politics were also polarised, fearing a revolt if it fully supported Spain.
* France was reliant on Britain, which was anti-Republic for its foreign policies.

}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== USSR ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|USSR}}}|USSR|
* Support not just because of ideological reasons.

* Republic victory could panic Britain and France into an alliance with Hitler.
** Wanted to form an alliance with Britain and France to ''contain'' Hitler.
* Stalin originally welcomed the NIC, but Germany and Italy's treatment of NIC, Stalin withdrew in October 1936.

* Drained resources from Germany, making it less likely to turn into a general war.
* Stalin withdrew support in June 1938, as the Republic seemed to be losing and Western democracies were appeasing fascist dictaros.
* Stalin wanted to create a block to resist Hitler ended with Czechoslovakia being blocked at Munich agreement, September 1938.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Germany ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Germany}}}|Germany|
* Germany not ready for general European war and was cautious when rebels appealed for help.

* Ignored NIC, even though it was a member.

=== Italy ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Italy}}}|Italy|
* Gave most assistance as Mussolini was anti-comminist/-socialist and democratic outlook, he wanted to enhance his influence in Mediterranean, and a fascist fictory would weaken France and prevent French left-wing influence.
* Another fascist power would encircle France, pressurising French colonies in North Africa.
* Contributed many planes, tanks, weapons, bombers, and submarines.
** Historians argue that despite massive troop support, its most effective support was air and naval.
* Italy ignored membership of NIC.
* Relationship between Italy and Germany were cemented in Spain.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== The nature of the Spanish Civil War ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The nature of the Spanish Civil War}}}|The nature of the Spanish Civil War|
* For foreign powers it was limited, for the Spanish it was total civil war.
* Propaganda was used to dehumanise the enemy. 
* Atrocities were common.
* The targeting of civilians was a premonition of what was to come in WWII - no lines drawn between civilian and combatant.
* Some cases, cavalry charges proved effective, such as in Teruel in February 1938.
* Other case, such as the crushing of Republican offensives in 1938 to 1938 with combined arms and air strikes showed the importance of technology.
* Neither side could consistently gain air control.
* Control of sea was important especially for supply routes.
* Battles on land were similar to that of WWI with defense remained easier than attack.
* Casualties were high, with attackers gaining little hand. 
* Blitzkrieg was evolving with application of tanks, artillery, and air bombardment.
* It was not a guerrilla war because, from Antony Beevor, &quot;the conditions for a universal guerrilla war simply did not exist.&quot;
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

* Patricia Knight: Church's creation of links to worker's movements was an attempt to infiltrate and prevent any resurgent communist groups.
* Use of Catalan, Basque, and Galician languages were forbidden.

}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Britain and France ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Britain and France}}}|Britain and France|
* Spanish civilians who were bombed made it clear that a general European war would witness horrors unlike the scale seen before.
* Poliarised political view of appeasement; some thought warring factions should battle it without without dragging democracies into conflict.
* &quot;Weakness&quot; of Britain and France over Britain, and their policy of appeasement, led Hitler to change perception of Britain - 1938 lost respect and the NIC made Hitler more aggressive.

* A. J. P. Taylor: The Spanish Civil War was &quot;without significant effect&quot; in causing WWII.

This template formats a [[w:Bourne shell]]-style prompt and is intended to be used in “leading space” preformatted sections.

The prompt will use &lt;code&gt;prompt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;prompt-sh&lt;/code&gt; HTML/CSS classes, and also an explicit &lt;code&gt;font-weight: bolder&lt;/code&gt; CSS style.

== Usage ==

* {{tl|Sh$}}
* {{tlx|Sh$|2=''Prompt text''&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;}}
* {{tlx|Sh$|2=&lt;code&gt;1=&lt;/code&gt;''Prompt text with a &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; inside''&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;}}

== Examples ==

== Description ==

Mwlist produces a list of [[MediaWiki]] pages present at the specified (&lt;code&gt;--api=&lt;/code&gt;) MediaWiki instance subject to the criteria given.  By default, it lists just the recently changed pages.
&lt;!-- NB: [[w:Man page]]s are not unknown to have whole paragraphs contained within description lists; as MediaWiki markup does not seem to provide a way to express such a structure, plain HTML is used below instead --&gt;

=== Basic options ===

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--api=&lt;var &gt;URI&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Specifies the URI of the MediaWiki instance’s [[mw:API:Main page|API]] ''endpoint'' (example: &lt;code&gt;https:{{SERVER}}/w/api.php&lt;/code&gt;.)  ''Note that this option is currently mandatory.''&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--user=&lt;var &gt;User-name&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Name of the user to log into the MediaWiki instance as.  (The password will be prompted for.)  The default is not to log in.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--debug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-debug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Enable or disable (default) debugging output.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--dry-run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-dry-run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;These options are provided for the sake of consistency with the other MediaWiki::Tools, and are silently ignored by &lt;code&gt;mwlist&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--max-queries=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;var &gt;N&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Should too many pages match the criteria given, the MediaWiki instance may refuse to return them all within a single response.  Mwlist may then use the MediaWiki API [[mw:API:Query#Continuing queries|“continue”]] facility to request for the remaining pages.  This option specifies the maximum number of queries to perform (including the initial one.)  The default is 1.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--output=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;var &gt;Filename&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Specifies the file to write the list of ids and names of the pages found to.  Using &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;var &gt;Filename&lt;/var&gt; denotes [[w:Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|stdout,]] which is the default for this option.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

=== Criteria ===

Unless specifically noted below, when several of the criteria below are used at the same time, the result will contain all the pages matching ''either'' of the criteria given. 

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--all-pages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-all-pages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This criterion matches all the pages on the given MediaWiki instance, as per [[mw:API:Allpages]].  It will be used if the only criterion given is &lt;code&gt;--no-recent-changes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--all-pages-from=&lt;var &gt;Page-name&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--all-pages-prefix=&lt;var &gt;Page-name-prefix&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;These criteria limit &lt;code&gt;--all-pages&lt;/code&gt; to only list the pages with the names either from the given one (and lexicographically greater) or having the prefix specified, respectively.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--categorized=&lt;var &gt;Category-name&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--embeds=&lt;var &gt;Template-name&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;These criteria match all the pages belonging to a specific category (as per [[mw:API:Categorymembers]]), or transcluding a specific template (as per [[mw:API:Embeddedin]]), respectively.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--recent-changes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-recent-changes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This criterion matches all the recently changed pages, as per [[mw:API:Recentchanges]].  It will be used if no explicit criteria are given.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

=== Being nice to the server ===

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--wait=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;var &gt;Min&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--wait-max=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;var &gt;Max&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order not to interfere with the activity of other users of the MediaWiki instance, Mwlist will wait for &lt;var &gt;Min&lt;/var&gt; to &lt;var &gt;Max&lt;/var&gt; seconds (either of which may be a decimal fraction, such as 4.2) between consecutive requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default values are 4 and 64 (or &lt;var &gt;Min&lt;/var&gt;, if it’s greater), respectively.  The minimum value for &lt;var &gt;Min&lt;/var&gt; is 1, and the minimum value for &lt;var &gt;Max&lt;/var&gt; is &lt;var &gt;Min&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

The follow articles describe the format of various user-editable files used within the Trainz environment.

When creating files for use with Trainz, care should be taken to follow the specified format accurately. Even if a particular deviation from the documented format is permitted by the current game and tools, it may become disallowed in future versions as loaders are updated and validation techniques are improved.


== Reading N3V File Formats ==
If you develop software which reads these file formats, you should accept and ignore minor deviations where feasible, in order to future-proof your software. Base your file reader on the documented format, not the particulars of the current Trainz implementation. It is likely that implementation-specific details will change between Trainz versions, whereas the file formats are typically extended but not often replaced.


== Writing Binary Files ==
There exist a number of binary file formats which are produced by N3V or by N3V-provided utilities and which are not formally documented. We strongly recommend that third-party developers do not write directly ''to'' these formats. N3V does not support any such tools or any files created by these tools. Reading ''from'' these undocumented binary formats is considered harmless but unsupported.


== Copy Protection ==
The use of an N3V binary file format should not be considered as a strong protection mechanism against snooping or modification except where specifically stated otherwise by N3V. Custom binary file formats are used to allow high-performance access to data from within the game environment. Security and obfuscation are neither primary not secondary goals for these formats, and N3V may provide mechanisms which convert from the binary formats back into &quot;common&quot; formats without prior notice. It should be noted that the technical capability of reverse-engineering the contents of a file does not equate to the legal right to modify or distribute said file. Before modifying someone else's content, please seek the permission of the creator. If you are in any doubt as to your rights in this area, please seek advice from a legal professional.

'''Containers''' are Trainz term for complex {{Wp|data structure}}s containing more than one elemental {{wp|data type|type of data}} but data groups which might be used in more than one of Trainz {{TL|Kinds}}, in and of themselves a 'container', but of a more unique type. In one sense, Trainz assets are nothing but a collection of data organized by proper enumerated codes and these containers, including the parent-classed containers known as {{TR|Kinds}} define the interrelationship and configuration of an asset. The container is but one element in an assets self-definition as initialized by the asset creator.

:Introduction to topic, see: [[Trainz/AM&amp;C/config.txt files|Config.txt file]]

This is the more technical coverage of the Trainz {{wp|ini file}} type known as config.txt files.

The '''config.txt''' file is the central descriptor for a Trainz content item. Every content item has a single filed named config.txt in its folder, which determines the name, kind and unique ID of the item, as well as various kind-specific details. All other files used by the content item are located via the config.txt file.

The config.txt file is stored in the {{TR|R|ACS Text Format}}, which in brief defines a keyword and a value paired. Some keywords are aggragate values, in Trainz, corresponding to a {{TR|C|p=container}} holding lists of such data pairs and other containers.
* When hand-editing the file, care must be taken to use correct syntax or the meaning of parts or the entirety of the file may become permanently lost. When content is installed into Trainz, or when it is archived (in [[CDP Format]] or similar) the config.txt file is stored in a machine-optimized binary format. If the content is later extracted using [[/Content Manager/]], the config.txt file is converted back to text format, however any custom formatting or erroneous syntax is already lost and cannot be restored.


==Standard Tags==
A variety of tags are available to all Trainz content items, regardless of the specific asset type. These tags are inherited from the {{TR|K|KIND TrainzBaseSpec}} base asset type, and are described there in detail. These values are:

{{:Trainz/references/TrainzBaseSpec}}
{{Trainz-section-stub|Place the more technical annotated materials adapted from the N3V wiki here}}
==Localisation==
:* ''Localisation is'' 'academic-speak' ''for &quot;Internationalization&quot;, or data translations to other languages...''
As the {{TR|R|ACS Text Format}} uses UTF-8 encoding, so non-English text string entries may occur within any string field in the config.txt file, save where proscribed. (For example, the '''username tag''' is supposed to always be English, but language suffixed forms also allow for support of ''multiple locales'' in the regions languages&amp;mdash; and to avoid confusion, the standard string tags which require localisation support effectively allow multiple entries because the run-time software uses the following conventions:

* ''username'' - The content's human-readable name, in American English. The English name for the asset must be present, and is supposed to be defined in English. (Unfortunately, a small number of assets were uploaded without policing of that criteria, so some non-English names are found on the {{TL|DLS}}.
* ''username-cz'' - The content's human-readable name, in Czech.
* ''username-de'' - The content's human-readable name, in German.
* ''username-es'' - The content's human-readable name, in Spanish (Espanol).
* etc.

{{Text-box|1=
The following standard tags support this form of localization:&lt;br/&gt;
'''where XX is the iso two character abbreviation for a language'''. (e.g. de=German, fr=French, it=Italian, etc.)}}
* {{TR|R|TrainzBaseSpec#username|p=username tags}} and username-XX tags 
* {{TR|R|TrainzBaseSpec#description|p=description tags}} and description-XX tags
* {{TR|R|TrainzBaseSpec#string-table|p=string-table container}} and string-table-XX tables.

==Common Containers==
* {{TR|C|attached-track container}}
* {{TR|C|extensions container}}
* {{TR|C|kuid-table container}}
* {{TR|C|mesh-table container}}
* {{TR|C|obsolete-table container}}
* {{TR|C|string-table container}}
* {{TR|C|textures container}}
* {{TR|C|thumbnails container}}
* ...

==Introduction==
{{TRS-byline|usr1=Fabartus|aun=fabartus|aid=497853}}&lt;!-- On Trainz/Config.txt_files ---&gt;

This is the introduction to '''[[Trainz/AM&amp;C/config.txt file|Trainz config.txt files]]''', a type of {{wp|ini file}} used to track and initialize literally every asset in the Trainz data definition and database system. 

Younger readers will likely be less familiar with the INI file concept, but the technology is still in use in modern applications, though much of the setup data once ensconced in ini files is now put into Windows registry entries, and the rest is usually hidden away in a folder not normally accessed by the casual Trainz Windows user. A search from the C:\ root for *.ini will find the ini file is still alive and well, even inside the Windows folder and sub-folders, for applications and so there is little mystery that Trainz which antedated Windows 2000 and Windows ME releases, would maintain the technology in use if it serves it well. 

Trainz however, cannot take that registry route for there are over 130,000 built-in assets in a typical Trainz release, and some might double that count&amp;mdash;before adding in free or payware content from the {{TL|Download Station}} or 3rd-party site, and using the registry to record ''even just added content'' would quickly swell the windows registry into behaving with glacial slowness, a result contrary to the idea of historic design goals of the registry which was supposed to make Windows launches and 
Window process switching go much faster. Then there is a second issue, most Trainz ini files are soon missing, their very folders are temporary in existence and as a file containing a data set, they are compressed into other partially processed and indexed files which the Trainz data base uses. This'' 'Asset status' ''is called ''being committed'', meaning the temporary files in a

==So What's a config.txt file?==
Each asset (or content item) in Trainz starts in a file folder setup and with each part defined by the content creator. Some graphics packages, notably Autodesk's {{wp|3ds Max}} which N3V's developers use and the formerly 'bundled-with-Trainz' simpler game focused {{TG|G|Gmax}} sub-set of 3ds Max liked to use certain sub-folder arrangements and these carry over into Trainz folders organization.

The config.txt file is the glue that holds together the parts of a self-defining 3D graphics model defining and giving instructions for how those files and sub-folders fit together as interpreted by the Auran JET 3.0 graphics engine behind the Trainz virtual worlds.
&amp;nbsp;
 
Various data elements must be defined in a config file, and others are optional. Such data elements are set forth in the {{TL|TrainzBaseSpec}}, a {{TR|Kinds|p=KIND}} classed data collection which may be or must be defined in each Trainz sub-asset. A sub-asset are parts, wheels, Locomotive Cabs, bogeys (trucks), couplers, track attached to an interactive factory and so forth which might be used by numbers of larger assets. The track in the factory or wheels of a freight car (wagon) being two easy to understand examples.

==The Flavor of a Config==
The following is a small taste of a config file from an actual locomotive asset engine component file folder. Sounds are parts assets too, and this one connects the sounds (which might be apropos to other locomotives) to the &quot;{{TG|E|engine spec}}&quot; config.txt file which calls this by reference to its {{TG|K|KUID}} &quot;&lt;kuid:32711:100430&gt;&quot; (find below). The engine-spec asset is in it's turn referenced in the locomotive's config.txt file, meaning this asset has both a parent and a grand-parent asset level; and possibly many such associations:

==Introduction==
In 2005, Bradley Birkenfeld left his job as a banker at the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS).  In 2007 he sought out the Department of Justice, providing them with information of International tax evasion schemes that the Swiss bank was facilitating abroad&lt;ref&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444017504577645412614237708.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  By 2012, Mr. Birkenfeld, was awarded $104 million dollars from the IRS. The award constituted 26% of the money collected from UBS by the IRS&lt;ref&gt;http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/birkenfeld-determination-letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Senator Grassley says the potential for the IRS Whistleblower program “is tremendous” arguing that “billions of dollars are paid that would have otherwise been lost to major tax evasion” &lt;ref name=&quot;grassley&quot;&gt; http://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/Article.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1502=42397 &lt;/ref&gt;. However, Mr. Birkenfeld didn’t just get a monetary reward for the information he provided the justice department, he was also convicted of conspiracy to commit tax fraud and sentenced to 40 months in jail. 

The case has broad implications beyond UBS and their clients. 33,000 Americans admitted to to holding undeclared overseas accounts following this case. The IRS collected over $5 billion in taxes and penalties, but public confidence in the whistleblower program was shaken because of the jail time Mr. Birkenfeld received. In a 60 Minutes Interview, Mr. Birkenfeld’s lawyer, Steven Kohn, stated “the day he walks into prison is the day you will lose a generation of whistleblowers.... because no one will blow the whistle!” &lt;ref name=&quot;birk_video&quot;&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6050245n&lt;/ref&gt; 

Igor Olenicoff, a real estate billionaire was Birkenfeld’s biggest client &lt;ref name=&quot;birk_video&quot; /&gt;.  When Birkenfeld’s association with Olenicoff’s tax fraud was revealed both were put on trial.  In 2007 Olenicoff pleaded guilty to filing false tax returns, and in 2008 he sued UBS for giving him incorrect advice regarding his offshore tax claims.

&quot;Rather than following most of his classmates into the military after graduation, a traditional track at Norwich, Birkenfeld went back to Boston and worked briefly as a bond trader. Then, after a couple of years, he decamped to Switzerland and stayed. He earned an MBA at the American Graduate School of Business, a picturesque little campus nestled between Montreux and Vevey in the Swiss Riviera.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/europe/100724/swiss-banking-secrecy-billionaires&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to Professionalism==

===Diffusion of Responsibility===

	With regards to the IRS program, diffusion of responsibility is adopting a mindset similar to “I can't be the only one who sees what is going on, so someone else will take care of it.”  A more professional attitude would be to take advantage of the IRS Whistleblower program, or the anonymous tip-off program &lt;ref&gt;http://www.irs.gov/uac/Whistleblower-Informant-Award&lt;/ref&gt;.  By reporting the violation, the whistleblower is being more responsible to the public than to the violator.  This is a potential breach of professional ethics &lt;ref name=&quot;ethicsBreach1&quot;&gt;http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/CodeofConduct/Pages/et_300.aspx#et_301&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;ethicsBreach&quot; &gt;http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_6_confidentiality_of_information.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  While professionals are held to these standards, when they come into conflict, by one definition of professional, it is their duty to exercise their judgment and choose which to follow.

===Normalization of Deviance===

Normalization of Deviance is the practice of accepting an action which by itself is not correct, but through habit, have accepted the action or lack of action as acceptable. Take for example the space shuttle Challenger that was doomed to tragedy by getting too comfortable with poor performing o-rings&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster&lt;/ref&gt;. Over time these small deviations from acceptable risk levels combine to produce a disaster prone operating practice.

Normalization of deviance can allow tax evasion to occur and even propagate. It can foster tax evasion by letting small changes go unnoticed over time.  Eventually, illegal practices become the norm.  These norms can be perpetuated by the status quo decision trap. Additionally, if the tax evasion is not constant, (i.e., only happens occasionally) normalization of deviance can allow it to be accepted as part of a natural year to year variance.

According to Birkenfeld, he did not realize that UBS wealth management operations were illegal until 2005 when an internal document detailed the illegal nature of the practices &lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/europe/100724/globalpost-investigation-telling-swiss-secrets-part-4&lt;/ref&gt;. At this moment Birkenfeld fully realized how far UBS had moved away from the safe operating norm and resigned. The difference between the daily operation procedures at UBS and the legal regulations outlined in the document mark a clear representation of Normalization of Deviance. Over the years the internal culture at UBS led to a point where these practices became standard operating procedure and undisputed.

===Cooperation and Defiance===

Is the whistleblower defying the covenant between the employee and employer? At what point does cooperation shed its veil of deceit? Take the Brad Berkenfeld case. Such corporate deception is reliant on employee cooperation. Is defiance in this instance a bad thing? The U.S. tax code makes an attempt to hold people accountable for their earnings and is based upon accurate reporting of those earnings. When a company or individual mis-reports these numbers the tax burden is shifted to those who are reporting accurate information. That certainly is not fair to those paying their taxes. Can this defiance of one’s company then be considered obedience to the greater population of taxpayers? Then the question becomes, who is the award benefiting? The individual whistleblower, the taxpaying population, both? Senator Grassley states “billions of dollars are paid that would otherwise be lost to major tax evasion” &lt;ref name=&quot;grassley&quot; /&gt; It appears that the majority of the money that would have otherwise gone uncollected is returned to the general public through the IRS. Does taking advantage of an incentive program promoting tax whistleblowing make the whistleblower unprofessional? Should the individual report tax fraud regardless of monetary opportunities? Professionals would report tax evasion. While the IRS Whistleblower Program is an attempt to promote whistleblowing of those less inclined to take the risks of a professional.

===Role of Client Confidentiality===
Attorneys and accountants interact with clients through confidential meetings and documents. In the American Bar Association’s ‘Model Rules of Professional Conduct,’  attorneys are held to the standard that “A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent, the disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation or the disclosure is permitted by paragraph (b).”&lt;ref name=&quot;ethicsBreach&quot; /&gt;
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Code of Professional Conduct “prohibits a member in public practice from disclosing any confidential client information without the specific consent of the client”.&lt;ref name=&quot;ethicsBreach1&quot; /&gt;

==Conclusion==

A professional is:

# A licensed or credentialed member of a recognized profession:  for example a physician, a lawyer, a professor, a clergyman, or a certified P.E. (Professional Engineer). 
# The opposite of an amateur:  an athlete, actor, etc., who is paid for his or her work.
# A dutiful and conscientious employee; for example, an employee who dresses appropriately and who is punctual, courteous and productive.
# A plerker or a master of flow: one who works at one’s excellence such that work is play and challenges are matched with skill

Birkenfeld represents a mix of the professional definitions. On the surface Birkenfeld's actions were the first of its kind in the banking industry. Acting as a whistle-blower in an industry riddled with accusations of fraud has been described as courageous. 

Why he is def 4?

Hey, this is good that we have this page. We can discuss what we need to do/documents to reference/information we should add to the page. I can start finding online journals and sources that will help us! [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 21:19, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm researching the topic now and am writing about Clay Shirky and his concepts, we should come up with an order of what we will write about! 
[[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 14:53, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I've created a new section for Main Theorists, where I think we can highlight certain important things that these people (Shirky, Lanier, etc.) have produced/studied/talked about in regards to CS. This can include Shirky's TED Talk, his book, Lanier's article on DIGITAL MAOISM: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism. Is there anything else we could add to this? [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 16:32, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey, should we mention the hive mind?  [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 21:32, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
 
... Never mind.. It's been done now... [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 07:51, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

We should write more about the different  theorists, especially the ones mentioned in today's lecture, as well as their concepts. [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 10:36, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I have almost completed a breakdown of Skirky's TED talk in which I analyse and expand upon much of what he said and the examples he gave. I'd be happy to discuss with anyone who has took a particular interest in the talk about what to include and how we can contribute equally. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 12:45, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, I agree that taking a look at the other theorists is essential. Lanier and Gauntlett in particular ought to be written about in some detail. I have found the 'further reading' that Greg listed after todays lecture and on that of CS have been very useful re: G&amp;L. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 12:48, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Shall we delegate tasks for each other to do? And then possibly run them by the other group so we don't overlap their work? Like maybe a some people do the theorists in todays lecture, and others can explained on what's already been put on by the other group, and then the new bits we were talking about adding while in our seminar? Seems like there's enough tasks to go around [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 15:31, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

That's a great idea, we all can take different parts and start working on those. I'll start reading up on the further reading that Liam mentioned there! I'm also happy to help create new sub-categories and organise things on the page.[[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:35, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, that sounds good. What other sub-categories do we need? I think I'm going to expand on the bit about Jaron Lanier.. That bit's looking a tad bare just now... [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 15:38, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Who made the Key Theorists part in the Key Concepts section? Because we can move that to the Main Theorists part to keep things consistant. [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:47, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

The other team have discussed using the APA ref system, and I'm relaying that on here too! [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:59, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I think Liam is writing about the TED talk, and that'd be great if you expand more on Lanier's section, Laura. Other theorists that we could mention could include Abigail de Kosnik and Tiziana Terranova (both mentioned in the CS lecture) as well as Harold Rheingold, Henry Jenkins, Pierre Lévy, Surowiecki and David Gauntlett (all from today's lecture).

I'll have my part on the TED talk up ASAP. Fraser has been looking in to it as well so we'll both be contributing to that. It should be completed entirely by tomorrow. Once I'm finished with that I'll look in to Lanier &amp; Digital Maoism if you'd like any assistance with that, Laura. APA is great, I'm glad that's been sorted out.

Hey guys, just catching up on all of this! Sounds great so far, the page is looking good. I'm going to start researching more into the lessons of Cognitive Surplus and how it has effected people. I will post anything I can find and let me know what you think. [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 20:51, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm going to start putting the words in the glossary that need defining, that way we can all take a few words each to define. After we have done that we can discuss what needs changed in any of our definitions? [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 09:08, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

... And I will also look at those other theorists! [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 09:09, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm organising the Main Theorists part a bit more by creating categories for Kosnik and Terranova. [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 10:59, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

George helped me with referencing!

Did some research last night on Cognitive Surplus and I have found a good example of something that has happened quite recently. It is public coming together to join the search for the missing Malaysian plane and is a great example of people using their spare time to help rather than waste time watching TV. Check out the link and let me know if you think it would be relevant in the wikibook! http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2583807/Did-Malaysian-fisherman-missing-flight-MH370-flying-low-Gulf-Thailand.html [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 13:23, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, that's a good example! What section would we include that in? [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 13:39, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm thinking of just creating a new section called 'How things have changed' or something like that. Thoughts? [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 15:06, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

The contents of that link fit perfectly. Since Shirky's TED Talk was entitled 'How Cognitive Surplus Will Change the World', maybe it would be an idea to entitle that section 'How Cognitive Has Changed the World' or something like that. I'm currently looking in to smart mobs and Howard Rheingold as you mentioned Kat, it would be a good idea to add more relevant theorists. Thanks also to whomever added the citation to my TED Talk analysis, that was much appreciated. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 15:38, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, I really like that idea Liam. I'm just looking at how to word this section, and what are the most important things to talk about. I think I will focus on what Shirky's idea of change was and then give the example of the Malaysian aircraft. I will post on the wikibook a bit later on and you can see what you think. [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 16:00, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

That's an interesting example about the Malaysian aircraft. I will go through it and add more references as well as fleshing out some more of the parts. Is there anything specific people would like me to write about as well? I can look up some definations as well.

I'm gathering a list of words for the glossary but there seems to be very little.. I was thinking of putting the words from the main concepts section and stuff, it would just be a more concise definitions in the glossary. Does that sounds okay? [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 17:02, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've just completed my section of Rheingold and how smart mobs link with the notion of cognitive surplus. Please feel free to edit it or ask me about any part of it if necessary. Your idea for the glossary sounds great, Laura. If I can help in any way just ask.

I don't see anything up yet about the &quot;wisdom of crowds&quot; and Surowiecki so I'm going to research and add some about that in Collective Intelligence if nobody minds [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 19:17, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Also Liam, that's fantastic what you've done on the TED talk. Only now managed to get on a computer so I may add a few things if I see anything.

Sorry guys big post coming up! In the middle of writing this and wanted to know if i'm going along the right lines? 
How Cognitive Surplus has Changed the World.
As Clay Shirky focuses on in his TED talk, civic value or civic engagement is one of the most relevant aspects of Cognitive Surplus. Nowadays, with devices such as the internet, people are able to communicate faster and more often. The idea of sitting on a couch and watching TV all day is less appealing.  More often than not, people are coming round to the idea of using their free time in a positive way, like raising awareness on social networking sites. 
Using the internet as a prime example, it is a simple enough tool to control Cognitive Surplus. The recent Malaysian MH370 Aircraft that went missing on the 8th of March 2014 caused major controversy all over the World. The article “Student posts ‘satellite’ image showing a jet over the jungle as thousands join online search for plane” written by Sam Webb and Richard Shears for the Mail Online proves Shirky’s point of Cognitive Surplus being used in a positive way. The article provides images of potential sightings of the plane and describes the search as an “online community”. Webb and Shears also explain that celebrities have taken to joining in the search and “offering up their suggestions”. 
[[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 19:41, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, do I link the article or is that something that needs to be referenced? [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 19:53, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I have posted on the &quot;How Cognitive Surplus has Changed the World&quot; section. Let me know what you think of it and let me know how I need to reference it. Any help would be much appreciated! [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 20:50, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Could you guys have a look at my piece on James Surowiecki and give me any pointers on referencing it please [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 22:16, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

&quot;Not quite the idealist that Rheingold comes across as with his &quot;smart mobs&quot;, Surowiecki too recognises that &quot;groups are remarkably intelligent&quot; and that even with a disparity in intelligence and knowledge progress can still be made. Shirky's idea of Cognitive Surplus can be seen to flow in tandem with Surowieckie's thoughts due to the fact that society as a group has no linear intelligence and knowledge. Societies knowledge is diverse and independent but much of it specialised. It is this diversity and independence that allows society to produce both &quot;civic&quot; and &quot;communal&quot; values at the same time. Surowiecki puts this down to the fact that &quot;human beings are not perfectly designed decision makers&quot;. Therefore, producing two forms of values.&quot;[[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 22:17, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, where would you say is the best place for me to add it. Under Shirky, or Rheingold? [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 22:18, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Thats good Fraser! I would put it under Shirky cause you've talked about how Surowiecki's thoughts are similar to his. [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 22:31, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Done the referencing. Think i've done it properly... [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 09:36, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Liam. In the TED talk do you think we should mention what he says about us now going into an &quot;age of generosity&quot; as both &quot;LOLcats&quot; and Ushahidi are both intrinsically. As Shirky says we don't produce &quot;civic&quot; and &quot;communal&quot; values because our boss wants us to and we are forced to, but instead we do it because we enjoy it? I thought it was worth a wee mention. Also, the day care centre example is quite interesting as it raises the point that there are social constraints which possibly hinder us from producing &quot;civic&quot; values. Please tell me if I got that completely wrong… [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 09:50, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Whoops. *Intrinsically good^ [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 10:01, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

That's a great idea. It would probably fit in best just before the final paragraph of what I wrote on the talk, but that's entirely up to you. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 10:04, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm filling in a few more definations, do you guys think we should reference the definations? I'm not copying and pasting them from the dictionary or anything, but should they be referenced?

I dont think they need to be referenced if its your own words... and what ones are you defining.. cause thats what i am doing just now.. if we split them up we won't find a definition only to discover its been defined. [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 13:31, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm moving the part about copyright from the section on Terranova to the main concepts.

Did you not say to me earlier you had words to go in the glossary, Fraser? You could add those in a define them? Also, since everything seems to be done.. why dont we discuss what parts of the page will be relevant for our presentation? [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 19:13, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Looking at what you've already done you've covered all the ones I talked about I think. I'll have another look and add any if i find them.

Good idea Laura. I think the majority should be focused on Shirky because it was really him who coined the phrase. We can use the TED talk in the presentation too to add a bit of relief for the rest of the class who i'm sure don't want to listen to us going on for the whole thing! [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 19:34, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah that's a good idea! Plus I would really rather not talk for the whole time, not a fan of presentations. We gonna use a powerpoint? Well actually hold on.. Greg says we take the seminar.. so lets start with what we think makes a good seminar? [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 19:37, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Also... I'm gonna add a little bit to the introduction if you want to add more after that? Means you get to contribute more since you haven't really had the chance... [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 19:41, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I think the page is looking pretty full. Thanks Laura and Kat for doing the definitions. I'm wondering if there is anything to add, but I can't find anything in particular from my notes or from the reading. I went through the 'Further Reading' suggestions from the Cognitive Surplus and Collective Intelligence lectures which Greg listed for something to add but it seems as if we and Team Alpha have took what is most relevant and went in to enough detail with it. I considered a new section on criticisms of CS, but I have only managed to find criticisms of the book, most of which focus on Shirky's writing style and idealism, and not on the idea of CS itself. If anyone has any suggestions of things they would like to add which they would like help with feel free to give me a shout. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 20:05, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, with regards to the presentation; I, for one, like the idea of a powerpoint presentation purely for the fact that it gives us a visual reference to keep us on track as well as helping to flesh out what we are saying for the rest of the class. Fraser, I agree that it should focus on Shirky; we could talk about the genesis of the idea, how he presents it (TED talk and the book) and what it means to us as media prosumers. (5 points to Ravenclaw for using the word from this weeks lecture.) We could also talk about the theorists we have mentioned as well as Kate's part about how CS has changed the world with some examples. Maybe we could mix it up with a variation of lecturing and class discussion/debate because you don't want to just babble on endlessly as much as you don't want to make the class do all of the work for us. We're week twelve so we have plenty of time to discuss it and make it the best possible presentation we can. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 20:14, 3 April 2014 (UTC) 

Yeah, I think its basically been covered. I looked for criticism too but i can't find anything! You'd have thought someone would have wrote something critical on it. I like your idea for the presentation, not too much talking on our part, but not too much free reign for the rest of the class too. I also like your positivity.. Our presentation will be the best!

Seen that there isn't any mention of David M Berry on &quot;creative commons&quot; so currently writing a piece on that now and will add and reference it shortly. [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 10:23, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I was very confused writing this so please tell me if i'm wrong before I go posting it -   ===David M. Berry===
Berry has a pessimistic view of Lessig's idea that there should be a &quot;free culture&quot;. He feels that it only labels culture as a &quot;resource&quot;(Berry,2006), and it can be easily controlled and owned at the expense of finding the ethical motives behind ownership. Berry argues that the Creative Commons may allow the sharing of culture resources but none of it is &quot;shared in common, nor owned in common, nor accountable to the common itself&quot;(2006). Therefore, it is down to private individuals to pick and choose when to reuse the commons when they so wish. In turn, blockages in creativity become a problem in the cases of lawyers due to the fact that they become mandatory passing points. This means that the &quot;ethical implications&quot; of the sharing of culture is now being restricted by legal barriers.&lt;ref&gt; Berry D. and Moss G.(2006) &quot;The politics of the libre commons.&quot; retrieved 3 April 2014 from http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1403/1321 &lt;/ref&gt; [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 11:42, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Laura, in the glossary how did you make the heading bold? I was gonna add in creative commons … &quot;Creative Commons&quot; - A none profit organisation with the purpose of enlarging the range of creative ideas available for others to have the ability to share and to expand upon in a legal manner.

::''Related Introductory Trainz articles:'' [[Trainz/file formats]], [[Trainz/containers|containers]], [[Trainz/Kinds|kinds]], and {{TR|Index of Tags &amp; Containers}}

'''Tags''' are Trainz term for simple {{Wp|data structure|data pairings}} containing one  elemental {{wp|data type|type of data}} paired with a keyword. ''Elemental data types'' or elementary data types in Trainz means text {{wp|string (computing)|strings}}, single value {{wp|boolean}} (0 or 1 only), integer (natural) or decimal (floating point) number types which are assigned legal values compatible with that data type. There are also a couple of work-around hybrid data types, which consolidated multiple string key name codes in the same single (''newer'') tag key name which are now assigned a range of values (referred in this work) to as a string array separated by semicolons. There is a similar array construct for tags latitude, longitude, and elevation value definitions, each containing three comma-separated floating point values. 
 
More complex data groups used in Trainz data definitions are discussed in {{TL|containers|Trainz containers}} and in {{TL|Kinds|Trainz kinds}}, in and of themselves a 'container', but of a more unique type. In one sense, Trainz assets are nothing but a collection of data organized by proper enumerated codes and these containers, including the parent-classed containers known as {{TR|Kinds}} define the interrelationship and configuration of an asset. The container is but one element in an assets self-definition as initialized by the asset creator.
{{Trainz-stub}}

==Heirarchy and level==
* {{TL|config.txt file}}s/{{TL|Config.txt file}}/{{TL|Config.txt files}}
:* {{TR|TrainzBaseSpec}}
::* {{TR|Category-classes|category-class tag}}
::* '''KINDs''' ''declaration''&lt;br
/&gt;'''KINDs''' in the Trainz simulators define the attribute that together with category-class set up required fields of information to make the model of an asset render properly. In a very real sense, the KIND data structure (grouping related data of disparate type relevant to the needs of model rendering and run-time simulation) is a first level {{TG|C|container}} in Trainz (albeit with a special name, &quot;KIND&quot;), and will almost always require other container level data groups accompany it in the ini files. 
::*'''containers''' and '''tags'''&lt;br
/&gt;Now all container and container-like structures occupy the config.txt file, but the distinction is simply that container defined types usually have scope in several different KIND defined assets, whereas each KIND is unique to that class of asset. KIND Engines and KIND Traincar both have bogeys (wheels on trucks) so both have a bogeys container in their ini file. Tags on the other hand have local scope as a Config.txt tag, or within a container where it's purpose is the same, to define and initialize a particular single data item with a value.
==Enumeration and variable values==
Some values are tightly proscribed by a pre-defined list of allowed values, this is known as '''''an enumerated type'''''. The values in the tag {{TR|tags|category-class}} are tightly controlled, which is to say ''must come from a given list of allowed values'' on which they were enumerated (listed out). They are in-effect, alphanumeric codes which when defined, must be on the list. Other normally seen upper level Config.txt tags {{TR|tags|category-era}} and {{TR|tags|category-region}} are two tag types which ''are both enumerated'' and odd because they are both ''''''string-arrays'''''' which replaces a number of listed individual tags as was the formulation in an older, now obsolescent Trainz release version. 
{{void|1=
==Important Everyday Tags==
The answer is dependent upon what sort of assets you are dealing with at the moment.

A Trainz '''Asset''' is a self-defining collection of mutually supporting more elementary data types that are usually used alone or in some cases, are used as an accessory in conjunction with other Assets to be rendered by the game software into a realistic 3D model of some sort and degree.

When an asset is a sub-component (a wheel type making part of a bogey or truck), it is usually set off inside a {{TR|C|p=container}} which will likely define other information about how the asset is used by the larger asset. Thus assets can greatly differ both in complexity and size, generality and specificity. Consider the many shapes on a steam locomotive and each part that moves independent of others. Each group will likely have component assets, and the complicated whole is made up of building blocks small asset by small asset.

Further, Assets can range from a sound or HTML data file providing background (one as 'realism' or color, the other as a instruction in a game {{TL|Driver}} {{TL|Session}}), a texture used to fill in the surface color and surface effects of a {{wp|polygon mesh}}, the mesh itself, or an aggregate of several or many sub-components, like the obvious kinds of rolling stock. But assets also include buildings, trackside related objects such as signals, relay boxes, {{TG|S|junction switches}} (points) and switch motors or switch levers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Crowdsourcing: the Wiki Way of Working''' explains an approach to organising work that is in some ways the opposite of traditional planning and management. It draws out some lessons from the most visibly successful crowdsourcing projects that support education and research, including Wikipedia. It shows how these community-based projects, despite their unorthodox methods, share educational and scholarly objectives with more traditional institutions and projects. It suggests ways in which those institutions and projects can benefit from working with Wikipedia and the wider Wikimedia community.

It was originally published in February 2014 as [http://www.jiscinfonet.ac.uk/infokits/crowdsourcing an infoKit on the Jisc infoNet site] and is reproduced here under its CC-BY-SA licence. It can be read as a series of self-contained points or case-studies, or as a journey from theory to practice. Development of the infoKit was funded by [http://www.jisc.ac.uk/ Jisc] and [[:wmuk:Main page|Wikimedia UK]].

This is not meant to be a comprehensive manual of crowdsourcing. The topic is also addressed in parts of the Wikibooks ''[[Citizen Science]]'' and ''[[Lentis|Lentis: The Social Interface of Technology]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Imagine you have a big, complicated task which can be broken down into many small steps. We will set in motion a machine – that is, a digital computer – to carry out the task. Here are two possible approaches.

Computer 1 works in sequence through its list of instructions. If it has to add two numbers, it grabs the two numbers from wherever they are stored, puts them through its adding machine, sends the answer to be stored and then clears its workspace to prepare for the next instruction. It only begins a step once the previous one is complete.
[[File:Linear_growth_schematic.PNG|300px|center|Computer 1 over time]]

Computer 2 is completely different. Parts of Computer 2 are constantly breaking off and other things are constantly sticking to it. It thus exists in a state of near-equilibrium with its environment. However, it makes progress because the equilibrium is not exact. When part of its structure corresponds to part of the correct solution to its problem, Computer 2 becomes a little bit more stable. So over time it grows bigger and more complete, even though from minute to minute it is rapidly changing in a way that seems chaotic. Just under half the steps in the development of Computer 2 are reversals of previous steps.
[[File:Organic_growth_over_time.PNG|300px|center|Computer 2 over time]]

Another difference with Computer 2 is that a constant proportion of its steps give incorrect answers. Asked for 1+1 it will most of the time say 2, but every now and again give 3 or 4. This is not as disastrous as it sounds, because the answers are so frequently erased and replaced, and correct answers are more stable and more likely to become part of the long-term structure. Still, there is no guarantee that every instruction is carried out correctly.

Here is another difference: Computer 2 is more energy-efficient by a factor of a hundred or a thousand, according to the physicist Richard Feynman. What’s more, these two machines are things we encounter all the time. Computer 1 is a microprocessor of the type we have in our computers, our phones, our cars, and ever more everyday objects. Computer 2 is DNA.

The long-term sustainability of DNA is not in question. Microprocessors had to be brought into existence and need constant external power because of their relative inefficiency. By contrast, DNA just happened when certain molecules came together. DNA does not need to be plugged into the wall. Given enough time and the opportunity to make lots of mistakes, DNA has made things that seem highly designed for their environment, all without any kind of forward planning.

The DNA approach may be unacceptable when guarantees of reliability and quality are paramount. An astronaut getting ready for launch won’t be happy to be told that 90% of the rocket’s components are definitely working properly. Either everything has been checked and tested, or the rocket is not likely safe. So we would not use the DNA approach in building a rocket. Then again, not every task is like this. The different articles in an encyclopedia do not depend on each other in the same way as the parts of a rocket: mistakes in the art history articles do not ruin the usefulness of the articles about military history. Similarly with creating a multilingual dictionary, a database, or a museum catalogue; partial success gives partial utility, not zero utility.

We could say that the DNA approach works to create things that are organic. In practice, organic means:

* Modular: a failure of a part does not mean a failure of the whole
* Visible in quality: it is possible to evaluate the quality of a part, independently from the whole

Open up an encyclopedia, database or educational materials to the public (the “crowd”) for editing and people may contribute, whether to demonstrate a skill, promote altruistic goals, to educate themselves, or for other reasons. It will also invite vandalism, hoaxes and other misbehaviour.

What makes crowdsourcing worth it is the net change over time. In a truly open system, it is not feasible to prevent vandalism entirely, but it is possible to structure it so that the negative contributions are outweighed by improvements. Achieving this is the challenge of successful crowdsourcing.

== Summing up ==
It is not the best way to do everything, but crowdsourcing offers huge efficiency gains for certain kinds of large, complex tasks. Managing it requires a different way of thinking that accepts unpredictability, imperfection and diminished control. Crowdsourced effort is hard to control, but the absence of central control gives it its efficiency and strength.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Imagine I’ve enlisted three people to write a handbook. Amy has an advantage over the others in finding and summarising research but doesn’t write the most elegant English; Ben is best at sourcing, adapting, and captioning images; and Chris, a grammar pedant, is strongest on copy-editing. A natural way to organise them is to divide them into different roles: Amy the writer and Ben the illustrator will pass drafts on to Chris the copy-editor.

Rather than labelling the workers, an alternative – more in the spirit of the DNA computer – is to label the work. The pages of the draft get tags to suggest &quot;This needs updating&quot;, &quot;This needs illustrating&quot;, &quot;This seems finished: needs review,&quot; and so on. Tagged pages go into a queue, so for example Chris tracks what needs doing by looking at the &quot;in need of a copy-edit&quot; queue. Pages with no tags go into a &quot;This needs a tag&quot; queue. Rather than working after each other in sequence, each person works, when they have time, on the next appropriate item.

Let us also introduce microattribution: each page is labelled with who has worked on it and what they have changed. On paper, this could be done with different coloured pens: in the digital sphere this could be a database of contributions. Not only will it be clear that each finished page was worked on by Amy, Ben, and Chris, but each can demonstrate what they added and none has to worry about others taking credit for their work.

This approach is more responsive than rigorous planning. Chris has a comparative advantage at copy-editing over Ben the illustrator, but Ben is still quite good at it. So if the copy-editing takes longer than expected, the relevant queue becomes backlogged, and the workers notice that Ben can vary his work to reduce that queue. He knows that his work will be credited, not assumed to have all been done by Chris. Sometimes the workers will be in a mood to use their special skills, and at other times they might want to work on something more simple and repetitive: they just have to change the queue they work on.

To extend the metaphor, we could invite strangers into this workplace to see the drafts and their tags, track what they do and add tags if their contributions are problematic. Pedants who cannot stand to see misplaced apostrophes might correct some errors in the drafts, and even if the crowd’s contributions are low-value like this, the job still gets done more quickly. Crowdsourcing does not mean that all the work is done by the &quot;crowd&quot;. Crowdsourcing can include engaging a wider public to collaborate with professionals or to add a particular value to work they are already doing.

This is the way of working enabled by a wiki. While by definition a wiki is a site that can be edited quickly and easily (&quot;wiki&quot; being a Hawaiian word for &quot;quickly&quot;), it is perhaps better seen as a technology for organising work, simplifying what would rapidly get out of hand if done with post-its and coloured pens. Tags, categories, queues, backlogs, and user contribution records all help to break down a high-level task (&quot;create a handbook of publishable quality&quot;) into small steps, to distribute effort across those steps, and to track progress.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wikipedia has become one of the top ten most popular websites on a tiny fraction of the staffing or budget of the others. It has created more than 30 million articles in 13 years, across more than 280 languages, harnessing hundreds of millions of person-hours of work. Clay Shirky estimated in 2010 that around 100 million person hours of volunteer effort had gone into making Wikipedia. Collectively, the Wikimedia sites have around 80,000 active volunteer contributors (defined as those making at least five edits per month) and in 13 years have reached more than two billion edits.

A large proportion of changes made to Wikipedia are reversions of other changes: this is not a failure but a consequence of how easy it is to edit, just as it was integral to the DNA computer that most of its steps are reversals of past steps. A huge number of person-hours have gone into heated-but-pointless discussions, but given how controversy is inevitable in topics like Abortion, 2003 invasion of Iraq, or Capital punishment, contributors’ disagreements have not stopped them creating detailed, extensively referenced articles. Wikipedia has an internal bureaucracy that can be arcane and frustrating for users, but when compared to the scale of bureaucracy required for similarly complex tasks, such as running a university, it could be seen as remarkably un-bureaucratic.

Wikipedia is just the best known of eleven multilingual, freely reusable, volunteer-led projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. These include Wikidata, Wiktionary, and others that will be considered later. &quot;Wikimedia&quot; is the umbrella term encompassing these projects, their communities, national and regional non-profit organisations and related activities such as outreach, research and software development.

The [http://www.jiscinfonet.ac.uk/infokits/change-management/culture/organisational-cultures/ change management infoKit] distinguishes four kinds of organisational culture: Collegiate, Bureaucratic, Innovative, and Enterprise. By being very individualistic, consensual, focused on freedom, driven by local cultures rather than global coordination, and focused on the long term, Wikimedia strongly maps onto the Collegiate culture, which also happens to be the culture of old, research-focused universities.

Wikimedia projects have glaring imbalances and biases in their output, reflecting that:

# The things needed to contribute – including broadband internet, access to sources, IT skills, free time, and confidence – are not evenly distributed through the world’s population. For example the density of articles, mapped geographically, corresponds strongly to the availability of broadband internet.
# Contributors’ effort goes into writing about what they are interested in.

Several projects that are very similar to Wikipedia have nothing like the same success (Mako-Hill, 2012). Citizendium is almost exactly like Wikipedia except that contributors have to be credentialed experts. Google Knol shared some features with Wikipedia but allowed individual authors to take ownership of articles. So to learn from Wikipedia’s success it is essential to look at its distinctive recipe.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the ways an encyclopedia is an ideal project for crowdsourcing is that it is strongly modular: it can be broken down into many individual pieces of work which do not depend on each other. It may seem, though, that the whole process depends on detailed planning to create a structure in which crowdsourcing will be successful. In particular, it might seem that the policies and guidelines that define good work have to exist before people start the work.

In fact, Wikipedia did not turn out like this. Policies and guidelines are created by the same process as the articles: public editing and discussion to consensus, often seeded by a very short statement. These policies and standards have evolved with the articles.

In the course of writing the best content, or handling the most contentious disputes, the community has reached consensus on points of style, scope, user conduct and so on. This consensus can then be cited in similar debates or written up as a policy or guideline. Once an article is badged as a “Featured Article”, representing the community’s best work, it can be used as a model for the development of related articles. So the role of good content in shaping policy is as important as policy’s role in shaping content.

Wikimedia has as its vision statement:

{{quote|a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.}}

This statement, which reflects both the long-term focus of the project and the moving target it is aimed at, is known by all active contributors and cited as a guiding principle in on-wiki discussions.

Wikipedia’s role is to be a general-audience encyclopedia in the same sense as Britannica. This goal is literally tangible for those generations who grew up with print encyclopedias. Having an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; goal is a plus: projects with too novel a goal restrict their own growth because not enough people can grasp the goal and decide whether it is being achieved (Mako-Hill, 2012). The Wikimedia and Wikipedia goals are made more concrete for contributors when they hear of people benefiting who were previously information-poor, such as the recipients of the One Laptop Per Child project or the use of Wikipedia by schoolchildren in the townships of South Africa.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Whereas the tagline “the free encyclopedia anyone can edit” suggests anarchy, newcomers can be surprised by how constrained and rule-bound the project is. The tagline is correct, but does not convey the evolutionary process that Wikipedia actually employs, preserving encyclopaedic contributions while resisting promotional, crank, or other undesirable influences.

A lot of the activity on Wikipedia is behind the scenes, not part of the encyclopedia itself. This includes policies, style guidelines, noticeboards, discussion pages about improving individual articles, “wikiprojects” to improve a topic area, and discussions about user behaviour. A lot of this is geared towards assessing articles on a detailed quality scale, including processes of informal and formal review. An article’s quality rating, if it has one, is visible on clicking “Talk” at the top of the page on the desktop version of Wikipedia.

;The Wikipedia quality scale

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Class	!!Criteria
|-
|FA	||The article has attained featured article status. Detailed community review process.
|-
|GA	||The article has attained good article status. Specific review  process.
|-
|B	||The article is mostly complete and without major issues, but requires some further work to reach good article standards.
|-
|C	||The article is substantial, but is still missing important content or contains a lot of irrelevant material. The article should have references to reliable sources, but may still have significant issues or require substantial cleanup.
|-
|Start	||The article has a usable amount of good content but is weak in many areas. Quality of the prose may be distinctly unencyclopedic; but the article should satisfy fundamental content policies such as notability, and provide sources to establish verifiability.
|-
|Stub	||The article is either a very short article or a rough collection of information that will need much work to become a meaningful article. It is usually very short, but if the material is irrelevant or incomprehensible, an article of any length falls into this category.

[[File:Featured_article_star.svg|thumb|right|Featured Article symbol]]
Review of a Wikipedia article is different from peer-review of an original research paper for a journal. Someone who “reviews a paper” is also reviewing the research that it reports. It takes expert knowledge to infer, from the paper, how the research was conducted, whether it used the best available methods, and hence whether the research is reliable and significant.

By contrast, a Wikipedia article is not a proxy for something else. The article itself, and its relation to its sources, are the target of the review. The reviewer does not have to infer things that happened away from Wikipedia. The reliability of the article comes from its citations (which is why Open Access research, verifiable by a wider audience, is of more use in improving Wikipedia than paywalled research). So while it is useful for reviewers to be aware of the relevant literature and able to use relevant research tools, it is not essential that all reviewing is done by experts.

Whereas a poorly-written paper reporting significant research might be accepted by a journal and then copy-edited, the reviews on Wikipedia examine the wording and layout in fine detail. Every sentence and citation can potentially be challenged. On the way to Featured Article status, an article typically goes through three review processes, involving at least eight reviewers. While Peer Review and Good Article involve one reviewer (or more if the review is contentious), the Featured Article review is a community process typically involving five or six reviewers. Another contributor reviews the FA discussion to assess whether it has reached consensus.

Whether it involves formal review or not, a quality scale is important in helping contributors work together, rather than against each other. The scale has to be flexible enough to adapt to different subjects, since a summary of knowledge about a battleship is different from a summary of knowledge about an art form. At the same time, the scale has to be cashed out in enough detail to guide individual decisions about progress. Tangible models (other encyclopedias in the case of Wikipedia) make this easier.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[:wikipedia:Stone soup|a common European folk tale]], a cook is tricked into boiling a &quot;magic&quot; stone in water to make &quot;stone soup&quot;. The taste is unappetising, so the cook adds some potatoes to &quot;bring out&quot; the flavour. Other cooks, still unsatisfied, add different herbs and vegetables in the hope of tasting stone soup at its finest. Eventually they all enjoy a delicious, nutritious soup. The stone was not magic, but it was essential to the successful outcome: it was there to create a soup that people would find inadequate and hence would want to improve.

Good articles on Wikipedia usually come from a similar process. They may have begun as a simple definition such as &quot;Cancer is a disease of unrestricted cell growth&quot;. Some of the readers, finding that inadequate, might supply details about symptoms of cancer. Others will have found it incomplete or inaccurate in other ways, and added text and references about treatments, diagnosis, biology and so on. Thus, over thousands of edits, a short definition evolves into a detailed and comprehensive article.

This process is only possible because of Wikipedia's unconventional publication process:

* It was technically possible for users to edit the live version of the site
* Users needed no permission to edit
* No lawyers or managers had to sign off on changes
* The owners of the site were prepared to bear the risk of articles being inadequate or even unreliable, for a long time
* Each change was recorded, viewable to the public, and reversible. So the merit of each change could be discussed at any point after it was made

This illustrates the centrality of openness (in its various forms) to the success of the Wikimedia sites. In a technical sense, the wiki was built in an open way to enable public contributions. In a legal sense, Wikipedia is an open resource whose users are free to alter it. The process of development is open in that it is public and auditable.

The concept of “ready for publication” does not apply in Wikipedia or the other projects. Just as the cooks started tasting soup when it only included the stone, it is essential that articles and their flaws are on public display so that people can improve them. The distinction between “published article” and “unpublished drafts” is replaced by tags or badges to show that content has problems or alternatively that it has passed a review. This puts some burden on the reader to take notice of tags and be appropriately critical, rather than assuming that something is true because it is published.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">By default, full copyright applies to new creative works: there is very little that the end user can do in terms of copying or altering them without permission from the owner. Creative Commons licences give a spectrum of different options in which the copyright owner still legally owns the material, but retains more or fewer rights in it, giving advance permission for copies, remixes and derivative works.

The copyright status of the material sets the balance of power between the hosting organisation and the contributors. Hosting organisations might be tempted to use copyright to keep a high degree of control over their content, if not with full copyright then reserving exclusive rights to commercial exploitation. This might seem a desirable move, but it has further effects.

If someone is asked to work in their spare time for the commercial benefit of an organisation, that is less compelling than working in their spare time for the cause of free global education or the advance of knowledge. As well as being a more noble goal, the latter option gives the contributor an assurance they are going to be able to keep and use what they have worked on.

There is a point in this spectrum of rights which defines what are known as free cultural works: text, media, or other works that anyone can use for any purpose, including adapting for their own use and distributing the adapted versions. This mirrors how the word “free” is used in the free software movement. All the contents of the Wikimedia sites (with small exceptions) are free cultural works by this definition.

If Wikipedia were fully copyrighted, improvement of articles would be impossible. Editing and translation of an article creates derivative works in the terms of copyright law. If that required permission of the previous authors, there would be no quick editing.

[[File:Pedia-still-9.jpg|thumb|right|Printed books created from Wikipedia content]]

If the licence were for noncommercial use only, some intended forms of distribution would not be possible, including distribution on a cost-recovery basis. The Wikimedia Foundation have a relationship with a for-profit print-on-demand publisher, PediaPress, which allows users to compile articles into books and to access these or community-created books digitally or in hard copy. This is already being used in universities to create tailored reference works for courses (Wane, 2012). This would not be a viable tool if PediaPress’s printing and selling of a book awaited permission of the Wikipedia contributors.

The choice faced by Wikipedia is not between more or less control of its content. In practice, the choice has been full control of nothing versus hosting and curation of the largest encyclopedia ever written.

The ShareAlike (SA) clause in the default Wikipedia licence stipulates that any derivative work must be given the same licence as the original. Whereas the attribution clause prevents others from taking your work and presenting it as their own, the SA clause prevents others from taking your work, adapting it, and giving the adapted version a more restrictive licence that restricts commercial exploitation to themselves. This, then, is another way to reassure contributors that they are working for a public commons, not private commercial benefit.

The content, policies, digital media and underlying software of Wikimedia projects are freely and openly available. It is technically possible to take them lock, stock and barrel (without private data like user logins) to another hosting organisation. This possibility gives the hosting organisation an incentive to respect the wishes of contributors, which in turn gives people the confidence to contribute. The same applies to Open Source software projects which build up large communities of contributors. Those contributors know that if they are unhappy with the project’s direction they can take an earlier version of the software and build from that (known as “forking”).

That an entire project can fork is not just a theoretical possibility. The crowdsourced travel guide Wikitravel was hosted by the commercial company Internet Brands, until in 2012 the contributors, complaining of insufficient updates and excessive advertising, forked the site to make WikiVoyage, which is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. This is a rare event but it illustrates how free cultural works maintain the balance of power between host and contributors. It also illustrates that it is the good will of the community, not rights in the content, that keeps the project viable (Benkler, 2012).

Where social media sites ask for exclusive commercial rights, contributors have to question whether the service they get from the site is unique and valuable enough to justify giving up some of their rights to their own content. In 2012 the photo sharing site Instagram retracted proposed new legal terms after a backlash from users. The new terms would have given the site a permanent exclusive licence to sell or licence users’ photos.

Wikimedia’s status as a charity without commercial influences is one factor in getting contributions from the public, but it is not a necessary factor. There are commercial entities using wikis and Creative Commons-licensed content to crowdsource reference sites, some of which use the free MediaWiki software that underlies Wikimedia. WikiHow develops tutorials, Wikia hosts thousands of how-to sites and fan sites, and Internet Brands’ original hosting of Wikitravel is another example.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://xkcd.com/214/ Randall Munroe’s cartoon] illustrates what seems to be a common user experience of Wikipedia: its web-like structure, linking all kinds of subjects, draws casual readers in to learn about things they would not have anticipated.

Less obvious, but essential to note, is that this effect works for creation as well as consumption. Anyone who learns how to edit articles about bridges also learns how to edit articles about US Presidents, Batman, or clothing, because all articles are in one software platform. Similarly, anyone who learns how to edit articles on Wikipedia also learns how to edit travel guides on Wikivoyage, news articles in Wikinews, and so on. The immediacy of wiki editing (just press &quot;Edit&quot;, make a change, then press &quot;Save&quot;) means that once someone has a taste for making changes, they can keep doing it whenever they find something they can improve.

There are processes in Wikipedia that require a previously uninvolved editor to review an article and confirm that it meets certain standards, for example Good Article Review. This is usually done on a pay-it-forward basis: a contributor who wants a review of their own article is usually expected to review someone else's contribution, and so on. Hence someone who is fixated on improving one article will, at some point, have to look at other content and decide what improvements it needs.

Contributors come with different intentions. Some want to improve articles about a topic such as their locality, their hobby or a subject they've studied. Others feel best able to contribute in ways that cut across topics: articles in British English, articles with vector diagrams, or articles with embedded geographical data, for example. These different contributors benefit from different categories and navigational tools. Here, the above-mentioned queues (such as &quot;articles with promotional text&quot;, &quot;articles awaiting Good Article review&quot;, or &quot;articles with broken external links&quot;) are valuable tools for helping people find where they can usefully contribute.

Users looking to improve articles of a particular kind use the same navigational tools as users who have come to find that kind of article. So anything that might be used to help readers with navigation can also be used to encourage contributions. Conversely, anything that segments and separates content will discourage some contributions. Separating the collection of articles by topic would make little difference to the topic-focused contributors but would obstruct, and get much less value from, the other kinds of contributor.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">If the users of a resource are also expected to be contributors, then whatever makes things easier for the readers will indirectly benefit the resource by making it easier to contribute. For this reason, the hosting organisation needs to attend to the balance of power between it and the contributors. Restricting reuse of the content may well lead to there being no content, just as people are less likely to buy from a shop that has no money-back guarantee. Walls around content may keep some contributors in but they keep a larger number of potential contributors from improving it.</text>

Are you free to park anywhere you like? There is a sense in which nothing prevents you from parking your car anywhere that can be reached from the road. You are not physically prevented from parking on your neighbour’s lawn or across the middle of the high street, but this does not mean you are free to do it. Drivers know they can only park in certain places. Elsewhere, they risk getting fined or towed away. So in a physical sense, you can park on people’s lawns, but in a more important cultural sense that actually shapes people’s behaviour, you can’t.

Wikipedia and similar communities have that same distinction between what is technically possible and what is culturally allowable. Technical possibility is determined by the software, but what is culturally allowable is decided in policy, values and community consensus. There is scope for interpretation and for human judgement in deciding what contributors are free to do, just as there is scope for a court to decide if someone’s actions count as murder.

It is technically possible to delete all the text from Wikipedia’s Featured Article, replace journal citations with tabloid newspapers, or to copy articles from a blatantly promotional site. This doesn’t mean that Wikipedia regards you as free to do these things, in fact they would be disastrous, even just as an experiment. For vandals, there are consequences: the edits can be undone and the accounts warned, blocked or banned.

So creating a community-driven site involves establishing and enforcing cultural norms and procedures. These answer such questions as:

* How does the community resolve disputes?
* What distinguishes constructive from unconstructive contributions?
* How do you distinguish good-faith but unconstructive contributions (which require educating or nudging the contributor) from intentional disruption (which requires minimising the future damage they can do)?
* How are disruptive contributions punished? How are constructive contributions rewarded?
* What changes are new users trusted to make, and how can they earn greater trust, or have trust withdrawn?

The transparency and perceived fairness of the answers to these and other questions will affect people’s experience of the community and their willingness to contribute.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wikipedia’s core principles are summed up in [[:wikipedia:WP:5P|&quot;five pillars&quot;]] which all new users are encouraged to learn. A quick summary is:

* Wikipedia is an encyclopedia
* Wikipedia is neutral
* Wikipedia is free
* Users interact in a civil and respectful manner
* Wikipedia does not work on fixed rules

Which of the pillars is the crucial one for getting people to work together productively, and to discuss each other’s work constructively? The fourth pillar may stand out as the obvious answer because it directly tells users to be civil. However, such rules do not guarantee civil behaviour, or the problems with trolling and abuse in online communities could be solved instantly.

More important is the first pillar, “Wikipedia is an encyclopedia”. This specifies a very constrained kind of literature; an encyclopedia is a summary of already-published knowledge. New users who add personal opinions, personal experience or speculation are told that this is inadmissible irrespective of whether they are right or wrong, because those things are not in scope of an encyclopedia.

If the goal of an article about abortion were to decide “the truth” about abortion, the debate would be unproductive and interminable. In practice, this would not be a shared goal because people would work against each other. Deciding what reputable sources say about abortion, and what opinions are held about abortion by different cultures and groups, is more achievable. There is scope for disagreement, but it is a goal that people with widely different opinions can share.

The drive for quality requires that articles are written in a balanced way, and writing a balanced article usually requires multiple sources and points of view to be represented. This incentivises contributors to write about perspectives that they don’t personally agree with. Paradoxically, the focus on verifiable sources can give the impression that Wikipedia is not interested in or directed towards truth, but this focus actually promotes reliability by directing contributors to reliable sources rather than their subjective responses to the topic.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is another sense in which Wikipedia’s goal of creating a free encyclopedia seems to occupy a “sweet spot”. Explaining this involves looking at two other Wikimedia projects.

[[File:Wikisource-logo-en.png|thumb|right|The Wikisource logo]]
Wikisource is a library of free-content texts, including works of literature, reference works, and historically or politically significant documents. It uses crowdsourced effort to upload scans, correct character-recognition errors and proofread. The end product is electronic text that is faithful to the original text of the document or book, organised in a way that makes it useful and findable. Slowly but steadily it has built up hundreds of thousands of documents, many coming from cultural partners such as the British Library or the US National Archives.

Where Wikipedia has to be an original literary work, Wikisource is about replicating texts that already exist. This means that there is a clear measure of progress and fewer possibilities for disagreement. The downside is that there is less scope for creative expression. Contributors do not have the same opportunity to make a personal mark as Wikipedians do when they decide the phrasing or structure for an article.

[[File:Wikiversity-logo-en.svg|thumb|124px|right|The Wikiversity logo]]
Wikiversity aims to be a space where people can “mutually cooperate in an active effort to learn”. This includes creating open educational resources, carrying out educational activities (for any educational context or level) and carrying out original research projects. Its tens of thousands of resources cover the whole spectrum of quality. A group of economists at the University of Exeter have shared [[wikiversity:Economic Classroom Experiments|a handbook of classroom economic experiments]] through the site, benefiting from textual improvements by the community. This is an example of the site’s very best content: there is a lot more of dubious utility, including fringe points of view.

Wikiversity’s scope is very much less constrained than Wikipedia’s; it accepts a lot of material that would be deleted outright from Wikipedia. It is harder to argue that anything should be deleted, since almost any online materials could have some use in education or research. A project similar to Wikipedia but less constrained might sound like it would attract many more contributions and become a greater success. This is the reverse of what happened. One possible reason is reputation: people are prouder of getting their material onto a platform that rejects a lot of contributions. Another is that there may simply be more demand for didactic encyclopedic text than for other types of educational resource. Another is that contributors need the confidence that their actions will improve the site, and that this requires a tightly-defined scope.

Wikipedia, Wikiversity, and Wikisource’s goals are all laudable, and the differences in their success are due to multiple factors that are technical, historical and social. However, the community’s goal plays a part, and Wikipedia’s much greater contributor base and audience result at least partly from the mix of creativity and constraint.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">While there are some &quot;do’s&quot; and &quot;don’ts&quot;, the success of Wikipedia is not an easily replicable model, and may even be unique. So in most cases it makes sense not to beat them but to join them. Creating a new volunteer community is hard, but moving digital content into a space where an existing community can work on it is easier (Masum et al, 2013).</text>

Wiki software is used by many different sites for different purposes, not all of which become successful crowdsourcing projects. The site has to function as a community that makes positive contributors feel welcome and destructive contributors unwelcome. It has to encourage people with different interests and opinions to build on each other’s work. The direction taken with this design can make or break the success of the project.

|Cory Doctorow quoted by Reuters, 14 Jan 2011}}
For the crowd to improve content, it needs to be technically and legally possible for them to make changes. So crowdsourcing is impossible without at least some commitment to openness and to the rights of the end user. This section explores some factors that have made Wikimedia successful at attracting a large number of contributions, and some ways in which crowdsourcing can be ruined by too much control.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wikipedia and its sister sites have not come about by planning the expenditure of effort, but by describing in detail the work to be done, labelling it and giving people a variety of ways to contribute, depending on their knowledge, time, skills and confidence. A crucial part of this success comes from a goal which is appealing, attainable in steps, flexible and tangible enough to be understood by, and inspire, a wide audience. If people are to work for free, they need confidence that their work advances a goal that they admire, and that their involvement will have some visible effect.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FUN-top|xrefs2=both}}
The '''config.txt''' file is the central descriptor for a Trainz content item. Every content item has a single {{wp|INI file|configuration INI file}} and in Trainz its always named config.txt and will appear in the {{TA|Trainz assets}} folder when the asset is {{TG|O|open for edit}}. The configuration data will determines the name, {{TR|K|=kind}} and {{TG|K|unique ID}} (KUID) of the item, as well as various kind-specific details. All other files used by the asset build of the content item are located ''via references in the config.txt file''. Assets which are used as components but configured to be standalone, will reference by a KUID, 

The config.txt file is stored in the {{TR|formats|ACS Text Format}}. When hand-editing the file, care must be taken to use correct syntax or the meaning of parts or the entirety of the file may become permanently lost. When content is installed into Trainz, or when it is archived (in {{TR|formats|CDP Format}} or similar) the config.txt file is stored in a machine-optimised binary format. If the content is later extracted using {{TL|Content Manager}}, the config.txt file is converted back to text format, however any custom formatting or erroneous syntax is already lost and cannot be restored.


==Standard Tags==
A variety of tags are available to all Trainz content items, regardless of the specific asset type. These tags are inherited from the {{TL|KIND TrainzBaseSpec}} base asset type, and are described there.


==Localisation==
As the {{TR|formats|ACS Text Format}} uses UTF-8 encoding, non-english text entries may occur within any string field in the config.txt file. To allow for multiple locale support and to avoid confusion, the standard string tags which require localisation allow multiple entries and use the following conventon:

* ''username'' - The content's human-readable name, in American English. The English name for the asset must be present.
* ''username-de'' - The content's human-readable name, in German.
* ''username-cz'' - The content's human-readable name, in Czech.
* etc.

The following standard tags support this form of localization:

* {{TR|tags|Username tag}}
* {{TR|tags|Description tag}}
* {{TR|containers|String-table container}}

==Common Containers==
* {{TR|containers|attached-track container}}
* {{TR|containers|extensions container}}
* {{TR|containers|kuid-table container}}
* {{TR|containers|mesh-table container|p=Mesh-table container}}
* {{TR|containers|obsolete-table container}}
* {{TR|containers|string-table container}}
* {{TR|containers|textures container}}
* {{TR|containers|thumbnails container}}
* ...

&lt;big&gt;

Whether you're a participant who has already done the early labs dozens of times or an instructor who's teaching a session that focuses on a later lab, it is often useful to skip earlier labs and focus on later labs in the RAC Attack curriculum.  Code to automate the RAC Attack labs is currently being developed and tested.


This page will contain instructions for automatically building a standard RAC Attack environment.

{{Info|These steps are being tested on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX}}

== Quick Start ==

{{Warning|you need a lot of memory and free disk space for this. See {{RA/A|RAC_Attack_12c/Hardware_Requirements}}. For these automation labs, 8GB memory can be a stretch if you have other programs running and 40GB disk might be pushing it too. This is still under development!}}

At this point in time, we're working to automate the third and fourth labs - [[../RAC Attack 12c/Create VirtualBox VM|Install Linux]] and [[../RAC_Attack_12c/Create_Virtualbox_Shared_Storage|Create Cluster]].

# Complete the first three labs: [[../RAC_Attack_12c/Hardware_Requirements|Hardware Requirements]], [[../RAC Attack 12c/Software Components|Software Components]] and [[../RAC Attack 12c/VirtualBox Setup|Prepare Host]].  Don't download Oracle Linux; just the database and cluster software.
# Download and install Vagrant 1.5.1
# Download and unzip http://racattack.org/vagrantfile.zip (note that this file changes frequently as we work on it)
# Open a command prompt and change into the directory where you unzipped vagrantfile.zip
# &lt;code&gt;cd vagrantfile-master\OracleLinux\racattack12cR1&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;vagrant ssh collabn1&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;sudo su - oracle -c vncserver&lt;/code&gt;
# Run the vnc client of your choice and connect to vnc://192.168.78.51:1
# discuss issues at http://racattack.org/list or https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile/issues

{{Info|typing &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt; for the first time on your laptop will trigger an 808MB download.  to just download the file without provisioning your VM (e.g. while you sleep) you can type &lt;code&gt;vagrant box add racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;.}}

{{Info|even without the download, running &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt; will take a long time - especially creating 20GB of &quot;shared disk&quot; before starting the first VM.}}

You can now skip to [[RAC_Attack_-_Oracle_Cluster_Database_at_Home/RAC_Attack_Automation#Connecting_to_the_virtual_machine|Connectting to the virtual machine]]

== Credits ==

This project came to you by [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=RAC_Attack_-_Oracle_Cluster_Database_at_Home/Team the RAC Attack Team]


Initial version: [mailto:alvaro@kikitux.net Alvaro Miranda] 14/04


== Getting started ==


For this implementation, we will be using Vagrant, to manage VirtualBox and automate the deployment.

=== Software used in this implementation ===

Besides the software listed in {{RA/A|RAC_Attack_12c/Software_Components}} for SSH, VNC and Grid and Database component, the following software have been used and tested in this implementation.

* [http://vagrantup.com vagrant] 1.5.1
* [http://packer.io packer] 0.5.2

=== OS that are know to work ===

This implementation have been tested in the following operating system:

* Windows 7 Professional 64 bit
* OracleLinux 6.5 64 bit
* Apple OSX OS X 10.9.2

=== OS used in the guest machine ===

The OS used in the guest machine is Oracle Linux 6.5 + updates.

The version of the box used reflect the day when the box was created and updated:

&lt;code&gt;
alvaros-mini:oracle65 alvarom$ vagrant box outdated --global

* 'racattack/oracle65' (v14.03.29) is up to date

alvaros-mini:oracle65 alvarom$ 
&lt;/code&gt;

This version of &lt;code&gt;racattack/oracle65&lt;code&gt; was created and updated to 14.03.29

{{Info|In the future, if new boxes are released, the version will match the day when the box was created}}


===  Hardware requirement ===


# Please review {{RA/A|RAC_Attack_12c/Hardware_Requirements}} and check you met the minimum hardware requirement.


=== Software Components ===


# Go to {{RA/A|RAC_Attack_12c/Software_Components}} and ensure you have all the Software Components listed there.


{{Info| We will use a Vagrant Box that have the OS and all the RPM requirement installed. Oracle Linux ISO are not required for this task}}


=== Vagrant ===

For this lab, you need vagrant, go to [http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html] , download and install vagrant software.

{{Info|This has been tested with Vagrant 1.5.1}}

== Introduction to Vagrant - Vagrant 101 ==


On this lab, we will use vagrant, however is left to the reader visit the [http://docs.vagrantup.com/ Vagrant documentation] in order to learn what other features can be useful outside this lab.


From [http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/why-vagrant/index.html why-vagrant] page:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Once the software is installed, a normal deployment goes like this:


# Download a [http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes.html vagrant box]
# Create a [http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/index.html Vagrantfile]


{{Info|Vagrant is a command line tool, if you are on Windows, open a command line window }}


Let's execute some commands with vagrant:


 &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;alvaros-mini:~ alvarom$ vagrant --help
 Usage: vagrant [options] &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]
 -v, --version Print the version and exit.
 -h, --help Print this help.

alvaros-mini:~ alvarom$ vagrant --version
Vagrant 1.5.1

alvaros-mini:~ alvarom$ vagrant box list

alvaros-mini:~ alvarom$ 

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


=== vagrant box ===


A vagrant box is a virtual machine template, with configurations made specifically for vagrant. In order to create box, you need to follow the steps listed at [http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes/base.html base box documentation]

The box used in the lab, have been created using [http://packer.io packer] version 0.5.2

Since vagrant 1.5.x you can download boxes from internet with a simple command:


 &lt;code&gt;vagrant box add racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;


This will download the base box used for this lab.


At this point, the box racattack/oracle65 is in your system, and you can use it.


=== Vagrantfile ===


Vagrant file is where the automation starts, it will include information about what box to use, from where get it, and will execute the customization listed in the Vagrantfile

According to [http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/index.html vagrantfile documentation], Vagrantfile is:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;The primary function of the Vagrantfile is to describe the type of machine required for a project, and how to configure and provision these machines. Vagrantfiles are called Vagrantfiles because the actual literal filename for the file is Vagrantfile (casing doesn't matter).

Vagrant is meant to run with one Vagrantfile per project, and the Vagrantfile is supposed to be committed to version control. This allows other developers involved in the project to check out the code, run vagrant up, and be on their way. Vagrantfiles are portable across every platform Vagrant supports.

The syntax of Vagrantfiles is Ruby, but knowledge of the Ruby programming language is not necessary to make modifications to the Vagrantfile, since it is mostly simple variable assignment. In fact, Ruby isn't even the most popular community Vagrant is used within, which should help show you that despite not having Ruby knowledge, people are very successful with Vagrant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To create a new Vagrantfile, you can :


 &lt;code&gt;vagrant init racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;


This will create a simple Vagrantfile on the directory where we are executing this command.


Let's enumerate what we have learn so far:


To download a vagrant box
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant box add racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;


To list the boxes in our system
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant box list&lt;/code&gt;


To create an initial Vagrantfile
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant init racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;


Other commands that we will be using are:


To start/create a new vm
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt;

To connect to a vm
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant ssh&lt;/code&gt;

To reboot a vm
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant reload&lt;/code&gt;


To stop a vm
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant halt&lt;/code&gt;

To check status of a vm
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant status&lt;/code&gt;


{{Info|This command will ask for confirmation}}


To delete a vm
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant destroy&lt;/code&gt;


== lab: create test1 vm ==


In this lab, we will create a simple test1 vm.


*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant box add racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant box list&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;mkdir test1&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;cd test1&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant init racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant reload&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant halt&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant destroy&lt;/code&gt;

Below the output on my test machine:

 &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;

Congratulations, you created and detroy your first virtual machine with Vagrant.

== RAC Attack Automation ==

=== Architecture ===

At this point, in the [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RA_Architecture_12c.png RAC Attack Architecture] we are in the first step.

[[File:RA Architecture 12c.png|800px|RAC Attack 12c architecture]]

Our Architecture Diagram looks like this:



=== Code ===

The code for this automation implementation can be found at [[http://racattack.org/code racattack.org/code]]

From the code, we are interested in [https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile racattack/vagrantfile] repo

To download the code are 2 ways:

# Download the zip file
# Using git

{{Info|Please bear in mind that the links can change in the future, so bookmark this webpage and visit [http://racattack.org racattack.org] for latest updates.}}

==== Download the zip file ====


A zip file with all the files required for this project can be downloaded as: https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile/archive/master.zip

Download,
Unzip
{{Info|Unzip the files in a directory with enough space to hold the virtual disks used when creating the virtual machines.}}
You are done.

==== Using git ====

If you are familiar with git, you can download a copy of this repo as:

&lt;code&gt; git clone https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile&lt;/code&gt;

If you have github software installed, then you can [[github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile|click on this link]]

=== reviewing racattack/vagrantfile ===

After downloading the repo locally to your computer, you will end with a structure similar to this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
.
|-- OracleLinux
| |-- README.md
| `-- racattack12cR1


&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

go to the OracleLinux/racattack12cR1 directory

&lt;code&gt;cd OracleLinux/racattack12cR1 &lt;/code&gt;

And the structure will be something like this:

 &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
.
|-- 12cR1
| |-- &lt;scripts&gt;
| `-- readme.txt
|-- Vagrantfile
`-- stagefiles
| |-- &lt;scripts&gt;
` `-- readme.txt
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Before we create our first cluster  ==

Now everything is in place, we can check the status of our cluster:


&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;




alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ vagrant status

collabn2 eth1 lanip :192.168.78.52
collabn2 eth2 privip :172.16.100.52
collabn2 dns server role is slave
on first boot shared disks will be created, this will take some time

collabn1 eth1 lanip :192.168.78.51
collabn1 eth2 privip :172.16.100.51
collabn1 dns server role is master
Current machine states:
collabn2 not created (virtualbox)
collabn1 not created (virtualbox)
This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
above with their current state. For more information about a specific
VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.
alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ 

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

What this out put tell us?

It show are 2 nodes:

 collabn2 not created (virtualbox)
 collabn1 not created (virtualbox)

It show we will be able to access them over the following network detail:

 collabn2 eth1 lanip :192.168.78.52
 collabn2 eth2 privip :172.16.100.52
 collabn1 eth1 lanip :192.168.78.51
 collabn1 eth2 privip :172.16.100.51

This mean, we will move from single node, to 2 node.

This also mean, we are one step closer in the RAC Attack Architecture.

[[File:RA Arquitecture step2.png|800x|RAC attack architecture step2]]

The scripts provided in &lt;code&gt;stagefiles/*.sh&lt;/code&gt; will do all the configuration required for a Oracle RAC Cluster.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;

racattack12cR1
`-- stagefiles
| `-- &lt;scripts&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

If we review the output of &lt;code&gt;vagrant status&lt;/code&gt;, we also have:

 collabn2 dns server role is slave
 collabn1 dns server role is master

This mean, when we provision our lab, &lt;code&gt;collabn1&lt;/code&gt; will be a dns server master and &lt;code&gt;collabn2&lt;/code&gt; will be a dns server slave.

Other piece of information is:
 on first boot shared disks will be created, this will take some time

This is, on the first execution of &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt; Vagrant, using our Vagrantfile will setup everything we need to have for a correct installation of an Oracle RAC 12cR1.

At this point you can do &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt; to create your very first 2 node rac cluster using this project.

== vagrant up  ==

&lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt; command, will read Vagrantfile and will create what is in this file.

This project Vagrantfile have been tested, and improved, and does all the OS requirement to have an Oracle RAC 12cR1 installation, free of issues.

=== Order matters ===
Vagrant execute the scripts and create the machines top to bottom, so for advances uses, we may end installing software, or doing some tasks after the provisioning, so for that, we need all the nodes up and running, so we will be doing  collabn2 first, then collabn1. In this way, once collabn1 is up and running, we can be sure all is up and ready.

=== Review of vagrant up output ===

Let's review the output.

A [https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile/blob/master/OracleLinux/vagrant-up.log sample vagrant up log] can be found on the project page at https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile/blob/master/OracleLinux/vagrant-up.log in case you want to review, before executing your own run.

{{Info|Not all the output will be reviewed. We will highlight the important bits}}

At this stage, the base box is imported.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Importing base box 'kikitux/oracle65-racattack'...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


At this stage, the box is being renamed from the template, into a name suitable for us.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Setting the name of the VM: collabn2.1404011431
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Vagrant magic:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
==&gt; collabn2: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Here, in the &lt;code&gt;pre-boot&lt;/code&gt; section, is where the shared disk are created. We will review this later.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Running 'pre-boot' VM customizations...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Booting the virtual machine, and setting hostname
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Booting VM...
==&gt; collabn2: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
==&gt; collabn2: Setting hostname...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt; 

Mounting shared folder
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Mounting shared folders...
collabn2: /vagrant =&gt; /Users/alvarom/racattack12cR1
collabn2: /media/sf_12cR1 =&gt; /Users/alvarom/racattack12cR1/12cR1
collabn2: /media/stagefiles =&gt; /Users/alvarom/racattack12cR1/stagefiles
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Executing scripts
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Running provisioner: shell...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt; 

=== Shared disk ===
In order to be closer to the RAC Attack 12cR1 Architecture, we need to have shared disks.


This implementation, performs automatically on the first boot the [[RAC_Attack_-_Oracle_Cluster_Database_at_Home/RAC_Attack_12c/Create_Virtualbox_Shared_Storage|RacAttack Create_Virtualbox_Shared_Storage steps]]

Let's check collabn1

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ vagrant status
collabn2 running (virtualbox)
collabn1 running (virtualbox)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt; 

Let's connect to &lt;code&gt;collabn1&lt;/code&gt; and become root

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ vagrant ssh collabn1 
[vagrant@collabn1 ~]$ sudo su -  
[root@collabn1 ~]#
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Let's check the disks.

* udev disk

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
[root@collabn1 ~]# ls -al /dev/asm* /dev/sd*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Apr 1 01:35 /dev/asmdisk1 -&gt; sdc1

brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 80 Apr 1 01:35 /dev/sdf
brw-rw---- 1 grid asmadmin 8, 81 Apr 1 01:35 /dev/sdf1
[root@collabn1 ~]#
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt; 

We have 4 shared disks, sdc,sdd,sde,sdf
We have persistent aliases


* OracleASM disks

{{Info|oracleasm-tools have been used to setup the /dev/oracleasm/disks alias device}}

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
[root@collabn1 ~]# ls -al /dev/oracleasm/disks/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Apr 1 01:35 .

brw-rw---- 1 grid asmadmin 8, 33 Apr 1 01:35 ASMDISK1
brw-rw---- 1 grid asmadmin 8, 49 Apr 1 01:35 ASMDISK2
brw-rw---- 1 grid asmadmin 8, 65 Apr 1 01:35 ASMDISK3
brw-rw---- 1 grid asmadmin 8, 81 Apr 1 01:35 ASMDISK4
[root@collabn1 ~]#
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

{{Info|[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/linux/asmlib/ol6-1709075.html oracleasmlib is included in the Oracle UEK Kernel]. This machines use UEKR3}}

Shared disk created, permission set. Ready to use.

Once again, this mean we are one step closer to the RAC Attack 12cR1 Architecture:

[[File:RA Arquitecture step3.png|800x|RAC_ATTACK Architecture step3]]

=== What came included by default ===

On top the detailed description already provided, this Automation script does:

* Create the required groups, for role separation per Oracle RAC Manual
* Create user grid
* Update groups of user oracle
* Initialize sdb disk for oracle binaries, mount it as /u01
* Setup DNS Settings for Master node (collabn1) slave (collabn2)
* Setup ulimit for grid user, for role separation

=== Default users and password ===

* User   root, password   root
* User   grid, password   grid
* User oracle, password oracle

== Connecting to the virtual machine ==

At this moment, you have 2 ways how to connect to the virtual machines

* &lt;code&gt;vagrant ssh collabn1&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;sudo su -&lt;/code&gt; to become root.

 You can became grid   user as  &lt;code&gt;sudo su - grid&lt;/code&gt; from vagrant
 You can became oracle user as  &lt;code&gt;sudo su - oracle&lt;/code&gt; from vagrant

* ssh/putty to the ip

You laptop computer is connected to both networks, lan 192.168.78 and priv 172.16.100.51.

So you can ssh directly to the machines.

&lt;code&gt;
collabn2 eth1 lanip :192.168.78.52
collabn2 eth2 privip :172.16.100.52

collabn1 eth1 lanip :192.168.78.51
collabn1 eth2 privip :172.16.100.51
&lt;/code&gt;

== Congratulations ==

At this point, you have a 2 node cluster, all ready to work.

This mean, we are 100% with the RAC Attack 12cR1 Architecture, congratulations.

[[File:RA Architecture 12c.png|800px|RAC Attack 12c architecture]]

== What's next ==

Place your downloaded zip oracle binaries in racattack12cR1/12cR1:

 &lt;code&gt;
 12cR1/linuxamd64_12c_grid_1of2.zip
 12cR1/linuxamd64_12c_grid_2of2.zip 
 12cR1/linuxamd64_12c_database_1of2.zip
 12cR1/linuxamd64_12c_database_2of2.zip
 &lt;/code&gt;

Configure VNC session, or use X11, from: [[RAC_Attack_-_Oracle_Cluster_Database_at_Home/RAC_Attack_12c/VNC_Server_Setup|RAC_Attack_12c/VNC_Server_Setup]]

Configure VNC Server with the oracle account (passwords won't be displayed):

 [root@collabn1 ~]# '''su - oracle'''
 [oracle@collabn1 ~]$ '''vncserver :1'''
 
 You will require a password to access your desktops.
 
 Password: '''racattack'''
 Verify: '''racattack'''
 xauth:  creating new authority file /home/oracle/.Xauthority
 
 New 'collabn1.racattack:1 (oracle)' desktop is collabn1.racattack:1
 
 Creating default startup script /home/oracle/.vnc/xstartup
 Starting applications specified in /home/oracle/.vnc/xstartup
 Log file is /home/oracle/.vnc/collabn1.racattack:1.log

Open a vncviewer on your laptop and fill the ip address of '''collabn1''' followed by :'''1'''.

{{Info|On OS X and Linux you can use X11 forwarding instead of VNC. To do that, use the -X flag with your ssh command as in '''ssh -X -l oracle 192.168.78.51'''. If you are using Mountain Lion or later, you may have to install XQuartz first as described at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5293}}


[[File:RA-VNCViewer-Connect form.PNG|RA-VNCViewer-Connect form]]

Enter the password '''racattack''' when prompted:

[[File:RA-VNCViewer-Password form.PNG|RA-VNCViewer-Password form]]

The graphical interface is ready for the Grid Infrastructure Installation.

[[File:RA-VNCViewer-Connected.PNG|800px|RA-VNCViewer-Connected]]


{{Info| Due the nature of Vagrant, the interfaces are eth1: LAN eth2: Interconnect }}

When you get to the interface setup of Grid Infrastructure, please have in mind that the interfaces, due Vagrant requirement are different than the 12cR1 book:

When ready to configure the networks, you need to:

Click on '''Identify Network Interfaces...'''&lt;/li&gt;

Check that the correct addresses are set:

* &lt;big&gt;'''eth0''' is marked as '''Do Not Use'''

* &lt;big&gt;'''eth1''' is marked as '''Public'''

* &lt;big&gt;'''eth2''' is marked as '''Private'''

Click '''OK''' to close the '''Identify Network Interfaces''' window.

Finally, click '''Next'''

Now you can go to the RAC Attack 12cR1 book, and start from [[RAC_Attack_-_Oracle_Cluster_Database_at_Home/RAC_Attack_12c/Prepare_for_GI_install|RAC_Attack_12c/Prepare_for_GI_install]]

== Update base box ==

As today, the version of &lt;code&gt;racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt; is 14.03.29

This is the base box, the box used to create new guest machines.

When a new guest machine is created, that is on the first time you run &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt;, or when you want to recreate your system after running &lt;code&gt;vagrant detroy &lt;/code&gt;

{{Info|In the future, if new boxes are released, the version will match the day when the box was created}}

In order to validate if you are in the latest version available, use command &lt;code&gt;vagrant box outdated --global&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;
alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ vagrant box outdated --global
* 'racattack/oracle65' (v14.03.29) is up to date
alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ 
&lt;code&gt;

This will check the version of the base box installed.


When a new version came out, the command to update the base box is &lt;code&gt;vagrant box update&lt;/code&gt;

Example output:

&lt;code&gt;
alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ vagrant box update
==&gt; default: Checking for updates to 'racattack/oracle65'
default: Version constraints: &gt;= 0
default: Provider: virtualbox
==&gt; default: Box 'racattack/oracle65' (v14.03.29) is running the latest version.
&lt;/code&gt;

== Update OS  ==

If you require to update the OS of the guest machines, the machines are configured to use [http://public-yum.oracle.com public-yum] from oracle.

This mean you can update executing &lt;code&gt;yum update&lt;/code&gt;

For more information [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E37355/html/ol_about_yum.html about yum] please visit http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E37355/html/ol_about_yum.html

;Purpose
:This template is used with {{Tl|ORP-top}} to set off Wiki reference pages, ''and especially those'' that are based on or adapted from the portions of freeware (Public Domain) assets used as examples or from the N3V TrainzOnline Wiki which need an attribution to the {{plain link|https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/us/|CC-BY-SA 2.0 License}}. Use of this template will assert those message properly on the page bottoms of reference pages.

* It will also auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz references]].

* It can be given the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; default parameter to alter the sort order of the reference page as listed in that category. (see example below)

==Options==
# Defining &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{nomsg|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Will do no message box footer when it's not needed.
# Defining &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{noautocat|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Will do no auto-category, so just use a div to replace the template call Dude!
# define '''&lt;nowiki&gt;'| cat1=', '| cat2=', or '|cat3='&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''some-cat-names''''' to add those categories to the page '''''without either''''' &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;Category:&quot; namespace, nor '[[' or ']]' allowed&lt;/nowiki&gt;. (their provided free of charge along with the default pipe tricking to the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[mw:Help:Magic words|Magic word]].
&lt;hr&gt;
* Lastly, this template closes a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot; ...&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; HTML block initiated by {{Tl|ORP-top}}. They should be used together as a pair top and bottom of each page.
'''Example:'''

category, just like {{tl|FUN-bot}}.

* Sorting Difference: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ORP-bot|ABC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will list the page under the A pages, before any page 'Aeroplane' but after 'Aardvark'.
:* Otherwise if no pipe trick is specified, the page will ''default sort'' to the value calculated by {{Tl|CHAPTERNAME}}, which evaluates as the sub-page 'Page title' after the slash in &lt;code&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz references/Page title or description]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;/code&gt;.
:* This is except in rare case exactly what is desired, so only {{tlx|ORP-bot}} need be given.
== Examples ==
'''&lt;u&gt;Contrasting category logic Examples&lt;/u&gt;:'''
# &lt;nowiki&gt; {{ORP-end}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on {{TR|KIND Engine}} will alphabetize the article under ''''K'''', just as a normal &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:Trainz reference pages]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; would do.
# &lt;nowiki&gt; {{ORP-bot|inhibit=1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on [[KIND Engine]] ''will not categorize the page at all''.&lt;!--
# &lt;nowiki&gt; {{ORP-bot|Engine}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on {{TR|KIND Engine}} will alphabetize the article under ''''Engine'''', if and only if cat=category-name is also defined. In the given example, Engine has no effect, so the same result as case 2.
--&gt;
#  &lt;nowiki&gt; {{ORP-bot|cat=category-name|Engine}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on [[KIND Engine]] will alphabetize the article under '''Engine''' to the second category, just as a normal 2nd &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:category-name|Engine]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; long form would do, as well as the normal default [[:category:Trainz references]]. ''Inhibit affects only the default if defined,'' so an alternative category can be specified or two categorizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Edwards' Dodo.jpg|thumbnail|right|Edward's Dodo]]
The '''[[w:Dodo|Dodo]]''' (Raphus cucullatus) is a flightless, extinct bird which inhabited the island of [[w:Maritius Island|Maritius]], and island 1,200 miles down the [[w:African subcontinent|African Subcontinent]]. Nothing is much known about this bird since the only things we have left of the Dodo is pictures and fossils of the bird's bones. 
== How was the Dodo found? ==
It is believed, by ''Extinct Birds'', that the Dodo was found by a Dutch Sailor in 1598 in the island of Mauritius. The name, Dodo, means &quot;Ugly, Disgusting Bird&quot;. It was named that because of the appearance. Many believe, however, that the Dodo only habitat was in the island of Mauritius, so Dutch explorers may have been going through the African subcontinent 1,000 miles below.

== How is the Dodo extinct? ==
[[File:Jacht op dodo's door Willem van West-Zanen uit 1602.jpg|thumbnail|right|The process of the killing of Dodos, which led to there extinction]]

[[File:Dodo head and leg.jpg|thumbnail|Dodo head and leg]]
The main reason why the Dodo is extinct is because it was a real target for food. Not only alive were they killed, but some of their eggs were eaten. Usual Dodo eggs were main food for vultures and coyotes. Which led up to the big extinction. It is to be believed that the last dodo was spotted, or seen, in around the 1660s or the early 1670s. There have also been various other animals that are extinct from Maritius
=== What were the main predators? ===
[[File:View of the Mauritius roadstead - engraving.jpg|thumbnail|right]]
The main predators are mankind. Hence the fact that they are extinct, the dodos became extinct because of Dutch sailors hunting them for food, and as mentioned above that the Dodo eggs are usual prey to many birds or other land animals who were on Mauritius, preventing more dodos from hatching. The dodos became prey of which many of the Dutch sailor's animals, such as pigs, monkeys, and rats.

;Summary:
The famous extinct Dodo, which has a pitiful reputation as a stupendously overweight idiot of a bird that couldn't even fly, has DNA related to the [[w:pigeon|Pigeon]]. Which DNA examinations show.
;Quotes
&quot;Island taxa such as the dodo and solitaire often represent extreme examples of evolution—and if we want to examine how we, or the life around us, evolved then such animals are very educational, By examining island birds we can investigate how evolution works—because extreme examples are often the best views of how something works&quot; --Alan Cooper, a zoologist at the University of Oxford and one of the co-authors of the study.

=== Preserves of Dodos ===
The only thing we have which traces the Dodo's history is pictures of the bird and bones of the bird, which is preserved mostly in museums. More are come to find, but and most will be carefully examined by special scientists.

==Trainz-build tag number==
The '''trainz-build tag''' number indicates the minimum '''{{TR|R|Trainz build versions|p=Trainz Code Version}}''' required to use the asset. Trainz will not attempt to load an asset which has a trainz-build tag that is newer than it's own version number, but unfortunately ContentManager will continue to report there are updates, even when they are entirely inappropriate. 

This tag is also an indication of the age of the asset, and the general technical configuration and standards to which it is built. The values will range up from the oldest {{TL|Trainz 1.0}} release (2001) with three {{wp|service pack|Service Packs}} making the version commonly referred to as Trainz V-1.3, or Trainz 1.3.  Assets with old Trainz-build numbers are not built to take advantage of new Trainz features that did not exist in the version of Trainz that the asset was built for, and the oldest used approaches which have been entirely abandoned. Newer Trainz releases do their best to translate these older technologies into the newer releases standards (data organization and graphical tech) but some small percentage of assets cannot be converted. 
&amp;nbsp;
{{UserTip|The word ''version'' is used in Trainz to refer to three different concepts. There is the '''Trainz Retail Version''', the '''Trainz Version''' and the '''Trainz Build Number'''.
The '''Trainz Retail Version''' is a text string for a product release, such as ''Trainz Simulator 2009''.
The '''Trainz version''' is a numeric code (e.g ''2.4'' or ''3.6'') which is incremented for each major release. This code is updated whenever a significant change to Trainz is made. Most service packs (which introduce significant functionality changes) will have a new ''Trainz Version'', but hotfixes (which do not introduce significant functionality changes) do not see a ''Trainz version'' number change. Different language versions of the same product will also generally share the same ''Trainz Version''.
The '''Trainz Build Number''' is a unique number (e.g. ''44653'' or ''58414'') that identifies an individual Trainz release. All releases (including minor changes and language translations) have a different ''Trainz Build Number''.
The '''Trainz-build''' tag uses the ''Trainz Version'' numeric code.
}}

[[file:CM will input Versions too advanced-TS10-SP2 shown.JPG|thumb|400px|'''TS10 SP2's Content Manager (V-3.2)''' happily imported TS12 version (V-3.4) texture cdp's for TransDEM.exe in November 2013. Other legacy versions of Trainz will also import 'Version unidentified' trainz content.&lt;br&gt; 
 
* '''For the new Trainz users:'''' the moral of this story is to examine trainz-build tags (versions) ASAP after importing new content into CM and provide human intelligence as to whether to delete, keep the asset, or set it aside; seek advice before trying to use, or risk breaking Trainz for while.&lt;br&gt; 
* Some content can be retrograded to work in earlier Trainz releases. More recently published Routes and Sessions cannot. ]]

==Asset compatibility==
It is important for an asset to list the correct Trainz-build in the {{TR|R|config.txt file}}. It specifies the version of Trainz the asset was intended to be used with. An earlier version of Trainz will refuse to load the asset. A later version of Trainz will enable appropriate backwards compatibility workarounds (e.g. using different validation requirements) as required.
&amp;nbsp;

A correctly-constructed asset built for an older version will usually function in a newer version of Trainz. However, Trainz content validation is improved over time, and newer versions of Trainz detect errors that older versions did not pick up on. Some content may be detected as 'faulty' in a current Trainz version that was missed in the version it was originally created for.
&amp;nbsp;

It should be noted that content that is uploaded to the {{TA|Download Station}} is validated by the most recent version of Trainz, using the validation compatibility for the trainz-build specified by the asset.
&amp;nbsp;

If {{TA|Content Creator Plus}} is used to modify an asset, it will automatically update the trainz-build version in the config.txt file to the current Trainz version. If this version has changed significantly, other changes to the config.txt file will probably be required.
Assets which are manually edited will need the appropriate version entered. If the line is omitted entirely, the lowest possible version is assumed. This is currently ''Trainz-build 1.3''.
&amp;nbsp;

==Obsolete Versions==
Trainz-build numbers up to and including 2.8 are considered obsolete as of September 2012 and can no longer be uploaded to the {{TL|Download Station}}. See the {{TR|R|Trainz Life-Cycle Policy}} for additional details.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey guys. I was wondering if we should include sub headings within the Main concepts section for each concept ? Was thinking it would be a good way to organize the different concepts? What do you guys think ? ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 22:34, 24 March 2014 (UTC))


Hey. I agree, I think having subheadings will make the page look more organised and professional. I think that we should start with a detailed description of the actual idea of Always-On Culture and then move on to Turkle and Boyd's ideas, each under their own subheading. What does everyone think? Also, is there something obvious I have missed? [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 15:34, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Should we change the main concepts to be more a section for each thinker than each concepts, or just add each of the main thinkers at the end or start of the section ? ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 22:41, 27 March 2014 (UTC))

Hi guys. I wanted to put in something about the fact that teenagers are more associated with &quot;always-on culture&quot; than any other group of people. Any suggestions of where, under which sub-heading, I should put it? Thanks! [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 13:50, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

''''reduced context cues'''' why the double bold here and not elsewhere? Try to be consistent with formatting :o) [[User:GregXenon01|GregXenon01]] ([[User talk:GregXenon01|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GregXenon01|contribs]]) 15:07, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Sorry about the double bold on social context cues it was a mistake on my part when making the sub heading and i didn't notice the error till today, however I've fixed it now and will check more carefully next time. As for teenagers being more associated with 'always on culture' you could work it into the idea of being part of a network as they would presumably be the largest part of said network and the implications of that ? ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 22:58, 28 March 2014 (UTC))

We should be sure to remain consistent with danah boyd's name. Some people are capitalising it when she is known for having it in lower case (even her Wikipedia page has it in lower case). (If anyone is dead against lower case just say here so everyone knows to put it like that). Thanks! [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 16:53, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Should we capitalize boyd's name when it is in the beginning of the sentence? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 17:55, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Good idea about putting the idea about teenagers being more associated with always on in the networking section. Thanks. I think if her name is lower case even on her Wikipedia page that we should keep it lower case throughout. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:14, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I've noticed that there are several different ways that we are saying &quot;Always-On Culture&quot;. Some have upper and lower case, some all upper case, some all lower case and some are in and some are out of quotations. I think they should all be the same, with perhaps the exception of the first time it should be in upper case. Do you think it should have &quot;&quot; quotations or ''? [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:33, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I agree Kathryn that we need to be a bit more consistent in the formatting of the words &quot;Always On Culture&quot;. In the module handbook and all our other course material the topic is refered to as 'Always On' Culture - with the culture aspect being titled as 'Always On' not an entire clause phrase and capitalising the C in 'Culture'. I hope that's helpful, what do others think? [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

I think we should go with what the handbook says. Also, are we putting the references in alphabetical order? Do you think it would look better or do you think they should be in line with where they are in the text? As in, if the reference comes first in the text should it come first in the reference list?

Hey guys, I was wondering for referencing, if we were to use the ref tags or not? https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 19:16, 31 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, I'm Jamie and I'm a second year Film &amp; Media student at Stirling University. 
When I'm not hacking away at this Wikibook, I spend most of my days lazing around playing guitar. I used to sing as well, but it caused many people considerable pain and distress so I've had to stop that. 
If there's anything I can help with; be sure to give me a shout!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first comprehensive book to uniquely combine the three fields of systems architecting/engineering, operations/production systems, and multiple criteria decision making/optimization

Systems architecting is the art and science of designing, engineering, and building complex systems—combining art, science, management, and engineering disciplines. Operations and Production Systems with Multiple Objectives covers all classical topics of operations and production systems as well as new topics not seen in any similiar textbooks before: small-scale design of cellular systems, large-scale design of complex systems, clustering, productivity and efficiency measurements, and energy systems.
Filled with completely new perspectives, paradigms, and robust methods of solving classic and modern problems, the book includes numerous examples and sample spreadsheets for solving each problem, a solutions manual, and a book companion site complete with worked examples and supplemental articles.
Operations and Production Systems with Multiple Objectives will teach readers:
# How operations and production systems are designed and planned
# How operations and production systems are engineered and optimized
# How to formulate and solve manufacturing systems problems
# How to model and solve interdisciplinary and systems engineering problems
# How to solve decision problems with multiple and conflicting objectives

Spirituality in India is not just an esoteric philosophy or practice, it has found its place in the most commonplace routines and daily lives of India's people. Looking at how spirituality fits in this context can give us a better perspective of the roots and future of Indian culture. Besides, it also helps us understand the unique nature of spiritual pursuit in India, which is found in various forms: as ascetic practices, the study of scriptures, devotion or bhakti, pilgrimages and temples. This book focuses on indigenously developed spiritual traditions, which include Hinduism and its offshoots, Christianity of the Malabar Coast and Indian branches of the Sufi tradition.

&lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::API2&lt;/code&gt; – yet another Perl interface to the [[MediaWiki]] API

== Synopsis ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
require MediaWiki::API2;

my $uri
    = &quot;https://example.com/w/api.php&quot;;
## alternatively, $uri can be a URI object
my $mw
    = MediaWiki::API2-&gt;new ({ &quot;api_uri&quot; =&gt; $uri });

## optional; may also be an interactive loop
my ($user, $pw)
    = Example::get_credentials_somehow ()
    or die ();
$mw-&gt;login ({ &quot;lgname&quot; =&gt; $user,
              &quot;lgpassword&quot; =&gt; $pw });

## get metadata for all the pages starting on Example in the
## main namespace, and also all the recently changed pages,
## sans for the bot edits; (both queries subject to the
## per-query limits in effect at the remote API endpoint)
my $query = {
    qw (action  query),
    &quot;continue&quot;  =&gt; &quot;&quot;,
    qw (prop    info    generators  allpages|recentchanges),
    qw (gapfrom Example gaplimit    max   gapnamespace  0),
    qw (grcshow !bot    grclimit    max   grctoponly    yes)
};
my $meta
    = $mw-&gt;api ($query);

## get more results, using the continue facility
my %pagenfo;
my $state = {
    &quot;max-queries&quot;   =&gt; 3
};
## NB: query_merge updates both the %pagenfo and the $state hash
$mw-&gt;query_merge ($query, \%pagenfo, $state);

$mw-&gt;logout ();
&lt;/source&gt;

== Description ==

&lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::API2&lt;/code&gt; provides a Perl interface to the [[mw:API:Main page|MediaWiki API]].  It’s heavily based on MediaWiki::API by Jools Wills (it’s estimated that around 70% of the code come from there), and the interface is intended to be mostly compatible with it.

There’re, however, a few significant differences between MediaWiki::API2 and MediaWiki::API interfaces:
* MediaWiki::API2 provides a “safe” interface; that is, the class methods generally only return when they succeed; otherwise, an exception (of the &lt;code&gt;[[../MediaWiki::API2::Exception|MediaWiki::API2::Exception]]&lt;/code&gt; class) is raised;
* MediaWiki::API2 supports the MediaWiki API [[mw:API:Query#Continuing queries|“continue”]] facility by the means of an additional &lt;code&gt;query_merge&lt;/code&gt; method;
* several MediaWiki::API methods are not provided by MediaWiki::API2, namely: &lt;code&gt;get_page&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; (convenience); &lt;code&gt;upload&lt;/code&gt; (deprecated); and &lt;code&gt;download&lt;/code&gt;.

== Interface ==
&lt;!-- NB: [[w:Man page]]s are not unknown to have whole paragraphs contained within description lists; as MediaWiki markup does not seem to provide a way to express such a structure, plain HTML is used below instead --&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $mw = MediaWiki::API2-&gt;new (\%options);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create and return a new MediaWiki::API2 object.  The following options are available:&lt;/p&gt;
; &lt;code&gt;api_uri&lt;/code&gt;
: Specifies the [[w:Uniform resource identifier|URI]] of the MediaWiki instance’s [[mw:API:Main page|API]] ''endpoint'' (example: &lt;code&gt;https:{{SERVER}}/w/api.php&lt;/code&gt;.)  ''Note that this option is currently mandatory.''  There is no default.
; &lt;code&gt;api_url&lt;/code&gt;
: This option is an alias for &lt;code&gt;api_uri&lt;/code&gt;, provided for compatibility with [//metacpan.org/pod/MediaWiki::API MediaWiki::API].
; &lt;code&gt;max_lag&lt;/code&gt;
: The query will fail if server reports lag over this number of seconds (an integer.)  This is done by setting the [[mw:API:Mainmodule#Parameters|&lt;code&gt;maxlag&lt;/code&gt;]] parameter in the query.  The default is &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt;, which means that this module will not set the &lt;code&gt;maxlag&lt;/code&gt; parameter by itself.
; &lt;code&gt;max_lag_delay&lt;/code&gt;
: Before retrying the query failed due to the &lt;code&gt;maxlag&lt;/code&gt; condition, the module will wait for this number of seconds.  This number is passed to the &lt;code&gt;sleep&lt;/code&gt; built-in Perl function and should be an integer.  The default is 5.
; &lt;code&gt;max_lag_retries&lt;/code&gt;
: Every time the &lt;code&gt;maxlag&lt;/code&gt; condition is raised, this module will reset the retry counter back to the &lt;code&gt;retries&lt;/code&gt; option’s value.  This option specifies the maximum number of such resets to perform before finally giving up.  The default is 4.
; &lt;code&gt;no_proxy&lt;/code&gt;
: Normally, this module will call the &lt;code&gt;env_proxy&lt;/code&gt; method on the implicitly created [//metacpan.org/pod/LWP::UserAgent LWP::UserAgent] object in order to initialize the proxy settings according to the current environment (see the &lt;code&gt;https_proxy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;http_proxy&lt;/code&gt; environment variables.)  If this option is set to a true value, however, the &lt;code&gt;env_proxy&lt;/code&gt; method will not be called.  The default is false.
; &lt;code&gt;retries&lt;/code&gt;
: If positive, the module will retry the failing query up to this number of times, not counting the first.  It’s an error for this option to be a negative number.  The default is zero.
; &lt;code&gt;retry_delay&lt;/code&gt;
: Before retrying the failed query the module will wait for this number of seconds.  This number is passed to the &lt;code&gt;sleep&lt;/code&gt; built-in Perl function and should be an integer.  The default is zero.
; &lt;code&gt;use_http_get&lt;/code&gt;
: If set to a true value, the module will use the [[w:Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request methods|&lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; HTTP method]] to perform certain actions (which currently are: &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;logout&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;purge&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;paraminfo&lt;/code&gt;.)  Otherwise (and for all the other actions) the &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; method will be used.  The default is false.
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $result = $mw-&gt;api (\%query);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $result = $mw-&gt;api (\%query, { });&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perform a query upon the MediaWiki instance associated with the &lt;code&gt;$mw&lt;/code&gt; MediaWiki::API2 object.  See the [[mw:API:Main page|MediaWiki API documentation]].  This is the primary entry point to this module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method currently accepts no options.  To ensure forward compatibility, the second argument should be either an empty hash, or omitted entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $result = $mw-&gt;edit (\%query);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $result = $mw-&gt;edit (\%query, { });&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perform an action upon the MediaWiki instance, acquiring an [[mw:API:Tokens|edit token]] as necessary.  The actions with specific support in the code are &lt;code&gt;edit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;move&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;patrol&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rollback&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;protect&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unblock&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;watch&lt;/code&gt; actions are also expected to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;emailuser&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;upload&lt;/code&gt; “pseudo-actions” are mapped to &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;edit&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;!-- FIXME: document the details --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method currently accepts no options.  To ensure forward compatibility, the second argument should be either an empty hash, or omitted entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $result = $mw-&gt;login (\%query);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;[[mw:API:Login|Log into]] the MediaWiki instance, acquiring the login token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;%query&lt;/code&gt; hash should contain the user’s name and password under the &lt;code&gt;lgname&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lgpassword&lt;/code&gt; keys, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $result = $mw-&gt;logout ();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;[[mw:API:Logout|Log out]] of the MediaWiki instance, discarding all the stored MediaWiki tokens and [[w:HTTP cookie|HTTP cookies]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $pages_ref = $mw-&gt;query_merge (\%query);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $pages_ref = $mw-&gt;query_merge (\%query, \%pages);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $pages_ref = $mw-&gt;query_merge (\%query, \%pages, \%state);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Query the MediaWiki instance and ''merge'' the pages’ metadata returned (within the &lt;code&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; subsection of the &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt; section of the query result) into the &lt;code&gt;%pages&lt;/code&gt; hash, if given, or a newly created one.  Return the reference to the hash containing the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pages whose respective entries in the &lt;code&gt;%pages&lt;/code&gt; hash exist but have &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt; as their values will not be updated.  (See also the [[#fits-p|&lt;code&gt;fits-p&lt;/code&gt;]] state entry below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this method both uses the “continue” keys within &lt;code&gt;%query&lt;/code&gt; (if any) ''and updates them'' each time a query finishes successfully.  If such an update is not desired, the caller may pass a reference to a ''copy'' of &lt;code&gt;%query&lt;/code&gt;, e. g., by using the &lt;code&gt;{ %query }&lt;/code&gt; form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;%state&lt;/code&gt; hash may contain entries having the following keys, which, if given (and except for &lt;code&gt;fits-p&lt;/code&gt;), ''will also be updated'' before this method returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code id=&quot;fits-p&quot; &gt;fits-p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifies a reference to a Perl function to call as soon as new information about a page is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function will be passed a reference to the hash containing such information.  Should it return a false value, the respective &lt;code&gt;%pages&lt;/code&gt; entry will be set to &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt; and no further metadata will be considered for the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the hash passed to this function may sometimes end up being ''incomplete.''  Hence, this function should only return false when no additional information can change the end result of the tests performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;pages-left&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this number of page entries is updated, no further queries will be considered, irrespective of the &lt;code&gt;queries-left&lt;/code&gt; setting.  The default is &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt;, which means that no limit is set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;queries-left&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maximum number of queries to perform, should the result be deemed too large by the server to be returned as a single response.  The default is 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that by updating all of the &lt;code&gt;%query&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%pages&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;%state&lt;/code&gt; hashes passed, this method allows for additional query results to be fetched simply by repeating the calls to this method, passing the same references on each call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The roots of Indian spirituality and religion stretch back into the stone age. As early as the Paleolithic, we find traces of it in forms that still resonate on the Indian subcontinent today. During the Upper Paleolithic, from 10,000 to 20,000 years before present (BP), there was fire worship and mother goddess worhsip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World Heritage Monuments and Related Edifices in India |last=Ali |first=Javid |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Algora |location= |isbn=9780875864846 |page=18 |pages= |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=54XBlIF9LFgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=bhimbekta&amp;dq=worship%20india%20stone%20age&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q=mother%20goddess%20worship&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Baghor, in Madhya Pradesh, the feminine was worship 11,000 years BP using a triangle as a representation. A triangular stone was found incised with triangles, marked in red ochre, at an altar for a goddess. This practice continues even today in villages of the area, where similar stones, smeared in red and incised with triangles are offered to village deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Archaeology and World Religion |last=Insoll |first=Timothy |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location= |isbn=9780203463673 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the rest of India too, the triangular shape is the basis for creating yantras,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.ishafoundation.org/lifestyle/navaratri-2013-flowering-feminine/ |title=Navaratri Celebrations 2013 – Flowering of the Feminine |author= |date=7 October 2013 |work= |publisher=Isha Blog |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are used for the worship of various deities. Archaeologists who excavated the site state that when the area's villagers saw the excavation, they told the archaeologists, “That’s one of our shrines. You must look after it properly.” After the archaeologists left, the villagers began worshipping at the shrine again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Archaeologist at Work in African Prehistory and Early Human Studies: Teamwork and Insight |last=Clark |first=Desmond |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=University of California Press|location= |isbn=|page=248 |pages= |url=http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt3f59n89f;NAAN=13030&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=d0e11490&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e11202&amp;brand=calisphere |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Harappan civilization (also sometimes called the Indus Valley civilization), more defined modes of worship turn up. Worship of the mother goddess is present alongside phallic worship and worship of a male god. One particular seal, termed the Pashupati seal by archaeologists is of interest. It depicts a horned figure, seated in what seems to be a yogic posture or asana, surrounded by an elephant, a buffalo, a tiger and a rhino. It is accepted by some scholar but disputed by others that this horned figure represents a &quot;proto-Shiva&quot;, an early representation of Shiva, the Hindu God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Handbook of Ancient Religions |last=Hinnells|first=|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= |isbn=9781139461986|page=436-457 |pages= |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FIYiil96ZXAC&amp;lpg=PA435&amp;dq=indus%20phallic%20worship&amp;pg=PA436#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even today, in yogic lore, Shiva is considered the lord of yoga, and the first yogi and guru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.ishafoundation.org/yoga-meditation/history-of-yoga/who-is-shiva-meaning/ |title=Who Is Shiva: Man, Myth or Divine? |author= |date=6 February 2014 |work= |publisher=Isha Blog |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaktism is also found in Harappa, as is the symbol of the swastika, another predominant presence in Hinduism today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Mathematics Extension 1, higher-order inequalities are introduced. I have written down the steps that need to be taken in order to solve these challenging problems. 

When you have a rational function as an inequality (e.g. f(x)/g(x)&gt;a), 
g(x) might be negative, so you cannot simply multiply g(x) by both sides and cancel out. 

Best Method to use is to subtract 'a' to both sides so that you get (f(x)/g(x))-a&gt;0

Rearrange the expression so that there is a common denominator and a single rational function. 

After you rearrange the expression, multiply the denominator by the numerator. This would be your 'sign graph'. Using your polynomial skills learnt from Year 10 Advanced Mathematics, perform a rough sketch of the function. Be sure to write down the 'regions' in which the polynomial is greater than 0 (or less than 0, depending on the question). These would be the solutions to your inequality. 

You would also have to be careful with the original rational function's denominator and see when the function is undefined. For example if the denominator is x+1, -1 should not be in the solution set of the inequality, because the function will be undefined (i.e. it would be a vertical asymptote if you sketch the function). 

Hope this helps!</text>

An '''autorack''', also known as an '''auto carrier''', is a specialized piece of [[railroad]] [[rolling stock]] used to transport unladen [[automobile]]s (unladen in this context refers to automobiles ''without passengers'').

It is widely used to carry new [[automobiles]] and light trucks from the factories to automotive distributors. It is also used for [[Auto Train]] service in the [[United States]].

In the early part of the 20th century, when automobiles were still new technology, their production levels were low enough that they could be shipped in sufficient quantities in [[boxcar]]s. Two to four automobiles would usually fit into one boxcar. But as automobiles grew in size, railroads found that they needed to modify the boxcars for more efficient loading. Some modifications included longer boxcars, larger sliding double side doors located near one end of the boxcar, or doors located on the boxcar ends.

These modifications helped, but the demand for new automobiles outpaced the railroads' abilities to build and modify boxcars in which to ship them. In 1923, the [[Grand Trunk Western Railroad]] experimented with modifying a group of 61-foot-long wood-frame [[flat car]]s to increase their capacity by adding collapsible frames to allow for double-deck operation. The concept was not perfected and therefore failed to gain acceptance. In the 1940s and 1950s, some railroads experimented with automobile loading assemblies that would lift one or more automobile above others within a boxcar for more efficient use of space within the cars. The success of these assemblies was limited due to their special use and specific size; it proved uneconomical to maintain a fleet of these assemblies that could only be loaded into boxcars from the ends of the cars.

By this time, in the United States, most circuses still traveled by rail. Circuses were major haulers of wheeled vehicles, carrying all of their vehicles on [[flat car]]s, usually behind their own [[passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]] or in separate sections of their trains (basically, one train would haul the performers and employees while a second train would haul the vehicles and freight). The circus solution to loading vehicles was to use a string of flat cars. A temporary ramp was placed at the end of the flat cars and temporary bridge plates spanned the gaps between adjacent flat cars; the road vehicles were driven or towed up onto one car and then driven or towed down the train. This type of vehicle loading became known as &quot;circus style&quot; due to its frequent use by circuses.

It wasn't until the 1960s that the majority of railroads took the clue from circuses and started loading their own flat cars in this manner. But, loading even up to six automobiles onto one flat car left a large amount of space above the vehicles that was unused. The natural solution was to take the temporary assemblies that were used to stack and load vehicles within boxcars and permanently attach them to the flat cars. The assemblies, also called racks, created two levels on which automobiles could be loaded. To complete the flat car, foldaway bridges were added to the ends of the flat car decks to allow the vehicles to be driven the entire length of a train for loading. Building flat cars in this manner, the railroads no longer needed specialized equipment to load and unload the racks in boxcars. All they needed now was a ramp at the right height.

In the 1950s, in [[Germany]], [[VW Beetle]] production was increasing beyond the capacity of highway trucks. [[Volkswagen]] engineers worked with German railroads to design a railroad car that was basically an extra long version of a vehicle hauling trailer. The design they came up with was able to carry 10 vehicles on one car. VW's two-level flatcar design effectively became the first autorack.

In late 1957, [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]] Railroad (CN) introduced a group of auto carriers which represented a new innovation. The CN bi-level auto-rack cars had ''end-doors.'' They were huge by the standards of the time; the cars were 75 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (23 [[metre|m]]) long and could carry 8 vehicles. These cars were a big success and helped lead to the development of today's enclosed auto racks.

Autoracks quickly lengthened to around 80 ft (24 m) to increase their loading capacity. This made them about as long as the average passenger car of the time; if the cars were much longer, they wouldn't be able to operate in interchange service due to clearance issues on curves. Yet, the railroads could still do better. It didn't take long for the first three-level autoracks to appear on American rails.

During the 1960s, specially built auto carriers took over rail transportation of newly manufactured automobiles in North America. They carried more cars in the same space and were easier to load and unload than the boxcars used earlier. [[Arthur Crookshank]] of the [[New York Central Railroad]] is credited with having the first set of cars manufactured for use in the late 1950s.{{citation needed}} Ever-larger auto carriers and specialized terminals were developed by [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] (N&amp;W) and other carriers. Also in this decade, autoracks were built in three-level configurations so railroads could haul more of the smaller vehicles of the era; two-level autoracks were still in use for [[van]]s and light [[Pickup truck|trucks]].

The only problem left was that the new autorack cars did not provide any protection from flying debris or from the weather. In the manner CN had developed in the 1950s, in the 1970s other North American railroads began refining their autorack cars. They began installing side sheathing to protect the vehicles from impact. Roofs were added to most autoracks in the 1980s, and end doors were added in the latter portion of the decade (both to prevent damage and to deter people from boarding the cars and riding the train within the vehicles loaded in them).

Although railroads were just beginning to see the advantages that autoracks delivered in the 1960s, most North American railroads were reluctant to invest in such specially built equipment. The [[Trailer Train Company]], organized by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and the [[Norfolk &amp; Western]] in 1955, stepped in to ease the railroads' financial burden a bit. Trailer Train purchased the flat cars from the rail car manufacturers, and the railroads that wanted to operate autoracks purchased the racks that were installed on those flat cars. Such cars were easily spotted at trackside due to the reporting marks identifying Trailer Train on the flat car portion of the car and the railroad's logo (usually much larger) in the upper portion of the rack.

[[Image:Autoracks in LA 3-22-99.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Autoracks wait to be unloaded in a [[BNSF Railway]] facility in [[Los Angeles, California]].]]

This arrangement worked so well that nearly every autorack operating in the US was so owned. Trailer Train became [[TTX Corporation]] in 1991; since then many railroads have themselves purchased the flat cars on which the racks were installed and TTX has itself expanded into purchasing and leasing out other railroad [[rolling stock]]. The development of enclosed autoracks also helped make several other innovative services work well.

===New designs and current usage===
Railroads of today are still grappling with the problem of loading more and larger vehicles onto autoracks. One popular solution is to create a double-length car that is articulated over a single middle truck ([[bogie]]) so that each half of the car is about the same length as a conventional autorack. These cars, which can be seen in operation on many of the railroads of the western US, are brand named ''AutoMax'' cars. These cars, built by [[Gunderson]] (a subsidiary of [[The Greenbrier Companies]]) measure 145 ft 4 [[inch|in]] (44.3 m) long and 20 ft 2 in (6 m) tall; they feature adjustable interior decks to carry up to 22 light trucks and minivans.

The railroads became the primary long-distance transporter of completed automobiles, one of few commodities where the industry has been able to overcome trucking in competition. Using the enclosed tri-level autoracks, they were able to provide ''both'' lower costs ''and'' greater protection from in-transit damage (such as that which may occur due to [[weather]] and [[traffic]] conditions on unenclosed [[truck]] [[trailer (vehicle)|trailers]]).

===Latest innovations===
In 2004, [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]] was as the forefront of autorack technology again, as it had been in the 1950s by using a more light-weight material, [[aluminium|aluminum]]. The new cars, built by [[Johnstown America Corporation]] beginning in December 2004, are brand named ''AVC'', an acronym for ''Aluminum Vehicle Carrier''. 200 new aluminum autoracks promise a softer ride, a wider interior, superior door-edge protection, and a rust-free interior from older steel versions. [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] has ordered 375 of these new cars as well. The new cars built for [[Amtrak]] [[Auto Train (Amtrak)|Auto Train]] service differ from those built for CN and CP; the Amtrak cars are three inches shorter in height, and use solid side panels instead of the perforated panels operated in freight service.

==Auto Train: combining autoracks and passenger cars==
===Auto-Train Corp: a privately funded innovation===

On [[December 6]], [[1971]] [[Auto-Train Corporation]] introduced a new and innovative rail transportation service for ''both'' passengers ''and'' their automobiles in the United States, operating scheduled service between [[Lorton, Virginia]] (near [[Washington, D.C.]]) and [[Sanford, Florida]], near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].

The [[Auto-Train Corporation|Auto Train]] offered an alternative to motorists who would otherwise drive their automobiles the 855-[[mile]] (1375 [[kilometer|km]]) distance along the east coast of the U.S. For vacationers with destinations at one or more of the many popular tourist attractions of Florida, the [[Auto-Train Corporation|Auto Train]] service offered dual features:
{|
|
 &lt;font color=magenta&gt;A numbered list (using # at the beginning of the line)
   ↓↓&lt;/font&gt;
|}
# avoid the long automobile ride on busy [[Interstate 95]] in [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]]
# have the convenience of use of their own automobile upon arrival.

From the beginning in 1971 (the same year [[Amtrak]] began service on purely passenger routes in the US), a key feature of [[Auto-Train Corporation|Auto-Train]]'s new service was the use of autoracks, which were former [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]] bi-level autorack cars acquired used. These were augmented by new tri-level auto-racks in 1976.

The privately owned service became very popular, but after 10 years of operation, and some costly attempts to expand the service elsewhere (such as a schedule between Florida and [[Chicago, Illinois]]), Auto-Train Corporation entered bankruptcy, and service ended in April 1981.

===''Amtrak's Auto Train: federally sponsored service''===
Auto Train service between Virginia and Florida was resumed by [[Amtrak]] in 1983. Amtrak, a federally chartered corporation which operates most intercity passenger trains in the United States, continued to use Auto-Train's autoracks as an important portion of its service.

In current operation of Amtrak's [[Auto Train (Amtrak)|Auto Train]], there are two trains in operation simultaneously. The autoracks normally run on the rear of Auto Train [[consist]]s, which stretch over a quarter-mile, and are a familiar sight on [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] trackage along the east coast.

Today, Amtrak's Auto Train carries about 200,000 passengers and generates around $50 million in revenue annually. It is considered Amtrak's best-paying train in terms of income in comparison with operating expenses.

==Alaska Railroad: Service through a long one-lane tunnel==
An Auto Train type of service utilizing autoracks and [[passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]] was operated in Alaska at the [[Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel]] through [[Maynard Mountain]] near [[Whittier, Alaska]], which is part of the [[Portage Glacier Highway]].
Completed in 1943, with a length of 13,300 feet (4054 [[m]]), it is the longest [[highway]] [[tunnel]] and longest combined rail and highway tunnel in [[North America]].

In the mid-1960s, the [[Alaska Railroad]] began offering a shuttle service through the tunnel which allowed vehicles to drive onto auto carrier cars to be transported between Whittier and the former town of Portage. As traffic to Whittier increased, the shuttle became insufficient, leading to a project to convert the existing railroad tunnel into a one-lane, combination highway and railway tunnel which was opened to traffic on [[June 7]], [[2000]].

'''Trainz Stations''' are interactive 'Industry class' assets that use people, albeit digital people, as products. Passenger Cars are the complementary rolling stock assets which transport that product. The implementation of such products in Trainz depends on hidden smoke and mirrors of TrainzScript, and properly designed assets with a sufficiency of mesh {{TG|A|attachment point}}s.

There are a wide variety of Train Station assets on the DLS and available through third party software vendors. Moreover, there is a wide variety of so-called invisible platforms which with suitable detailing allow most any building to be made into an interactive station. Trains stations inside a session like other interactive industries need be told what to do, so this page will deal with that bit of programming in the game. 
----
==Module Goals==
By working through this material, the student will learn:
# Station Industries, glitz and glitter aside as like any other interactive {{TL|Industries|Trainz Industries}}.
# Optional asset selection approaches and technologies for setting up Station Industries.
# Gain an understanding of Interactive Stations
# Gather an understanding of Dummy Stations,
## and how to upgrade them when modifying an older gem of a route using invisible platforms.
## Some tricks to substitute or mask or combine components of several technologies to get an desired 3D model. 
# Master programming of Interactive Stations, when to do that in what layer, and so forth.

==Dummy Station Components==
In the beginner, before the Lord created the heaven's and the Earth...
Stations in Trainz had the same humble beginning as dummy industries of any kind. Content Creators put together a set of likely looking scenery items, built up some splines objects of various appearances to act as platforms (each adroitly side stepped having stairs or steps by using ramps) and with the use of a few {{TG|T|Trackmarks}} the primitive AI programability that was added into the {{TG|S|Scenarios}} technology (Trainz UTC, v1.5) a scenario designer/writer could generate traffic for a human operator to sometimes interact with. Compared to what is possible with the much more highly evolved Trainz of today, there wasn't a lot of capabilities to exploit.
# Likely looking building
# Track with signalling
# Track mark on Tracks to interact with AI drivers and triggers for sensing control
# Station platform, either of the {{kp|F3}} tools ''''O'''bjects': {{kp|F3}},{{kp|O}}  or ''''S'''pline scenery assets': {{kp|F3}},{{kp|S}} groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You would like a standardized set of tools for getting a list of all collections and resources and for resources that match specific patterns or have specific mime-types.

There are several functions that allow you to do a fast scan utility functions for each resource (file or collection) or just collections.  Each of these functions have two arguments, one for the starting collection and the other is a callback function that can be used to filter out unwanted matches.

   dbutil:scan(xs:anyURI($collection as xs:anyURI, $func as function($collection-path as xs:anyURI, $full-file-path as xs:anyURI?)) as item()*)
   dbutil:scan-resources($collection as xs:anyURI, $func as function(xs:anyURI) as item()*)
   dbutil:scan-collections($collection as xs:anyURI), $func as function(xs:anyURI) as item()*)
   dbutil:find-by-mimetype($collection as xs:anyURI, $mimeType as xs:string)
   dbutil:find-by-mimetype($collection as xs:anyURI, $mimeType as xs:string, $func as function(xs:anyURI)

These are all small XQuery functions and can be found at:

$EXIST_HOME/webapp/WEB-INF/data/expathrepo/shared-0.3.1/content/dbutils.xql

== Example of Scan ==
The following example uses the scan() function to get a list of all the resources in the collection that end with the suffix 'xunit.xq' - which is a script that returns the results in XUnit test result format.

=== Sample Code ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
import module namespace dbutil=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/dbutil&quot;;

let $root-collection := '/db'
let $file-suffix := 'xunit.xq'

let $find-file-path :=
  (: This function MUST have two parameters, the first is the collection path, the second is the FULL path to a resource.
     Note that the second parameter must be able to be optional.  :)
  function($collection as xs:anyURI, $full-path-to-resource as xs:anyURI?) {
    if (ends-with($full-path-to-resource, $file-suffix))
        then
          $full-path-to-resource
        else ()
     }
     
  return
  &lt;results&gt;
      {for $resource in dbutil:scan(xs:anyURI($root-collection), $find-file-path)
      return
         &lt;resource&gt;{$resource}&lt;/resource&gt;
       }
  &lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Sample Results ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;resource&gt;/db/apps/myapp/unit-tests/scan-xunit.xq&lt;/resource&gt;
   &lt;resource&gt;/db/apps/myapp/unit-tests/scan-collection-xunit.xq&lt;/resource&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example of Scan Collection ==
The following example uses the scan-collection() function to get a list of all collection paths
that end with the string &quot;/unit-tests&quot;.

&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Other Followup Notes ==
Again it illustrates how to obtain information from Freebase via it's
MQL language (it predated Sparql).

The previous query was taken from

 https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/mql-overview

and it limits the data that results from the call to the Freebase API.
You can see a limit parameter being set to 3 below in the API call.

 https://www.googleapis.com/freebase/v1/mqlread?query=[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;/music/album&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:null,&quot;artist&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/en/bob_dylan&quot;},&quot;limit&quot;:3}]&amp;cursor

If you do not specify a limit with your API call, Freebase will impose
a limit of 100 records on your query. This message addresses the
question of how to get everything.

The key to doing this is dangling at the end of the above API call,
it's the cursor parameter and it's usage is discussed with an example
here

   https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/mql-overview#querying-with-cursor-paging-results

To summarise you ask for a cursor (see the example API call above for
the form of the initial request) to be returned with your query
results which acts as a link to the next set of query results. You
obtain that next set by supplying the value of the cursor returned
from the previous invocation. Along with that next set you get another
cursor that points to the set after that. When the final set of
results are retrieved the cursor returns a string value of false (the
Freebase overview has this in upper case but my code  used lower case
'false' and that works).

The overview has sample Python code which I have not tried or parsed
in anger but which I believe invokes libraries that take care of all
the cursor handling for you.

   https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/mql-overview#looping-through-cursor-results

However the same thing can easily be achieved from XQuery with a
little bit of tail recursion.

We will use as an example a MQL query that returns all films with
their netflix_id's.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
[{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/film/film&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: null,
  &quot;netflix_id&quot;: []
}]
&lt;/source&gt;

A few brief comments about MQL. You ask for something by giving the
field name and a value null. Null gets replaced by the actual value.
However if the field can have multiple values MQL will return an array
and cause your null query to error. This may happen even when you are
expecting a singular value so you can avoid this problem by using the
symbol for an empty array instead of null as in the query above.

You can paste the query above into

   http://www.freebase.com/query

to see the results (we will take care of the cursor in the code example).

Now to the code, which assumes XQuery 3.0

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;3.0&quot;;

import module namespace xqjson=&quot;http://xqilla.sourceforge.net/lib/xqjson&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Freebase returns JSON but we want to store this in an xml db so we use
the above package for json to XML conversion. From eXist you can
install the package by just clicking it on the eXist Package Manager
which you can get to from the eXist Dashboard.

We declare a variable for our query.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare variable $mqlQuery {'[{
   &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/film/film&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: null,
  &quot;netflix_id&quot;: []
}]'};

declare variable $freebase {'https://www.googleapis.com/freebase/v1/mqlread'};
declare variable $key {obtain an API key from freebase and puts it's
value here'};
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Power circuits and hazards: hazardous voltages; fuses and circuit breakers; grounding; lightning protection; battery safety; electrical code compliance'''

Amateur Radio Operators occasionally need to handle items that are energized with high voltages or have enormous amounts of energy stored in them.  Such powerful sources must always be handled with care to prevent serious accidents from occurring.

'''Human Health.'''  There is a misconception that &quot;voltage kills&quot;, but this is actually untrue considering that we may become charged with tens of thousands of volts simply by handling a latex balloon while wearing a woolen sweater.  We must rely on the truth that &quot;current kills&quot;.  It only takes between 10-100ma to trigger muscle spasms, disrupt cellular activity or cause the burning of flesh do to Ohmic heating.  Always assume that we are at earth potential of zero volts and that all higher voltages will induce a current through us.

'''AC Power Sources.'''  North American electrical service in a modern structure has three wires delivered to your receptacle.  Inside this receptacle, these three conductors are a green wire for Ground, a white wire for Neutral and a wire of a different color for the Hot.  Traditionally Hot is a black wire, but that isn't a requirement.  The Hot should never be a white or green wire as those are reserved exclusively for Neutral or Ground.  It is always worthwhile to test that your house is wired and grounded correctly before setting up your ham shack or lab bench.

AC sources provide a maximum current that is determined by the cross-sectional dimension of the wire.  Because the conductors have a resistance, current flow would cause heat to be released.  Typically the heat is released in junctions where wires are fastened together as those regions have the highest resistance.  The NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) has done extensive research to create an elegant set of rules for correct dimensioning and insulation of conductors.  Overcurrent conditions that can cause heating of the conductor are mitigated with a circuit breaker (or fuses for pre-1960 installations).

The circuit breakers, or fuses, primarily serve the goal of preventing fires, but our additional green ground wire provides a human safety benefit.  Lets say the Hot wire comes loose inside your appliance and the metal frame becomes energized, it is a shock hazard.  A grounded appliance will bleed this voltage to ground potential of zero volts.  This typically results in an over current where a circuit breaker trips or a fuse blows.

When a circuit breaker trips or a fuse burns out, interpret that as a warning.  You have just prevented a fire or electrocution by a safety feature being activated.  When you defeat these systems by installing an over-dimensioned breaker or fuse, you are defeating safety features that solely exist to protect life and limb.  Always determine the cause of an incident.  If you don't have an exact replacement, it is acceptable to use a smaller dimensioned protection at the risk of a nuisance tripping that rapidly reduces the life of a breaker.

Current flow in an AC system is between two conductors, the Hot and Neutral.  The Hot alternates between a high positive potential and a high negative potential and the Neutral is the return path for the electron flow.  There are a number of high quality technologies that provide greater protection for the user.  Arc-Fault breakers contain an embedded system that measures current flow and disables the current flow if it detects what appears to be arcing in the load.  GFCI breakers, are Ground Fault Current Interrupting where if more that 20ma is unaccounted for in the flow between Hot and Neutral, the current flow is shut off.  Some companies, such as E-T-A, even produce circuit breakers that are drop in replacements for fuses and will fit in the existing holders.

'''Battery Sources.'''  These are particularly dangerous as they can deliver much higher currents that AC electrical service.  A lead-acid battery from a car can easily deliver hundreds of amperes of current.  This enormous current capability means that an incredible amount of heating can occur during a short circuit.  There are instances of screwdrivers melting after being sec upon the terminals of the batter.  The same current that passes through the short circuit also passes through the battery and ohmic heating can rapidly overheat the battery.  Treat the battery with the same amount of care as you would a fuel canister.  The same energy that can power your transmitter over the course of an afternoon can also start a fire within seconds.

I am guilty of short circuiting a car battery on one occasion.  In this case a solar cell was charging the battery.  While unplugging the solar cell, the terminals landed on each other.  Immediately, the entire wire turned to a very beautiful smoke cloud that rose straight up (and very uniformly) across the entire length of wire.  Each loop the wires made across the floor made perfect smoke rings as well.

Some components such as inductors, transformers and certain electric motors must never be attached to batteries as they will quickly become short circuited once the magnetic fields are created.

When batteries overheat, either through overcharging or over current, the water in the battery will separate into molecular oxygen and hydrogen.  These gases are violently explosive in their mutual presence, not to mention, already heated due to current flow.  An outgassing battery is an explosion hazard, especially if it's outgassing faster than pressure can be released.  Disconnect a noisy battery and ventilate the room to dissipate the gases.

==The Question Pool==
===Question 1===
;Which of the following is a safety hazard of a 12-volt storage battery?
:A. Touching both terminals with the hands can cause electrical shock
:B. Shorting the terminals can cause burns, fire, or an explosion
:C. RF emissions from the battery
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
The voltage is harmless, but the short circuit current can be enormous.  Ohm's Law tells us that heat released is proportional to the current squared.  Each time the current doubles, the power output multiplies by four.  '''The correct answer is B.'''
===Question 2===
;How does current flowing through the body cause a health hazard?
:A. By heating tissue
:B. It disrupts the electrical functions of cells
:C. It causes involuntary muscle contractions
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
All these things can happen.  Ohmic heating of tissue and involuntary muscular contractions are often associated with electrical injuries.  Cellular damage can also occur due to a potential difference across the cell.  '''The correct answer is D.'''
===Question 3===
;What is connected to the green wire in a three-wire electrical AC plug?
:A. Neutral
:B. Hot
:C. Safety ground
:D. The white wire
&lt;br&gt;
Green is a reserved color for ground.  Don't ever use it for any other purpose.  The ground is a return path for current in case a wiring fault makes an appliance hot, so that the breaker may trip if it draws enough current.  '''The correct answer is C.'''
===Question 4===
;What is the purpose of a fuse in an electrical circuit?
:A. To prevent power supply ripple from damaging a circuit
:B. To interrupt power in case of overload
:C. To limit current to prevent shocks
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
The fuse is equivalent in application as a circuit breakers as the protect from over-current situations.  They prevent fires, not shocks.  '''The correct answer is B.'''
===Question 5===
;Why is it unwise to install a 20-ampere fuse in the place of a 5-ampere fuse?
:A. The larger fuse would be likely to blow because it is rated for higher current
:B. The power supply ripple would greatly increase
:C. Excessive current could cause a fire
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
The components and wiring and specified for a 5 ampere fuse.  If you exceed that current, you will have excessive heating which would be a fire hazard.  In this case, the current is allowed to flow four times the specified max, which means ohmic losses will be squared, sixteen times as much heat will be dissipated.  '''The correct answer is C.'''
===Question 6===
;What is a good way to guard against electrical shock at your station?
:A. Use three-wire cords and plugs for all AC powered equipment
:B. Connect all AC powered station equipment to a common safety ground
:C. Use a circuit protected by a ground-fault interrupter
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
Ground Fault Breakers save lives.  Rumor has it you still feel the shock, but they interrupt before harm is done.  Properly grounded equipment ensures the potential of the housing is at earth potential of zero volts.  All grounds should be connected to each other to prevent potential difference between grounds.  '''The correct answer is D.'''
===Question 7===
;Which of these precautions should be taken when installing devices for lightning protection in a coaxial cable feed line?
:A. Include a parallel bypass switch for each protector so that it can be switched out of the circuit when running high power
:B. Include a series switch in the ground line of each protector to prevent RF overload from inadvertently damaging the protector
:C. Keep the ground wires from each protector separate and connected to station ground
:D. Ground all of the protectors to a common plate which is in turn connected to an external ground
&lt;br&gt;
Keep all your ground conductors connected.  Lightning strikes have enormous voltages and can deliver enormous currents.  In most cases, the grounds may have a small voltage across them, but during a lightning strike, these voltages can reach into the thousands of volts and that is a fire hazard.  Even if the strike isn't direct, it's possible for the ground wires to act as antennas and become highly charged. Keep your grounds connected.  '''The correct answer is D.'''
===Question 8===
;What safety equipment should always be included in home-built equipment that is powered from 120V AC power circuits?
:A. A fuse or circuit breaker in series with the AC hot conductor
:B. An AC voltmeter across the incoming power source
:C. An inductor in series with the AC power source
:D. A capacitor across the AC power source
&lt;br&gt;
Circuit breakers will restrict over-currents to the smaller components that could otherwise combust during a runaway failure.  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 9===
;What kind of hazard is presented by a conventional 12-volt storage battery?
:A. It emits ozone which can be harmful to the atmosphere
:B. Shock hazard due to high voltage
:C. Explosive gas can collect if not properly vented
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
Hydrogen and Oxygen are both released from the water in a battery.  Two dangerous gases in a heated, sealed container.  '''The correct answer is C.'''
===Question 10===
;What can happen if a lead-acid storage battery is charged or discharged too quickly?
:A. The battery could overheat and give off flammable gas or explode
:B. The voltage can become reversed
:C. The memory effect will reduce the capacity of the battery
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
The excessive current will heat the battery rapidly.  The same current that is being delivered is also flowing through the battery.  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 11===
;What kind of hazard might exist in a power supply when it is turned off and disconnected?
:A. Static electricity could damage the grounding system
:B. Circulating currents inside the transformer might cause damage
:C. The fuse might blow if you remove the cover
:D. You might receive an electric shock from the charged stored in large capacitors
&lt;br&gt;
Some of the components can store energy long after the appliance is disconnected from power.  Observe the voltage rating on the capacitors to get a hint on if the voltage is one you feel is dangerous.  Remember, some metal capacitors may have energized cans around them.  Typically these have plastic sleeves, but they also fall off or disappear.  Glass or foil capacitors may have a very long self discharge time.  Be careful discharging these because they can provide enormous currents; always use a resistor to discharge.  '''The correct answer is D.'''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''RE GAMING''' Hey! I'm aware you have been working on a gaming section for the WikiBook. I'm working on the Dishinibition effect specifically and breaking it down into smaller contributory factors - I've come across the contributory factor of &quot;dissociative imagination&quot; which comes into play within Gaming. Would you link up our ideas? I could post an internal term link to &quot;gaming&quot; in the section directing to your section when you have finished writing it and posted it and you could mention the dissociative imagination I have written about in the gaming section. Linking our similar ideas would really make the page flow well together! Drop me a line on my page!

'''Presentations''' We should really do this for our presentation, would you be able to help me set this up?:

Hi Elizabeth! One person from our group just created another user page like the one we all have (ie. mine is BobblehatImara; yours is ButtonsElizabeth) and named it after the group. We all post on the discussion page of that, like I am posting on your discussion page now. Just make sure that the creator of the page logs off of that and back on to their individual user page, or else Greg will not be able to track their posts on the page. Hope this helps!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Mutual Recursion==
I would not connect mutual recursion in this way with
divergence respectively non-termination. This can also
happen with single recursion. Its rather the case
that sometimes, in bigger projects, mutual recursion
naturally comes up.

==Facebook==
Discussion Copied from Facebook, 18th March-24th of March:

Claire Porter: If you's meet the keep me up to date and I'll try by some miracle to contribute from ny x

Kasia Peel: sorry i completely didn't realise i'd been added to this group! but i think by the looks of things we are contributing on a sort of individual basis for the wiki and discussing it with the other group on the wiki discussion page. my page it RedGebsKasia, so since we get marked for our contributions we could always chat on their as me and elizabeth have been. then i think its more the presentation stuff that we will have to be meeting up for since we actually do that together 

Kasia Peel: i should be able to still meet up also, on monday i have a break between 1 and 2?

Elizabeth Ross: I can do between 1 and 2 too, but we should definitely try and meet up. Is there a different time that would suit on Monday, maybe after 4pm?

Caroline Grace Malcolm: I can do after 4

Debbie Morrison: Yes, great idea! Where….? x

Elizabeth Ross: Shall we meet in social study? Kasia and I might be a bit late due to the film screening, but not too much.

Elizabeth Ross:  I was looking at the topics covered so far and I don't think anyone is really covering the sense of belonging one can get through online groups and communities. Do you think we should look at this? I already have a few notes.
Obviously we can talk about it more tomorrow but just something to think about.

Discussion Copied from Facebook, 31st of March:

Claire Porter: Booked a group study room for 12 on thursday, should all get an email sent to you about it. 

Caroline Grace Malcolm: I will get there at about 12:15 and need to leave at 1:45 because of classes but that should be ok

Claire Porter: Also its room 10 by the way

== Presentations ==

Just some stuff to maybe think about ahead of us meeting up tomorrow. I wrote a good chunk of the SNSs section and so was maybe thinking we could do a group exercise on their Facebook or social media usage, getting everyone to discuss how they are affected by impression management, blurred boundaries ect and maybe see if they have examples to share. We could get the ball rolling by doing it ourselves first, or at least one of us.

I also think we should try and link in as much of our real life experience as possible to make the presentation as engaging and interesting as possible. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 20:55, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

And this might be a good video to start the whole presentation with- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10K137WU9gw [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 21:10, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xua1JXd5pK0. I think this one we could reflect on just how big a deal online identity is if there are web blogs and videos giving advice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGFF8lJM8mk. And I thought this one highlights really well a lot of the points that have been brought up throughout the whole page, not just SNSs [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 21:22, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

We should brainstorm using the topics we have covered and (I agree) personal experience. Then we can decide which ideas will work best given the time frame and environment. [[User:Debsi91|Debsi91]] ([[User talk:Debsi91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Debsi91|contribs]]) 10:11, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Was really happy with our meeting today, lots of progress made! Just to confirm on time allocation for each person in the belonging section it was two minutes yeah, before I start writing my part on fan culture? [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 15:38, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I am having an issue with this section that when I post something it wont save or appear [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 15:39, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Two minutes is perfect. I think I have finished with my section, I am worried it is a little on the short side but I don't want to waffle. Any feedback would be appreciated if you can think of anything positive/negative. Presentations ahoy! [[User:Debsi91|Debsi91]] ([[User talk:Debsi91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Debsi91|contribs]]) 23:58, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok I just managed to save something. I think today went really well and our content is good. I think come Monday it will be more clear because we can start creating the official presentation and practice our deliverance. I also think it is really important that we ensure that the presentation is well organised and set out in a logical way that is purposeful in order that it does not look messy. But I think come Monday we can make sure that happens as we pull together all the work and create the final piece. [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 15:42, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree, once we have all of our own content prepared for the presentation I think it should fit together nicely. [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 15:44, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I think roughly two minutes will be good. Our mock run through on Monday will help though. Is everyone happy with what they have to write, or shall I put up the rough order sheet document we were working on today?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Your edits to [[Sexual Health/Incest]] have again been undone.  Firstly the edits don't make grammatical sense.  Secondly if what you feel is correct then find sources for it, cite those sources and make the edit in a way which makes sense. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:28, 3 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{TopNav|prev=Foreign Key|next=Drop Table}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
{{BookCat}}

&lt;div class=&quot;nonumtoc&quot;&gt;
__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;

The ALTER TABLE command modifies column definitions and table constraints 'on the fly'. This means existing definitions are extended, changed or deleted or existing data is casted to a different type or existing data is evaluated against the new definitions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
-- change column definitions
ALTER TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; { ADD | ALTER } [ COLUMN ] &lt;column_name&gt; &lt;column_definition&gt;;
ALTER TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; { DROP        } [ COLUMN ] &lt;column_name&gt;;

-- change table constraints
ALTER TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; { ADD | ALTER } CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint_name&gt; &lt;constraint_definition&gt;;
ALTER TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; { DROP        } CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint_name&gt;;
&lt;/source&gt;

The following examples are based on the test table ''t1''.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t1 (
  id         NUMERIC  PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1      CHAR(4)
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Columns ==
The syntax of the ADD COLUMN and ALTER COLUMN phrases are similar to the one shown in the [[Structured_Query_Language/Create_Table#Column_Definition|create table page]].

=== Add a Column ===
Existing tables can be extended by additional columns with the ADD COLUMN phrase. Within this phrase all options of the original Create Table statement are available: data type, default value, NOT NULL, Primary Key, Unique, Foreign Key, Check.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- add a new column with any characteristic
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN col_2 VARCHAR(100) CHECK (length(col_2) &gt; 5);  -- Oracle: The key word 'COLUMN' is not allowed.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Alter the Characteristic of a Column ===
With the ALTER COLUMN phrase some characteristics of an existing column can be changed
:*data type
:*DEFAULT clause
:*NOT NULL clause.
The new definitions must be compatible with the old existing data. If you change for example the data type from VARCHAR to NUMERIC this action can only be successful if it is possible to cast '''all''' existing VARCHAR data to NUMERIC - the casting of 'xyz' will fail. Casting in the direction from NUMERIC to VARCHAR will be successful as long as the width of the VARCHAR is large enought to store the result.

Hint: Concerning the change of the characteristics of columns some implementations ignore the syntax of the SQL standard and use other keywords like 'MODIFY'.

==== Change the Data Type ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 SET DATA TYPE NUMERIC;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Change the DEFAULT Clause ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 SET DEFAULT 'n/a';
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Change the NOT NULL Clause ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 SET  NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 DROP NOT NULL;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Drop a Column ===
Columns can be dropped from existing tables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN col_2;    -- Oracle: The key word 'COLUMN' is mandatory.
&lt;/source&gt;

Hint: As an extention to the SQL standard some implementations offer a RENAME or SET INVISIBLE command.

== Table Constraints ==
Table constraints can be added, modified or dropped. The syntax is similar to that shown on the [[Structured_Query_Language/Create_Table#Table_Constraint|create table page]].

=== Add a Table Constraint ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD CONSTRAINT t1_col_1_unique UNIQUE (col_1);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Alter a Table Constraint ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER CONSTRAINT t1_col_1_unique UNIQUE (col_1);
&lt;/source&gt;

Hint: Concerning the change of table constraints some implementations ignore the syntax of the SQL standard and use other keywords like 'MODIFY'.

=== Drop a Table Constraint ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 DROP CONSTRAINT t1_col_1_unique;  -- MySQL: Not supported. There is only a 'DROP FOREIGN KEY'.
&lt;/source&gt;

Hint: As an extention to the SQL standard some implementations offer an ENABLE / DISABLE command for constraints.

&lt;div class=&quot;nonumtoc&quot;&gt;
__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;

The DROP TABLE command removes the definition and all data of the named table from the database.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
DROP TABLE &lt;t1&gt;;
&lt;/source&gt;

The command handles the table as a whole. It will not fire any trigger. But it considers [[Structured_Query_Language/Foreign_Key#DROP_TABLE_.2F_TRUNCATE_TABLE|Foreign Key definitions]]. If any other table referes to the table to be dropped, the DROP TABLE command will fail. The Foreign Key definition must be [[Structured_Query_Language/Alter_Table#Drop_a_Table_Constraint|dropped]] first.

As the DROP TABLE command handles the table as a whole, it is very fast.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= The Live-CD =
The GNU Health Demo Database is available as Live-CD. This gives interested users the option to run GNU Health on their own PC, and, if desired, install the GNU Health demo database directly from the CD.&lt;br /&gt;
Similar as the demo database, the live-CD is an ongoing project and it will be adapting to the each new GNU Health version. The clinical history will also grow with time.

== Download the Live-CD ==
The Live-CD was built on [https://susestudio.com/ SUSEStudio], and is currently available with the following flavours:
* openSUSE 13.1 / KDE4 / 32bit: [https://susestudio.com/appliance/edit/1083253 GNU Health 2.4.1]

Unlike the full version of openSUSE, the Live-CD contains only packages that are required to run GNU Health. Feel free to add required programs later on from the openSUSE repositories

== Install the Live-CD ==
In order to use the Live-CD, you have to install it on a CD or a USB stick. 

=== USB-Stick / Hard Disk Image ===
The hard disk image comes as packed raw format. After download, first unpack the *.tar.gz file

* On Linux/Mac-OS, use your favorite archiving program, or use 'tar -xvzf *tar.gz' from the command line
* On Windows, use an advanced packer like 7-Zip

After unpacking, you have to install the RAW-file to a stick. [http://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick See instructions].

Note: When booting the first time from the USB-Stick, the boot process takes a bit longer, as the stick is being optimized (data and swap space creation). Second boot will be much quicker.

=== ISO-Image / CD ===
If you have downloaded the ISO image to burn a CD, you can find the relevant instructions [http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Download_help#Burn_the_ISO_image.28s.29 here].

== Install the Live-CD to your hard drive ==
The Live-CD offers the option to install the system and the GNU Health Demo-DB to your hard drive. The relevant program can be found in the 'My Computer' Section of the start menu (the little green button on the lower left corner of the screen).

= Virtual Machine Image =
Another possibility to try GNU Health is the use of a virtual machine (VM). Here is a proposal how to proceed:

== Download the VM ==
The VM-Image with the GNU Health Demo Database is currently available with the following flavours:
* VirtualBox-Image openSUSE 13.1 / LXDE / 32bit: [http://www.axxite.com/openSUSE131-GNUHealth.tar.bz2 GNU Health 2.4.1 (1,9 GB)]. The Image was build on VirtualBox 4.3.8, so use this VirtualBox-Version or higher. The Image contains a full installation of openSUSE 13.1 with the lean LXDE desktop. 

== Installation of the VM ==
* Download [http://www.virtualbox.org VirtualBox] and the Extention Pack and install it on your hardware
* Unpack the VM-Image to the place where VirtualBox stores it's VM. This is usually '&lt;homedir&gt;/VirtualBox VMs' 
* Follow the instructions from the [https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&amp;t=55003 VirtualBox Forum] on how to move a VM

== Adjustmends ==
* You may want to change the language and keyboard to your preferred setting. From the Start Menu, select System -&gt; Administration -&gt; YaST. Enter the password for 'root': tryton . You have reached the administration settings. From the 'System' Section select 'Language' to change the primary language.

* You may want to run an online update. From the Start Menu, select System -&gt; Administration -&gt; YaST. Enter the password for 'root': tryton . You have reached the administration settings. From the 'Software' Section select 'Online-Update'.
* You may want to install additional software. From the Start Menu, select System -&gt; Administration -&gt; YaST. Enter the password for 'root': tryton . You have reached the administration settings. From the 'Software' Section select 'Software Management'.</text>

== Wikitext ==

Regarding your post on [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Technical Assistance]], I'd recommend reading [[Using Wikibooks/Wiki-Markup]].  In addition selecting ''Browse'' or ''Random book'' on the menu on the left of the screen and just investigating other books will help.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:06, 11 April 2014 (UTC)
:Also [[Help:Contents]] has a more detailed look at everything.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:10, 11 April 2014 (UTC)

== Importer Flag ==

I'm attempting to get rights to import content from English Wikipedia. If I should get the flag I would like some guidance on how to, because I'm unsure based on the page [[wikibooks:importers]]
:You'll see that I have changed it so that you now have importer rights.  [[Special:Import]] is the page to go to.  Make sure you select the correct project (''w'' for Wikipedia).  Then enter the correct title of the Wikipedia page.  Ensure the first check box is checked.  To transfer to a new page in your book choose ''(Main)'' from the drop-down box.  Enter your reasons for the import in the ''Comments'' field.  Finally enter ''Topology'' in the ''Destination root page'' field.  This will import the page from Wikipedia (let's call it ''Blob'') to Topology/Blob.  Sometimes there can be problems especially if it's a big page or a page with hundreds of revisions - in that case leave a message in the [[Wikibooks:Reading_room]] and someone will try to help.  Hope this all makes sense.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:36, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

Thank you! I'll try it out tonight. [[User:Knittedbees|Knittedbees]] ([[User talk:Knittedbees|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Knittedbees|contribs]]) 00:42, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:I just noticed your first attempt.  It is possible to import directly to your book if you select ''Main'' from the drop-down box instead of ''Transwiki''.  I think the import didn't work because the actual page on Wikipedia is ''Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms'' with the long hyphen.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:04, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:I have succeeded in importing that page now - [[Topology/Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms]].  I'll delete the other attempts.  I don't even have the long hyphen (–) on my keyboard (only the short (-) so I had to copy and paste from Wikipedia.  I should also add that imported pages will often be full of red links which you'll have to remove or change the links within the book.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:10, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:I see you managed this time.  I had just imported it also so it looks strange when you click on ''History'' as there are now 3 different entries for each past edit because it has been imported 3 times - I don't think it matters.  I'll leave you to it and if you have any further problems hopefully someone will be around to help out - I'm off to bed.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:16, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
Great, thanks for setting me up, I'll just have to watch my punctuation. I can tell this will take some effort to get into wikibook style but still a lot easier than working from scratch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''normed vector space''' &lt;math&gt;(V,|\cdot|)&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space ''V'' with a function &lt;math&gt;|\cdot|:V\times V\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; that represents the length of a vector, called a norm. 

==Definition==

We know the vector space defintion, so we need to define the norm function. &lt;math&gt;|\cdot|&lt;/math&gt; is a norm if these three conditions hold.

1. Only the zero vector has zero length, with all others being positive. &lt;math&gt;|v|\geq 0, |v|=0\iff v=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt;.

2. For &lt;math&gt;a\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;|av|=|a||v|&lt;/math&gt;.

3. The triangle inequality holds: &lt;math&gt;|v+w|\leq |v|+|w|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v,w\in V&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==

For a given &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; we know that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space and its norm can be defined to be &lt;math&gt;|v-w|=d(v,w)&lt;/math&gt; ie. &lt;math&gt;|v|=d(v,0)&lt;/math&gt;. This is not unusual, in fact we say that a norm '''induces''' a metric with the first equation. So normed vector spaces are always metric spaces. Let's prove this.

==Theorem==

Normed vector spaces are metric spaces.

Proof

It suffices to show that &lt;math&gt;d(v,w)=|v-w|&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the metric axioms. Let &lt;math&gt;u,v,w\in V&lt;/math&gt;

1. &lt;math&gt;d(v,w)=|v-w|\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; holds by definition and &lt;math&gt;d(v,w)=|v-w|=0\iff v-w=0 \iff v=w&lt;/math&gt; as required.

2. &lt;math&gt;d(v,w)=|v-w|=|-1||w-v|=|w-v|=d(w,v)&lt;/math&gt;

3. &lt;math&gt;d(u,v)+d(v,w)=|u-v|+|v-w|\geq |u-v+v-w|=d(u,w)&lt;/math&gt; so the triangle inequality translates correctly.

Since the axioms hold, we conclude that ''V'' is a metric space.

== Book structure ==

Hello, books here are built as a main page with sub pages nested beneath them. You need to create them with names like [[Manga Study Guide: Barefoot Gen/Page 1]] and not as [[Page 1]]. I have deleted all the stubs that you created in the wrong place and amended your main page so new pages are created correctly. Please let me know if this isn't clear.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A fascinating aspect of Indian spirituality, specifically in the context of Hinduism, is its durability across hundreds and even thousands of years. As mentioned in the previous chapter, yoga as a practice seems to have been known in the Harappan civilization 5000 years ago. Similarly, the association of the triangle with feminine worship seems to have been present 11,000 years ago. This chapter will look at a few more examples of such nature.

== Sanskrit ==
Sanskrit is one of the more well known examples. Sanskrit is among the oldest languages of the Indo–European group of languages. Though no longer a widely spoken language, it is still extremely important as the classical language of Indian culture and the sacred language of Hinduism. Sanskrit, in its oldest known form entered North-West India during the second half of the second millennium BC, at which time it was similar in nature to its relative Avestan. Later, it spread into North India and came to be the preferred language of communication in cultural and religious aspects. The language evolved during the Vedic period until it was standardized by the grammarian Panini around the fourth century BC. Thereafter, his grammatical rules were generally followed with exactness, to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics |last=Brown |first=Keith |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993|publisher=Elsevier|location= |isbn=978-0-08-044854-1 |page=9188 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Harappan civilization ==
A continuity between the Harappan civilization and several practices found in the region inpresent times has been proposed by some scholars. For example, the units of measurement for length and weight are said to be similar. A similarity of housing plans has also been shown between houses in Mohenjodaro and modern Gujarat. Similarities have also been found in construction techniques. Structural similarities, namely the ratio between the breadth and length of a structure have been shown between the building of the Harrapan civilization and the later Mauryan period. This ratio is also found in the sacrificial altars of vedic rites which are practiced in modern India. Parallels have also been drawn between Vedic Soma sacrifices and Harrapan fire altars.&lt;ref namə&quot;Danino&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Lost River |last=Danino |first=Michel|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books|location= |isbn=9780143068648 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8yc7-OirxKEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=danino%20saraswati&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that a sculpture of a male, called the &quot;Priest King,&quot; found in Mohenjodaro may represent a yogi pose, with his eyes focused on the tip of his nose, half closed in concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Handbook of Ancient Religions |last=Hinnells|first=|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= |isbn=9781139461986|page=450 |pages= |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FIYiil96ZXAC&amp;lpg=PA450&amp;dq=priest%20king%20yogi&amp;pg=PA450#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historicity of festivals ==
=== Navratri and Dussehra ===
There is evidence that the slaying of the buffalo demon by the goddess Durga was present as early as 1st Century BC. However, the DUrga cult could possibly date further back into prehistoric times. Towards the end of the Gupta period in North India and the Chola period in South India, the worship of Durga took the form of a ten-day festival associated with war. Besides martial rites, fertility rites and kingship rites associated with wealth were also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mysore Royal Dasara |last=Sivapriyanand|first=Swami|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=Abhinav Publications|location= |isbn=9781139461986 |pages= |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DVkyFvZL_qMC&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=history%20of%20navaratri&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the present day, these three factors are still found, represented as Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati, each allocated three of the nine days of Navratri, with the tenth day being Vijayadashami or the day of victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.ishafoundation.org/lifestyle/dussehra-vijayadashami/ |title=Dussehra or Vijayadashami – Why Do We Celebrate It? |author= |date=14 October 2013 |work= |publisher=Isha Blog |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
When administrator starts working by himself with Autodesk Vault, he runs into quite unusual client-server logic. For programmers it's even more hard to understand how API really works. Autodesk, no offense.
&lt;br /&gt;
But after a little time later all becomes much clear and easy. Remembering those days, I tried to comprehend Vault, at now I'd like to make easy way for others to start working with Vault.
&lt;br /&gt;
I beg your pardon, but I'll be using PowerShell language mainly, for some reasons:
# This is .Net language, so code could be easy translated to any other .NET language: C#, C++ VB.NET, JScript .NET, etc., or even one code could be embedded to other.
# The code is extremely short - you can get very illustrative wonderful program in just several lines of code.
# PS is interpreted language, you just store it in text and can easy change to create fork.
# PS is command line language and you can build object conveyors - this benefits could be useful in administration.
All code available on [https://github.com/miwaniza/Autodesk_Vault_Programmers_Cookbook.git GitHub].
So, let's start! Approximate TOC you can see below. Links to articles will be continuously updated.

A '''vector space''' &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is formed by scalar multiples of vectors. The scalars are most commonly real numbers but can also be complex, or from any field.

==Definition==

A vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; on a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; with two binary operations, commonly vector addition on elements of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and scalar multiplication, by elements of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, of elements of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. These operations are subject to 8 axioms ('''u''','''v''', and '''w''' are vectors &lt;math&gt;\in V&lt;/math&gt; and a and b are scalars &lt;math&gt;\in F&lt;/math&gt;):

1. Associativity (addition): ('''u'''+'''v''')+'''w''' = '''u'''+('''v'''+'''w''').

2. Associativity (scalar and field multiplication): a(b'''u''') = (ab)'''u'''

3. Distributivity (field addition): (a+b)'''u''' = a'''u'''+b'''u'''

4. Distributivity (vector addition): a('''u'''+'''v''') = a'''u'''+a'''v'''

5. Identity element (addition): &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; '''0''' &lt;math&gt;\in V&lt;/math&gt; such that '''u'''+'''0''' = '''u''' &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; '''u''' &lt;math&gt;\in V&lt;/math&gt;

6. Identity element (scalar multiplication): 1'''u''' = '''u'''

7. Commutativity: '''u'''+'''v''' = '''v'''+'''u'''

8. Inverse element: &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; -'''u''' &lt;math&gt;\in V&lt;/math&gt; such that '''u'''+(-'''u''') = '''0''' &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; '''u''' &lt;math&gt;\in V&lt;/math&gt;

A simplicial complex is a union of spaces known as simplicies, that are convex hulls of points in general position. In Euclidean space they can be thought of as a generalisation of the triangle. For the first few dimensions they are: the point, the line segment, the triangle and the tetrahedron.

==Definition of a simplex==

Given n+1 points &lt;math&gt;\{a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, in a space with dimension of at least n, such that no three points are colinear, the set

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}=\{t_0a_0+t_1a_1+\dots+t_na_n:\sum_{i=1}^n t_i = 1\text{ with }t_i\in [0,1]\}&lt;/math&gt;

is a simplex, and more specifically an n-simplex since it has n+1 verticies.

==The standard n-simplex==

For ease we will sometimes need a standardised co-ordinate system for a simplex. The standard n-simplex, a subset of Euclidean (n+1)-space, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_n=\{(t_0,t_1,\dots,t_n)\in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}: t_i\geq 0\text{ and }\sum^n_{i=0} t_i=1\}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the set is expressed in a very similar manner, but the co-ordinates are fixed in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:2D-simplex.svg|150px|thumb|right|A diagram of the the standard n-simplex in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, with n=2]]

==Face of a Simplex==

A face of an n-simplex &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is any (n-1)-simplex formed by an n-1 element subset of the verticies of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Defintion of a simplicial complex==

A simplicial complex is a union of simplicies such that the intersection of any two simplicies is a simplex. Alternatively if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a simplicial complex then

1. Every face of a simplex in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a simplex in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

2. The intersection of two simplicies &lt;math&gt;A, B \in \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a face of both of A and B.

==Example==

The triangulation of a polygon in the plane is a simplcial complex. In fact it hints at the existance of simplicial complexes existing for all polytopes, e.g. every polyhedron can be expressed as tetrahedrons meeting full face to full face.

In general, a ''morphism'' refers to a function mapping from one space to another that preserves structure. In terms of vector spaces the natural morphism is a ''linear map''.

==Linear maps==
{{TextBox|1=
;Definition of Linear Map:
A ''linear map'' is a function &lt;math&gt;f:V\to W&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V, W&lt;/math&gt; are vector spaces over a field F. Such that for all &lt;math&gt;v,w\in V&lt;/math&gt;

1. &lt;math&gt;f(v+w)=f(v)+f(w)&lt;/math&gt;

2. &lt;math&gt;f(\alpha v)=\alpha f(v)&lt;/math&gt;

}}

The image of a linear map is a subspace of the domain. The kernel of a linear map is a subspace of the codomain.

==The Importance of Kernels and Images==

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition of Rank:
The ''rank'' of a linear map is the dimension of the image of the map &lt;math&gt;dim(Im(f))&lt;/math&gt;. It also can be found using row reduction on the corresponding matrix.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition of Nullity:
The ''nullity'' of a linear map, or matrix, is the dimension of the kernel of the map &lt;math&gt;dim(Ker(f))&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;The Rank-Nullity Theorem:
For any linear map &lt;math&gt;f:V\to W&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dim(Ker(f))+dim(Im(f))=dim(V)&lt;/math&gt;

Interim, Draft 2014-0226-01 to John Citron per request
Draft (253 lines) posted 2014-0404 'as-is' on Trainz\Wikibook scratchpad page without any of the pending pen and ink edits, as need to link it today.
&lt;div style=TRS-style|S=12pt}}&gt;
GENERAL COMMENTS																				* GEN00.0	Consistant with the philosophy of &quot;If-we-break-it, it's-our-job-to-really-fix-it&quot; patches to update all CM's from TS2006-SP0 should be issued for all EXE or DLL re-issue fixable mode suggested hereinafter. 
* This is a moral obligation heretofore overlooked and ignored by N3V. People that are comfortable with a Trainz release should not have to suffer from a bad change inserted by coding changes or N3V's practices and data models. Realizing they are desiring to sell newer versions, breaking older status-quo ante behaviour is never ethical. You want sales, provide added value, not broken historic behavior.
** A prime example of this is CMP's original formulation to NOT report trainz-build tag values, as later CM's have and the concurrent BUG overlooked in each since, that of mishandling &quot;Update available&quot; by not discriminating with respect to Trainz-build tag values. This is a bona-fide BUG and N3V has a moral obligation to fix it.
** Similarly, KUID and KUID2 handling is mismanaged. Internally all the CMs ought be treating KUIDS as KUID2:xxx:yyy:0 as they indeed are evaluated. In practice, in operating CM, the two forms are not equal in searching, to the discomfiture of the customers. This means things are confusing, missed, overlooked and vexing. Having to 'Show Versions' to see alternative KUIDs is plainly deliterious to efficient user time investment and so forth. Searching &lt;kuid:xxx:yyy&gt; should expand to include all the &lt;KUID2:xxx:yyy:nn&gt; forms in the list resulting. Then OBSOLETE icons have context, the user can eliminate such. 
** Related is the mishandling of the reports of updated kuids. MISSING DEPENDENCIES should not be showing obsoleted versions as a Missing dependency. THey aren't necessary so must not be shown as missing for it devalues the validity and utility of searching dependencies status icon (The yellow puzzle piece) ineffect trashing the users local database with FALSE and unhelpful information.

* GEN01.0 	Programmers totally insensitive to aging problems. In particular eyesight. 
																		
* GEN01.a 	Ability to change skin and text color away from default is highly needed. 
																		
* GEN01.b	An ability to modify skin+font size+font color+font face in CM, and font stuff in Surveyor would be REALLY REALLY valuable upgrade for us older and the visually impaired. Monitor+vid card configurations, dependent settings and such vary so much customer to customer that NOT having the flexibility means we tens-of-thousands're forced to make do with proofed displays vetted by the unaged and less debilitated.
																		
* GEN01.c 	Particularly bad is the font size and coloration in TS12 Surveyor, especially SESSION EDIT WINDOW and the Mini Map gradiants' TS12 change from previous green to white font. (The latter clutters the screen with illegibility when labels are also on.
																		
* GEN01.d 	Another color for trackside versus Scenery/Industry labels would be a nice option as well. Each of these should be customer settable for his own situation. 'Restore to Default' and Save Themes highly suggested accompanying changes... don't want disappearing print after all if someone misapplies an option.
																										
* GEN02.0 	Particularly bad is Session rules color schema. Black on current colors would be fine. Some idiot put white lettering on mostly grey backgrounds making text 'LOW CONTRAST' all-but-illegible with accompanied by the other stupid change... reducing the font sizes to ANT PRINT. 
																		
* GEN02.a	RESTORE TRS2006 LOOK SEE AND FEEL. 
																		
* GEN02.b	Trash any ant print in the programs. 
																		
* GEN02.c	DEFAULT Min 'printers font size' (1 pt = 1/72nd inch) should be 10pt to 12pr for your actual user base AFTER monitor scaling. If the tools menu grows to take up the whole left margin, so be it. Straining to see/read something necessary is very frustrating and counter-productive and very deliterious to an enjoyable experience. 
																		
* GEN02.d	Kids eyes can read large text fine, post 45 year-old eyes have adjustment issues young programmers need to be sensitive too. With a customization ability, the kids can select a smaller font at need.
																		
* GEN02.e	Regardless of settings, search window 'current line' should wrap to show whole titles of 'Username' data field. 
																													
* GEN03. 	Surveyor and Driver MAPS had nice legible green GRADIENT DATA... White in TS12 makes them blend into other data types messing with peoples' time who are trying to smooth terrain and appearance. 
																													
* GEN04. 	Loose a lot of time because Screen zooms or begins to zoom to medium elevation pseudo-flying-looking-down mode. THAT FOCAL TRIGGER ca 500-1000m too soon. Raise at least 300 meters. Current switch point is just about where one wants to tour a panarama of fixed layout.
																													
* GEN05. 	Back in TRS2006... Elimination of TYPE and REGION tags manifesting in Surveyor tools was counterproductive. Breaking selectable sub-groups is opposite to the needs of users trying to remember how to find an single asset name to plop down. Pick list doesn't cut it with Category-Class filtering alone -- Dataset should allow user understanding to subcategorize such groupings. WHAT IS NEEDED is ability to allow USERS to override AUTHORS and edit those tags in both Surveyor, viewer and pick APPS and at the very least from CM--without a need to manually open config.txt and edit... CM should allow various adjustments in other words using popup APIs while maintaining CURRENT SEARCH.

* GEN06.  History of Current Search and last selections too short in real life error fixing. Consider some specific search which then shows assets with missing dependancies. Now need to change screen to  display for  assets to see the missing asssets  (second screen)  so can evaluate versions and/or reported errors and warnings and so forth. Any one asset examination may lead to another search, so third is used. Resolving that, usually means importing or DLS machinations... usually involving a fourth screen. The ORIGINAL TASK you were about is now almost always gone... so if you didn't manually save that search you are screwed again by the programmers doing coding on the cheap and convenient for  them, not software crafted to the users common needs.
																													
* GEN07. 	KUID2 version assets should not generate a missing dependancy puzzle piece when the prior assets are not present. If five failed and the sixth trial works, ':5' version is all that matters INCLUDING WHENEVER something else is referencing an earlier version. (Logically, the CM data base may want to track the substitute, but CM should not be written  to bother humans about an earlier missing version, unless parts of it are needed by reference. In that case, Trainz should create a whole corrected asset and kill the earlier versions itself. 
																						
* GEN08. 	BADLY need data search range and especially a date range abilty in CM, we humans work in spurts, recall by association, and frequently work past one days end (MIDNIGHT... during scarce and valuable 'HOBBY TIME') and the beginning of the next... or over several groups of days, our highly constrained time permitting. Selecting individual days with ANDs is tedious to say the least, and worst, cannot be saved. (the dates aren't saved but normalise to 'today'.) 

* GEN08b.	Allow dates in search pane as saved criteria in CM, and it's seatrch tabs

* GEN08c. 	Some wildcarding in search parameters would be greatly appreciated. Especially at least a two field search with wilddards in between. Tektronics or possibly DEC once had a beautiful command line search which would be good. '/tag1/*/tag2/' was better than a regex for finding variable length terms. Some regex could be built in as well. '//Ctag1Ctag2C*' (or '//Ctag1CC*tag2C' as an alternive to the first example) would enable the delimiter to subst so that character would be the new escaped delimiter... what ever the character might be. 

* GEN08d-1. 	DOUBLE escape after a space following a valid find string would have the last part be a substitution string. THAT required a second escape character which was usually the '$' IIRC. Thus '/tag1/*/$tag2$/ /$replacement$/' would replace 'tag2' and similarly, '/tag1/*/$*$//tag2/ /$insert_this$/ would split and insert the term. Also used were # for a digit, ? for a single char and '^nn' to repeat a type so ?^15 would count fifteen anycharacters, whilst #^(2-7) allowed for variable number digit sequences, which would include both decimal points, scientific notation (-1.5408E-04) and signs if necessary in such. 

* GEN08d2.	Given such tooling, would like to have RENAMING on the fly inside CM, even Surveyor... some way to locally change the term string of an asset (username). Could be implemented as an alias term CM inserts into the config.

* GEN09. 	Along similar lines, adding a revisions and notes tag in the config would be very welcome the revisions field would display as an header prefixing the asset description data and the notes as an addendum suffixing the asset description data. 

* GEN10.	Those three and the trainz-build codes need be viewable in an auxillary window in surveyor... Said content display window would change when the selected item is accessed in the surveyor tools tabs. The user would toggle it open and closed with a hotkey toggle and/or close button.
																		
* GEN09.a	Need to self-identify which asset is list of errors and warnings in titlebars
																		
* GEN09.b 	IMPORT .cdp and Content... 'TASK COMPLETED' 'DETAILS' messages should pair both asset names and kuids (ALWAYS ACTUALLY) This was unhelpful results:
Message: Will install content package &quot;F:\CDP files\All_TS12_CDPs\Scenery Trainz.cdp&quot;
Message: Will install content package &quot;F:\CDP files\All_TS12_CDPs\TransDEM Ground Textures V3.cdp&quot;
Message: Will install content package &quot;F:\CDP files\All_TS12_CDPs\US&amp;S Style B Semaphore Pack.cdp&quot;
Warning: Skipped previously installed asset '0-4-0T Jay Street Connecting #1 --- Scenery'
    ...     SNIP, SNIP ...
Warning: Skipped previously installed asset 'Streetcar Peter Witt --- Scenery'

Warning: Skipped previously installed asset 'US&amp;S Style-B Semaphore Numbers'

... 

* GEN09c) Would actually be quite handy to have these screens have a kuid stream output, a comma separated list of the kuids listed in the message. Something we can paste in (including unknown location Kuids) into the search window or capture to a text file to later pursue missing assets. As is, we have to go through several other screens to capture dependencies which are unknown location (missing, not on DLS nor local).
																		
09d)	Several different output arrangements by click box selection would be nice
																		
09e) 	[CTRL]-[A] + [CTRL]-[C} needs to work on all these message boxs and APIs. Default should then list both kuids and names with messages. Excepting error and warnings report... which should have those indentifiers in the tit6le bar... solutions sometimes take a while to research... other things demand attention, so having pairing with folders open for edit and a results window... is far more efficient than guessing!
																		
10. 	Programmers need to use unique names for executables Windows finds out about. The overuse of Trainz.exe (one in bin one as launcher from installation's root) is confusing at best. Worse still is no distinction between versions in name for those who operate multiple Trainz legacy varieties too. Poor practice in any event given stand-alone nature of evolving product.	

* GEN11.0	Task complete message windows, and all popup windows in general: assaying extent of errors frequently has 3-5 open at once to see where same error by same author is occuring. Need to self-identify which asset is list of errors and warnings in titlebars. Further, if possible a different icon in Windows 'open processes' (Taskbars tabs) would be valuable, at LEAST one different from CM and another different for TADdaemon (if visible).


Main Menu wishlist
01a. 	Author column of Routes and Sessions
																		
01b.	Title bar show folder pathspec and trainz-build 
																													
02a.	Columns listing Last ALTERED date and last access date
																		
02b.	and kuids (All optional toggle or click box or drop down selectable)
																													
03. 	MAIN MENU -- RESUME historic behavior of positioning list menu to last loaded route and session,	or at least display what it was. (Prefer the TS2009-TRS2004 historic menu overall)
																													
04. 	MAIN MENU -- 'Navigation Action buttons' at or near top (Like browsers), not down at screen bottom nor any at right and left... launch interface frankly sucks.
																													
COM05.0 CM+SUR -- Desire Two run-time EDITABLE USER 'AUX-DESCRIPTIONs fields' that individual users can add and edit in both CM and Surveyor, adding that capability to viewer mode asset browsers like Railyard and  the proposed 'Trackside&quot; (or what ever name is given the general asset viewer(s). These should be click-box activated or disabled to see only the description (default) or any combo of the three.

COM05.a New Tag &quot;Aux-description1&quot; would prefix in CM and any in surveyor pop-up description view (Suggested else where in detail). 

COM05.b Whilst tag &quot;Aux-description2&quot; or &quot;Revisions-record&quot; would append to current string when things display, if enabled. (I'd use this to display a change record, of modified assets. (e.g. Date, installed newer data structures and thumbnails, deleted obsolescent tags 'region', 'type' 'asset-filename', [Or whatever] and advanced Kuid to Kuid2 and trainz-build to V2.6 ,[Or whatever]. This latter could and should be handled in a remarks header block as a file header ID.																			
																				
06.  Ability to search keywords or string in both CM and Surveyor DESCRIPTION FIELDS... including proposed 'Aux-description' augmentations. [Like all good coding, where necessary legacy Trainz releases should have a Patch to ignore such new data and data formats. The same patch project should be used to fix the various CMs so that they all (TRS2006, TC1&amp;2, TC3...) ignore versions currently listed as AVAILABLE UPDATES when in fact those are in data formats incompatible with earlier Trainz. (i.e. BUG IN CM programming: Assets to build v3.7 should NOT be reported as available in TS10 etc. Assets to 3.0  should not be reported as Out of Date in TC3, and its predecessors.)

SURVEYOR NEEDS and shortcomings...
* SUR01.	NEW TOOL BUTTON==Need ability to set numeric height and rotation on F3-O scenery objects; sometimes things manifest with slight offset angle that cannot be eliminated, ditto elevation differential making it impossible to blend two or more into one displayed entity/virtual object.

* SUR02.	NEW TOOL BUTTON==Need ability to set a fixed (default) angle of F3-O scenery items in put down. (e.g. all the houses in a row development parrallel to a street oriented at compass 323 or 45 or 165 degrees...) THis means the auto-rotation setting in OPTIONS needs local override toggle and data input. USE THE SPACE wasted currently by &quot;Advanced Tools&quot; (WHAT A CROCK OF...) expanders... 

* SUR03.	Pick list needs to respond to tool activated so only F3 items are in when tool active, so only F4-Y objects (trackside) show when that tool selected, etc.

* SUR04.	Need to be able to save and import nn+1 pick list(s) -- users names and options (...\Settings\picks\*.txt suggested)

* SUR05.	Get tools inconsistent -- all should stay in get mode until A for Add hotkey pressed.
 
* SUR06. 	TEXTURE TOOL needs overhauled so selected texture name/title of texture appears in edit line.

* SUR07.	Elevation back away 'zoom to map mode' needs switching-point trigger capability to be set by user or raised at least 1000 feet above current trigger point, and THAT VALUE should be the default for user set point when fixed. [High priority--this is costing lots of lost time in undesired focal shifts.]

* SUR08. 	BADLY NEED hot key for 'View errors and warnings'.

* SUR09. 	Changing of perspective by slight zoom back to see wider panorama/view is very annoying -- 3x out of four imposes a long delay... [suspect presumably because of LOD meshes???] 
																		
* SUR10. 	Would like a hotkey to set angle of view relative to horizon when viewing obliquely downwards and 'flying' above terrain. Mounse rolls too far, too frequently stopping on either side of best angle as wanted.

* SUR11.a  Eliminating Objects subgrouping type control in surveyor a bad mistake. Industries vs buildings etc. had a filtering and location ability that was very useful. Far more useful than huge list format now in TS12.

* SUR11.b	New Feature very much desired: HOTKEY ability to toggle widening of tool menu displays so can read the whole title of items.

* SUR12. 	Wanted: Global GET TOOL - Press hotkey then clickon whatever, gives the proper tool tab, then KUID under mouse tool tip.

* SUR13. 	If tab is active, any get key should open tab and display the get... not waste users time.

* SUR14. 	Railyard spinoff-allow viewing of F3-O objects and preferrably also F3-S, F4-Y, F2 textures, ideally in popup from in CM like viewing the config.txt file.

* SUR15. 	TOOL API's and Pick List, etc... popup items using up screen space including mini-map should be dragable to second or third head monitors AND ALSO RESIZABLE! 

* SUR16. 	CLICK BUTTON IN SURVEYOR AND CM to 'UNFAVORITE' an asset... i.e. NEVER SHOW ME THIS ITEM AGAIN in Surveyor (e.g. Flip Trees in a Speedtreed route, BR rollng stock in US etc.) Whether this is same as disabling the item in CM or archiving it, or some third mode, don't care. Disabling seems about right, but in CM would LOVE TO HIDE THOSE THINGS TOO! 

* SUR17. 	WANT A 'PICK LIST OF (adjustment) TOOL BUTTONS' w/data seeting input fields, perhaps on F8? 
																		
* SUR18. 	GET TOOLS MUST STOP DEFAULTING to ADD. I can hit the 'A' hotkey myself.
																		
* SUR19. 	Surveyor ability to toggle sounds on and off whilst working an area would be nice. Got a wolf right where I need to do a lot more development ... that really annoys the wife and me!

* SUR20. 	Compass rose added in the Trainz Classics in the exactly worst place on the minimap for those of us using one monitor more often than not. THAT MODE requires a small mini map extended off the screen lower left corner... making the compass rose overtop some very valuable views... near center screen, where the mouse moves the screen/angle and keys rotate the view.

* SUR21. 	'Circumstansial Selectable Pick groups' ... Seperate Pick List both by type and some user definable groups activated by 'click buttons'... trying to just pick textures they are mixed with other things really slowing down the utility of Pick list. IF &quot;Bookmarks buttons&quot; had a second row coresponding to other pick lists, all savable and transportable route to route, etc. (Export should be an external and EDITABLE comma delimited multiline TXT file enabling users to copy, edit, or archive! 'Input' and 'save as' and 'merge with' file at some path specified too. Extracting a portion ('Export Part As...' and saving as would be nice but not necessary feature.)

* SUR22. 	LIST ABILITY of Asset type X &quot;In this Route&quot;... for example... list all textures on ground used so far on this route and put them in a pick list type display applett.

* SUR23. 	Asset choosing tools should allow description in Surveyor mode in an optional pop-up screen. Popup concieved to be an extension of current tool set and applies solely to selected asset. Scrolling through those scrolls the descritions in the new popup enhanced. 

content manager punchlist 
																			* CMn0.0	[partial repeat-see whole in General comments] Consistant with the philosophy of &quot;If-we-break-it, it's-our-job-to-really-fix-it&quot; patches to update all CM's from TS2006-SP0 should be issued for all EXE or DLL re-issue fixable mode suggested hereinafter. A prime example of this is CMP's original formulation to NOT report trainz-build tag values, as later CM's have and the concurrent BUG overlooked in each since, that of mishandling &quot;Update available&quot; by not discriminating with respect to Trainz-build tag values.
																					
* CMn01.	Errors are so prevalent, need View Errors and Warnings API in title bar to give title of asset being reported. In the real world, we have no choice but to chase more than one error at a time now and then. [Very High Priority]

* CMn02. 	&lt;kuid:-10:197&gt; 

* CMn03. 	CM BADLY NEEDS WEB type interface so pervasive nowadays to backspace to previous search, and such searches as are kept in que, needs much longer length. Four just isn't enough and eight might not be either. 16 would be more than enough in any circumstance I could keep straight. Bumping off listed items in searches list would be a good feature to have, suggest drag and toss feature. 

* CMn04. 	DUP 14 above: Railyard spinoff-allow viewing of F3-O objects and preferrably also F3-S, F4-Y, F2 textures, ideally in popup from in CM like viewing the config.txt file.

* CMn05. 	Ability to save download que, set it aside and prioritize a different DLS list first. reboot Trainz or computer or in any event return to it or any other saved list at a later time more convenient to the user.

* CMn06. 	Listing ability of stuff in Download helper

* CMn07. 	Expand codes for category region to indlude continental expanses, e.g. Mexico, US+ Canada find much in the way of identical rolling stock types.

* CMn08. 	Capture current search/main list to savable kuid list (Text file will do fine, best if search then allowe import of same. Manual cut and paste fine too for me.)

* CMn09. 	Asset Description to be 1st item, then screenshot in ASSET DETAILS pane
* CMn10. 	CLICK BOX on SEARCH PANE to disable including DLS and Local and Built In items selectively. Setting three criteria (Name_+AND NOT+ON DOWNLOAD STN is time disrespectful. NEED TOO OFTEN.

* CMn11. 	Boolean search params... move to top of list, or preferably loose and replace with click-box implementation where the clickbox applies to the next search field following. Rearranging search to a top bar would be advisable--the left panes are overly busy and overworked.

* CMn12. 	Along the same lines revising the 'Asset Details' pane to a relocatable resizable window format [or this older (option selectable) placement] would be good. Description and screenshot are most important, so current placement as bottom items is contraindicated. 

* CMn13. 	Finding a list of KUIDs comes up as obsoletes, when should default to showing current kuid installed and active if that's suplanting it. CHANGE THE FONT COLOR AT LEAST SHOWING the little OBSOLETE iconography means the asset is coming up obsolete when it's the only version still to be found. (May be a circumstance with new kuid obsoleting an updated one. Seen in SS Log Dump Diesel, misstated: &lt;kuid2:86661:144048:2&gt; (replacement) vs. &lt;kuid:86661:144012&gt;, the first has the 2nd in obsolete table. BOTH were in data base. Having the disposihle one come up in red font would let people know is deletable asset. Generated errors in newer Trainz apparently. Part of Northbay County routes. 
) 

* CMn14.0 	Need a right Click Copy KUIDS ONLY for CM Main Display items. Sometimes want just a comma separated list, for example to search another Trainz's CM for said assets.

* CMn15.0 	CURRENT SEARCH 'Tab' should return user to the prior search selected by the main search tool in the left CM/CMP Pane -- not OVERRIGHT THAT with the results of clicking &quot;VIEW IN MAIN LIST&quot;, or any of it's derived subsequent Show Dependencies applets. 

* CMn15.a 	THIS IS AN URGENT CHANGE NEED that would greatly aid user productivity and experiences with Trainz--downloading many assets, especially routes and sessions, often returns a large &quot;PUNCH LIST&quot; of further items that need to be downloaded. 

* CMn15.b 	The ONLY way to currently capture and enter these into the Download Helper pane is to SHOW IN MAIN LIST... then drag and drop -- messing up a larger work process and interfering with ongoing project tasks (INTERUPTIONS SUCK). VERY VEXING.
																		
* CMn15.c Recommend:	Adding clidk box &quot;ADD Updates and missing dependencies to the Show Dependencies applet. One click adds any updated or missing dependency available on the DLS to the CM DOWNLOAD HELPER PANE. 
																		
* CMn15.d Further, missing dependencies NOT ON THE DLS ought to append a log file as follows:
** ''Timestamp, Datestamp, TRAINZ ASSET: 
:::  'JRPX 20800 gal tank car', &lt;kuid2:45324:300008:2&gt;  missing the following non-DLS assets:
:::  Unknown Location: &lt;kuid2:45324:28900:1&gt;
:::  Unknown Location: &lt;kuid2:45324:50203:1&gt;
:::  Unknown Location: &lt;kuid2:45324:555200:1&gt;
:::: &lt;kuid2:45324:300008:2&gt; needs: &lt;kuid2:45324:28900:1&gt;,&lt;kuid2:45324:50203:1&gt;,&lt;kuid2:45324:555200:1&gt;

:: END: 'JRPX 20800 gal tank car' 
																		
* CMn16.0 	HOTKEY and/or menubar toggle between Large and Small Icons.
	- Really need a Medium size, small icons can't be made out, but that's best for maximizing data listed seen. LARGE for figuring out the status. A blend of the two would be greatly appreciated. Hence a rotating toggle would work.
 
																		
* CMn17.0	CMs occasionally get display all bolloxed up, so Settings click box to reinitialize display (as when starting up) would cut down on the quitting our and relaunching (and reduce frustration because of interupted thought process, work in prograss.)
																		
* CMn18.0	IMPORTING CDPs... The Task COmplete popup needs the STANDARD show in 'Main View' option button even for case when ALL ASSETS SKIPPED because already present. And the default behavior should be to show all in the CDP when so viewing a mixed bag of imports and skipped. AT THE LEAST this would help us better organize and label collected CDPs without resorting to pasting the names in and then one by one searching what the heck was there and came in (or was present in the cdp). 
 
																		
* CMn19.0	CDP Preview read and display needed, not a base import, but data to decide if import is GOOD... Kuids list, Names, Trainz-build at a mininum. Option to VIEW in MAIN SCREEN and if there, check the lot for updates on the DLS (Versions listed for each, in other words)
																		
* CMn20.0	Importing CDPs or otherwise, View in Main List needs to display the UNKNOWN KUIDs in the same list so we can at least get the picture of how much we're screwed by downloading that route or session... If CM could manage a running list of missing assets we can get as a text report file, that would be a great time saving feature.
																		
* CMn21.0	Selecting a batch (Screenful) of assets and lauching view Versions, needs allow a cut and paste save at least for missing (ny definintion UNKNOWN to the DLS) assets.
																		
* CMn22.0	Task Complete popups universally need report which version in reporting CM output results, with TADdaemon running 3 CMs at once and cross loading assets has been a frequent experience this past week.
																		
* CMn23.0	Having the registry entry for CPS track various installations and ask which Trainz to launch/load them into would be a nice safeguard. An accidental click had TRS2006 importing TS09--TS12 data yesterday... 
																		
* CMn24.0	INSTALL A THUMNAIL AUTOMATICALLY feature. A) adapt Railyard to show any asset. The software ia already present in surveyor ot generate the rotating images... adapt so 
** CMn24.a	Scenery ([f3]-[O] selections and many [f4]-[Y] assets can be viewed in a standard Trainz board with some default setups of terrain based on size of the asset generated geometry (tiny, small, medium, large corresponding to a road sign/trackside small footprint asset, house size, commercial building size, Factory/Level Bridges assets with ample lengths). Each of those can be placed in a locus a fixed radial distance from the (focal length) virtual camera, the object virtually rotated to maximize width aspect, and if rectangular camera position automatically precessed around (i.e. to show two building faces) and canted (move camera up to tree top height) to establish a perspective view. SNAP SNAP. AUTO EDIT the configs.
	
* CMn25.0	Task complete message windows, and all popup windows in general: assaying extent of errors frequently has 3-5 open at once to see where same error by same author is occuring. Need to self-identify which asset is list of errors and warnings in titlebars. Further, if possible a different icon in Windows 'open processes' (Taskbars tabs) would be valuable, at LEAST one different from CM and another different for TADdaemon (if visible).

* CMn26.0 	Ordering of items in Search drop down needs refactored to place those needed most often up the top, AND and OR, NAME, AUTHOR, KUID, immediately come to mind as do local, DLS and installed. Category should be just after booleans.

* CMn27.0 	Displaying a list of assets in such and such should not loose the current search. Further, especially should have search combo's in search pane listed over list of kuids. Even going one page past, measn guessing on what resulted 3-30 minutes ago. Mostly I miss finding my way back. More history would be best, preferrably like a Broswer history of at least 16 items in drop down form, most recent top to bottom. Date installed, Date modified, era, region at bottom. Alternatively this order and alphabetical with click box toggle.

DRIVER SHORTCOMINGS
* DVR01.	Font size on Driver Map is about 2 pt too small for older viewers. Desire a menu option to select larger sizes from this default as the new minimum of a set of selectable font scales.
* DVR02. 	Repeat above for default font size in HTML pop-up Windows

* DVR03. 	TS12 switch to white on other white lettering Gradients data is HIGHLY problematic. GIVE US GREEN AGAIN Please. Having another text color for some frequent assets would also be handy-suggest yellow for junction names and a seperate toggle to hide those labels or the Red-Green controls which can overwhelm accessing the data one actually needs when trying to get an overview of upcoming tracks and yards. Need to process junctions follows after getting a sense of what is needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Cantor space is a generalisation of the Cantor set, which can be seen as any element as the homeomorphism class of the Cantor set defined below.

==Definition of the Cantor set==

The Cantor set is the limit of an infinite process of removing subsets of the unit interval depicted here.
[[Image:Cantor set in seven iterations.svg|729px|Cantor ternary set, in seven iterations]]

So at any given step we remove the middle thirds of the unit interval, let &lt;math&gt;C_0=[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; so at the n-th step we have:

:&lt;math&gt;C_n=\frac{C_{n-1}}{3}\cup \big(\frac{2}{3}+\frac{C_{n-1}}{3}\big)&lt;/math&gt;

So the effect is scaling the previous step down by a third and putting two copies next to each other. Then the Cantor set is

:&lt;math&gt;C=\bigcap_{i=0}^{\infty} C_i&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition of the Cantor space==

A Cantor space is any space homeomorphically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; defined above. The value of this defintion is elucidated by the following theorem.

==Brouwer's Theorem==

An equivalent form of Brouwer's original theorem is: &quot;A topological space is a Cantor space if and only if it is non-empty, perfect, compact, totally disconnected, and metrizable.&quot; 

To understand this let's fill in the definition not yet covered. 

1. Clearly, non-empty means it is not the empty set. 

2. Perfect means the space has no isolated points (no points that are contained in an open set in the ambient space).

3. Compactness has been covered.

4. Totally disconnected means the connected components (the maximal connected subsets) of the space are all points.

5. Metrisable means there exists a metric for this space.

Thus the theorem states that the combination of these conditions leaves a space homeomorphic to the Cantor set.

==Example==

Consider the map from the set of infinite binary codes &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; often written &lt;math&gt;2^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to the Cantor set defined above: &lt;math&gt;f:2^\mathbb{N}\to C&lt;/math&gt; defined as for a sequence &lt;math&gt;a=(a_i)_{i=0}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(a)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{2a_i}{3^{i+1}}&lt;/math&gt;

Then f is a homeomorphism of metric spaces, meaning that all the properties above hold for the space &lt;math&gt;2^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.</text>

The idea of Becker's Defence 3...h6 is to play 4...g5 without having to fear 5.h4, which would simply be answered with 5...Bg7.

&lt;big&gt;That difficult word order...&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Issues==

Word order in Dutch is not easy for speakers of English or one of the Romance languages. We have already seen a number of issues above that may well drive Anglophone learners of Dutch a little crazy. The three main ones are:

#Inversion: reversing the order of the subject and the finite verb (See [[Dutch/Lesson 11|Lesson 11]])
#Subjunction: a different word order in a dependent clause (See [[Dutch/Lesson 11|Lesson 11]])
#Separability:  separable verbs can split and combine (See [[Dutch/Lesson 18|Lesson 18]])

These three issues are mainly concerned with the verbs in the sentence.

However, pronominal adverbs are also separable (See [[Dutch/Lesson 8|Lesson 8]]) and this is part of a more general, fourth issue: the position of other parts of the sentence, like adverbial expressions or objects. It is also different from English. 

Obviously in a Dutch sentence these four issues may very well combine and interfere with each other.

This lesson will try to tie the issues together a bit and expand on the fourth issue.

===Two poles===

In English a sentence typically has a basic &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;O&lt;/font&gt; structure: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;verb&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;object&lt;/font&gt;

:E.g.: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;The farmer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;plows&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;the field&lt;/font&gt;

Dutch has the same order in this case

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ploegt&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt;

But this resemblance is a bit deceptive. This becomes clear when we have a compound verb in the sentence.
In English &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;O&lt;/font&gt; continues to hold for the perfect tense for example:

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;The farmer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;has plowed&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;the field&lt;/font&gt;

But in Dutch this is ''not'' the case. The finite part of the verb 'has' - 'heeft' remains in the same position, but the participle 'geploegd' moves to end of the sentence, forming a second verbal pole:

: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt;

That means that Dutch is not really an &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;O&lt;/font&gt; language. We could say that the Dutch structure has two verbal poles: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;O&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

The second pole does not just attract past participles, but also infinitives, e.g. in the future tense

: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;zal&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ploegen&lt;/font&gt;

Also the adverbial prefix of a separable verb, like omhakken, moves to the second pole:

: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;hakt&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;de boom&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;om&lt;/font&gt;

In a dependent clause the role of the second pole even becomes dominant, because even the finite verb moves to &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;: 

: Ik zeg dat &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;de boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd heeft&lt;/font&gt;
: Ik zeg dat &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;de boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft geploegd&lt;/font&gt;

(Both versions occur: Dutch word order is less uniform than the English one).
In either case the order is &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;O&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;!

In English the order simply remains &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;O&lt;/font&gt;:

:I say that &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;the farmer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;has plowed&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;the field&lt;/font&gt;

==Adverbs==
Adverbial expressions typically end up ''between'' the two poles.

E.g. ''gisteren'' - ''yesterday''

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ploegde&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt; 
:Ik weet dat &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;de boer&lt;/font&gt;  -'''gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd heeft&lt;/font&gt; 

Notice that in Dutch the adverbial expression typically comes ''before'' the object. It is possible to swap the object and the adverbial expression, -which resembles English word order more-, but this tends to put emphasis on the adverb:

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt;  - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; -'''gísteren''' -&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt; (niet: vandaag)

It also possible to put the adverbial expression up front, but then it triggers inversion of the subject and the finite verb:

:'''Gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;de boer&lt;/font&gt;   - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt;  -&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt; 

In the front position there is a mild emphasis on the adverb, but often it is just a way to accommodate more than one adverbial expression. Compare:

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - '''met de tractor'''- &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt; 

:'''Gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;de boer&lt;/font&gt; - '''met de tractor'''  - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt;  -&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt; 

The order of the adverbial expressions in usually   '''when''' - '''how''' - '''where''':
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Ik&lt;/font&gt;- &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ben&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - '''met de trein'''- '''naar Brussel'''  - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gereisd&lt;/font&gt; 

===niet===
Negation in Dutch is done by adding the adverb ''niet''. It gets its own position:

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ploegde&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - '''niet'''
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - '''niet''' - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt; 
:Ik weet dat &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;de boer&lt;/font&gt;  -'''gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - '''niet''' - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd heeft&lt;/font&gt; 

We could put it before ''gisteren'', but that changes the meaning to: not yesterday (but today). 

Sometimes, however, the negation is put between the adverbs, after the time expression:

The order of the adverbial expressions in usually   '''when''' - '''how''' - '''where''':
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Ik&lt;/font&gt;- &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ben&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - '''niet''' - '''met de trein'''- '''naar Brussel'''  - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gereisd&lt;/font&gt;

==Objects: direct, indirect and prepositional==
In Dutch the indirect object can be expression either with or without the preposition ''aan''. This is comparable to the situation in English:

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;He&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gave&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;me&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;the book&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;He&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gave&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;the book&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;to me&lt;/font&gt;

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Hij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gaf&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;mij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het boek&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Hij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gaf&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het boek&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;aan mij&lt;/font&gt;

Notice that in both languages the real indirect object and its prepositional stand in have a different position in the sentence. This becomes clearer if we add some adverbial expressions to the Dutch sentences

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Hij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gaf&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;mij&lt;/font&gt; '''gisteren''' '''op straat''' &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het boek&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Hij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gaf&lt;/font&gt; '''gisteren''' '''op straat''' &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het boek&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;aan mij&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Hij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; '''gisteren''' '''op straat''' &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het boek&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;aan mij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gegeven&lt;/font&gt;

Notice that the direct object gravitates towards the first pole. The prepositional version goes to the second.

We can swap most of the items in the sentence for emphasis, but not the indirect object one. Since Dutch has lost its case endings around 1600 in the spoken language there is only the word order to mark ''me'' as an indirect object.

In the written language there is exactly one exception: the third person plural (''them'') has two forms: hun for indirect objects and hen for direct and prepositional ones:

: Ik gaf hun het boek
: Ik gaf het boek aan hen

However, this distinction was artificially created in the 1630's by a grammarian and despite four centuries of schoolmasters hammering it in, the artificial word 'hen' will seldom be heard in the spoken language.

==Prepositional objects and pronominal adverbs==

There are more prepositional objects in Dutch besides the one with 'aan'. Many verbs show fixed combination with certain prepositions, e.g.:

:Meewerken met iets
:Deelnemen aan iets
:Gebrand zijn op iets

:E.g.: Hij heeft &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;aan deze wedstrijd&lt;/font&gt; deelgenomen

When the noun 'wedstrijd' is to replaced by a pronoun, Dutch turns the prepositional object into a pronominal adverb:

: Hij heeft &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;hieraan&lt;/font&gt; deelgenomen

However, pronominal adverbs are separable and the locative part (er, hier, daar, waar) tends towards the first pole, whereas the prepositional one tends towards the second. This becomes apparent when we add adverbial expressions.

:Hij heeft '''vaak met volle overgave''' &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;aan deze wedstrijd&lt;/font&gt; deelgenomen
: Hij heeft &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;hier&lt;/font&gt; '''vaak met volle overgave''' &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;aan&lt;/font&gt; deelgenomen</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Fool's Gold Loaf is a rather unusual sandwich, consisting of a whole french loaf filled with margarine, bacon, peanut butter and jelly. It is famous for being a favorite of Elvis Presley

== Ingredients ==
* 2 T [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 1 loaf French white [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* 1 lb / 450 g [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] slices
* 1 jar of smooth [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]]
* 1 jar of grape jelly (US), jam (UK)

== Procedure ==
# Preheat the oven to 350F/180C. Spread the margarine generously all over all sides of the loaf. Place it on a baking sheet in the oven.
# Meanwhile, fry the bacon in a bit of oil until it is crisp and drain it thoroughly on paper towels.
# Remove the loaf from the oven when it is evenly browned, after approximately 15 minutes. Slice the loaf lengthwise and hollow out the interior, leaving as much bread along the walls as desired. Slather a thick layer of peanut butter in the cavity of the loaf and follow with another thick layer of grape jelly. Use lots of both.
# Arrange the bacon slices inside the cavity, or, if desired, layer the bacon slivers between the peanut butter and jelly. Close the loaf, slice and eat.
Serves 8-10 for most people.

==Fixing the DLS, soonest!==
This is a proposal to fix the issues with bad content on the DLS, which is not the bad data itself, but the bad data when downloaded. The solution is like exterminating other vermin, the quickest way is to remove their food supply, so to here I propose we remove the errors with automatic computer data shuffling. 

Here's the base N3V survival problem. The new user knows squat about fixing errors, or the perils of downloading a route. The secondary issue, is that those of us who do know that minefield still get stuck with the time-sink of fixing errors when assaying a new route. Since Many routes have dependencies with issues OR, those which have missing dependencies (''as bad to my thinking''), the goal is to deal with such ASAP as a community, and a corporate partner... 
{{TOCright}}
So the strategy is to isolate those with issues, isolate the supporting cast of assets with issues, and isolate those which may have issues... leaving a set of clean problem free assets and routes on the new skinnier DLS that can be safely downloaded by even a third grader without much ado. 

THAT resultant will become the new default DLS on a diet. The other stages are user accessible web pages where one can shop and download knowing you may face a risk. In general, new users won't find out about those until they've been around long enough to not get discouraged. 

Lastly, I've a number of proposed methods for curing the new backlog, the assets with problems, the missing assets, and so forth. Again, I invoke computer automation with a little software assist from N3V. It's their mess, they benefit most from the attractiveness of the DLS. It's time they supported a system of expedited fixes.

==What are those==
What are those other websites you ask, how will that work. Some may wonder if it will be expensive. (Compared to alienating customers? Just the opposite.) Well, simple, they're clones of [https://www.auran.com/TRS2004/DLS.php This TRS2004/DLS.php] website, just like a page such as [https://www.auran.com/TRS2004/DLS_viewasset.php?AssetID=193416 this snoop page] can be accessed. I presume they'd reside in another harddrive, possibly might need a separate computer, but we aren't talking a large outlay here, a few thousands in equipments should cover it with room to spare. The key difference is they will have a different URL, perhaps TRS2004/DLS-1.php, TRS2004/DLS-2.php, TRS2004/DLS-3.php or some more clever link namings. Whether they are organized as a sub-page, a permanent url, or whatnot I leave to the preferences of N3Vs webmaster and management. The point is there is little hardware and little software needed, there already exists a pipeline into the DLS for vetted and approved assets conformal to V2.9 or above. There already exists an link to the shopping carts in Simulator Central, and capacity to have that shopping cart trigger a download. 
 
Our only requirements in this specification are that
# they duplicate the search capabilities of the TRS2004 DLS
# They too can feed the shopping cart for download enqueuing
## --preferentially with a different background color to minimize confusion
## --they can transfer data to and fro to the other cloned DLS variants at need, 
## or most importantly, via a channel with filtering supplied by the N3V programmers as discussed below.

==Homage==
This 'naming' is a homage, a tribute to daytime children's programming when CABLE TV hadn't yet been invented. Don't know how international the [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=Three+Stooges&amp;go=Go Three Stooges reruns] were, but the FIVE-to-SEVEN stooges (They had some cast turn over in 45 years) were a vaudeville act gone to Movie Shorts and then Television shorts/programs and ran over four decades as a popular USA entertainment act. 'Larry' was wild haired and 'Curly' was Bald, while 'Moe' had a trademark bowl-snipped hairdo and sometimes sported a Hitleresque mustache but was always the boss except when they debuted in film with Shemp as the principal actor. Their skits relied heavily on abusing the others with eye-pokes and rump kicks, head-knocks and other slapstick comic stuff before society went over soft to the Nanny State motif. Their names are somewhat symbolic of stages in a process aimed to  cleaning up the mess on the DLS... ''quickly''

==Shemp==
&lt;b&gt;Shemp&lt;/b&gt; had an successful independent Hollywood and stage career and seen chronologically in their shorts output was a Curly replacement. (Actually Curly replaced Shemp initially&amp;mdash;but he returned to the act over a decade later when brother Curly had a series of career and life-ending strokes) so because he's disorderly&amp;mdash;with a hairdo from hell&amp;mdash;we'll let him represent a &lt;b&gt;clone of the current DLS&lt;b&gt;, warts and all&amp;mdash;with one important change:
# '''SHEMP will not know what ''a 'simple KUID'''''' is but input the DLS as it is now&amp;mdash;but as all as ALL KUID2 formats&lt;big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;... with any luck the software gurus will sense the obvious next nicety, a wildcard capability! &lt;!--
---&gt;
# Shemp normally talks only to Curly, except for two highly constrained specific cases:
## unless Larry asks for something,
## or Moe tells him what to do. 
# Shemp will not output Class Y category-class assets, Maps, Scenarios, Sessions, except to Larry, but then if and only if Larry asks. 
# When told by Moe, Shemp will delete a map, session, or scenario. Moe does that only because he's received all the assets on the route, session, or scenario from Larry. {{bullR}}Signifies a complete ready to run session and route! Yea, team!{{bullR}}For those of you following, I sense you sensing that Moe will be holding the new DLS when this all works through.
# When asked, Shemp will pass other assets to Curly, beginning with simplest most likely to be building block assets, then progressively higher organized kinds of assets.
# then delete them when Curly says they're received and error checked.
# Curly will not tell Shemp to delete assets with errors.
Like sand running through an hour=glass, the implication here, good assets, once vetted (and the method assumes this will likely take some time) or repaired leave Curly and Shemp, and in the end, Shemp will end holding only routes with faulty content, Curly only faulty assets.
{{text-box|
:&lt;big&gt;*&lt;/big&gt; Simple kuid's have outlived their usefulness, particularly as they confuse string searching. Since &lt;kuid:WWWXXX:YYYZZZ&gt; can be specified  &lt;kuid2:WWWXXX:YYYZZZ:0&gt;, both are redundant. Ironically, once everything is coded for kuid2 formats, I'd advocate (now that the statisticaly population is everything) converting all back to kuids, the 2 then being redundant.
}}

==Curly==
# Assume the next '''Curly''' is a website you can also stimulate into adding items into a shopping cart, which you can then download. Make the same assumption for each of the others... that downloading of a cart is already in place, n'est pas? Everyone thinking that five pages adding to same cart would overwhelm N3Vs technical capacity, please raise your hand.  OK, Shane, you stay after school. &lt;G&gt;&lt;!--
---&gt;
## Curly can not get any Sessions, scenarios, or Routes from Shemp, and when Shemp passes the assets on, he must delete them when curly tells him the Kuid2 is OKAY, leaving him holding only Sessions, Routes, and Scenarios--and assets with Errors... (like my CM!) &lt;!--
---&gt;
# Meanwhile Curly tests the component assets in a prioritized scheme, based on category-class tags and KINDs from simplest to most complicated. More or less, I'd initially think to  prioritize searching and input by:  &lt;!--
---&gt;
## { G= Ground, E= Environment, J= Textures, H= meshes, I= Product, F= Foliage, O= Organisms, V= Vehicles, Z= Train Parts, M=Maintenance Of Way, W= Wayside, T=Track, S= Splines, B= Buildings, A= Motive Power, and rolling stock C,D,L,P,R,X } with a deliberate hold on Y= Maps and scenarios, sessions. &lt;!--
---&gt;
## All assets of '''{the set''': {{bullR
}}'''Class &quot;A&quot;        Motive Power''', Class &quot;B&quot;        Buildings and Structure, {{Col

---&gt;
# Those which pass testing for TRS2006-SP1 (upto TC3--higher formats later by Larry) are copied and passed onto LARRY then...
## Curly then auto-modifies these substituting an annotation at the end of the description text ''&quot;This asset auto-updated by DLS automation bot CURLY on 2014-0415, Happy Tax Day!'' and promoting the KUID2 to the next vacant level. That will usually be '+:1'  so &lt;KUID2:WWW:XXX:1&gt; for oldest assets (&lt;KUID2:WWW:XXX:0&gt; is the same as &lt;KUID:WWW:XXX&gt;, lowest numbers most often, trainz-build tag to 2.6. Then passes those also onto Larry.
## That leaves Curly Holding a bag full of broken assets
## and assets with missing KUIDS (unbroken assets with missing dependencies)... Curly holds onto these until Larry asks for them.

==Larry==
;gets pre-vetted assets needing more TLC
Larry is more clever than Curly as every fan knows. He's going to run the list of KUID2s from Curly and edit the files and folders of v2.6 to v2.8, translating data structures and tags, auto-annotating the description records ... making them TS2009 compliant (v2.9). &lt;!--
---&gt;
 
Note, that if N4V wants to raise that v2.9 import threshold in the future, this facility will be in place. A little code tweak, and TANE compliant assets could in theory be produced sans our time being spent like our minutes are as cheap as raindrops in the Amazon during a thunderstorm. &lt;!--
---&gt;
# The software for this is straight forward, for every migration N3V has made in the SIMPLER, OLDER data structures, they've made a more generalized more flexible analog, usually (ALMOST ALWAYS) using containers and/or texture.txt file expansions--EACH OF WHICH extended the flexibility and capabilities of optional asset behaviors. &lt;!--
---&gt;
# Most of these can be defaulted by Larry as they do and have done for over a decade in their run time (read-in) code now. &lt;!--
---&gt;
## Since this is a pipeline translation, one approach would be to write filters, say five or six a day, old format to new (You know and I know they'll steal code from existing source files, so five a day isn't going to take very much of a chunk out of their schedules.), and run those against this DB until you've nothing left to convert. &lt;!--
---&gt;
### Filters for those unfamiliar with the concept are short programs using standard I/O facilities which can be 'piped' input to the previous output, and so on in a chain. 
### Filters have been at the heart of Unix, sysix, linux, C, and even DOS and Window since the IBM PC debut stabilized the home computer market and overnight practically killed off most the operating systems competing with MSDOS (and eventually Windoze).
### Since you can chain them, you can also batch them, so bundle a set inside a batch file, selecting apropos sequences of filters to process this KIND of asset or that.  
## Converted files are promoted with another KUID2 bump up and passed onto Moe, lucky bossy loud, Moe! &lt;!--
---&gt;
### One key to this is Moe continues the current vetting of assets to V2.9, whereas in this schema, the current DLS's clone )(SHEMP) would be able to resume accepting upgrades to assets by their own content creators to versions v2.6-v2.8; he passes them onto Curly, and an intermediate KUID (v2.0--V2.8) can resume being entered into the system. Thus partially updated assets can be pulled from our CMs and be fed to the rest of the community. Curly will need to read &amp; run an CMP/TrainzUtil extract to vett for TRS2006-TC3 errors.
### Another asset upgrade schema in this thinking is a two way automatic data flow. LARRY requests an asset from his source Curly, but the asset Curly has, has a (potentially insoluable) problem (needing human intervention); meanwhile N3V sets it up so people volunteer and sign up and those accepting get a small add-on utility or patch from N3V which allows N3V to query for a locally modified kuid/asset. Curly initiates this process for &lt;KUID whatever&gt; when our volunteer's CM logs into the site and finds 3-5 users with the asset 'Locally Repaired' (and faultless!). 
### The system reads three to five such from it's community partners via the tweaked TrainzUtil or whatnot program and compares the 3-5 excluding text babble lines to find three that are matches in the important data definition fields and subfolders. They don't even have to match in username tags--obsolescent tags are trimmed, Photos excluded, as are descriptions, licensing, and the other verbose text tags in the TrainzBaseSpec. A binary comparison finds three matches from community donors, and the asset is replace by the winner under the original name and description, licenses, company, et. al. In the event there is a disagreement (say a texture.txt file on one has an AlphaMask= set to a different state, the program would refer these 'fixed assets' to a human for selection of the best. &lt;!--
---&gt;
# '''''Folks my brain is fried tonight''''', so this is the draft promised, albeit unfinished and lacking polish. You should get the gist by now. I'll see if I can finish this by tomorrow afternoon. N3V's in their weekend schedule so a day more won't slow anything down. // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 06:30, 5 April 2014 (UTC) &lt;!--
---&gt;
## When Larry's done with basic assets, the only thing left will be things he can't convert, so the humans will go back to write more filters. '''''Very futuristic''', eh... Men working for the computer taskmaster!'' &lt;G&gt; &lt;!--
---&gt;
# At some point though, the computer will be taken to task by the human slaves and told to start requesting routes from Shemp by starting with scenarios, then sessions, and working on dependent routes.  &lt;!--
---&gt;
## Assets all accounted for, get passed to Moe as happy faces. &lt;!--
---&gt;
## Assets with errors get sent to CURLY! (He was feeling left out of the sessions and routes biz) &lt;!--
---&gt;
## Assets with missing dependencies make Larry Sad. He holds onto those, and from time to time checks against the input stream to see if there's news of a missing asset. &lt;!--
---&gt;

==MOE ==


==Costs==
Now for the price of a few url pages, and a few hard drives, this should be feasible using N3V's servers alone. The general scheme is to divide, conquer, and quarantine. Then update and userfy working content to new standards with apropos kuid advancements.

Some 'asset validation' software will need to be customized by Windwalkr and company, but that should be mostly extracts from prior Trainz released make file resources (source code), and they'll have to work out piping data from server to server (I/O). 

Designate Curly to get Content with bad content (errors). 
Designate MOE to get all vetted and approved ERROR FREE content without missing dependencies

==End==

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is about OpenMP, a language extension to C (and C++) that allows for easy parallel programming. To understand what OpenMP makes possible, it is first important to know what parallel programming is and what it isn't.

''[[:w:en:Parallel computing|Parallel programming]]'' means writing software that operates on several compute devices at the same time. For the purpose of this book, a &quot;compute device&quot; is primarily a processor (CPU) or a processor core within a multicore CPU, which is the focus of OpenMP 3. In other settings, a compute device may mean a full-blown computer within a cluster of computers, or a different type of device such as a graphic processing unit (GPU). An extension of OpenMP to cluster computing has been devised by Intel, and OpenMP 4 adds supports for executing code on non-CPU devices, but these are outside the scope of this book.

Parallel programming is mainly done to speed up computations that have to be fast. Ideally, if you have ''n'' compute devices (cores) to run a program, you'd want the program to be ''n'' times as fast as when it runs on a single device. This ideal situation never occurs in practice because the compute devices need to communicate with each other, sending and waiting for messages such as &quot;give me the result of your computation&quot;. Still, parallel programming can speed up many applications.

Parallel programming should be distinguished from ''[[:w:en:Concurrent computing|concurrent programming]]'', which means breaking down a program into processes that conceptually run at the same time. There is considerable overlap between parallel and concurrent programs: both involve decomposing a task into distinct subtasks that can be executed separately, and concurrent programs can benefit from having their tasks run on multiple compute devices in parallel. However, full concurrent programming is a different art from that of parallel programming in that usually, different types of communication occur between concurrent tasks than between parallel tasks.
&lt;!-- example of concurrent programming needed --&gt;

OpenMP adds support for parallel programming to C in a very clean way. Unlike thread libraries, little change is needed to existing programs to have them run on multiple processors in parallel. In fact, the basic constructs of OpenMP are so non-intrusive that programs using them but compiled by a compiler that doesn't support OpenMP will still work (although sequentially, of course). To see what that means, consider the following C function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void broadcast_sin(double *a, size_t n)
{
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        a[i] = sin(a[i]);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This function &quot;broadcasts&quot; the sine function over an array, storing its results back into that same array. When OpenMP is enabled in the compiler, it will in fact do so using multiple threads, but without OpenMP, it will still function and produce the exact same effect.

[[Image:Fork join.svg|thumb|right|400px|Illustration of the fork–join model: the program splits (&quot;forks&quot;) into sections that are executed in parallel and join into a sequential section when done. This occurs multiple times over the lifetime of the program.]]
OpenMP programs work according to a so-called [[:w:en:Fork–join model|fork–join model]], illustrated on the right. The OpenMP runtime maintains a thread pool, and every time a parallel section is encountered, it distributes work over the threads in the pool. When all threads are done, sequential execution is resumed.</text>

      <comment>/* A parallel way of summing */ dot product exercise</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Summing floating point numbers==
For our first parallel program, we turn to an age-old problem: summing an array of floating point numbers. The basic algorithm to solve this problem is so simple that it allows us to focus on OpenMP features rather than algorithmic details, but we'll see in a bit that the problem is actually less trivial than it appears at first.

Without further ado, here's a sequential algorithm to sum a list of floating point numbers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;  // for size_t

float sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    float total;
    size_t i;

    for (i = 0, total = 0.; i &lt; N; i++) {
        total += a[i];
    }
    return total;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

As far as algorithms go, this one is as simple as it gets. Put the definition above in a file &lt;code&gt;isum.c&lt;/code&gt; (iterative sum).

:If you have experience dealing with floating point numbers, you might be tempted to make &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; for added precision. Don't do that just yet, as we'll solve the precision issue in a different way in a bit.

To test our algorithm, we need a driver program, which we'll put in a file &lt;code&gt;main.c&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

float sum(const float *, size_t);

#define N 1000000  // we'll sum this many numbers

int main()
{
    float *a = malloc(N * sizeof(float));
    if (a == NULL) {
        perror(&quot;malloc&quot;);
        return 1;
    }

    // fill the array a
    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        a[i] = .000001;
    }

    printf(&quot;%f\n&quot;, sum(a, N));
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

And finally we need some way to build this program. On Linux/Unix/OS X, the following &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; should do the job. It assumes you're using GCC.

&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
# C99 extensions are not necessary for OpenMP, but very convenient
CFLAGS = -fopenmp -Wall -std=c99
LDFLAGS = -fopenmp

OBJS = main.o isum.o

# when copy-pasting the following, be aware that the indent must be a tab, not spaces
sum: $(OBJS)
        $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o sum $(OBJS)
&lt;/source&gt;

Now compile the program with &lt;code&gt;make sum&lt;/code&gt;, run it and see how fast it is with a tool such as &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt;. If it's too fast to measure, consider changing &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; to a larger number, or run &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; in a loop instead of just once.

===A parallel way of summing===
We had to go through a bit of setup, but now we're ready to make a parallel sum algorithm for floating point numbers. Here it is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;  // for size_t

float sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    float total = 0.;

    #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:total)
    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        total += a[i];
    }
    return total;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;#pragma omp parallel for&lt;/code&gt; turns the loop into a ''parallel loop''. If you have two cores, OpenMP will (probably) use two threads that each run half of the loop. The &lt;code&gt;reduction(+:total)&lt;/code&gt; declares that we're [[:w:en:Fold (higher-order function)|reducing]] the input array by summing into the variable &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt;, so after the partial loops are done, their results must be summed into this variable.

Put this in &lt;code&gt;isum.c&lt;/code&gt; and recompile. Now run the program. Do you get the same output as before?

:''Exercise'': run the program with various settings for the environment variable &lt;code&gt;OMP_NUM_THREADS&lt;/code&gt;, which controls the size of the thread pool that OpenMP uses. Try 1, 2, 4 and 8. Do you see the same results for each setting? Now try absurdly large number of threads, e.g. 16000. How does this affect performance?

:''Exercise'': the [[:w:en:Dot product|dot product]] of two vectors is the sum of products of their respective entries, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i&lt;/math&gt;. Adapt the &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; function to a &lt;code&gt;dot&lt;/code&gt; function for computing dot products in parallel.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Setting up your compiler==

To do any useful OpenMP programming, you will need a compiler that supports it.

* The [http://gcc.gnu.org/ GNU C Compiler] (GCC) has OpenMP 3.1 support since version 4.7. This compiler comes with practically any Linux system; for instance, on Ubuntu you can install it (and a set of related tools) with &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install build-essential&lt;/code&gt;. To find out the version of GCC that you have installed, issue &lt;code&gt;gcc --version&lt;/code&gt; on the command line.
* The Intel C Compiler supports OpenMP.
* The Clang compiler, [https://trac.macports.org/wiki/UsingTheRightCompiler shipped with Apple's Xcode], does not support OpenMP as of April 2014, but an [http://clang-omp.github.io/ experimental version by Intel] does.
* Microsoft Visual C++ apparently has limited support for OpenMP, depending on the version.
* The LLVM-GCC compiler, shipped with older versions of Apple's Xcode, does not support OpenMP.

The [http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-compilers/ OpenMP website] has a more complete list of compilers with OpenMP support.

Apart from a compiler, we'll also be using the &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; tool in this book. You can do without if you want to use a different build system.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AMD Opteron Six Cores.jpg|thumb|right|A six-core AMD processor. OpenMP programs can run on all six cores simultaneously.]]
Welcome to the Wikibook ''Parallel Programming with OpenMP''! This short book serves as a tutorial for the [[:w:en:OpenMP|OpenMP]] framework for parallel programming, using the C programming language. It discusses how to easily create parallel programs in C, or add parallel constructs to existing sequential code to make it run faster on multiprocessor and multicore machines.

* This book assumes you are already familiar with either C or C++. While the examples are in C, OpenMP works very similarly in C++ and the techniques discussed usually carry over to C++ with few modifications. We won't discuss OpenMP support in Fortran.
* The examples in this book are mostly numerical algorithms, but it is not too heavy on the math. OpenMP is popular in the scientific computing world, but it can just as easily be employed in games, server programs, or any other program that has to do a lot of computation.
* The emphasis in this book is on the OpenMP 3 standard and programming for multicore CPUs. While OpenMP 4 adds interesting new features including support for vector instructions, GPUs and accelerators, OpenMP 3 is better supported by current C and C++ compilers.

&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;font size=3&gt;Tajikistan was a region of the former Soviet Union which became independent in 1991. Meter stamps with former Soviet Union markings (“CCCP”, hammer and sickle logo, etc) continued to be used after independence. Although it is probable meter stamps inscribed Tadzhikistan are in use, examples are not known to us.

      <comment>speed it up (forgot the pragma omp single)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If you followed along with the [[../Reductions|previous chapter]] and did the exercises, you'll have discovered that the sum function we developed was quite unstable. (To be fair, we set up the data to show the instability.) In fact, the naive way of summing has &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; round-off error: the error is proportional to the number of elements we sum. We can fix this by changing the summation algorithm. There are three candidates for a stable sum algorithm:

* Sort the number from small to large, then sum them as before. Problem: this changes the complexity of the problem from linear to &lt;math&gt;O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt;.
* Use [[:w:en:Kahan summation algorithm|Kahan's algorithm]]. While this algorithm takes linear time and is very stable, it is quite slow in practice and harder to parallelize then our third alternative, which is
* [[:w:en:Divide and conquer algorithms|divide-and-conquer]] recursion. The round-off error for such an algorithm is &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. proportional to the logarithm of the number of elements.

The basic divide and conquer summation is very easy to express in C:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
float sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    // base cases
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    else if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    // recursive case
    size_t half = n / 2;
    return sum(a, half) + sum(a + half, n - half);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If you use this definition of &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; in the program we developed for the previous chapter, you'll see that it produces exactly the expected result. But this algorithm doesn't have a loop, so how do we make a parallel version using OpenMP?

We'll use the tasks construct in OpenMP, treating the problem as task-parallel instead of data parallel. In a first version, the task-recursive version of &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; looks like

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
float sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    // base cases
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    else if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    // recursive case
    size_t half = n / 2;
    float x, y;

    #pragma omp parallel
    #pragma omp single nowait
    {
        #pragma omp task shared(x)
        x = sum(a, half);
        #pragma omp task shared(x)
        y = sum(a + half, n - half);
        #pragma omp taskwait
        x += y;
    }
    return x;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

We introduced two tasks, each of which sets a variable that is declared &lt;code&gt;shared&lt;/code&gt; with the other task. If we did not declare the variables shared, each task would set its own local variable, then throw away the results. We then wait for the tasks to complete with &lt;code&gt;#pragma omp taskwait&lt;/code&gt; and combine the recursive results.

You may be surprised by the &lt;code&gt;#pragma omp parallel&lt;/code&gt; followed immediately by &lt;code&gt;#pragma omp single nowait&lt;/code&gt;. The thing is that the first pragma causes all of the threads in the pool to execute the next block of code. The &lt;code&gt;single&lt;/code&gt; directive causes all threads but one (usually the first to encounter the block) to not execute it, while the &lt;code&gt;nowait&lt;/code&gt; turns off the barrier on the single; there's already a barrier on the enclosing &lt;code&gt;parallel&lt;/code&gt; region, to which the other threads will rush.

Unfortunately, if you actually try to run this code, you'll find that it's still not extremely fast. The reason is that the tasks are much too fine-grained: near the bottom of the recursion tree, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{n}{2}&lt;/math&gt; invocations are splitting two-element arrays into subtasks that process one element each. We can solve this problem by introducing, apart from the base and recursive cases, an &quot;intermediate case&quot; for the recursion which is recursive, but does not involve setting up parallel tasks: if the recursion hits a prespecified cutoff, it will no longer try to set up tasks for the OpenMP thread pool, but will just do the recursive sum itself.

:''Exercise'': introduce the additional case in the recursion and measure how fast the program is. Don't peek ahead to the next program, because it contains the solution to this exercise.

Now we effectively have two recursions rolled into one: one with a parallel recursive case, and a serial one. We can disentangle the two to get better performance, by doing less checks at each level. We also separate the parallel setup code to a driver function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;

#define CUTOFF 100  // arbitrary

static float parallel_sum(const float *, size_t);
static float serial_sum(const float *, size_t);

float sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    float r;

    #pragma omp parallel
    #pragma omp single nowait
    r = parallel_sum(a, n);
    return r;
}

static float parallel_sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    // base case
    if (n &lt;= CUTOFF) {
        return serial_sum(a, n);
    }

    // recursive case
    float x, y;
    size_t half = n / 2;

    #pragma omp task shared(x)
    x = parallel_sum(a, half);
    #pragma omp task shared(y)
    y = parallel_sum(a + half, n - half);
    #pragma omp taskwait
    x += y;

    return x;
}

static float serial_sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    // base cases
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0.;
    }
    else if (n == 1) {
        return a[0];
    }

    // recursive case
    size_t half = n / 2;
    return serial_sum(a, half) + serial_sum(a + half, n - half);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This technique works better when the code inside the parallel tasks spends more time computing and less time doing memory accesses, because those may need to be synchronized between processors.

There's one big downside to the above code: it has an ugly magic constant called &lt;code&gt;CUTOFF&lt;/code&gt; that we need to tune by hand. We can prevent this by stopping the parallel recursion not at a fixed cutoff, but when we're using all threads. So, we ask OpenMP how many threads it has in the driver, and split the parallel work until we find we're running code serially.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;omp.h&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;

static float parallel_sum(const float *, size_t, int);
static float serial_sum(const float *, size_t);

float sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    float r;
    int n_threads = omp_get_num_threads();

    #pragma omp parallel
    #pragma omp single nowait
    r = parallel_sum(a, n, n_threads);
    return r;
}

static float parallel_sum(const float *a, size_t n, int n_threads)
{
    // base case
    if (n_threads &lt;= 1) {
        return serial_sum(a, n);
    }

    // recursive case
    float x, y;
    int half_threads = n_threads / 2;
    size_t half = n / 2;

    #pragma omp task shared(x)
    x = parallel_sum(a, half, half_threads);
    #pragma omp task shared(y)
    y = parallel_sum(a + half, n - half, n_threads - half_threads);
    #pragma omp taskwait
    x += y;

    return x;
}

static float serial_sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    // as before
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This way, we lose the ability to compile the exact same code without OpenMP support, but fortunately the OpenMP standard gives us the preprocessor macro &lt;code&gt;_OPENMP&lt;/code&gt;, so with two small changes...

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#ifdef _OPENMP
#include &lt;omp.h&gt;
#endif
&lt;/source&gt;

and

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#ifdef _OPENMP
int n_threads = omp_get_num_threads();
#else
int n_threads = 1;
#endif
&lt;/source&gt;

our code no longer depends on OpenMP.</text>

[[Image:Locrio de Pollo (Dominicano).jpg|right|200px]]
A Locrio is a common Dominican dish, similar to paella. Like Paella, there are many variations. The main point is to have a little tomato sauce/paste for coloring, and some caramelized sugar. In that way it is similar to the Trinidadian Pilau.

Like Paella, the rice at the bottom should be toasted or browned, but not burnt. This browned rice is called &quot;concon&quot;. You're not considered a good cook until you can do this. 

== Ingredients ==
* 4 lbs (1.8kg) [[Cookbook:Chicken|Chicken]] cut up, alternatively one can use guineafowl, rabbit, Dominican salami, pork chops, or other meat, cut in pieces. 
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|C]] Olives (pitted, preferably) or Capers.
* ¼ C Oil for frying
* 2 Tbsp Oil, used later when rice is almost done
* 1 Tbsp sugar
===Liquids and rice===
* 4 C [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 5¼ C Chicken [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]] or water
* ¼ C tomato paste (mix it in the water/stock until smooth)
===The Sofrito===
* ½ C finely diced [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* ½ C finely diced [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 2 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], chopped.
===Seasonings===
* 1 tsp salt or to taste
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
* ½ tsp Oregano (if desired)
* 1 tsp ground black pepper

== Procedure ==
This recipe is in three steps: first caramelize the sugar, fry the meat / vegetables, then cook it with the rice. 

===Caramelizing the sugar===
#Put the oil in the pot, and heat on high heat
#Put in the tablespoon of sugar.
#It will melt, then turn brown.

Note: pay close attention and don't let the sugar burn. Adding the chicken brings the temperature down. Also don't use plastic utensils to stir the sugar, since it will be at around 400F (200C), which will melt plastic. Use wooden or metal utensils, but the sugar may stick to it.
 
===Frying the meat===
#Add the meat (chicken, guineafowl, rabbit, etc.) and let it brown on both sides.
#Remove the meat
#Fry the garlic, onions, and celery

===Cooking rice===
#Add rice, meat, and all liquid
#Add the salt, pepper, and thyme
#Add olives or capers. 
#Although it is not authentic, you can add 1 tsp Ajinomoto (味の素). Some Dominicans add &quot;Sazón Completo&quot; which has MSG in it anyways. 
#Check the seasoning. If the salt is good, add an extra ½ tsp of salt. This is because the rice will absorb some of the salt, and it will come out a bit flat in the end. 
#On high heat, bring to a boil, and let it boil, stirring occasionally until the water is absorbed. (Note: the high heat is needed to bring the rice temperature up so that it cooks. If you lower the flame at this point, the rice might not cook all the way). 
#Cover, lower the heat, and let it cook 15 minutes.
#Uncover, sprinkle 2 Tbsp oil on top, and stir so that the uncooked rice on top goes to the bottom
#Give another 5 minutes.
#If rice still not cooked, give it another stir and another 5 minutes.
#Turn heat on high for a couple of minutes to brown (toast) the rice on bottom (sometimes it does this by itself during the main cooking so you don't have to do this. Experience will tell. 
#Serve.

== Notes ==
#If the rice doesn't cook, but all the water was absorbed, you can separate the rice from the meat, and put it in a bowl, and give it 5 minutes on high in the microwave. Often there wasn't enough heat to cook the rice.
#It is also helpful to put a sheet or two of aluminium foil over the pot before putting the lid on. That helps seal the lid and keep the heat / steam from escaping. Rice often comes out better. 
#Dominicans tend to cook the rice on the dry side: rice will be cooked through, but not too watery. The ratio should be 4 C rice to 5½ C liquid (some locrio recipes ask for 7 or 8 cups of liquid, which makes things mushy). If you have tomato sauce instead of tomato paste, you can use that also, as long as the ratios are the same (e.g. 1 C tomato sauce to 4½ C water/stock; which makes a total of 5½ C liquid). 
#Some people deep fry the meat separately, remove the excess oil, and then caramelize the sugar.
#The ingredients of the sofrito vary, and can be made in advance. Some add cilantro, bell peppers, culantro (''Eryngium foetidum'' a.k.a. recao, culantro coyote, etc.) and other aromatics to it.
#Other vegetables such as 1 cup of cubed auyama (squash) sometimes are added with the rice.
#Almost any meat can be used. Pork chops (smoked), cubed Dominican Salami, cubed ham or spam, Arrenque (smoked dried herring, pre-soaked in warm water to remove some salt, but cut the amount of salt you use), canned sardines, Vienna Sausages, shellfish (mariscos) and if in desperation, ground beef, meatballs, hot dogs, etc. can also be used. One can use 2 lbs of chicken gizzards also, but gizzards need to be boiled (or pressure cooked) until tender first. 
#Some people use Sazón Completo for the seasoning.
#One can take the skin off the chicken before frying it.
#Instead of chicken stock, some people throw in a bullion cube (sopapilla).

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first postage meters were used in 1952.
* All stamps are inscribed “THAILAND”.
* Essays from 1928 with the country’s former name, “SIAM”, exist.

* The stamps are grouped according to appearance and usage:
:: A – Franks with outer frame line and separate town mark
:: B – Digital stamps with 2D barcode
:: PO – Stamps generated only by special Post Office machines
:: PV – Variable rate stamps generated by self-service vending machines
&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
'''PO3'''. Unidentified local manufacturer (digital), 2008.

:::::::::::::: '''a'''. Value figures without &quot;&lt;font size=3&gt;≋&lt;/font&gt;&quot;











'''NOTE''': Many minor variations of Types PO2 and PO3 can be found. The differences are in the font and font size and also in the image of the elephants. It is probable that Thai Post tweaks the operating system in these machines frequently.

&lt;font size=3&gt;* This island became a semi-independent nation in 2010 upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. Adhesive postage stamps inscribed &quot;SINT MAARTIN&quot; have been issued, but meter stamps have not yet been reported to or seen by us. We assume they do exist.

      <comment>terminology regarding pickling brine</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description of Brine ==
The article says &quot;[p]ickling brine is a moderately strong acid,&quot; but traditional pickling usually starts with a saltwater brine, often with spices added. The acidification is a result of lactic acid produced by the naturally present bacteria. Fresh pack pickling (what one will often see used by large companies) involves the pouring of a hot, spiced vinegar solution over cucumbers, but that isn't the traditional method. It's the salt in the brine that initially prevents microbial growth. Thus, I think this could be reworded to adhere to the typical definition of &quot;pickling.&quot; ([[User:Pcwendland|Pcwendland]] ([[User talk:Pcwendland|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pcwendland|contribs]]) 13:29, 6 April 2014 (UTC))</text>

&lt;br&gt;

* &lt;font size=3&gt;Tristan da Cunha is part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. It has a population of only about 300 permanent inhabitants and so has little need for postage meters. Although it does issue traditional postage stamps - mainly for the philatelic trade - no meter stamp has ever been generated on this South Atlantic island.

* &lt;font size=3&gt;Tanganyika was a British colony until it gained independence in 1961 and merged with Zanzibar in 1964 to form the new country of Tanzania. For many years after independence it’s postal affairs were managed communally with Kenya and Uganda, and it used meter stamps inscribed with all three country names. Stamps inscribed TANZANIA by itself appeared in the 1990s.

* The stamps are grouped according to use:
:: A – Stamps for commercial use
:: PO – Stamps generated by machines in post offices

* For stamps used before independence and for post-independence stamps inscribed KENYA, UGANDA and TANZANIA, see EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY. See also ZANZIBAR for stamps used before the merger into Tanzania.

== Problem ==
Establish Autodesk Vault connection.
== Solution ==
Create WebServiceManager from Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll with credentials parameters.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;
#Connecting dll
Add-Type -Path &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Autodesk\Autodesk Vault 2014 SDK\bin\Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll&quot;
#Retreiving read-only credentials
$cred = New-Object Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServicesTools.UserPasswordCredentials (&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;Vault&quot;, &quot;Administrator&quot;, &quot;&quot;, $true)
#Creating manager
$webSvc = New-Object Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServicesTools.WebServiceManager ($cred)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Discussion ==
WebServiceManager is your gates to the garden of Vaulty API. And IWebServiceCredentials is a key to this gates.&lt;br /&gt;
You can create this key in at lest 16 different ways (A-P) of getting IWebServiceCredentials.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Establishing Vault connection.png|thumb|The ways of establishing connection with Autodesk Vault 2014 API]]
After connection you can get next information about connection:&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;
|-
! Method !! Description
|-
| ReadOnly || Gets if the connection is read only.
|-
| RequiresSignIn || Gets the value telling if a sign in is required before a service can be used.
|-
| RequiresSignOut || Gets the value telling if a sign out should be called when the service goes out of scope.
|-
| SecurityHeader || Gets the security header.
|-
| ServerIdentities || Gets the server identity.
|-
| SupportsSignIn || Gets the value telling if the credentials can sign in.
|-
| SupportsSignOut || Gets the value telling if the credentials can sign out.
|-
| UserName || Gets the username.
|-
| VaultName || Gets the vault name.
|}
Connecting is quite simple operation, but its fundamental for any program that needs connect to Vault server. Here's algorithm, that describes logging with UserPasswordCredentials:&lt;br /&gt;
And here's &quot;cmd edition&quot;, that handles errors and gives more verbose:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;param ($help,$VServer,$VVault,$VUser,$VPass,$VOut)

$WebServicesPath2014=&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Autodesk\Autodesk Vault 2014 SDK\bin\Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll&quot;

if ($help)
{
&quot;Login Vault with read-only connection`n&quot;
&quot;Usage:&quot;
&quot;  Login-VaultServer.ps1 -Vserver &lt;server address&gt; -VVault &lt;vault name&gt; -VUser &lt;username&gt; [-VPass &lt;password&gt;]`n&quot;
&quot;Arguments:&quot;
&quot;  -Vserver		Autodesk Vault server name. In any format: IP, DNS, IP:port, DNS:port.&quot;
&quot;  -VVault		Vault name.&quot;
&quot;  -VUser		Registered user name.&quot;
&quot;  -VPass		Password.&quot;
&quot;`nExample:&quot;
&quot;  powershell .\Export-FileCategories.ps1 -Vserver localhost -VVault Vault -VUser Administrator -VPass pass`n&quot;
exit
}
else{
	if (!$VServer -or !$VVault -or !$VUser){&quot;Invalid arguments. Use 'help' argument for more help&quot;
	exit}
}

try
	{
	&quot;Trying to find Vault 2014 dll&quot;
	Add-Type -Path $WebServicesPath2014 #Vault 2014
	}
Catch
	{
	&quot;No dlls were found. Edit script or contact author.&quot;
	exit
	}	

&quot;Found - executing&quot;
try{
$cred = New-Object Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServicesTools.UserPasswordCredentials ($VServer,$VVault,$VUser,$VPass,$true)
$webSvc = New-Object Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServicesTools.WebServiceManager ($cred)
Write-Output $webSvc
}
Catch
{&quot;Login failed&quot;
exit}&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
And the best way to login - is certainly by using dialogs fromVDF.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;#Connect dll
Add-Type -Path &quot;c:\Program Files (x86)\Autodesk\Autodesk Vault 2014 SDK\bin\Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Forms.dll&quot;
 
#Call login dialog and workflow, get credentials on successfull login 
$g_login=[Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Forms.Library]::Login($null)&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
As a result you'll get login dialog with information, you've entered last time.</text>

As Autodesk Vault SDK help kindly informs, the Vault API is:&lt;br /&gt;
The Web Services API comprised of the Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices DLL.  The DLL enables you to communicate with the server.&lt;br /&gt;
When you’re communicating with server, you can use only that services, that server supports.
In 2014 Vault version there are 3 Vault editions:
* Basic
* Workgroup
* Professional
Here’s diagram that describes the functionality of API’s through them:

[[File:Autodesk Vault 2014 API services.png|thumb|Autodesk Vault 2014 API services]]
Where:
* 2 – full functionality
* 1 – functionality is limited 
* 0 – N/A
I’ve created API Services Catalog in Microsoft Excel Pivot table, that could be useful for navigate through services.&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of things – everything that Vault Client and ADMS can do, even more, because it represents &quot;dogfooding&quot; idea.&lt;br /&gt;
# Include a link to dll in your project.
# Connect to server, using services’ methods.
List of services method, for useful search is placed in API Services’ Methods Catalog, although in Excel Pivot Table.

== Problem ==
Establish Autodesk Vault connection.
== Solution ==
Create WebServiceManager from Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll with credentials parameters.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;
#Connecting dll
Add-Type -Path &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Autodesk\Autodesk Vault 2014 SDK\bin\Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll&quot;
#Retreiving read-only credentials
$cred = New-Object Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServicesTools.UserPasswordCredentials (&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;Vault&quot;, &quot;Administrator&quot;, &quot;&quot;, $true)
#Creating manager
$webSvc = New-Object Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServicesTools.WebServiceManager ($cred)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Discussion ==
WebServiceManager is your gates to the garden of Vaulty API. And IWebServiceCredentials is a key to this gates.&lt;br /&gt;
You can create this key in at lest 16 different ways (A-P) of getting IWebServiceCredentials.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Establishing Vault connection.png|thumb|The ways of establishing connection with Autodesk Vault 2014 API]]
After connection you can get next information about connection:&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;
|-
! Method !! Description
|-
| ReadOnly || Gets if the connection is read only.
|-
| RequiresSignIn || Gets the value telling if a sign in is required before a service can be used.
|-
| RequiresSignOut || Gets the value telling if a sign out should be called when the service goes out of scope.
|-
| SecurityHeader || Gets the security header.
|-
| ServerIdentities || Gets the server identity.
|-
| SupportsSignIn || Gets the value telling if the credentials can sign in.
|-
| SupportsSignOut || Gets the value telling if the credentials can sign out.
|-
| UserName || Gets the username.
|-
| VaultName || Gets the vault name.
|}
Connecting is quite simple operation, but its fundamental for any program that needs connect to Vault server. Here's algorithm, that describes logging with UserPasswordCredentials:&lt;br /&gt;
And here's &quot;cmd edition&quot;, that handles errors and gives more verbose:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;param ($help,$VServer,$VVault,$VUser,$VPass,$VOut)

$WebServicesPath2014=&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Autodesk\Autodesk Vault 2014 SDK\bin\Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll&quot;

if ($help)
{
&quot;Login Vault with read-only connection`n&quot;
&quot;Usage:&quot;
&quot;  Login-VaultServer.ps1 -Vserver &lt;server address&gt; -VVault &lt;vault name&gt; -VUser &lt;username&gt; [-VPass &lt;password&gt;]`n&quot;
&quot;Arguments:&quot;
&quot;  -Vserver		Autodesk Vault server name. In any format: IP, DNS, IP:port, DNS:port.&quot;
&quot;  -VVault		Vault name.&quot;
&quot;  -VUser		Registered user name.&quot;
&quot;  -VPass		Password.&quot;
&quot;`nExample:&quot;
&quot;  powershell .\Export-FileCategories.ps1 -Vserver localhost -VVault Vault -VUser Administrator -VPass pass`n&quot;
exit
}
else{
	if (!$VServer -or !$VVault -or !$VUser){&quot;Invalid arguments. Use 'help' argument for more help&quot;
	exit}
}

try
	{
	&quot;Trying to find Vault 2014 dll&quot;
	Add-Type -Path $WebServicesPath2014 #Vault 2014
	}
Catch
	{
	&quot;No dlls were found. Edit script or contact author.&quot;
	exit
	}	

&quot;Found - executing&quot;
try{
$cred = New-Object Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServicesTools.UserPasswordCredentials ($VServer,$VVault,$VUser,$VPass,$true)
$webSvc = New-Object Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServicesTools.WebServiceManager ($cred)
Write-Output $webSvc
}
Catch
{&quot;Login failed&quot;
exit}&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
And the best way to login - is certainly by using dialogs fromVDF.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;#Connect dll
Add-Type -Path &quot;c:\Program Files (x86)\Autodesk\Autodesk Vault 2014 SDK\bin\Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Forms.dll&quot;
 
#Call login dialog and workflow, get credentials on successfull login 
$g_login=[Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Forms.Library]::Login($null)&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
As a result you'll get a login dialog with the information you entered last time.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Trinidad and Tobago=

* &lt;font size=3&gt; This former British colony obtained its independence in 1962. Meters were first used in 1931 during the colonial years. These franks contained the crown and cipher of the British monarch. Many were used as such without alteration well after independence.
* All franks contain “TRINIDAD &amp; TOBAGO”.
* Currency was changed from Sterling (£sd) to decimal in 1955.
* The stamps are grouped by appearance and function:
:: A – general commercial use franks with upright orientation
:: B – general commercial use franks with horizontal orientation
:: PO – stamps generated by special post office machines

* For specialized information about the meter stamps of Trinidad &amp; Tobago, see ''Trinidad &amp; Tobago Postal Meter Stamps'', by R.G. Wike, Harry Hayes, Batley, W. Yorkshire, England, 1979.

'''Welcome to the [[Euclid's Elements/Euclid's Elements|Euclid's Elements]] wiki-book''', a public partnership of scholarly individuals with a resolute intent to construct and achieve a thorough, accurate, and complete analytic book about the historical disquisition ''Elements.'' We created the book in April 2014, and already have '''0 pages'''. Our goal is to produce 50 pages, so let's all break out the sweat and get to writing. The Euclid's Elements wiki-book is a timeless project, meaning ''anyone'' may edit, expand, or add content to any extent to his or her personal will at any moment of time. Interested individuals in the project should direct themselves to the [[Euclid's Elements/Euclid's Elements/FAQ|FAQ]] to inquire any interrogations about the ''Elements'' treatise itself, the structure of the project, or anything out of curiosity.

''Anyone can copy, edit, or modify text supplied on the Euclid's Elements wiki-book without any cost, as granted and stated under the Wikibooks [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|copyrights]].''

''Please note that the wiki-book supplies information within the extremities of the ''Elements'' and Euclidean geometry.''

&lt;br&gt;

* &lt;font size=3&gt;Turkmenistan was a region of the former Soviet Union and became an independent country in 1991. Post independence meter stamps with old Soviet Union markings (“CCCP”, hammer and sickle logo) are known used, but franks with Soviet inscriptions removed or inscribed with the new country name have not yet been reported. It is probable that such stamps do exist.&lt;/font&gt;

      <comment>I have started the initial creation of page.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Before continuing to learn about the properties of operations you must understand two basic questions:

&lt;u&gt;'''What is the point of operations having properties?'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''→''' Without operations having properties, we would not know their usage. Understanding their usage helps lay the foundation for solving word problems later on.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Why do operations have properties?'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''→''' Operations have properties which define their usage. The usage of operations is the very essence of them, without usage properties are useless (vice versa).
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;With understanding properties we are able to enter the realm of higher-level thinking. 
This is because properties illustrate general cases which allow us to lead to more mathematical generalizations.&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Definitions of Mathematical Properties:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''Addition:'''
# Commutative Property: &lt;math&gt;a + b = b + a&lt;/math&gt;
# Associative Property: &lt;math&gt;(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)&lt;/math&gt;
# Identity Property of zero: &lt;math&gt;0 + a = a (= a + 0)&lt;/math&gt;
# Inverse Property: For every member a, there is - a such that &lt;math&gt;a + (- a) = 0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''Multiplication:'''
# Commutative Property: &lt;math&gt;ab = ba&lt;/math&gt;
# Associative: &lt;math&gt;(ab)c = a(bc)&lt;/math&gt;
# Identity: &lt;math&gt;a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a&lt;/math&gt;
# Inverse Property, for every &lt;math&gt;a \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is &lt;math&gt;(\dfrac{1}{a})&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;), such that a &lt;math&gt;(\dfrac{1}{a}) = 1. &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The general rule for the inverse property of multiplication is if when you multiply two numbers and the product is 1, then what you multiplied must be multiplicative inverses or reciprocals of each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''It is important you remember that connecting addition and multiplication is the:'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''→''' Distributive Rule: &lt;math&gt;a(b + c) = ab + ac.&lt;/math&gt;

Often rules are final factor of what you get as your answer: &lt;br /&gt;
An example of this is shown below: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a \cdot 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;a = a \cdot 1 = a \cdot (1 + 0) \cdot a \cdot 1 + a \cdot 0.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Now subtract a from both sides to get &lt;math&gt;0 = 0 + a \cdot 0 = a \cdot 0.&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <comment>Asked a question regarding why 'Properties of Operations' and ''Why Do Operations Have Properties?' are separate pages.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I am rather confused to as why 'Properties of Operations' and 'Why Do Operations Have Properties?' are two separate pages... 'Why Do Operations Have Properties?' alone barely takes up a page. I think it would be better to have the two together than apart.

:'''''Aces Up''' is also another name for '''Easthaven''', a variant of [[Klondike (solitaire)#Variations|Klondike]].''

'''Aces Up''' (also known as '''Idiot's Delight''', '''Once in a Lifetime''', '''Ace of the Pile''', '''Rocket to the Top''', '''Firing Squad''', '''Loser Solitaire''', '''Aces High''', and '''Drivel''') is a [[solitaire]] [[card game]] using a deck of 52 playing cards. One advantage of this game is its minimal use of space: one can even play it on an area as small as an [[encyclopedia]] volume cover.

== Rules ==
Note: Aces are high.

1. Deal four cards in a row face up.

2. If there are two or more cards of the same suit, discard all but the highest-ranked card of that suit.

3. Repeat step 2 until there are no more pairs of cards with the same suit.

4. Whenever there are any empty spaces, you may choose the top card of another pile to be put into the empty space. After you do this, go to Step 2.

5. When there are no more cards to move or remove, deal out the next four cards from the deck face-up onto each pile. 

6. Repeat Step 2, using only the visible, or top, cards on each of the four piles.

7. When the last four cards have been dealt out and any moves made, the game is over. The fewer cards left in the tableau, the better. To win is to have only the four aces left.

When the game ends, the number of discarded cards is your score. The maximum score (and thus the score necessary to win) is 48, which means all cards have been discarded except for the four aces, thus the name of the game.

== Variations ==
A much more challenging variation on '''Aces Up''' allows only the aces to be moved onto an empty pile. This makes game play much more restrictive and consequently the game can only be completed roughly once in every 270 games.&lt;ref&gt;An Aces Up variant playing program http://atchoo.org/src/aces_up.tar.gz&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tournament rules (play-tested) ==
1.  Prizes are determined by the organizer.  Some suggestions are a prize for Aces Up, a prize for winning the tournament, a 2nd place prize, etc.

2.  Score is determined by how many cards remain after playing a hand of Aces Up.  For example, 0 for Aces Up, 1 for 1 remaining card other than the aces, 2 for 2 remaining cards other than the aces, etc.

3.  Low score advances to the next round.  The number of people advancing is cut off by the tournament director based on the number of entries into the tournament.

4.  The normal rules for Aces Up apply for playing a hand.

5.  A round consists of playing five hands.  The lowest score of the five hands is retained for the score for that round.  All five hands do not have to be played out. For example, if someone gets Aces Up on their first hand of the round then the score for the round is zero, the player advances to the next round, and the remaining four hands for that round do not need to be played.

6.  No one can advance with a score greater than 5.  This number can be adjusted at the tournament director's discretion before the tournament begins.

&lt;/div&gt;

== Description ==
Regular tables are containers to store data for a shorter or longer time periode and to offer those data to a lot of processes. In contrast, sometimes there is the requirement to handle data for a short time and only for local purposes. This is accomplished by the provision of TEMPORARY TABLES. They are subject to the SQL syntax in the same way as regular tables.

The common characteristic of all temporary tables is, that every session (connection) gets its '''own incarnation''' of the temporary table without any side effect to other sessions. This leads to the situation that every session sees only those data, which it has inserted previously. The data is '''not shared''' between different sessions, even if they use the same table name at the same time. Every session works on a different incarnation. A second common characteristic is that with the termination of the session all data of the temporary table is thrown away automatically. An explicit DELETE or DROP TABLE is not necessary.

The concept of temporary tables is similar to the concept of arrays of records within programming languages. The advantage over arrays is the availability of all DML statements known in SQL, eg.: if you need some intermediate data, you can retrieve it from a regular table and store it in a temporary table with one single Insert+Subselect command. The advantage over regular tables is that the overhead of logging and locking might be saved.

There are three slightly different types of temporary tables:
:* Global temporary tables
:* Local temporary tables
:* Declared local temporary tables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
CREATE  GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; (...) [ ON COMMIT { PRESERVE | DELETE } ROWS ];
CREATE  LOCAL  TEMPORARY TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; (...) [ ON COMMIT { PRESERVE | DELETE } ROWS ];
DECLARE LOCAL  TEMPORARY TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; (...) [ ON COMMIT { PRESERVE | DELETE } ROWS ];
&lt;/source&gt;

If the phrase 'ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS' is used, the data is automatically thrown away with every COMMIT command, else at the end of the session (or with a DELETE command).

== Global Temporary Tables (GTT) ==
If a GTT is created, this '''definition''' keeps alive beyond the end of the defining session. Even other session within this schema sees the definition. Therefore the GTT can be defined simultaneous with regular tables and applications don't need to create GTTs by itself (but they can do it). Up to this point GTTs don't differ from regular tables. The distinction relates to the '''data'''. As with all temporary tables every session gets its own incarnation of the table and cannot access data from any other session. If the session terminates, all data from the table is thrown away automatically.

A typical use case is an application which needs a temporary protocoll about its own activities like successful actions, exceptions, ... to perform recovery activities later on. This information is not of interest for other sessions. Moreover it may be deleted at the end of a transaction or at the end of the session.

Another use case is an application which want to store an intermediate result set and iterate about its single rows to performs actions depending on the columns values.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- The table may be defined by a different session long time before.
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE temp1 (
  ts       TIMESTAMP,
  action   CHAR(100),
  state    CHAR(50)
)
ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS;
--
-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO temp1 VALUES (current_timestamp, 'node-1-request sended.', 'OK');
INSERT INTO temp1 VALUES (current_timestamp, 'node-2-request sended.', 'OK');
INSERT INTO temp1 VALUES (current_timestamp, 'node-1-answer received.', 'Failed');
INSERT INTO temp1 VALUES (current_timestamp, 'node-2-answer received.', 'OK');
SELECT count(*) FROM temp1 WHERE state = 'OK';
...
COMMIT; 
SELECT count(*) FROM temp1; -- In this example all rows should have survived the COMMIT command
-- After a disconnect from the database and establishing of a new session the table exists and is empty.
&lt;/source&gt;

== Local Temporary Tables (LTT) ==
The '''definition''' of a LTT will never survive the duration of a session. The same applies to its '''data''', which accords to the behaviour of all temporary tables. In consequence every session must define its own LTT before it can store anything into it. Multiple sessions can use the same table name simultaneously without affecting each other, which - again - accords to the behaviour of all temporary tables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- The table must be defined by the same session (connection) which stores data into it.
CREATE LOCAL TEMPORARY TABLE temp2 (
  ts       TIMESTAMP,
  action   CHAR(100),
  state    CHAR(50)
)
ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS;
-- After a disconnect from the database and establishing of a new session the table will not exist.
&lt;/source&gt;

The SQL-standard distinguishs between SQL-sessions and modules within SQL-sessions. He postulates that LTTs are visible only within that module, which has actually created the table. The tables are not shared between different modules of the same SQL-session. But the LTTs definition occures in the information schema of the DBMS.

== Declared Local Temporary Tables (DLTT) ==
The main concept of DLTT is very similar to that of LTT. The difference is that in opposite to the definition of a LTT the definition of a DLTT will not occure in the information schema of the DBMS. It is known only by the module where it is defined. You can imagine a DLTT as some kind of a module-local variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- The declaration must be defined by the same module which stores data into the table.
DECLARE LOCAL TEMPORARY TABLE temp3 (
  ts       TIMESTAMP,
  action   CHAR(100),
  state    CHAR(50)
)
ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS;
-- After a disconnect from the module and entering the module again the declaration will not exist.
&lt;/source&gt;

== Implementation Hints ==

&lt;u&gt;MySQL:&lt;/u&gt;
* Omit the key words LOCAL/GLOBAL and the ON COMMIT phrase. Temporary tables are always LOCAL and the ON COMMIT acts always in the sense of PRESERVE ROWS.
* GTT and DLTT are not supported.

&lt;u&gt;Oracle:&lt;/u&gt;
* LTT and DLTT are not supported.</text>

=The Chemistry of Life=
==Chemical Elements and Water==
===State that the most frequently occurring chemical elements in living things are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen.===


===State that a variety of other elements are needed by living organisms, including sulfur, calcium, phosphorus, iron and sodium.===


===State one role for each of the elements mentioned in 3.1.2.===
*Sulfur: Needed for the synthesis of two amino acids.
*Calcium: Acts as a messenger by binding to calmodulin and a few other proteins which regulate transcription and other processes in the cell.
*Phosphorus: Is part of DNA molecules and is also part of the phosphate groups in ATP.
*Iron: Is needed for the synthesis of cytochromes which are proteins used during electron transport for aerobic cell respiration.
*Sodium: When it enters the cytoplasm, it raises the solute concentration which causes water to enter by osmosis.
===Draw and label a diagram showing the structure of water molecules to show their polarity and hydrogen bond formation.===


===Outline the thermal, cohesive and solvent properties of water.===
and
===Explain the relationship between the properties of water and its uses in living organisms as a coolant, medium for metabolic reactions and transport medium.===

Thermal properties:

*large heat capacity:
**Temperature of water tends to remain relatively stable.
**Beneficial for aquatic animals as they use water as a habitat.
**Water can be used as a thermal medium, like blood in humans.

*Boiling and freezing points.
**High boiling and freezing point.
**Water is less dense in the solid phase than in the liquid phase.
**Ice on the surface of water also insulates the liquid water underneath, enabling survival of organisms in colder climates.

*Cooling effect of evaporation.
**Water can evaporate at temperature below boiling point.
**This is an endothermic physical change, and therefore has a cooling effect.

Cohesive properties:

*Water has hydrogen bonding, giving its molecules cohesion.
**Plants can transport water to their upper foliage because of this property.

Solvent properties:
*Because of the polarity of water molecules, many substance can dissolve in it.
**Organisms can use water as a medium for metabolic reactions.


==Carbohydrates, lipids and proteins==
===Distinguish between organic and inorganic compounds.===
*Organic compounds are compounds that contain carbon.
**Exceptions include carbon dioxide, carbonates and hydrogen carbonates.
*Inorganic compounds don’t contain carbon.


===Identify amino acids, glucose, ribose and fatty acids from diagrams showing their structure.===
===List three examples each of monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides.===

‘’’Monosaccharides:’’’
*Glucose
*Galactose
*Fructose

‘’’Disaccharides’’’
*Maltose
*Lactose
*Sucrose

‘’’Polysaccharides’’’
*Starch
*Glycogen
*Cellulose


===State one function of glucose, lactose and glycogen in animals, and of fructose, sucrose and cellulose in plants.===

‘’’Animals’’’

|}


===Outline the role of condensation and hydrolysis in the relationships between monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides; between fatty acids, glycerol and triglycerides; and between amino acids and polypeptides.===


===State three functions of lipids.===
*Energy storage in the form of fat in humans and oil in plants.
*Heat insulation as fat under the skin reduces heat loss.
*Allow buoyancy as they are less dense than water and so animals can float in water. 
===Compare the use of carbohydrates and lipids in energy storage.===

|-
| '''Feature''' || '''Carbohydrates''' || '''Lipids'''
|-
| '''Energy storage''' || Short term stores || Long term stores

|-
| '''Speed of digestion''' || Very rapid, so carbs are better for energy needed quickly || Slow
|-
| '''Energy density''' || Low energy per gram || Higher energy per gram, makes lipids a lighter energy source
|}


==DNA structure==
===Outline DNA nucleotide structure in terms of sugar (deoxyribose), base and phosphate.===
Made of:
*deoxyribose
*a nitrogenous base (which can be either adenine, guanine, cytosine or thymine)
*a phosphate group.
[image]
===State the names of the four bases in DNA.===
Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine and Thymine.
===Outline how DNA nucleotides are linked together by covalent bonds into a single strand.===
Below is a diagram showing how nucleotides are linked to one another to form a strand. A covalent bond forms between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate group of another nucleotide.
[image]
===Explain how a DNA double helix is formed using complementary base pairing and hydrogen bonds.===
*DNA is made up of two nucleotide strands.
*The nucleotides are connected together by covalent bonds within each strand.
*The sugar of one nucleotide forms a covalent bond with the phosphate group of another.
*The two strands themselves are connected by hydrogen bonds.
*The hydrogen bonds are found between the bases of the two strands of nucleotides.
*Adenine forms hydrogen bonds with thymine whereas guanine forms hydrogen bonds with cytosine (this is called complementary base pairing)
*Below is a diagram showing the molecular structure and bonds within DNA.
[image]


===Draw and label a simple diagram of the molecular structure of DNA.===


==DNA replication==
===Explain DNA replication in terms of unwinding the double helix and separation of the strands by helicase, followed by formation of the new complementary strands by DNA polymerase.===

*DNA replication is semiconservative: both of the DNA molecules produced are formed from an old strand and a new one
#Unwinding of the DNA double helix and separating them by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the bases.
##This is done by the enzyme helicase.
##Each separated strand now is a template for the new strands.
#Free nucleotides around the replication fork bond to the template strands.
##The free nucleotides form hydrogen bonds with their complementary base pairs on the template strand.
##Adenine will pair up with thymine and guanine will pair up with cytosine.
##DNA polymerase is the enzyme used for DNA polymerization.
#The new DNA strands then rewind to form a double helix. The replication process has produced a new DNA molecule which is identical to the initial one.


===Explain the significance of complementary base pairing in the conservation of the base sequence of DNA.===
*Complementary base pairing is very important in the conservation of the base sequence of DNA.
*Adenine always pairs up with thymine and guanine always pairs up with cytosine.
*DNA replication is semiconservative (see above); this complementary base pairing allows the two DNA molecules to be identical to each other as they have the same base sequence.
*New strands formed are complementary to their template strands but also identical to the other template.


===State that DNA replication is semi-conservative.===


==Transcription and translation==
===Compare the structure of RNA and DNA.===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| '''Feature''' || '''DNA''' || '''RNA'''
|-
| '''Sugar in nucleotide''' || Deoxyribose || Ribose
|-
| '''Nucleotides''' || Adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine || Guanine, adenine, uracil, cytosine
|-
| '''Shape''' || Double stranded helix || Single strand
|}


===Outline DNA transcription in terms of the formation of an RNA strand complementary to the DNA strand by RNA polymerase.===
*DNA transcription is the formation of an RNA strand which is complementary to the DNA strand.
#Uncoiling of the DNA double helix.
#Free RNA nucleotides start to form an RNA strand by using one of the DNA strands as a template.
##Uses complementary base pairing; however, in the RNA chain the base thymine is replaced by uracil.
##RNA polymerase is the enzyme involved in the RNA polymerization and the uncoiling of the DNA double helix.
##RNA strand then elongates and then separates from the DNA template.
##DNA strands then reform a double helix.
#Strand of RNA formed is called messenger RNA (mRNA).


===Describe the genetic code in terms of codons composed of triplets of bases.===
*A triplet of bases (3 bases) forms a codon.
*Each codon codes for a particular amino acid.
*Amino acids in turn link to form proteins.
*DNA and RNA regulate protein synthesis.
*The genetic code is the codons within DNA and RNA, composed of triplets of bases which eventually lead to protein synthesis.
*DNA → RNA → Protein


===Explain the process of translation, leading to polypeptide formation.===
*Translation is the process through which proteins are synthesized.
[[File:Protein translation.gif|thumbnail|Animation of protein translation]]
[[File:Translation 1543.gif|thumbnail|Animation of protein translation]]
*Involves ribosomes, messenger RNA (mRNA) - which is composed of codons - and transfer RNA (tRNA), which has a triplet of bases called the anticodon.
*The first stage of translation is the binding of mRNA to the small subunit of the ribosome.
*The tRNA molecules have a specific amino acid attached to them which corresponds to their anticodons.
*A tRNA molecule will bind to the ribosome; its anticodon must match the codon on the messenger RNA.
*This is done through complementary base pairing. These form a hydrogen bond together.
*Another tRNA molecule then bonds.
*Two transfer RNA molecules can bind at once.
*Then the two amino acids on the two transfer RNA molecules form a peptide bond.
*The first transfer RNA then detaches from the ribosome and the second one takes it’s place.
*The ribosome moves along the messenger RNA to the next codon so that another transfer RNA can bind.
*Again, a peptide bond is formed between the amino acids and this process continues.
*This forms a polypeptide chain and is the basis of protein synthesis.

===Discuss the relationship between one gene and one polypeptide.===
*A polypeptide is formed by amino acids liking together through peptide bonds.
*There are 20 different amino acids so a wide range of polypeptides are possible.
*Genes store the information required for making polypeptides.
*The information is stored in a coded form by the use of triplets of bases which form codons.
*The sequence of bases in a gene codes for the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide.
*The information in the genes is decoded during transcription and translation leading to protein synthesis.


==Enzymes==
===Define enzyme and active site.===
‘’’Enzymes:’’’ Globular proteins which act as catalysts of chemical reactions. 
‘’’Active site:’’’ Region on the surface of an enzyme to which substrates bind and which catalyses a chemical reaction involving the substrates.


===Explain enzyme-substrate specificity.===
*The active site of an enzyme is very specific to its substrates as it has a very precise shape.
*This results in enzymes being able to catalyze only certain reactions as only a small number of substrates fit in the active site.
*This is called enzyme-substrate specificity.
*For a substrate to bind to the active site of an enzyme it must fit in the active site and be chemically attracted to it.
*This makes the enzyme very specific to its substrate.
*The enzyme-substrate complex can be compared to a lock and key, where the enzyme is the lock and the substrate is the key.

===Explain the effects of temperature, pH and substrate concentration on enzyme activity.===
*Enzyme activity increases with an increase in temperature and usually doubles with every 10 degrees rise. This is due to the molecules moving faster and colliding more often together. However at a certain point the temperature gets too high and the enzymes denature and stop functioning. This is due to the heat causing vibrations within the enzyme destroying its structure by breaking the bonds in the enzyme.
*Enzymes usually have an optimum pH at which they work most efficiently. As the pH diverges from the optimum, enzyme activity decreases. Both acid and alkali environments can denature enzymes.
*Enzyme activity increases with an increase in substrate concentration as there are more random collisions between the substrate and the active site. However, at some point, all the active sites are taken up and so increasing the substrate concentration will have no more effect on enzyme activity. As long as there are active sites available, an increase in substrate concentration will lead to an increase in enzyme activity.
===Define denaturation.===
Denaturation: a change to the structure of a protein so it can no longer carry out its function.
===Explain the use of lactase in the production of lactose-free milk.===
*Lactose is the sugar found in milk.
*It can be broken down by the enzyme lactase into glucose and galactose.
*Some people lack this enzyme and so cannot break down lactose leading to lactose intolerance.
*Lactose intolerant people need to drink milk that has been lactose reduced. Lactose-free milk can be made in two ways:
#The first involves adding the enzyme lactase to the milk so that the milk contains the enzyme.
#The second way involves immobilizing the enzyme on a surface or in beads of a porous material. The milk is then allowed to flow past the beads or surface with the immobilized lactase. This method avoids having lactase in the milk.

==Cell Respiration==
===Define cell respiration.===

Cell respiration: the controlled release of energy from organic compounds in cells to form ATP.


===State that, in cell respiration, glucose in the cytoplasm is broken down by glycolysis into pyruvate, with a small yield of ATP.===

===Explain that, during anaerobic cell respiration, pyruvate can be converted in the cytoplasm into lactate, or ethanol and carbon dioxide, with no further yield of ATP.===

*In anaerobic cell respiration the pyruvate stays in the cytoplasm and in humans is converted into lactate which is then removed from the cell.
*In yeast the pyruvate is converted into carbon dioxide and ethanol. In either case, no ATP is produced.


===Explain that, during aerobic cell respiration, pyruvate can be broken down in the mitochondrion into carbon dioxide and water with a large yield of ATP.===

*If oxygen is available, the pyruvate is taken up into the mitochondria and is broken down into carbon dioxide and water.
*A large amount of ATP is released during this process.


==Photosynthesis==
===State that photosynthesis involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy.===
*Photosynthesis involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy.


===State that light from the Sun is composed of a range of wavelengths (colours).===


===State that chlorophyll is the main photosynthetic pigment.===


===Outline the differences in absorption of red, blue and green light by chlorophyll.===
*Chlorophyll can absorb red and blue light more than green.
*Chlorophyll cannot absorb green light and so instead reflects it making leaves look green.
===State that light energy is used to produce ATP, and to split water molecules (photolysis) to form oxygen and hydrogen.===


===State that ATP and hydrogen (derived from the photolysis of water) are used to fix carbon dioxide to make organic molecules.===


===Explain that the rate of photosynthesis can be measured directly by the production of oxygen or the uptake of carbon dioxide, or indirectly by an increase in biomass.===

*Photosynthesis can be measured in many ways as it involves the production of oxygen, the uptake of carbon dioxide and an increase in biomass.
*Aquatic plants release oxygen bubbles during photosynthesis and so these can be collected and measured.
*Uptake of carbon dioxide is more difficult to measure so it is usually done indirectly.
*When carbon dioxide is absorbed from water the pH of the water rises and so this can be measured with pH indicators or pH meters.
*Photosynthesis can be measured through an increase in biomass. If batches of plants are harvested at a series of times and the biomass of these batches is calculated, the rate increase in biomass gives an indirect measure of the rate of photosynthesis in the plants.


===Outline the effects of temperature, light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration on the rate of photosynthesis.===
*As temperature increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases more and more steeply until the optimum temperature is reached. If temperature keeps increasing above the optimum temperature then photosynthesis starts to decrease very rapidly.
*As light intensity increases so does photosynthesis until a certain point. At a high light intensities photosynthesis reaches a plateau and so does not increase any more. At low and medium light intensity the rate of photosynthesis is directly proportional to the light intensity.
*As the carbon dioxide concentration increases so does the rate of photosynthesis. There is no photosynthesis at very low levels of carbon dioxide and at high levels the rate reaches a plateau.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==

=Genetics=
==Chromosomes, genes, alleles, and mutations==
===State that eukaryotic chromosomes are made of DNA and proteins.===


===Define gene, allele, and genome.===
*Gene: a heritable factor that controls a specific characteristic.
*Allele: a specific form of a gene.
*Genome: the complete set of an organism’s base sequences.


===Define gene mutation.===
*Gene mutation: a random, rare change in genetic material.
*If DNA changes, RNA changes, which can change proteins, which affect structure and function.


===Explain the consequence of a base substitution mutation in relation to the processes of transcription and translation, using the example of sickle-cell anaemia.===
*Base substitution: one base is replaced by another in the DNA sequence.
*Sickle-cell anaemia is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for haemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that is used for gas exchange.
*Normal GAG mutates to GTG; valine is added to the polypeptide chain instead of glutamic acid.
*Different peptide=altered structure=altered function.
*Different haemoglobin molecule shape changes structure of red blood cell so that it is sickle shaped.
*Symptoms: weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
*Oxygen cannot be carried as efficiently by the sickle-shaped RBCs.
*Haemoglobin can crystallize within RBCs, making them inflexible; affected RBCs can clog capillaries.
*Mutated gene can be passed on to offspring.
*Those with sickle-cell anaemia are resistant to infection by malaria parasite.


==Meiosis==
===State that meiosis is a reduction division of a diploid nucleus to form haploid nuclei.===
*Haploid: n
*Diploid: 2n


===Define homologous chromosomes.===
*Homologous chromosomes: chromosomes that carry the same genes, and therefore have similar shape and size.


===Outline the process of meiosis, including pairing of homologous chromosomes and crossing over, followed by two divisions, which results in four haploid cells.===
‘‘’’Prophase I’’’’
#Chromosomes become visible as the DNA becomes more compact (supercoiling)
#Homologous chromosomes pair up
#Crossing over occurs
#Spindle fibres made from microtubules form
‘‘’’Metaphase I’’’’
#Bivalents (homologous chromosomes) line up across cell equator.
#Nuclear membrane disintegrates
‘’’’Anaphase I’’’’
#Spindle fibres attach to chromosomes and pull them to opposite poles of the cell.
‘‘’’Telophase I’’’’
#Spindles and spindle fibres disintegrate.
#Chromosomes uncoil and new nuclear membrane forms.

Cytokinesis now occurs. Cells are haploid, having only one chromosome of each pair. Each chromosome has its sister attached, so no S phase is necessary. Meiosis II takes place to separate sister chromatids.
‘’’’Prophase II’’’’
#DNA condenses into visible chromosomes again.
#New meiotic spindle fibres are produced.
‘’’’Metaphase II’’’’
#Nuclear membranes disintegrate.
#Individual chromosomes line up at the cell equator in random orientation.
#Spindle fibres from opposite poles attach to each sister chromatid at the centromere.
‘’’’Anaphase II’’’’
#Centromeres of each chromosome split, releasing each sister chromatid to become an individual chromosome.
#Spindle microtubules pull individual chromatids to opposite ends of the cell. Because of random orientation, chromatids can be pulled to either of new daughter cells.
‘’’’Telophase I’’’’
#Chromosomes uncoil into DNA strands.

Cytokinesis now occurs, yielding a total of four haploid cells.


===Explain that non-disjunction can lead to changes in chromosome number, illustrated by reference to Down syndrome (trisomy 21).===
*Chromosomes do not always separate during first or second meiotic divisions, yielding an unequal distribution of chromosomes.
*In humans, this may give and egg or a sperm cell 24 chromosomes instead of 23.
*Caused by non-disjunction; chromosomes stick together instead of separating.
*Down syndrome is caused by non-disjunction in the 21st pair, and the child receives 3 instead of 2. This is a trisomy (tri-=3). Down syndrome is also called trisomy 21.
*Trisomy 21 brings malformations of the digestive system and differing degrees of learning difficulties.
*Down syndrome is most common chromosomal anomaly (1 in 800).
*Risk increases as age of mother increases, especially over age of 35.
*Non-disjunction can be severe enough to cause a miscarriage.


===State that, in karyotyping, chromosomes are arranged in pairs according to their size and structure.===


===State that karyotyping is performed using cells colelcted by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, for pre-natal diagnosis of chromosome abnormalities.===


===Analyse a human karyotype to determine gender and whether non-disjunction has occurred.===
*Large sex chromosome is X, small is Y.
*Three of one type means that non-disjunction has occurred.


==Theoretical genetics==
===Define genotype, phenotype, dominant allele, recessive allele, codominant alleles, locus, homozygous, heterozygous, carrier, and test cross.===
*Genotype: symbolic representation of a pair of alleles possessed by an organism. Represented by two letters.
**Ex: '''Bb''', '''GG''', '''tt'''
*Phenotype: the characteristics or traits of an organism.
**Ex: five fingers on each hand, colour blindness
*Homozygous: having two identical alleles of a gene.
**Ex: '''AA''' is homozygous dominant
*Heterozygous:
*Dominant allele: allele that has the same effect on the phenotype regardless of what allele it is paired with.
**Ex: The genotype '''Aa''' gives the dominant '''A''' trait because the '''a''' allele is masked. The '''a''' allele is not transcribed and translated during protein synthesis. When labelling genotypes, capital letter indicates dominant, lower-case indicates recessive.
*Recessive allele: affects phenotype only when in the homozygous state.
**Ex: '''aa''' gives rise to the recessive trait because no dominant allele is there to mask it.
*Codominant alleles: pairs of alleles that both affect the phenotype when present in a heterozygote.
**Ex: parent with curly hair and a parent with straight hair have children with differing degrees of hair curliness; both alleles influence hair condition when both are present in the genotype.
*Locus: particular position on  homologous chromosomes of a gene.
*Carrier: individual who has a recessive allele of a gene that does not have an effect on their phenotype.
**Ex: '''Aa''' carries the gene for albinism but has pigmented skin – an ancestor must have been albino and some offspring might be, too. If both parents are carriers, then some offspring may be affected ('''aa''').
*Test cross: testing a suspected heterozygous organism by crossing it with a known homozygous recessive ('''aa'''). Since a recessive allele can be masked, it is often impossible to tell if an organism is '''AA''' or '''Aa''' until they produce offspring which have the recessive trait.

===Determine the genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring of a monohybrid cross using a Punnett grid.===
Let:
*'''A''' = dominant allele, allows pigment to form
*'''a''' = recessive allele, albinism – few or no pigments

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Example || style=&quot;background: silver&quot; | '''a''' || style=&quot;background: silver&quot; | '''a'''
|-
| style=&quot;background: silver&quot; |  '''A''' ||  '''Aa''' || '''Aa'''
|-
| style=&quot;background: silver&quot; |  '''a''' || '''aa''' || '''aa'''
|}

Half the offspring are albinos, half are carriers of the albinism gene.

===State that some genes have more than two alleles (multiple alleles).===


===Describe ABO blood groups as an example of codominance and multiple alleles.===
Let:
*'''I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;'''=allele for type A blood
*'''I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;'''=allele for type B blood
*'''i'''=recessive allele for type O blood

Therefore:
*'''I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;''' or '''I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;i''' gives a phenotype of type A blood
*'''I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;''' or '''I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;i''' gives a phenotype of type B blood
*'''I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;'''  gives a phenotype of type AB blood
*'''ii''' gives a phenotype of type O blood
Genotype '''I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;''' shows codominance; neither allele is masked, both show expression in phenotype of blood type AB.


===Explain how the sex chromosomes control gender by referring to the inheritance of X and Y chromosomes.===
*'''XX''' is female, '''XX''' is male
*This means that the chromosomes carried by the sperm will decide the gender of the offspring (egg always has '''XX''')
*half of sperm contain one '''X''' and half have one '''Y'''
*50% chance of being boy, 50% chance of being girl

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Example || style=&quot;background: silver&quot; | '''X''' || style=&quot;background: silver&quot; | '''X'''
|-
| style=&quot;background: silver&quot; |  '''X''' ||  '''Aa''' || '''Aa'''
|-
| style=&quot;background: silver&quot; |  '''Y''' || '''aa''' || '''aa'''
|}

===State that some genes are present on the X chromosome and absent from the shorter Y chromosome in humans.===


===Define sex linkage.===
*Any genetic trait whose allele has its locus on the X or the Y chromosome is sex linked.



===Describe the inheritance of colour blindness and haemophilia as examples of sex linkage.===
*Colour blindness: inability to distinguish between certain colours.
**Allele for colour blindness found only on X chromosome
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;''' = recessive allele for colour blindness
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;''' = allele for the ability to distinguish colour
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;''' gives phenotype of non-affected female
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;''' gives phenotype of non-affected female that is a carrier
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;''' gives phenotype of an affected female
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;Y''' gives phenotype of non-affected male
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;Y''' give phenotype of affected male
*Haemophilia: disorder where the blood does not clot properly.
**Allele for haemophilia found only on X chromosome
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;''' = recessive allele for haemophilia
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;''' = allele for the ability to clot blood
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;'''gives phenotype of non-affected female
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;''' gives phenotype of non-affected female that is a carrier
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;''' gives phenotype of an affected female
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;Y''' gives phenotype of non-affected male
**'''X&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;Y''' gives phenotype of affected male
*Males are always affected if they have the recessive X allele.
*Females are more likely to be carriers than to have the condition.

===State that a human female can be homozygous or heterozygous with respect to sex-linked genes.===


===Explain that female carriers are heterozygous for X-linked recessive alleles.===
*See 4.3.8.


===Predict the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of offspring of monohybrid crosses involving any of the above patterns of inheritance.===


===Deduce the genotypes and phenotypes of individuals in pedigree charts.===


==Genetic engineering and biotechnology==
===Outline the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to copy and amplify minute quantities of DNA.===
*In PCR, DNA is copied again and again to produce many (millions in a few hours) copies of the original molecules.
*Useful when very small amounts of DNA are found in a sample and larger amounts are needed for analysis.
*DNA from very small samples of semen, blood, or other tissue (even long-dead specimens) can be amplified using PCR.
*PCR is carried out at high temperatures using a DNA polymerase enzyme from ‘’Thermus aquaticus’’ (a bacteria that lives in hot springs).


===State that, in gel electrophoresis, fragments of DNA move in an electric field and are separated according to their size.===


===State that gel electrophoresis of DNA is used in DNA profiling.===


===Describe the application of DNA profiling to determine paternity and also in forensic investigations.===
*Many organisms (including humans) have short sequences of bases that are repeated many times (called satellite DNA).
**Satellite DNA varies greatly between different individuals.
*Samples containing satellite DNA can be copied using PCR, then cut into pieces using restriction enzymes; the lengths of fragments vary greatly between individuals.
*Gel electrophoresis can be used to separate fragmented pieces of DNA according to size and charge.
*This technique is called DNA profiling.
*Can be used in forensic investigations and obtaining paternity.


===Analyse DNA profiles to draw conclusions about paternity or forensic investigations.===
*Profiles that match bands will most likely be from the same or related individuals.


===Outline three outcomes of the sequencing of the complete human genome.===
#It will become easier to study how genes influence human development.
#It will allow easier identification of genetic diseases.
#It will allow the production of new drugs based on DNA base sequences or genes or the structure of proteins coded in these genes.
#It will give new insight into the origins of evolution and migrations of humans.


===State that, when genes are transferred between species, the amino acid sequence of polypeptides translated from them is unchanged because the genetic code is universal.===


===Outline a basic technique used for gene transfer involving plasmids, a host cell (bacterium, yeast, or other cell), restriction enzymes (endonucleases), and DNA ligase.===
#Prepare the gene for transfer.
##MRNA coding for insulin extracted from human pancreas cells that make insulin.
##DNA copies of the mRNA are made using reverse transcriptase.
##“Sticky” ends are made by adding extra G nucleotides to the ends of the gene.
#Prepare the plasmid (loop of bacterial DNA) to receive the gene.
##Plasmid is cut open using restriction enzymes (they cut open DNA at specific base sequences).
##“Sticky” ends are made by adding extra C nucleotides to the ends of the cut plasmid.
#Combine the prepared gene with the prepared plasmid.
##Ligase seals the nicks in the DNA by making sugar-phosphate bonds.
##Plasmid with insulin gene is called a recombinant plasmid.
#The recombinant plasmids are combined with suitable host cells, in this case E. coli.
#The GM E. coli are cultured in a fermenter.
#The bacteria start to synthesize insulin, which is extracted, purified, and used.


===State two examples of the current uses of genetically modified crops or animals.===
*Bt maize that produces botulin toxin naturally, killing pests that would normally destroy the crop.
*GM salmon that have more muscle mass, and can therefore provide more food per fish.
*Plants that glow in the dark.


===Discuss the potential benefits and possible harmful effects of one example of genetic modification.===
Example: Bt maize
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Potential benefits of Bt maize !! Potential risks of Bt maize
|-
|
#Less pest damage and therefore higher crop yields to reduce food shortages.
#Less land needed for crop production (because of higher yield), so more natural area could be conserved.
#Less use of insecticide sprays, which are expensive and can be harmful to workers and wildlife.
||
#Humans or animals eating the GM corn might be harmed by the bacterial DNA or Bt toxin in it.
#Insects that are not pests could be killed. Maize pollen will be blown onto wild plants near the maize; animals feeding on these wild plants may be affected.
#Populations of wild plants may be changed. Cross-pollination will spread the Bt gene into some wild plants, which will gain an advantage.
|}


===Define clone.===
*Clone: a group of genetically identical organisms or a group of genetically identical cells derived from a single parent cell.


===Outline a technique for cloning using differentiated animal cells.===
#Take differentiated cells from a donor animal.
##For example, udder cells from a sheep.
##These cells should be dormant (can be cultured in a low-nutrient medium to switch off genes).
#Take unfertilized egg cells from another animal.
##These egg cells should have their nuclei removed.
#Fuse the differentiated cells with the egg cells without nuclei using a pulse of electricity.
#These fused cells will develop like zygotes and become embryos.
#The embryos may be implanted into another sheep, which will become the surrogate mother.
#The offspring will be genetically identical to the animal that gave the differentiated cells.


===Discuss the ethical issues of therapeutic cloning in humans.===

#Embryonic stem cells can be used for therapies that save lives and reduce suffering.
#Cells can be removed from embryos that have stopped developing, so would have died anyway.
#Cells are removed at a stage when embryos have no nerve cells and can feel no pain.
||
#Every human embryo is a potential human being, which should be given a chance to develop.
#More embryos may be produced than are needed, so some may have to be killed.
#There is a danger of embryonic stem cells developing into tumour cells.

''Replying to your message on my talk page:''
:You're welcome.  The book is looking good and a great book to have here at Wikibooks.  It is possible to import any or all of those Wikipedia pages directly into Wikibooks.  This will import the exact page with formatting and the edit history (for copyright purposes).  If you think this is a good idea then you can list the pages you want to be imported (or if you want all within that category then say so).  You can post a request on [[Wikibooks:Requests for import ]] (myself or another admin will try to do it as soon as possible) or leave a message on my talk page.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:18, 9 April 2014 (UTC)
:I left a note on [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_import]] regarding the imports as there are so many of them, the original Wikipedia category has been deleted and it's not clear which ones are needed more than others.  When you have time please have a look.  Thanks.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:42, 15 April 2014 (UTC)

== Master Thesis interview? ==

Hi TheChampionMan1234,

NetRadiant is a map editor for the [[w:id tech 3|id tech 3]] or [[w:id tech 4|id tech 4]] engines. It is a fork of [[GtkRadiant]], and has more features added for newer games such as [[w:Xonotic|Xonotic]] and [[w:Warsow (video game)|Warsow]]. It comes with the [[Q3Map2]] BSP compiler.

Although this book has been written using Xonotic as an example, other games should be similar.

NetRadiant is a 3d map editor for the [[w:id tech 3|id tech 3]] or [[w:id tech 4|id tech 4]] engines. With it, you can lay out new maps or edit existing maps.

NetRadiant's native format is &lt;code&gt;.map&lt;/code&gt;. This is a plain-text, human-readable format that describes the [[NetRadiant/Objects|objects]] in the map. However, the game engines that will have to read the map can't calculate all of the lights, shadows, and collision bounds at runtime; maps must be compiled with Q3Map2 before they can be used in-game.

==Game==

Although the interface of NetRadiant does not change with different games (e.g. Xonotic vs Warsow vs Nexuiz), games use their own texture packs (which are not included with NetRadiant due to size constraints), weapon and item names, and more. NetRadiant uses [[NetRadiant/Game Packs|game packs]] to describe each game's contents; by default, it comes with game packs for Darkplaces, Quake, Nexuiz, Xonotic, Warsow, and Project::OSiRiON. Many other games are supported, but their game packs are not released under a license that allows NetRadiant to redistribute them or they are not common enough to bundle. These game packs are usually available for download at the corresponding game's website.

You can select NetRadiant's game pack either at startup or in the [[NetRadiant/Preferences#Game|preferences]].

==Compiling==

Q3Map2 has many command-line arguments that change its behavior; it can be told to only produce the &lt;code&gt;.bsp&lt;/code&gt; file (the basic geometry of the map), the &lt;code&gt;.srf&lt;/code&gt; file (lighting and shadows), and many more arguments that adjust the quality of the results. Compiling a full map can take hours.

==Final map files==

Map files are generally saved with the lowercase name of the map without spaces, followed by either the version or the date. Map files can be zipped with any file zipper and saved with a &lt;code&gt;.pk3&lt;/code&gt; extension; when this is placed into a game include path, the map should appear in the map lists.

===Mapinfo (&lt;code&gt;.mapinfo&lt;/code&gt;)===

The mapinfo file contains the title of the map, the description, the author(s), the gametypes for which the map is suitable, and some other information used by the engine such as weapons and vehicle status.

===Geometry (&lt;code&gt;.bsp&lt;/code&gt;)===

The &lt;code&gt;.bsp&lt;/code&gt; file contains all of the geometry and collision information for a level; this is the only file that a map ''requires''. This is the fastest output for Q3Map2 to compile.

===Lightmaps (&lt;code&gt;.srf&lt;/code&gt;)===
Calculating lightmaps (used for shadows and lighting) is very slow; even on a high-end computer, it can take hours to calculate all of the shadows for a map. When you just want to get a feel for the map in-game, you don't have to calculate lightmaps; the entire map will simply be lit evenly, and no lights will be taken into account.

===Botmaps (&lt;code&gt;.waypoints&lt;/code&gt;)===

Bots (used in single-player mode as well as when there are not enough players present in multiplayer mode) need ''bot waypoints'' to be able to navigate; many third-party maps lack these, and bots will not attempt to move.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The object is to compress the entire deck into one pile like an accordion.
&lt;br /&gt;
==Rules==
===Variations===
There are two variants of the game in terms of how the game begins.

In one variant, the cards are laid out one by one and are immediately put into play if possible. The number of cards to be laid out range from just one card to how many cards the width of the table can allow (usually a second or third row is constructed in the process). While practical, it also allows an element of surprise as the player does not know the next card to be dealt until all possible plays are exhausted.

In another variant, the cards are spread out in one line. While this variant allows for some tactics to be applied, it can prove to be cumbersome when played with a real deck.
===Play===
No matter the layout variant, the game is the same. A pile can be moved on top of another pile immediately to its left or separated to its left by two piles if the top cards of each pile have the same suit or rank. Gaps left behind are filled by moving piles to the left. 

Here's an example:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-----
| 5♠ || 6♠ || 10&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;♦&lt;/span&gt;
| 5&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;♥&lt;/span&gt; || K♣
|}

According to this example, either 6♠ or 5&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;♥&lt;/span&gt; can be placed over 5♠. These are the only allowable moves.
===Winning===
The game is won when all cards are compressed into one pile. But since achieving this is next to impossible when cards are dealt one at a time, [[Alfred Sheinwold]] mentions in his book ''101 Best Family Card Games'' (ISBN 0-8069-8635-2) that it is considered a win when there are five piles or less at the end of the game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This game is so called because there are 13 columns in the game.
== Rules ==
# Deal the cards cards are dealt into columns of four on the tableau, resulting in 13 columns. 
# Any King that is in the top or middle of each column must be placed on the bottom before the game starts. Two Kings that are mixed into one column are placed on the bottom without changing their order
# 
# The object of the game is to build all the cards onto the four foundations.
[[File:Pysolfc-bakers-dozen.xcf|thumb|right|Screenshot]]
# You must first free up the four aces and if one of them is found, it is placed on the foundation. 
# Building on the foundation is up by suit, each from ace to king.
# 
# Only the top cards of each column can are available, and cards on the tableau, if they cannot be placed on the foundations yet, can be built down regardless of suit.
# Furthermore, once all cards are taken out of a column, the column can never be filled.
# The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations.
==Variations==
Here are some variations of Baker's Dozen:

* In '''Spanish Patience''', foundations are built up regardless of suit.
* '''Castles in Spain''' is akin to Spanish Patience, but the cards in the tableau are built down by alternate color.
* In '''Good Measure''', two aces are taken out and placed on the foundations while the rest of the deck is shuffled and laid out in columns of five cards, resulting in 10 columns. Like in Baker's Dozen, Kings that are at the top or in the middle of their respective columns are placed at the bottom and the game proceeds in the process stated above.
* '''Portuguese Solitaire''' is halfway between Baker's Dozen and Spanish Patience because empty columns can only be filled with Kings.

3. ''colloq.'' (orig. ''U.S.''). The practice of doing paid work in addition to one's regular employment. &lt;ref name=&quot;oed&gt;&quot;moonlighting, n.&quot;. OED Online. March 2014. Oxford University Press. [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/121934?rskey=Cuxnnp&amp;result=3] (accessed April 09, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For professionals, particularly those salaried rather than paid by time, moonlighting raises a set of legal, philosophical, and ethical questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When are contracts with moonlighting prohibition clauses warranted? What is actually 'sold' when a professional enters a contract? Under what conditions may moonlighting pose an ethical issue?&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some thoughts:
# Legal issues - nature of contracts, when they've held up, when they haven't
# Labor theory - Marx has some relevant thoughts. Particularly of interest for salaried employees w/ non-moonlighting clauses. Are you selling ''everything'' you produce, even &quot;on your own time&quot;? What if you propose idea, rejected by company, then worked on independently? IP issues. Selling the self?
# Ethical issues - If you're in a nonmoonlighting contract, are there circumstances (above) where it's still ethical to work on things not authorized by ? Medical field - 80-hour work week standard - performance impact of out-of-hours work. Putting greater effort / quality of work in off-the-clock- ethical? Working overtime?

      <text xml:space="preserve">This game is also known as ''Five Piles'' and ''Thirteens''. The object of the game is to remove pairs of cards that add up to 13

==Rules==
#Five cards are dealt in a row; they will form the bases of the five piles, the top cards of which are available for play.

#In order to win, one has to remove Kings and pairs of cards that total 13. In this game, spot cards are taken at face value, Jacks value at 11, Queens 12, and Kings 13. So the following combinations of cards are discarded:
* Queen and Ace
* Jack and 2
* 10 and 3
* 9 and 4
* 8 and 5
* 7 and 6
* Kings on their own.

#When gaps occur, they are filled by the top cards of the other piles; but when there are not enough cards to do this (less than five), cards from the stock are used.

#When gaps are filled and no kings and/or pairs of cards totalling 13 are present, five new cards are dealt from the stock, one onto each pile. Game play then continues, with the top cards of each pile, as mentioned above, are available. This cycle of discarding and dealing of new cards goes on until the stock has been used up.

#The game is won when all cards have been discarded.

|next=Eilenburg-Steenrod Axioms}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

A Mayer-Vietoris Sequence is a powerful tool used in finding Homology groups for spaces that can be expressed as the unions of simpler spaces from the perspective of Homology theory.

==Definition==

If X is a topological space covered by the interiors of two subspaces A and B, then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\cdots\rightarrow H_{n+1}(X)\,&amp;\xrightarrow{\partial_*}\,H_{n}(A\cap B)\,\xrightarrow{(i_*,j_*)}\,H_{n}(A)\oplus H_{n}(B)\,\xrightarrow{k_* - l_*}\,H_{n}(X)\xrightarrow{\partial_*}\,H_{n-1} (A\cap B)\rightarrow\\ 
&amp;\quad\cdots\rightarrow H_0(A)\oplus H_0(B)\,\xrightarrow{k_* - l_*}\,H_0(X)\rightarrow\,0.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

is an exact sequence where &lt;math&gt;i:A\cap B\hookrightarrow A, j:A\cap B\hookrightarrow B,l:A\hookrightarrow X,k:B \hookrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;. There is a slight adaptation for the reduced homology where the sequence ends instead

:&lt;math&gt;\cdots \rightarrow \tilde{H}_0(A\cap B) \xrightarrow{(i_*,j_*))} \tilde{H}_0(A)\oplus \tilde{H}_0(B)\,\xrightarrow{k_* - l_*}\,\tilde{H}_0(X)\rightarrow\,0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

Consider the cover of &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; formed by 2-discs A and B in the figure. 

[[Image:SphereCoverStriped.png|thumb|250px|right|&lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; covered by 2-discs A and B]]

The space &lt;math&gt;A\cap B&lt;/math&gt; is homotopy equivalent to the circle. We know that the homology groups are preserved by homotopy and so &lt;math&gt;H_n(A\cap B)\cong 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n\neq 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_1(A\cap B)\cong \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Also note how the homology groups of A and B are trivial since they are both contractable. So we know that

:&lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow \tilde{H}_1(S^2) \xrightarrow{\partial_*} \mathbb{Z}\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

This means that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}_1(S^2)\cong \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\partial_*&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism by exactness. 

Consider the cover of the torus by 2 open ended cylinders A and B.

==Background of an atomic bomb that was dropped in Hiroshima (Little Boy)==


	At first, America was planning to perform “Operation Downfall”, to assault Japan. However, after wtinessing the horror of Iojima and Okinawa battles, America changed the plan and decided to drop atomic bombs on Japanese soil. There were some opinions that they need to strike further with napalm or other type of weapons to maximize the damage, but the government decided against it. Before they dropped atomic bombs, nobody knew about the secondary damage caused by atomic bombs - radiation. 


	Little Boy, codename of an atomic bomb, was built with Uranium-235. Simply, Little boy detonates when 2 uranium masses colide, creating a massive heat and energy.

	August 6th, 1945, 3 American planes flew above Hiroshima in order to recon the area. The citizens evacuated hastily, but nothing happened. After a few hours later, B-29 appeared on Hiroshima’s sky. The citizens thought it would be another recon plane, and continued their normal life. 

	But, the B-29 dropped an atomic bomb; It was 240 meter far away from Aioi bridge. Hiroshima citizens saw a very brightening light when it was detonated; some of the people were even blinded. Everything instantly burnt near the hypocenter at 3000~4000C. Soon, thermal effect and shockwave followed at 340 meter per second speed,  wiping out everything on the ground (1.5 km radius). Hiroshima suffered from high radiation, heat and gray atmosphere preventing the sunlight sifting on Hiroshima’s soil.

===Lines used in Manga===


Lines are a common use in comics. They are often used to emphasize situations or add 

extra information to the scene. Most commonly they are used to express action, motion, 

mood, power or depression.


'''Action lines:'''

Action lines are usually parallel straight, diagonal or curved lines. Action lines have two 

main categories, one being focus lines and the other speed lines. 

Focus lines are used to create focus towards a certain object/person by using thus focus 

lines via outward projections. (image)

Speed lines are a combination of a lot of lines going in the same direction, usually parallel 

straight lines. It is used to indicate velocity, or speed, in the scene whilst directing where 

the character(s) is moving towards. (image)


'''Mood/atmospheric lines:'''

These lines are often curved, spiky or even shown like smoke to indicate the atmosphere 

or the current mood of a character or an object. They are often around –or emitted from - a 

character or object making it seem like steam is coming off them. (image)


'''Depressing lines:'''

Lines to show depression are mainly vertical straight lines. These indicate the character's feeling towards the situation.

Gutter:
Gutters are the spaces between the borders of the panel, It is also defined as a closure.
In comic books the gutter is usually white, but not all the time. The artist has taken leeway on certain pages and mixes the panels together in a seamless set of images for greater impact. 
The gutter is the thing that separates the images. Without the gutter the reader would have a hard time following along and the transitions between each image and would get very confused with what is happening at the time.
the term gutter  is referring to the space between the borders of the panels in the comic book(manga). It is called this because it looks like the gutter of a house with its two parallel lines. This space is very important as it separates the panels and lets the reader know that we are going from one scene to the next and makes it easy to follow a long with the comic strip and not get lost between panels.

Manga Convention:Onomatopoeia
Onomatopoeias are the words containing sounds similar to the noises they describe. In Japanese manga, onomatopoeias are drawn as a part of the picture to show the sound of the action or the feeling of the character, it is often called Kakimoji or Onyu (symbolic words) in Japan. To show the different types of actions and feelings, the onomatopoeias are also drawn differently. For example, in the battle scene, the thick and black Kakimoji is used.

Same kind of onomatopoeias are used by different authors. However there are also many other onomatopoeias that different authors has originally made. The famous author Araki and are famous for making their original onomatopoeias.

In Barefoot Gen, there are some onomatopoeias that describes the sounds that we're often lay heard during the war. For example whooooooeeeeee is a sound of the emergency alarm when the enemy plane is coming.

Pace is an important factor in Manga conventions.  The pacing of the story is essentially how fast the story is progressing and how important the scene is depending on situation.

'''Slow pace:'''
It makes the reader focus on the scene and gives us an impression of close up, that way emphasises the scene. It shows that the scene is an important aspect that is worth slowing down the pace and that it plays a vital role in both story progression and character building.

'''Fast pace:'''
Fast pace is used for showing quick action.  The fast change of scenes give the reader the impression of fast movement as quick change enables the reader to understand and move quickly from panel to panel and imply the feeling of action on the reader.

===Manga Conventions: Layout===

'''''Composition''''' plays a major role in how the reader will follow the story, determined mainly by the positioning of the panels (images), and it also creates the atmosphere through lightings. Sizes of the panels determines the scene, typically showing mental images over large boxes, and small but many boxes will give a sequencial feeling.

'''''Positive/Negative''''' Spacing is refered to the two colors: black (negative) and white (positive). A good balance in the two types of spacing will make a best composition, and balance can be maintained by adding black to areas that are too white, and the same for white.

'''''Flow''''' is how the reader’s eye moves across the page. Many Japanese Manga is read from right to left, whilst Western comics are to be read from left to right. Depending on your audience, it is important for the illustrator to distribute the images in the right place, and use other features in a way that makes the reader’s eye move in the correct order.

'''''Timing''''' is what determines the flow, but also portrays the importance of the scene and the key points by the size, shape and and the position of the panels. The time it takes the reader to look through one frame is what determines the pace of events and illusion of time. Commonly, when the panels are bigger, they are showing the scene that the illustrator (mangaka) wants to emphasize the important points in the story - the bigger the panel, the longer the eye will linger on the frame. The smaller panels tend to give a sequencial feeling but also show the personality of characters, and the faster the eye will move onto another panel.

== Manga Conventions: Facial Features ==

=== Eyes === 
Many manga characters have very large eyes nowadays; female characters especially have eyes larger than male ones to make them look attractive. In some cases, character’s emotions is reflected in their eyes. When the character is feeling lucky, stars might replace their eyes, or if they have desire towards money, symbols that relates to money (usually ¥/yen) show in their eyes. However, Manga characters don’t always have eyes; instead, they might have shadows over their eyes to show tension. When character’s eyes or eyebrows twitch, it tells us that the character is holding back his/her anger, laughter or shock. Sparks literally fly between characters’ eyes when they are fighting or when the illustrator wants to show a rivalry relationship.

=== Mouth ===
Many characters in manga have very small mouth, many in which are just a straight line added to their faces. Fangs in their mouths indicate that the character is angry or shocked, unless the character have had that feature throughout the story. Sometimes, features of eyes and mouth can be used together. When the character is feeling very shocked, they have oblong mouth shapes and white round eyes, along series of lines on their forehead.

=== Nose ===
When a character is sleeping, a bubble comes out from their nose, inflating and deflating. Female characters have small noses compared to male ones; in fact, its usually consists little more than a vertically short line.

=== Head/Face ===
When the character is hurt physically, white crossed bandages show up on their faces. If the character is feeling angry, cross-shaped lines show on their heads which are actually popping veins. A round swelling on their fead is and exaggeration of injury.

=Humour=

Gag manga is a type of Japanese manga that portrays humor. 
Gag manga started from the Taisyou era to the Syouwa era. At that time, humor was essential to every manga and people called it the ponch picture. But in the 1960s a new type of manga called Gekiga was created that had no elements of humor. Because of this, manga was divided in groups and the Gag manga was born.

For example one of the techniques used in gag manga is ‘chibikyara’:
Chibikyara are mini version of a character. 
Chibikyara are usually a used in a comedy manga.  Authors also create mangas that include only Chibikyara for a sub story.  

Tsukkomi is a technique to create humor in Japan. This technique usually has two roles, the Boke role (funny man) and the Tsukkomi role (straight man). Usually Boke role says something funny or does something silly. In response, the Tsukkomi role points out the mistake that the Boke role did and starts rectify what the Boke role said or did. By pulling back the topic, it creates a tempo making it easier for the Boke role to say more jokes.
 
In Japanese manga, sometimes the authors use words with similar meanings, spellings, sounds etc. A sentence such as “Friends for dinner” is a good example. It has two meanings, one is having dinner with your friends. The other definition would be eating friends for dinner. Like this manga also uses this technique to make the manga funny. It also helps the Tsukkomi technique to create a topic.

==Why did the comic &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; use cartoon violence?==

An abbreviated strong language and violent expression.
The Weekly Jump could not show a realistic violence.

===Style of manga comic’s info===
In a case, Japanese comics has excessive violence and expression.  But they aren’t meant to injure person.  They just entertain the reader.
Realistic expressions have the blood sprat, scars, and  destruction and realistic faces.  They look like real photographs.  However comical expressions have have unrealistic motions (e.g jumping to the sky).

===Pieces of work that use realistic violence===
*History- “Explain the past times with details”
*War log- “Describe events that happened in the great War”
*Mystery- ”A story to elucidate the truth of a crime.”
*Gekiga(劇画)-”Comic style of a realistic narrative”

===Pieces of work that use comical violence===
*Gag manga- “Funny moment and such jokes”
*Satire- “Draw contents in derision of specific object interestingly”
*Comedy

===Pieces of work that use both expressions===
*Adventure
*Action
*Fantasy

In Barefoot gen.That has very heavy and serious theme from the war.And Barefoot gen has both expression.Because, When the scene where Gen was hit by father.  Then moment, Gen cut in his mouth. (You can see a little bit of blood).  So, This is a realistic expression but, he flew up by a hit shock (In some cases, people can flow up).  In most cases, those expression is comical.

{{Navigation|previous=Character summary|next=Use of cartoon violence}}

==Symbolism==

Symbolism is used very often in stories, especially in visual sources such as manga. 
They can provide a dramatic shortcut to explaining a lot more than just writing what you are trying to tell, it gives the reader a visual understanding rather than someone writing the words down.
Texts wouldn’t give the reader as much understanding nor the visual impact as a Manga can give to the reader.
An action, person, place, word or object can all have a symbolic meaning; this is usually when the author wants to show emotion rather than expressing it. Visualizing gives more emotion and understanding to the reader compared to written texts.
The example below shows the sun rising between the clouds; which is a symbolism of hope.

'''Nakaoka family:'''	

Gen Nakaoka(main character): Gen is a main charcter and a second son, portrayed as a protagonist in the manga; Barefoot Gen. 

	Shinji Nakaoka: Third and last son. Shinji plays an important role in showingthe war from childrens’ eyes/perspective. He shows the way war affected on innocent children like himself.

	Kimie Nakaoka(mother) she is a hard-working mother, who is also pregnant. 

	Koji Nakaoka: First son in the family. He decides to go against his father by going to pilot training to clear the title ‘traitor’ of their family.

	Eiko Nakaoka: Elder daughter of Nakaoka family. She is affected by the warand as she is mainly portrayed as a victim in the story. Since most of the main casts are men, she plays a important role, showing the affects to young, feminine girls. 

	Daikichi Nakaoka: He is a pacifist father. Through out the manga he stubbornly believes that war was started by the “people at the top”and that they brain-wash people to keep the nation on their side.
Daikichi Nakakoka dearly loves his family and does anything to save his family.

	Akira Nakaoka: Second son of Nakaoka family. He was evacuated to the countryside to be safe from all of the bombing in Hiroshima.

'''Antagonists:'''

	Inspectors

	Police officers

	chairman

	teachers

(from this layout, we can see that most of the villains have some sort of relation directly to the government, therfore, we can see that the reasons are purely through patriotism: people who have been brain-washed by the ideas made by the government)
	Ryukichi (chairman’s son) (shows how youths are effected by the society. For example, school programs and propogandas)

'''sub-characters that appear in anecdotes/ sub-plots'''

	Tamura (escapee from the country evacuation/ friends with Akira)
	Kumai (a kamikaze pilot Koji met on the way to his training)
	Mr.Horikawa (a legless man Gen helped)
	A carp owner Gen and Shinji met whilst stealing a carp for their sick mother

Each of these charcters shows what the affects of pre-war and war time difficulties may cause. (Both mentally and physically) 

'''Minor characters:'''

Mr.Pak/Boku Pak (korean immigrant) he is portrayed as a protagonist, as he helps the Nakaoka family throughout the text. He plays an important role, as he becomes the key to showing that the stereo-typical Japanese way of thinking is not always correct. in addition, his relationship with the Nakaoka family is heart-warming and may create a different point of view toward immigrants.
school teachers (they are directly involved with the government, therefore, they act as propaganda, to brain-wash the youths.)

== Analysis(Q&amp;A from Study Guide) ==

''''' This is an analysis created by answering a number of questions that the authors of this wiki were provided with by their supervisors in the form of a study guide. '''''

==='''1. Gen is a Japanese name meaning “root” or “source.” Nakazawa stated, “I named my main character Gen in the hope that he would become a root or source of strength for a new generation, one that can tread the charred soil of Hiroshima barefoot, feel the earth beneath its feet, and have the strength to say ‘NO’ to nuclear weapons.” Think about the wheat field that keeps coming up in the novel (especially on page 1). How does it relate to Gen’s name? Explain the metaphor.''' ===

“Gen” is also the first letter of the word “Genki” which means strength and energy
When wheat is stompped and stepped on, they do not die like other plants; they continue to grow. Like wheat, Gen struggles because of war and horrible neighbours, but does not lose the will to be a survivor. 
The wheat field symbolizes hope - how the wheat field provides them the bugs to eat as if it wants them to survive to persuade others to feel the same way as their family. It also visualizes Mr. Nakazawa’s explanation of the origin of the name, how the wheat field is the ‘root or source of strength’. The state of the wheat field correlates with the storyline, showing the situation of the family. For example, when the wheat field was destroyed, the family felt emotionally unstable.
The kanji Gen not only symbolizes strength but also means the root of something. Combining these two interpretations together, it can infer that the main character, Gen is the “root” or “source” of strength, supporting the people in his lives and his family. Throughout the comic, Gen often acts almost as a hero for justice. For example, on page 239, it shows how Gen broke window glasses, knowing he would get in trouble, in order to help a legless man’s get over his debt and financial problems. The wheat also has a very symbolic meaning: in the story, the wheat suggests invincibility. Even after getting stepped on, frosted by the cold winter, wheat shoots right back up. All in all, Gen represents a figure of justice, someone who would not be defeated by anything. (In this case, the pre-war lifestyle and his struggles with society) 
Because of the events in the novel - of  living harshly and being treated terribly and getting worse (the bomb) - it symbolizes that no matter how  hard things get, you should always stand back as because there is always something to stand up for, like the wheat rising to grow and be used by the Nakazawas, Gen - whom is another symbol, must stand up for his family because they are worth standing up for. They  need him as he needs them as well as all of the family needing the wheat. In another point of  view, something worth standing up for is not always the case. A plant’s whole purpose is to grow. It does not care if it will be killed or destroyed, it’s only purpose is to grow no matter what, which is what Gen and his family should do. Live.
Gen is described like the wheat they are growing and he is because like the wheat threw the war he is growing, learning and experience more. When Gen, his brother and sister are bullied and the shoes are thrown into the river is when the wheat had been stomped down, like him but it hadn’t died and kept growing such as Gen did.

=== '''2. Barefoot Gen has been described as a comic book for both children and adults – do you agree with this statement? What audience do you feel is most appropriate for this book?''' ===
 
Hadashi no Gen has been serialized in a manga magazine specifically for young adults and teenagers. “Weekly Shonen Jump!” was a popular manga magazine, and still is, that was targeted towards a wide demographic. The age range of the people reading the magazine, and with it Hadashi no Gen, would most appropriately be the children around the age 15 to 20, as by then they would develop some immunity towards biased material, and be able to efficiently gather out the important aspects of the work while also being able to see how the mangaka was able to express his emotions.

Both adults and children can enjoy and learn about Barefoot Gen. It is important for children to know what happened during the WWII so that they'd understand that wars must not be repeated. Although it contains some gruesome scenes, the gruesomeness is not emphasised so we can accept them as the outcome of the A-bomb (like facts). Barefoot Gen can also be read by adults because after learning the WWII as series of events, which are mainly about defeats and victories of the counties, they can have a look at the individuals' stories.

=== '''3. One thing that makes Barefoot Gen unique is that it describes the day-to-day life of ordinary men, women and children living in wartime. The bulk of the book deals with suffering outside of the battlefield. Select a scene from their daily life that you found affecting or moving and explain why it affected you. ===

On page 16 Gen and Shinji are fighting over a sweet potato. They punch each other trying to eat the sweet potato by themselves.  This scene was affecting and moving as it shows the greed and hunger of a human which we usually hide behind a curtain of respect or shame.  However, seeing them fight over it while showing open greed shows the effect of war on people.  in addition, it makes the audience compare their life to Gen’s.'''

Pg. 52- This is a scene in Gen’s classroom, where they are reading out letters to send to the soldiers off in the battlefields; Gen reads out his letter, encouraging them to survive instead of dying, and his teacher’s fist comes flying into him and he gets told to rewrite it. I found this strange because nowadays, teachers don’t use violence on students because their parents would soon find out and will protest. Secondly, school is a place to learn peace, at least not to encourage them to die in the war.
On Page 60, Mr.Pak and Gen are teased by the classmates, although they have not done any misbehaviour. 

On page 193 - 194, Gen and Shinji are shown street performing, under false identities and circumstances, as well as attempted stealing a fish from a man’s Koi Pond. This is particularly affectionate as it shows how far an individual will go for their family. As the old saying is, Family comes first. The two lied about themselves, lied to others and stole from others to keep their family in relatively good, better, condition. In addition, as I am from the Philippines, I’ve seen how the hardship people experience and know how far people will go and do for those they care about to survive and thrive. 

=== '''4. Look at the villains in the novel. Are there any similarities in the way they are drawn? Analyse the effectiveness of Nakazawa’s portrayal of them.''' === 

Nakazawa often portrays the villains in a very stereotypical way. They have pursed lips, thick and slanted eyebrows, and they often have narrowed eyes. The superior, grown-up villains, such as instructors, the chairman and officers often have mustaches. The mustache symbolizes power and class. In addition, many of the villains have dark circles under their eyes: symbolizing mischief and wickedness.The effects of these facial expressions are very effective. It becomes a crucial clue of who the antagonists are to the readers. The audience can easily recognize the role the character is playing, therefore, the author can easily evoke the feelings he wants the audience to feel. 
One of the resembles in the villains in Mr.Nakazawa’s comic book is their clothing. Many antagonists tend to wear uniforms, such as chairman, instructors and officials. When protagonists were sometimes seen in more casual clothes antagonists remained in uniforms: symbolising royalty to the emperor in addition creating an stiff and hard impression. 

=== '''5. Throughout the book, there are instances in which characters who are initially portrayed as villains are later shown in a sympathetic light. Select and describe a passage where this occurs. What do you believe Nakazawa was trying to achieve?''' ===

When Koji encounters a man who tries to injure him shares his experience and feelings with him (pg. 142-161): there are sympathetic light on the man to emphasize the tragedy and the situation of the war - how they are forced to volunteer to be the Kamikaze pilots and how the man doesn’t want to die. It also shows how the citizens are forced to think that contribution to war and sacrificing your life is something to be proud of. Through this experience, Koji realizes his father was right all along and war brought nothing but misery to the people

=== '''6. Barefoot Gen’s main focus is the Nakaoka family; the story unfolds through their words, thoughts and actions. At times, a separate narrative voice is present, in the form of captions. This unknown narrator conveys information beyond the family’s experience, such as facts about the war. How well do these two storytelling approaches work together?''' ===

The two storytelling approaches work well together. This is because we get the insight of the Nakaoka Family and their struggles that are because of the war. We learn about their struggles and their experiences for wanting the war to end. They are called traitors for despising war, but nevertheless, want nothing more than to end it.
Having a narrator that is not the main character while we also see the story from the families point of view (main character) is very good as it enables us to see the story from different perspectives.  As the Nakaoka family generally disagrees to war it is good to see a general perspective.  it enables the reader to interpret the story in an unbiased  way understanding the story to a deeper extent.  on the other hand it can also intensify the emotions of the reader as seeing the anti-war Nakaoka family with the Pro-war people around them which the unknown narrator explains, expresses the desperate situation of the family even more.   
There are few moments where the story is narrated by supporting characters which gives readers an opportunity to see the ways other people perceived with struggles in their lives during the war.

=== '''7. The pages of this book are filled with scenes of violence – from childish brawls to cruel beatings. Even within the Nakaoka family, violence is normal (look at page 1!). This is common in manga, but how did the amount of violence affect you as a reader? How did it affect your sympathy for Gen and his family?''' ===

The amount of violence in Barefoot Gen was essential in order to make the reader feel rather excited than shocked. In most of the scenes where violence is used, Mr Nakazawa used onomatopoeia and visualizing things that you can’t see, such as the shock when the father hits Gen and Shinji on the head.
The Japanese are more accepting towards physical punishment. A stereotypical character in manga or anime, especially in the old ones, are depicted as an “enthusiastic teacher”. They are commonly portrayed as muscular men who may look scary or mean at first glance because they give physical punishments. But the students later finds out that the teacher was punishing them for their own sake, to teach them what is wrong to do, etc. The teacher soon becomes the most popular teacher amongst students because he can empathise with them, and at the end of the story, the students and the teacher run towards the sunset. As seen in this example, Japanese culture is quite forgiving when it comes to violence that are done for others instead of own satisfaction. In addition, the fact that Gen and Shinji are smiling but crying at the same time when their father punch them makes the violence seem less painful. However, in scenes where the children are abused for unjust reasons (E.g. pg.174 the police officer stops them from eating sweet potatoes), Gen and Shinji are not smiling. This made me feel very bad for them because it looked very painful, and as violence to the Nakaoka family were repeated throughout the book, their impression changed to victims. 

=== '''8. Though this story has a large cast of characters and many subplots, Gen plays the central role. Describe Gen and the pivotal role he plays throughout the novel.''' ===

Gen is also a symbol of hope and happiness. He plays the central role, as he has a huge impact in relation to the development or success of the rest of the characters that appear throughout the text. The small anecdotes and subplots are mostly based on the justice Gen creates. Whether it’s a feud or an obstacle, Gen confronts the villains. For example, Gen and Shinji skips school and acts like beggars in the streets in order to get money for their sick mother. The pure intention of Gen is what the author hoped for the readers (especially the youths) to capture: almost acting as a moral or theme for the book.  But Gen is still a child, and so he is highly gullible and believe anything that his teachers tell him, even if it is a form of propaganda, as in false education to mislead the children so that they stay obedient to the country. Through his interactions with various people of that time, we get to see a side of Hiroshima that everyone subconsciously knows exists, but wishes to not see.


=== '''9. Symbolism is characteristic of Japanese comics; in Barefoot Gen it takes the form of a reappearing sun that glares through the pages. It is the marker of time passing, the giver of life, and the flag of Japan. Find as many instances of the sun as you can and analyse what it represents in the examples.''' ===

8 – The sun is a symbol of safety in this page, after the US fighter planes fly away from the city, allowing the people to continue with their lives. With the sun shining bright without any clouds, it gives a sense of normality (of the weather and the people’s activity).

14 30 31 34 39  – This sun has some dark clouds around it, forecasting a twist in the story that will affect the Nakaoka family a difficult time. As it is drawn the same way as the sun from page 8, it gives a comparison.

35 75 78 127 139 163 - The sun has lines spreading from the center. The spiky sun appears before the members of the family feels anger towards a person or the society.

61 64 179 – The shady sun appears when the family has a peaceful, quiet, happy time. It also appears as the end of the sub plots, and the sun represents the afternoon.

==Background: Author's life and experience==
Keiji Nakazawa was born on March 14, 1939 and died on December 19th, 2012 when he was 73. When Nakazawa was young his father was imprisoned during the war for his &quot;anti war activities.&quot; Him and his family were viewed as traitors. Nakazawa was in first grade when the first bomb was dropped in 1945, kill around 70,000 people in the blast alone. Nakazawa’s father, older sister and younger brother were killed in it. He was only 1.2 km away from where the bomb had hit, but he was saved by a wall of a building which shielded him from the flash of heat, that would have killed him. After the bomb had been dropped Keiji's mother, Kimiyo (pregnant at the time), seeing her husband, daughter and son burning alive tried to kill herself in the fire as well, so she could die with them, but was stopped by the neighbors. The extreme amount of shock make Kimiyo give birth before dated to a baby girl, who ended up dying 4 months later.

After the war Nakazawa would gather scraps of metal and glass which he would sell for money. That is when he was brought into the world of manga, when he started to read Osamu Tezuk's 'Now Legendary New Treasure Island' in 1947. Influenced by his father, Nakazawa loved to draw. In 5th grade he had made, and presented his own manga called 'Paper Dramas.' His 5th grade teacher also helped inspire him to become a manga artist. After finishing junior high he improved his drawing skills by painting every day in the evenings and watching 3 movies in a row at the local cinema, learning from them. He would also submit all of his work to magazines such as 'Omoshiro Bukku' (&quot;Funny Book&quot;)

In 1961, at the age of 22, with only $600 in his pocket,Nakazawa moved to Tokyo and started working as an assistant to the manga creator Daiji Kazumine. 2 years later Nakazawa made his own debut in the magazine 'Shonen Gaho' (&quot;Boys' Illustrated.&quot;) Wanting a fresh start in Tokyo he wrote a story about car racing. He purposely did not write about the atomic bomb because growing up as a survivor of the bomb was not easy. Even his earlier pieces did not hint to his tragic past. In 1963, his direction in manga completely changed. This was caused by his mothers death from the effects of radiation poisoning. Only 8 months later Nakazawa's got married to Misayo Yamane, following traditional cremation, burning the body and putting certain bones that shouldn't burn in the family grave, but the bones were degraded by radiation and only a fine powder remained.

In rage Nakazawa returned to Tokyo and in inspiration wrote 'Kuroi ame ni utarete' (&quot;Pelted By Black Rain&quot;). The story about a 13 year old boy, a specialized assassin with killing americans. With his clouded mind he did not think this through clearly. The story was rejected by every publisher he went to.

In 1967 his first was born, which made him to work at a very fast paste, still trying to get 'Pelted By Black Rain' published and still having a clouded mind writing stories with unifying themes. All he made was about anger and mad grief. Targeted at the U.S., Japanese government, weapon makers and war profiteers. The characters he wrote into his story were normal, flawed people that are angry.
In the 1970’s the leukemia rates were higher than usual, which then inspired Nakazawa to write a story about a Hiroshima survivor that has a son that develops leukemia and dies. After finishing the 60 page draft he gave it to the editor for editing. After he was done reading it he broke into tears because it was so emotional. He then told Nakazawa that he should make the story 80 pages long which had never been done before. He later in 1972 wrote his most dramatic story, ‘Ore wa mita’ (“I Saw It!”) a 48 page story, which was the first time he had ever written down his own experiences of the atomic bombing of HIroshima in pictures and words. Then soon after he started his best selling novel ‘Barefoot Gen’

By the end of the 1970’s Nakazawa had stopped writing and drawing all together when he was diagnosed with diabetes. It made it very difficult for him to draw and when the cataract surgery failed to improve his eyesight, he finally retired from writing, drawing and the creating manga in 2009.

==The Weekly Jump==
The Weekly Jump is one of the most famous comic magazine in Japan, releasing many well-known comics to the world. The Weekly Jump is famous for its “questionnaire supremacy policy”, the policy of deciding if a series continues by the number of reader votes it receives, and will stop a series if it does not receive enough votes for a certain period of time. Barefoot Gen did not do receive as much support from the readers. After it was cut off the Weekly Jump in 1974, over 10 books of the series were published from a few publishers over a 14 year period. The comic appeared on magazines supported by the Japanese Communist Party which supported the anti-nuclear message of the comic. It was also published on the magazine of the Japan Teacher’s Union, and received support from teachers all around Japan. By this support, Barefoot Gen was the only comic allowed in school, gaining young readers who wanted to read comics in school. Nakazawa continued to create the series, until he announced his retirement in 2009 due to his illness

Barefoot Gen started off as an one-shot comic called “おれは見た(ore-wa-mita “I Saw It”)” as part of project of the Monthly Jump (not the same as the Weekly Jump) asking comic writers to write autobiographical comics in 1972. This one-shot comic later later developed into the series “Barefoot Gen” in 1973 which was put on the Weekly Jump as it received support from the editor of the magazine. Nakazawa used no assistants as he believed that was the best way to best express his thoughts.
Barefoot Gen is structured in a short story form as it was first published in the Weekly Jump. As it is a weekly magazine, comics often appear with a short story every week so the readers do not get bored of the series, but have an overall main plot that develops over a period of time, resulting in the structure Barefoot Gen has. This is a common format many comic that appear on weekly magazines follow, as it keeps the readers interested while developing the overall plot of the comic.

==Background: Author’s Purpose and Philosophy==

	Nakazawa Keiji the writer of ‘Barefoot Gen’, wrote the book in such a way as children, young adults and even adults enjoyable  and attracts attention about the war. He had also written this story based by himself and what he have experienced.  

First he has written this book based on the story of his life and telling the readers what similar events have happened to him. For example his family died because they became trapped under the debris of their house but his mother still lives with his baby sister which have died 4 months later. In the comic Nakazawa put down all of his experiences and feelings. Genn`s family died  the same way with but lives with his mother and baby sister.

Secondly he wrote this book in manga because of 2 main reasons. Firstly, the reason is that he have already been writing manga for a long period of time and Jump Shounenn Manga was popular so he thought he could use that to make the book more famous for young people that are interested in mangas and make them know how the war can affect your whole life even the country. So he would let them know so when they grow up they won't think that the war is the solution to everything and will spend their lives so easily in war.

{{Navigation|previous=Pace|next=Onomatopoeia}}


==Manga Conventions: Thought Bubble==

Thought bubbles, also called Fukidashi in Japanese, are usually used for expressing the thoughts of characters. Some manga authors come up with their original thought bubbles, but their fundamental basics are same enough for the readers to notice that the character is thinking in his or her head.
	
	There are two basic types of thought bubbles:
 One is a very common and widely-accepted thought bubble that resembles a cloud. This thought bubble comes with small circles that connect the person's head to the thought bubble.

Another type is a thought bubble that is more commonly used in manga. The thought bubble is an oval that has lines going out from it, and text in the centre of the thought bubble. It is usually used to express character’s voice or opinion that is powerful although other characters cannot hear it. This type is also used to express telepathy. These thought bubbles are placed close to the character who is speaking. As stated before, authors of manga can create their original thought bubble. For example, instead of lines, it can be dots that is radiating, or just fuzzy outline which is often used in Shojo Manga (manga for young girls).

‘Barefoot Gen’ uses thought bubble in shape of a cloud, but it is rarely used in the book.Usually, thought bubbles are used often to express the character’s opinion, because it is not a conversation and the characters do not feel the need to share their opinion. For example, it will be unrealistic if the character suddenly starts talking to a nearby person about the day’s weather. But in ‘Barefoot Gen’, although many views and opinions are expressed, they always talk about it to somebody or something. This can be seen in page 104, where Gen’s father begs to stop the war. Gen’s father looks in the direction of Iwakuni where Americans are bombing, and it seems as though Gen’s father is talking to the Americans or the war itself. The only situations where thought bubbles are used are when the character is thinking to themselves about personal things. Such as when they are offending somebody else. An example of this is in page 63 of ‘Barefoot Gen’, where both Gen and the chairman insults at each other, but without saying it out loud. It can be inferred that Keiji Nakazawa used speech bubbles for when he wants a strong message delivered to the readers. And because there are many strong messages concerning war and peace, many characters, especially the Nakazawa family speaks their mind out.

==Manga conventions dialogue bubble==
Dialogue ballons are a graphic convention used most commonly in manga books,comic strips and strips and cartoons to allow words to be understand as representing the dialogue of a given character in the comic.
-Speak tails are small,dedicate or even missing,usually over character’s head.The normal talk’s bubble are circles with tails.


Bubbles representing different character’s dialogue features different edge designs.One character’s dialogue might be inside perfectly oval dialogue bubbles,while their companion’s dialogue falls into a geometric shape.

 
If a character is upset ,the text bubble must be jagged

'''The elementary working of Public Key Cryptography is best explained with an example.   The working below covers the making of simple keys and the encryption and decryption of a sample of plain text.   By necessity, the example is greatly simplified.   In the examples it is assumed that an encrypted message is to be sent from Site A to Site B.''' 
==Basic Public Key Summary==
*Public key encryption is used for internet secure links, such as when a browser opens a bank site or a site used with credit cards.      Such addresses are prefixed by ''https'' as opposed to just ''http''.  An example of the protocol is RSA-OpenSSL, an open source application that handles encrypted links for both secure servers and browsers.   The address field for ''this'' Wikibooks page shows the ''https'' marker that shows it is secure.
*Each site has an encryption key and a decryption key of its own, termed the public and private keys respectively.  These are essentially very large numbers.   These keys are always different, giving rise to the term asymmetrical encryption.   In fact whenever we say ''key'' we mean a pair of numbers comprising the key; a key number to use in the raising of powers and another number that is the modulus of the arithmetic to be used for the work.
*Public keys are openly available for anybody to see, but private keys are not.  The destination site sends his public key to the sender, early in the process of setting up the link.
*For each message transmission the sender uses the intended ''recipient's'' public key to make the code.   In that way only the private key of the recipient will decrypt it.   See the worked example in the text below.
*The numbers used are made deliberately very large, and the factorization of very large numbers is very time consuming.     This makes the task of obtaining the private key from the public key too difficult for a hacker.
*Such a system finds use when the time to crack a code far exceeds the date when the data is considered useful.
*Signed digital certificates help certify the identity of user sites and are also used to deliver public keys.  Browsers take steps to confirm their validity.  
*The main advantage of the public key system is that there is a low administrative burden.   Everything needed to send a message to a site is available in a public directory or is sent openly as a part of setting up the link.
*The main disadvantage of public key cryptography is that is too slow for modern internet use.  Because of this, the internet most often uses symmetric encryption for the main task and uses public key methods for the symmetric key exchange.
*There are several methods that hackers use to break coding:
**The ''brute force'' cracking of a key refers to trying every possible combination of ''private key'' while testing it against the relevant cyphertext.
**A ''mathematical'' attack refers to the prime factoring of the public key modulus, with a view to then finding the private key;   it has the advantage that it does not require testing until the key is found.    At the time of writing (2014) the record for breaking a key is a  mathematical attack by Lenstra et al, on 12 December 2009, when an RSA-768 bit modulus (232 decimal digits) was factored using a General Number Field Sieve (GNFS).   The process required two years of collaboration and many hundreds of computing machines. (see: http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/006.pdf)  Today most encryption keys in use are much bigger than the one that was broken, and a 1024 or 2048-bit key in an SSL certificate is still considered fairly safe against a mathematical attack.   Note that the difficulty of breaking such a key increases ''exponentially'' with the key length.
**Most security intrusions have tended to involve the hacking of the servers for their data and private keys, or reliance on the security omissions of individuals, rather than code cracking.

==Making Site B's PUBLIC Key==
''A recipient's public key used by any who want to send them an encrypted message''.

*Each site's computer produces two very large prime numbers, and since they are the basis of all that follows, these numbers are never revealed to any other. (''Prime numbers are those that have no factors other than themselves or unity'').
*These two numbers are multiplied together to produce the modulus used in all of that site's calculations. The main public key is also derived from these primes, and determines the exponent to which the plain language numbers will be raised. 
*This public key is available in directories and from certificate authorities, so when the SENDER wants to encrypt a message by public key cryptography he can easily use the ''recipient's '' public key (and modulus) to do it.  Each site's public key and modulus are almost certainly different.

To illustrate the point for an intending recipient, let us make a simple example with the large prime numbers replaced with very small ones.

Say the two secretly held prime numbers are:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;p = 5  ,  q = 11&lt;/pre&gt;    
Then the modulus of the arithmetic that will be used is given by their product:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;m = 5  x  11 = 55    (the modulus of the arithmetic to use)&lt;/pre&gt;
The encryption key can be found as follows:
First, using the two prime numbers, calculate the function:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;   f(n)  = (p-1) x (q-1)
&amp;#8757; p = 5 and q = 11    
&amp;there4; f(n) = (5-1) x (11-1)
&amp;there4; f(n) =  40&lt;/pre&gt;
then,&lt;br&gt;
Select ANY number that is ''relatively prime'' to f(n) and less than it.&lt;br&gt;

(''Two numbers are said to be '''relatively prime''' when they share no common factors other than one.   This term is also  referred to as '''mutually prime''', or '''coprime''' ''). 
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt; The possible choices become:
 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, 29, 31, 33, 37, and 39.

 Select public encrypt key =  7&lt;/pre&gt;
The receiving site's PUBLIC key can be safely given to the world as : 
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;(7, 55) as (encryption exponent, modulus)
(In practice the numbers would be much very larger)&lt;/pre&gt;

The term 1024-bit RSA encryption refers to the size in bits of the modulus; this is equivalent to a decimal number of about 308 digits, or 256 hex digits.   The public ''exponent'' most often chosen is 01 00 01, with an integer value 65537, Fermat Number F4.   This exponent is chosen because it produces faster encryption than some other selections, perhaps because it helps to avoid some of the more common selection errors that are made.

==Making Site B's Private KEY==
''Used by Site B when decrypting messages that were sent to them, encrypted using Site B's public key''.

The private key pair is used to decrypt messages, and this key will only work if the public key of the same site was used to encrypt the message.   That is to say, Site B's public key is obtained from a directory, then used by Site A to encrypt a message for them.   When the message gets to Site B, Site B uses its own private key for decryption.   

Continuing with the simple example above, the private key of Site B is made from its  public key as follows.
&lt;poem  style=&quot;color:black;font-size:1.3em;border:1px lightgrey solid;padding:12px;background:rgb(249,249,249);font-family:courier;&quot;&gt;   private decrypt key =  (public encrypt key)&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Mod f(n)
&amp;#8757; public encrypt key = 7 , and f(n) = 40
&amp;there4; (private decrypt key x 7) Mod 40 = 1       
&amp;there4; private decrypt key  = 23

  The Site B PRIVATE key pair is then:
  (23,55)  as (decryption exponent, modulus)&lt;/poem&gt;
It will have been noted by some that the same number can result for both the encrypt and decrypt exponents. This particular case must be avoided by deliberate testing since a hacker would likely test for this possibility early in the process of an attack.     In the above examples, this would have been the case if 9, 11, 21, 33 or 39 were chosen for the public key instead of some other.   Some  selections of coprimes that are themselves prime (eg; leading to: 11 * 11 = 1 mod 40), and those that are coprime but not in themselves prime (eg; 9, 21, 33, and 39), all produce this insecure state of affairs. 

With the use of long primes, m the modulus (their product), is very much longer, but it should be apparent that an intending hacker could still obtain the private key if he were able to find the two secret primes as a starting point.   Both the public key and the modulus to use with it are given to all who require it for encryption, so the burden of a mathematical attack reduces to the difficulty of factoring the modulus into these two secret primes.   For the simple example shown above (m=55) this task is very simple, but for a very large number this effort is prohibitively long.

The native format in which the private key is delivered is in fact base-64.  Unlike the public key string, [http://etherhack.co.uk/asymmetric/docs/rsa_key_breakdown.html '''the layout of a practical private key string'''] for a 1024-bit RSA encryption contains the private key details, the public key details, and the secret numbers used in their making, as well as various other numbers and headers.   The private key ''exponent'', unlike the public exponent, is quite long, and is the equivalent of 256 hex digits in length. The secret primes are each 128 hex numbers in length.  The decimal equivalent lengths are 308 digits for the ''private'' exponent (and the modulus), and 154 digits for each of the ''secret numbers''.

==Factoring the Modulus==
One way of factoring the modulus without any other algorithm to assist, is to simply divide the modulus by a succession of increasing primes until a zero remainder results.   Then the two primes would be known.   However the number of primes is also very high in such a large modulus. In general the following approximation gives the number of primes in the number x as:&lt;poem  style=&quot;color:black;font-size:1.3em;border:1px lightgrey solid;padding:12px;background:rgb(249,249,249);font-family:courier;&quot;&gt;   number of primes &amp;cong; x/(logx - 1)
   now a 64 bit space is equivalent to about 20 digits
&amp;there4; number of primes &amp;cong; 4 * 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;
   then assuming 1 million calculations per second:  
   the time to test half of the primes &amp;cong; 12000 years&lt;/poem&gt;

The example here was limited to 64 bits because the more representative figures, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and 2048-bit calculations are too big for most calculators.  See [http://www.digicert.com/TimeTravel/math.htm '''The Math Behind Estimations to Break a 2048-bit Certificate'''] by DigiCert for more details.

This example does not consider the use of improved algorithms for factoring, and these appear frequently in the literature.  At present, (2014), the best of these is considered to be the General Number Field Sieve (GNFS), used to establish the [http://www.digicert.com/TimeTravel/math.htm '''record in December 2009'''].

==Encryption with B's Public Key==
Assume that the public key pair belong to a Site B.  Assume also that a plain language character represented by the number '2' is to be encrypted by Site A and sent to the recipient Site B:   Site A uses Site B's public key pair to do so. 
&lt;poem  style=&quot;color:black;font-size:1.3em;border:1px lightgrey solid;padding:12px;background:rgb(249,249,249);font-family:courier;&quot;&gt;   Assume plaintext=2
   cyphertext = plaintext &lt;sup&gt;public encrypt key&lt;/sup&gt; Mod n
&amp;#8757; public encrypt key =7, and modulus = 55
&amp;there4; cyphertext = 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Mod 55 = 128 Mod 55
&amp;there4; cyphertext  = 18&lt;/poem&gt;
With the very small numbers used in the example the cracking of the code would be relatively simple.   But for very large values of primes ''p'' and ''q'', and without knowing the private key value, the burden becomes very difficult.  In some cases the task would involve an unreasonable time even for a very large number of computers.

Public key encryption does not disguise the relative frequency of the characters used.   This is considered a failing in such systems since it improves the chances of cracking the code.   So, the plaintext characters are arranged into groups before encryption to hide their natural frequencies of use;  the groups are very large, the limit being that the size of a number encrypted must be smaller than the modulus in use.

==Decryption with B's Private Key== 
Decryption using the above specific example is acheived as follows:
For the received cyphertext = 18
&lt;poem style=&quot;color:black;font-size:1.3em;border:1px lightgrey solid;padding:12px;background:rgb(249,249,249);font-family:courier;&quot;&gt;   With cyphertext=18 from previous section
   Plaintext = cyphertext&lt;sup&gt;private decrypt key&lt;/sup&gt; Mod n
&amp;#8757; private decrypt key =23, and modulus = 55
&amp;there4; Plaintext = 18&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; Mod 55 =  74347713614021927913318776832 Mod 55
&amp;there4; Plaintext = 2&lt;/poem&gt; 
which is the required result.

==The Internet Speed Compromise==
Because public key encryption and decryption is so very slow, it is unsuitable in its native form for internet use.   In fact,  asymmetric public key encryption is used for only a small part of internet communications.   Such systems are ''hybrid''.   The summary of the method used is as follows:
*The text to be transmitted securely is first encrypted, not by public key cryptography, but by using SYMMETRIC key encryption.   This is typically a 128 bit cipher, but can be greater.   Symmetric key methods need both sites to use the same key.   To do this one site must at some stage originate the key then send a copy of it to the other.
*The SYMMETRIC key itself, the key used to encrypt this plaintext, is in fact encrypted using PUBLIC key encryption.   The public key of the destination site is used for this.   Both the encrypted text (with its SYMMETRIC coding) and the encrypted SYMMETRIC key (with its ASYMMETRIC coding) are sent to the recipient.
*The recipient uses his PRIVATE key to recover the SYMMETRIC key value, then decrypts the main ciphertext with it.
*The ''symmetric'' encryption key is discarded at the end of the current session, and the asymmetric public key may or may not be discarded, depending on the system in use.   This reduces the chances of a successful key recovery during cyber-attacks and the subsequent decoding of recorded traffic at a later date.   With this in mind, it might be that ''short'' sessions are more secure than ''long'' ones, provided of course that ''discarded'' means the complete ''removal from memory'', and not just the ubiquitous ''delete''.  
The systems currently in use for internet browsers are Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).  A complete description of these is available at Wikipedia's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer|'''Secure Sockets Layer'''].

==Message Authentication==
Security breaks down if outsiders can change the message in transit, or if they mis-represent themselves right from the start.   In an attempt to overcome these risks digital certificates were devised.   In a further attempt to ensure that the certificates were from the place respected by the users, the certificates were given digital signatures.   One such method among many is the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), the basis of the Digital Signature Standard (DSS). 

Hash values are made for message content and are said to be so complex in their construction that new messages could not be made by outsiders to represent an existing value.   Because of this they provide a basis upon which to verify that a message's contents were not changed since the certificate was issued.

Certificates themselves are tested against known root certificates within the browser store, to ensure that the certificates are from a known reliable source.   If certificates are signed with a private key known only to the issuing authority, then validation of the certificate can be made by decrypting the signature with its public key.   That is to say, the two keys used for encryption and decryption can be reversed in their purpose; the function is reversible.

The actual process used for these tasks is more complex than is implied in summary, involving many long-bit calculations, but the strength of the system is unlikely to satisfy the skeptical until the sums are seen.   Refer to the pdf file [http://www.tatanka.com/bionic_buffalo/original/archive/document/technote/tn0035.pdf '''How Encryption and Digital Signatures Work'''] and read the section ''An Example of a Digital Signature Mechanism'' for such a description.   

The process of testing certificates and other matters are in any case summarized by browsers for their users.  Browsers will indicate clearly whether or not they consider a connection to be secure.  The most common of these indications includes an added padlock somewhere on the screen and the modification of the site's ''http'' address heading to read ''https''.   Some browsers such as Opera add other information such as color coding to represent the levels of security.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Motivation =
You have data stored in a Google Docs spreadsheet.  Since Google docs has an RSS feed for their data you can use this service to get well-formed XML about your spreadsheet directly from XQuery.

= Method =
You can use the base URL of 'https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/' to list the data in a public spreadsheet.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $base-uri := 'https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/'
let $document-id := '0AsuPP847sJrUdEdwcVdHeUZ1Sm80dEc1eWZHQkwyZlE'
let $suffix := '/od6/public/basic'
&lt;/source&gt; 

you can concat these three strings together and wrap them in an '''xs:anyURI''' type to get the document using the httpcleint:get() function.

= Example Code =

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace atom=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom&quot;;

let $http-get :=
   httpclient:get(

     true(), ())
 
 return
 &lt;results&gt;
    Number Entries: { count($http-get//atom:entry) }
 &lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Which returns:

==Order Ophioglossales==

The order '''{{fny-w|Ophioglossales}}'''...

=== Family Ophioglossaceae ===

The {{fny-w|Ophioglossaceae}} (adder's-tongue family) comprises primitive ferns that have traditionally been considered part of a group informally known as fern-allies. In New York, the family is represented by about a dozen native species, all of which are listed as protected plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{fny-ref|DEC}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genus ''Botrychium''====

The genus ''Botrychium'' contains the moonworts, grapeferns, and rattlesnake ferns, each of which is treated here as a subgenus of ''Botrychium''.  These groups are also sometimes treated as separate genera within the Ophioglossaceae.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Reflection|Tips and Tricks}}

A basic issue in programming is [[w:Resource management (computing)|resource management]]: a [[w:Resource (computing)|resource]] is anything in limited supply, notably file handles, {{wp|network socket}}s, locks, etc., and a key problem is making sure these are ''released'' after they are ''acquired.'' If they are not released, you have a {{wp|resource leak}}, and the system may slow down or crash. More generally, you may want cleanup actions to always be done, other than simply releasing resources.

Python provides special syntax for this in [https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement the &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement], which automatically manages resources encapsulated within [http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typecontextmanager context manager types], or more generally performs startup and cleanup actions around a block of code. You should  '''always''' use a &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement for resource management. There are many built-in context manager types, include the basic example of &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt;, and it is easy to write your own. The code is not hard, but the concepts are slightly subtle, and it is easy to make mistakes.

==Basic resource management==
Basic resource management uses an explicit pair of &lt;code&gt;open()...close()&lt;/code&gt; functions, as in basic file opening and closing. '''''Don’t do this,''''' for the reasons we are about to explain:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
f = open(filename)
# ...
f.close()
&lt;/source&gt;
The key problem with this simple code is that it fails if there is an early return, either due to a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement or an exception, possibly raised by called code. To fix this, ensuring that the cleanup code is called when the block is exited, one uses a &lt;code&gt;try...finally&lt;/code&gt; clause:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
f = open(filename)
try:
    # ...
finally:
    f.close()
&lt;/source&gt;
However, this still requires manually releasing the resource, which might be forgotten, and the release code is distant from the acquisition code. The release can be done automatically by instead using &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt;, which works because &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; is a context manager type:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
with open(filename) as f:
    # ...
&lt;/source&gt;
This assigns the value of &lt;code&gt;open(filename)&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; (this point is subtle and varies between context managers), and then automatically releases the resource, in this case calling &lt;code&gt;f.close()&lt;/code&gt;, when the block exits.

==Technical details==
Newer objects are ''context managers'' (formally [http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typecontextmanager context manager types]: subtypes, as they implement the context manager interface, which consists of &lt;code&gt;__enter__(), __exit__()&lt;/code&gt;), and thus can be used in &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statements easily (see [http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#with-statement-context-managers With Statement Context Managers]).

For older file-like objects that have a &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt; method but not &lt;code&gt;__exit__()&lt;/code&gt;, you can use the &lt;code&gt;[http://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.closing @contextlib.closing]&lt;/code&gt; decorator. If you need to roll your own, this is very easy, particularly using the &lt;code&gt;[http://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager @contextlib.contextmanager]&lt;/code&gt; decorator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6884991/how-to-delete-dir-created-by-python-tempfile-mkdtemp/22726782#22726782 Nils von Barth’s] answer to “[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6884991/how-to-delete-dir-created-by-python-tempfile-mkdtemp how to delete dir created by python tempfile.mkdtemp]”, ''StackOverflow''&lt;/ref&gt;

Context managers work by calling &lt;code&gt;__enter__()&lt;/code&gt; when the &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; context is entered, binding the return value to the target of &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt;, and calling &lt;code&gt;__exit__()&lt;/code&gt; when the context is exited. There’s some subtlety about handling exceptions during exit, but you can ignore it for simple use.

More subtly, &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; is called when an object is created, but &lt;code&gt;__enter__()&lt;/code&gt; is called when a &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; context is entered.

The &lt;code&gt;__init__()/__enter__()&lt;/code&gt; distinction is important to distinguish between [http://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#single-use-reusable-and-reentrant-context-managers single use, reusable and reentrant context managers]. It’s not a meaningful distinction for the common use case of instantiating an object in the &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; clause, as follows:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
with A() as a:
    ...
&lt;/source&gt;
…in which case any single use context manager is fine.

However, in general it is a difference, notably when distinguishing a reusable context manager from the resource it is managing, as in here:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
a_cm = A()
with a_cm as a:
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;
Putting resource acquisition in &lt;code&gt;__enter__()&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; gives a [http://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#reusable-context-managers  reusable context manager].

Notably, &lt;code&gt;File()&lt;/code&gt; objects do the initialization in &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; and then just returns itself when entering a context, as in &lt;code&gt;def __enter__(): return self&lt;/code&gt;. This is fine if you want the target of the &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; to be bound to an ''object'' (and allows you to use factories like &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; as the source of the &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; clause), but if you want it to be bound to something else, notably a ''handle'' (file name or file handle/file descriptor), you want to wrap the actual object in a separate context manager. For example:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
@contextmanager
def FileName(*args, **kwargs):
   with File(*args, **kwargs) as f:
       yield f.name
&lt;/source&gt;

For simple uses you don’t need to do any &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; code, and only need to pair &lt;code&gt;__enter__()/__exit__()&lt;/code&gt;. For more complicated uses you can have [http://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#reentrant-context-managers reentrant context managers], but that’s not necessary for simple use.

==Caveats==
===&lt;code&gt;try...finally&lt;/code&gt;===
Note that a &lt;code&gt;try...finally&lt;/code&gt; clause ''is'' necessary with &lt;code&gt;@contextlib.contextmanager&lt;/code&gt;, as this does not catch any exceptions raised after the &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt;, but is ''not'' necessary in &lt;code&gt;__exit__()&lt;/code&gt;, which is called even if an exception is raised.

===Context, not scope===
The term ''context'' manager is carefully chosen, particularly in contrast to “scope”. Local variables in Python have function scope, and thus the target of a &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement, if any, is still visible after the block has exited, though &lt;code&gt;__exit__()&lt;/code&gt; has already been called on the context manager (the argument of the &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement), and thus is often not useful or valid. This is a technical point, but it’s worth distinguishing the &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement context from the overall function scope.

===Not RAII===
{{wp|Resource Acquisition Is Initialization}} is an alternative form of resource management, particularly used in C++. In RAII, resources are acquired during object construction, and released during object destruction. In Python the analogous functions are &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ __del__()]&lt;/code&gt; (finalizer), but RAII does ''not'' work in Python, and releasing resources in &lt;code&gt;__del__()&lt;/code&gt; does ''not'' work. This is because there is no guarantee that &lt;code&gt;__del__()&lt;/code&gt; will be called: it’s just for memory manager use, not for resource handling.

In more detail, Python object construction is two-phase, consisting of (memory) allocation in &lt;code&gt;__new__()&lt;/code&gt; and (attribute) initialization in &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt;. Python is garbage-collected via reference counting, with objects being finalized (not destructed) by &lt;code&gt;__del__()&lt;/code&gt;. However, finalization is non-deterministic (objects have non-deterministic lifetimes), and the finalizer may be called much later or not at all, particularly if the program crashes. Thus using &lt;code&gt;__del__()&lt;/code&gt; for resource management will generally leak resources.

It is possible to use finalizers for resource management, but the resulting code is implementation-dependent (generally working in CPython but not other implementations, such as PyPy) and fragile to version changes. Even if this is done, it requires great care to ensure references drop to zero in all circumstances, including: exceptions, which contain references in tracebacks if caught or if running interactively; and references in global variables, which last until program termination. Prior to Python 3.4, finalizers on objects in cycles were also a serious problem, but this is no longer a problem; however, finalization of objects in cycles is not done in a deterministic order.

|current=Exact Sequences
|next=Homology Groups}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

An exact sequence is a tool used in Algebraic Topology used to extract information from a sequence of chain groups.

==Definition==

Given a sequence of groups &lt;math&gt;G_1,G_2,\dots,G_n&lt;/math&gt; and homomorphisms

:&lt;math&gt;G_1\xrightarrow{h_1}G_2\xrightarrow{h_2}\cdots\xrightarrow{h_{n-1}}G_n&lt;/math&gt;

is an exact sequence if &lt;math&gt;im(h_n)=ker(h_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;1\geq k&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the sequence can be infinite.

Given an exact sequence of chain groups, with this indexing

:&lt;math&gt;\cdots \xrightarrow{\partial_2} C_2 \xrightarrow{\partial_1} C_1  \xrightarrow{\partial_0} C_0 &lt;/math&gt;

we have a ''chain complex''.

==Short Exact Sequence==

Given the special case where we have 3 groups with the following homomorphisms

:&lt;math&gt;G_1\xrightarrow{h_1}G_2\xrightarrow{h_2}G_3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt; is a one-one homomorphism and &lt;math&gt;h_2&lt;/math&gt; is an onto homomorphism, we have a ''short exact sequence''. Short exact sequences have the property &lt;math&gt;G_3\cong G_2/h_1(G_1)&lt;/math&gt;.

A ''homology group'' is a group derived from a space's chain complex.

==Definition==

Given a chain complex

:&lt;math&gt;\cdots\xrightarrow{\partial_2}C_2\xrightarrow{\partial_1}C_1\xrightarrow{\partial_0}C_0&lt;/math&gt;

the n-th homology group is

:&lt;math&gt;H_n=Ker(\partial_n)/Im(\partial_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt;. We have a similar situation to the fundamental group.

{{TextBox|1=
;Theorem:
A continuous function on topological spaces &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; always induces homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;f_*:H_n(X)\to H_n(Y)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a homeomorphism, &lt;math&gt;f_*&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism.

:&lt;math&gt;0\to C_\bullet(A) \to C_\bullet(X)\to C_\bullet(X) /C_\bullet(A)  \to 0&lt;/math&gt;

meaning we can define the ''relative homology'' as &lt;math&gt;H_n(X/A)\cong H_n(C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A))&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TopNav|prev=Introduction|next=Objects}}

NetRadiant's two main methods of viewing, creating, and editing [[NetRadiant/Objects|objects]] are the 2D view and the camera view.

==Grid==

NetRadiant uses grids to simplify accurate positioning of objects; the grid size (the distance between grid/snap lines) can be adjusted with the ''Grid'' menu or with the {{key|1}} to {{key|9}} keys. All objects will snap to the grid spacing; if an object is halfway between two grid lines, it will not snap to the grid lines. Instead, it will move one full grid unit at a time, always staying halfway between two grid lines.

The grid is used in both the 2D and the 3D view.

==2D view==

The 2D view is located in the left half of the window by default. It shows an orthographic view of the map from either the top, the front, or the side. All map objects are shown as wireframe in the 2D view.

To pan, right-click and drag; the cursor will disappear and you can drag as far as you want without the mouse exiting the window. (The [[NetRadiant/Textures|texture view]] also allows panning with right-click and drag.)

To cycle through the top/front/side views (which are also known as the YZ, ZX, and ZY views because of the &quot;slice&quot; of the map they show), press {{key|Ctrl}}-{{key|Tab}}.

==Camera view==

The camera view is a 3D viewport; its controls are similar to first-person shooter games. Unlike the 2D view, all brushes are fully textured, although shaders are not used. The camera view can be controlled with either the mouse or keyboard shortcuts.

To lock the mouse cursor so that you can look around, right-click anywhere in the camera window. Right-click again to unlock the cursor. To move forwards and backwards, you can scroll up and down with your scroll wheel. Note that the mouse doesn't need to be locked to move forwards and backwards with the scroll wheel.

There are three axes along which the camera view can be manipulated; left-right, up-down, and forwards-back. To strafe (move left-right), press {{key|,}} or {{key|.}}; to move up and down, press {{key|PageUp}} or {{key|PageDown}}; and to move back and forth, press {{key|Up arrow}} or {{key|Down arrow}}.

Additionally, you can tilt the view with keyboard shortcuts. To look up or down, press {{key|a}} or {{key|z}}; to look left or right, press {{key|Left arrow}} or {{key|Right arrow}}.

By default, NetRadiant's movement step distance is rather large; to slow it down, open the [[NetRadiant/Preferences|preferences window]] and adjust the Movement slider in the Settings&gt;Camera view.

[[File:NetRadiant-brush.png|thumb|right|A simple brush]]

Brushes are the building blocks of maps; players collide with them, and they're the only type of object used to draw the [[NetRadiant/Minimap|minimap]].

A brush is a six-sided object; all six sides must remain planar (i.e. it is not possible to move one vertex only). Its vertices can be moved, and it can have a different [[NetRadiant/Textures|texture]] for each side.

To create a new brush, deselect everything (to prevent accidental resizing or dragging), then left-click and drag. If you used the 2D view to create the brush, its hidden dimension will have the same size as the largest previously selected brush.

==Editing==

You can use the [[NetRadiant/Editing#Tools|editing tools]] to approximate sizes or select multiple brushes; to edit the individual vertices, edges, or faces of brushes, use the brush selection modes.

The vertex, edge, and face selection modes allow you to edit individual vertices, edges, and faces of all selected brushes.

* To activate the brush selection modes, press {{key|V}} to activate vertex selection mode, {{key|E}} to activate edge selection mode, or {{key|F}} to activate face selection mode. When any of these modes are active and there are no selected vertices, edges, or faces, pressing the key again will exit the selection mode. Note that although you can select and move individual vertices in the 2D view, NetRadiant will move the other vertices to force all sides of the brush to remain planar (flat). Only one brush selection mode can be active at a time.
* To select vertices, use either {{key|Shift}}-left click to select multiple vertices, {{key|Shift}}-left click and drag to select all vertices within a bounding box (including vertices covered up by other vertices), or left-click to select only one vertex at a time. Drag on a selected vertex, edge, or face to move all selected vertices, edges, and faces.
* To deselect all vertices, edges, and faces, press {{key|Escape}}; press it again to exit the brush selection mode.

==Per-face textures==

(See [[NetRadiant/Textures|textures]])

While you can set one texture for each brush by default, you will sometimes need to set textures per face. To assign textures to faces, enter face selection mode ({{key|F}}), select all of the faces that need a different texture, then assign the texture like usual. When using the &quot;Fit&quot; button in the surface inspector window with faces with different sizes, each face's texture will be independently offset and scaled so the texture fits onto each face properly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TopNav|prev=Interface|next=Brushes}}

An object in NetRadiant is either a [[NetRadiant/Brushes|brush]] or an [[NetRadiant/Entities|entity]] that can be positioned in 3D space. Any number of objects can be selected at once; there are several tools that simplify the creation, editing, and removal of all selected objects.

==Selection==

The current selection can consist of multiple objects.

* To add to the current selection, {{key|Shift}}-left click anywhere on the item to be selected. Note that in the 2D view, the nearest object in 3D will get selected regardless of the wireframe outline; to select an object that's behind another object, either cycle through 2D views until the object to be selected is the closest object to the camera, or use the camera view to select the object.
* To toggle the selection status of items in a bounding box, {{key|Shift}}-left click and drag. All items within the box that were selected will be deselected and vice versa.
* To clear the current selection, press {{key|Esc}}. Note that if you are in vertex, edge, or face selection mode, the {{key|Esc}} key will first deselect all vertices, edges, or faces, exit vertex/edge/face selection mode, and then clear the current selection.
* To delete all items in the current selection, press {{key|Backspace}}.

When an object is selected, it shows up in the 2D view as a red dotted wireframe outline; in the camera view, it's superimposed with a dotted outline and with a red tint. If either vertex, edge, or face selection modes are active, there will be a green dot in the center of each vertex, edge or face; if the vertex, edge, or face is selected, the dot will be blue instead, and the selected edges or faces will have a red tint.

==Tools==

There are several tools used to translate (move), rotate, scale, resize, or clip brushes and entities. By far the most commonly used tool is resize; the {{key|W}} key cycles between the translate and resize tools. (The currently used tool can be seen in the toolbar.)

===Resize===

Resize mode is used for moving and resizing the faces of brushes. When one or more brushes are selected, left-click anywhere outside of the brush and drag; the closest edge (or edges if you dragged a corner or there are multiple brushes selected) will move with the mouse. Brushes that have been modified to have angled surfaces will maintain the angle of the edges. If a brush is resized to have zero size in any dimension, it will ''not'' be removed; it will be unselectable and unresizable (since both sides are &quot;inside&quot; of the brush).

To move a brush, click anywhere inside of one of the selected objects and drag.

===Translate===

Translate mode is useful for restricting movement to one axis. Simply drag the arrow to the desired position; all of the selected objects will move. If the current mode is translate mode, pressing {{key|W}} will enable resize mode; otherwise it will enable translate mode.

===Rotate===

Rotate mode is used when you must rotate to an angle other than 90 degrees (which can be done with the [[NetRadiant/Toolbar#edit-selection|edit buttons]] in the toolbar). Left-click and drag one of the rings to rotate all of the selected objects, or left-click and drag inside of the inner ring to rotate in all three axes at once. Press {{key|R}} to switch to rotate mode.

===Scale===

Scale mode is used to scale an object in one axis. Unlike resize mode, which only moves one side at a time, scale mode will scale the selected objects in both directions along one axis (or all three if you click inside of the inner cube). There is no default shortcut for scale mode.

==Hiding objects==

Objects that are in your way can be hidden; press {{key|H}} to hide all selected objects. Press {{key|Shift}}-{{key|H}} to unhide and select all previously hidden items.

A ''Banach space'' is a normed vector space that is complete with respect to the inferred metric.

==Examples==

Recalling that a space is complete if all Cauchy sequences converge. Then &lt;math&gt;L^p&lt;/math&gt; spaces over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; are Banach spaces.

[[File:NetRadiant-surface-inspector.png|thumb|right|NetRadiant's surface inspector (texture mapping) window.]]

[[NetRadiant/Brushes|Brushes]] and [[NetRadiant/Patches|patches]] in NetRadiant can be textured; these textures are projected onto each face, and if the brush moves, the texture will &quot;slide&quot; across the surface of the brush. All six sides of every brush can be textured and mapped independently with the surface inspector.

==Textures vs Shaders==

A shader is a dynamic texture, generated in real-time with [[w:GLSL|GLSL]]. Many of the images listed are not actually textures but shaders instead; shaders make dynamic textures such as lava, water, glass, and skydomes possible. Note that shaders are not used in the [[NetRadiant/Interface#Camera view|camera view]]; they will instead use the shaders' default texture.

==Texture browser==

The texture browser (press {{key|T}} if you have switched the layout) shows the currently available texture folders on the left and the textures or shaders within that folder on the right. Double-click on a folder on the left to show its textures, and click on textures to apply them to all selected objects. Applying textures to objects will not change the texture mapping; if you switch between differently-sized textures on an object that has been previously fitted, you will need to fit the texture again with the new size.

If a texture or shader is currently being used in the map, it will have a green outline in the texture list; if it is a shader, it will have a white outline; and if it's currently being used and it's a shader, it will show the green outline outside of the white outline.

==Surface inspector==

The surface inspector (hidden by default; press {{key|S}} to toggle the window) handles the mapping of the texture; it can also fit and align textures to brushes, patches, and curves.

There are three ways to move textures; translation (&quot;sliding&quot; textures), scaling (stretching textures), and rotating. All three can be manipulated independently with the number entries on the left side. (The &quot;step&quot; number entries on the right adjust the offsets applied when you click the &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; arrows on the left-side number entries.)</text>

&lt;!-- Please add categories to the bottom of this page, and add interwikis to Wikidata. --&gt;

This is a template for writing code examples. You can specify the language the code is in, introductory text, code, output, and explanatory text. The code is syntax highlighted using the [[mw:Extension:SyntaxHighlight|SyntaxHighlight extension]], and the output is formatted with {{tag|pre}} tags, meaning that it uses a monospace font and whitespace is preserved.

== Usage ==

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Code:Formatted
| lang             = 
| before           = 
| code             = 
| output           = 
| after            = 
| border-color     = 
| background-color = 
| output-color     = 
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Parameters ==

* &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt; - the language code. See the [[mw:Extension:SyntaxHighlight#Supported languages|SyntaxHighlight extension page]] for a list of supported languages. The default language is Lua.
* &lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt; - the introductory text. This comes before the code and the output.
* &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; - the code.
* &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; - the output.
* &lt;code&gt;after&lt;/code&gt; - the explanatory text. This comes after the code and the output.
* &lt;code&gt;border-color&lt;/code&gt; - the hexadecimal color code for the border color, e.g. &lt;code&gt;FF7777&lt;/code&gt;. Do not include a # symbol, as this is added by default.
* &lt;code&gt;background-color&lt;/code&gt; - the hexadecimal color code for the background color, e.g. &lt;code&gt;FFDDDD&lt;/code&gt;. Do not include a # symbol, as this is added by default.
* &lt;code&gt;output-color&lt;/code&gt; - the hexadecimal color code for the output text color, e.g. &lt;code&gt;FF0000&lt;/code&gt;. Do not include a # symbol, as this is added by default.

All parameters are optional.

'''Note:''' using a pipe character &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; in any of the parameters will break the template. This is because for the MediaWiki software, the pipe character signifies the start of a new parameter. To work around this problem you can use the code &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{!}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

== Examples ==

=== Lua, all parameters ===

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Code:Formatted
| lang   = lua
| before = A hello world program.
| code   = print('Hello, world!')
| output = Hello, world!
| after  = The &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; command prints text. 
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Code:Formatted
| lang   = lua
| before = A hello world program.
| code   = print('Hello, world!')
| output = Hello, world!
| after  = The &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; command prints text. 
}}

=== Python, just code and output ===

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Code:Formatted
| lang   = python
| code   = print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
| output = Hello, world!
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Code:Formatted
| lang   = python
| code   = print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
| output = Hello, world!
}}

=== PHP, Just code ===

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Code:Formatted
| lang = php
| code =
&lt;?php
  echo &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;
?&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Code:Formatted
| lang = php
| code =
&lt;?php
  echo &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;
?&gt;
}}

A ''Hilbert space'' is a type of vector space that is complete and is of key use in functional analysis. It is a more specific kind of Banach space.

==Definition of Inner Product Space==

An ''inner product space'' or IPS is a vector space V over a field F with a function &lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : V \times V \to F &lt;/math&gt; called an inner product that adheres to three axioms.

1. Conjugate symmetry: &lt;math&gt; \langle x, y \rangle = \overline{\langle y, x \rangle} &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x,y\in V&lt;/math&gt;. Note that if the field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; then we just have symmetry. 

2. Linearity of the first entry: &lt;math&gt;\langle ax, y \rangle = a\langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle x+y, z \rangle = \langle x, z \rangle + \langle y, z \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x,y,z\in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \in F&lt;/math&gt;.

3. Positive definateness: &lt;math&gt; \langle x, y \rangle \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x,y\in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \langle x, y \rangle = 0 &lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition of a Hilbert Space==

A Hilbert Space is an inner product space that is complete with respect to its inferred metric.

==Exercise==

Prove that an inner product has a naturally associated metric and so all IPSs are metric spaces.

==Example==

&lt;math&gt;\ell^2&lt;/math&gt; is a Hilbert space where its points are infinite sequences &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; on I, the unit interval such that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

converges and is a Hilbert space with the inner product &lt;math&gt; \langle (x_n), (y_n) \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i \overline{y_i}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Characterisation Theorem==

There is one separable Hilbert space up to homeomorphism and it is &lt;math&gt;\ell^2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Exercises==

'''Agnes'''is a variant of [[Soltiaire card games/Klondike|Klondike]]. It is similar to the latter except on how the stock is dealt.

==Rules==

Dealing the first 28 cards onto the tableau is a lot like in Klondike. Then a card is placed in the first of the four foundations. This card will be the first card of that foundation and all other cards with the same rank should be placed at the other three foundations.

Seven cards are then dealt in a row either above or below the tableau. This will act as the reserve. The cards in the reserve are available for play.

[[Image:Agnes I (solitaire).jpg|center|The initial layout of the game of Agnes]]

Playing the game is a lot like Klondike except that any gaps are filled in by a card a rank lower than the first card of the foundation. For instance, if the first card of each foundation is a 10, gaps are only filled by 9s. Foundations are built up by suit, while the columns on the tableau are built down in alternating colors, wrapping from Ace to King if necessary. When play is no longer possible on the tableau, any card on the reserve can be used to continue the game. Gaps in the reserve are not filled until a new set is dealt.

If the game cannot continue even from the reserve, a new set of seven cards is dealt from the stock to the reserve. The stock is good for two deals on the reserve with two cards left over. So after the third new deal and no more moves possible, the two left over cards are dealt as if they each have a reserve pile on their own.

The game is won when all cards have made their way to the foundations.

==Variations==

There are two versions of the game of Agnes. The one described above is called '''Agnes Bernauer'''. In another version called '''Agnes Sorel''' (no connection to [[Agnes Sorel|the woman with the same name]]), the game is played the same way except the cards in the tableau are built down by color, i.e. Red suits on red, black suits on black. Furthermore, in Agnes Sorel, spaces are not filled. [[David Parlett]] gave these two versions their separate names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodsol.com/pgshelp/agnes_bernauer.htm http://www.goodsol.com/pgshelp/agnes_bernauer.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ORP-top}}{{TOCright}}&lt;!-- TrainzOnline only:
:''For a new-user walk-through explaining how to create various types of content, see the {{TC|How-To-Guides}} index page instead.'' 
---&gt;
==Overview of Trainz Content==
This page acts as reference manual for all Trainz content, and its legal {{wp|data type}}s (KINDs) and {{wp|data structure}}s (generally, [[:category:Config Container|Containers]]). It is intended to provide accurate and concise description of the capabilities and configuration of Trainz current-version content. To the new user, particularly those with no familiarity with programming language practices, the information in this page can become a starting point to understanding. Every Trainz asset from the mighty collection of assets contained in a route to the lowliest scenery item such as imitation grass,  the color of a rock or field&amp;mdash;all have two things in common: The list of common legal tag names which begin the definition of the asset found in the [[TrainzBaseSpec]].

==Structure of a Trainz Asset==
Each item of Trainz content (&quot;an asset&quot;) is created as the contents of a single operating system folder, containing a [[config.txt file]] and some number of supporting files and/or folders and their files. Files located in the content folder must obey the [[Filename character restrictions]] and each item should be directly relevant to the asset in question. When committed or as in newer Trainz releases, tested for validation before commitment, the asset's folder contents and the [[config.txt file]] will be validated against one another, the ideal minimum definitions will be bounced against those and each must be in balance and correct with respect to one another.

==Content Types==
Each asset built for the Trainz environment follows a preset template, which defines what tags can be included in the [[config.txt file]], what capabilities the asset will have, and how the user can manipulate the asset in-game. The following types of custom content are supported by Trainz:

{|

==Category Tags==
A Category in {{TL|CM}} are an aid to sorting and selecting appropriate content varieties which are classified into groups by N3V loosely based on category-class and {{TR|K|p=Kinds}}. Category-region and category-era are classification tags identifying assets that would be found in a time or place. Each of these tags have the job of classification, ''which are used in narrowing down'' a particular sort of asset search when running {{TL|Content Manager}} or such searches can be used to group assets, which are then useful mainly in filters inside Surveyor.

{|
|-
|
* {{TR|S|category-class}} 
| For Asset by enumerated categories search. The ''''''CM search by Category'''''' is defined by N3V's programmers, and does not directly correspond to all asset {{TR|K|p=Kinds}} and {{TR|S|category-class}}es.
|-
|
* {{TR|s|category-region}} 
| For Region (country or countries) searching
|-
|
* {{TR|S|category-era}} 
| For Era Searching

===Subscribing to Podcasts===
Podcasts are content feeds provided in formats such as Atom, RSS, and XML, among others.

;iTunes

iTunes can be used to subscribe to a Video as well as an audio podcast. See [[/Subscribing to a Podcast in Itunes/|/Subscribing to a Podcast in iTunes]].

;Democracy Player

Democracy player is an open source way of subscribing to video podcasts. It also has a Channel Viewer which makes it easy to find new content. See [[/Subscribing to a Podcast in Democracy Player]].

;Fireant Player
Fireant Player is another podcasting program.

===Watching Video Files in a Media Player===

To watch a video from the internet you need to have certain software installed on your computer that will enable it to play the video. If you already have something installed, this could be windows media player (pc), quicktime (mac). Even so, you might have trouble watching some films, so why not download and use:

There is some infomation explaining container and codecs here. 
http://video.indymedia.org/wiki/doku.php?id=encoding

Why can't I play this video file?

Maybe the Media player application you are using doesn't support the file container you are using. For example Windows Media player won't play a .mov file. The mov container isn't supported. 

Or maybe you don't have the codec used to encode the file installed on your computer. For example you may be able to play some .avi files but not other .avi files. If you open them up in Windows Media player it may even say Missing Codec. 

You can install codecs on your computer by downloading them from the internet. 

On windows you can use a program called Gspot to find out what container and codec have been used to encode the video file. 
there is a help file here. 

Below are links to useful programs and help filed to make sure you can watch your video files.

====Cross platform====
* [http://www.videolan.org/ VLC] is a free software program for Linux, Mac and PC that will play most video formats. There are a list of formats that it will play listed [http://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.html here]. You will see that it will play just about everything apart from real player format. If you install this program hopefully all of your problems viewing files will be solved. 

====Windows====
Gspot tell you how a video file is encoded and what container it is using. 
http://www.headbands.com/gspot/v26x/quick_start.html

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Encoding Video for the Internet==
Before putting a film on the internet you have to transform it into a special format that can be easily transmitted along wires. This process is called encoding. it can be very complicated, but there are people who can advise if you get stuck, the first thing you need is to download and install a software programme which will encode the video format you have into the video format that will be suited to your online distribution needs.
There are a few popular ways of encoding video using commercial solutions but here are some free options

== Applications for Encoding Video for the Internet==

;Definition:
A ''Retraction'' is a continuous function to subspace A of X

1. &lt;math&gt;r:X\to A&lt;/math&gt;

such that the following map exists an embedding

2. &lt;math&gt;\iota:A\hookrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;r\circ \iota=id_A&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

The purpose of this construction is to simplify out some of the more bizarre properties of a topological space, or otherwise simplify to help find basic properties. 

A ''deformation retraction'' is a stronger property where a homotopy exists that takes the identity to a retraction.

For example there is a deformation retraction of an open ended cylinder to a circle, despite the fact that they are not homeomorphic. There are some topological properties preserved in this way and they are of interest in algebraic topology.

==Examples==
The disc has a deformation retraction to a point, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; maps everything to that point and the embedding &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; just fixes that point. Any space that deformation retracts to a point is called ''contractable''.

As just mentioned, &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; is a deformation retract of &lt;math&gt;[0,1]\times S^1&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this is a one way statement, since &lt;math&gt;[0,1]\times S^1\not\subset S^1&lt;/math&gt;. More generally we can say that we can `divide out' by terms that are contractable in a Cartesian product. So the unit n-cube is always contractable.

==Exercises==
1. Find, explicitly, a deformation retraction from the unit n-cube to the point.

2. Although deformation retractions are not reflexive, show that they are transitive.

==Dealing with Asset Errors==
'''Errors, Faults, Faulty assets, Bad Content, Faulty content'' are all synonyms in Trainz-speak for the same situation: An asset has become or was distributed with malformed components. Another kind of error or fault occurs when the asset needs an tweak to conform to a newer level of asset technology. The flaw is frequently something which can be 'fixed' by hand edited changes into the files in the assets defining folder(s) opened in the  operating system.

==Introduction to Trainz==
Trainz is first and foremost a hobby and a passion with a large international participation and many sub-communities. You don't have to be a '{{wp|Railfan}}' to enjoy {{TL|Driving Trainz}} but to get the most out of the software requires the drive to want to make something, because Trainz has it's warts, it's confusions, and it's faults and flaws. It can present a seemingly endless mountain of learning curves to surmount, and this book is all about helping you up those slopes in the least time intensive, least frustrating way possible.

Trainz is however an ongoing, evolving, ever changing dynamic system of modeling in a 3D real time interactive graphical 'Virtual World' and was one of the first 'game classed' software packages which did a good job of simulation in such a milieu. It is far easier to simulate for example a flight simulator, for by and large, the graphical world demands are far off and indistinct. One of the key and unique features of Trainz is we humans can go anywhere in the virtual world, virtually at any moment, and just look around (letting that Train look after itself) or change things (the junction points of a ladder in a railyard) and experience the world with an intimacy which wasn't generally possible in most games which tightly controled player placement and views. This is very much still the case even in specialize game virtual environments such as are generated in the play-stations and Nintendos and Xbox game consoles. Just try to run far from the path in Left for Dead -- the game environment scope is designed to channel you. In Trainz a route designer defines the whole world, but you are free to trespass everywhere in it from being underwater (can be weird or annoying) to flying high above (in satellite mode or as a hawk might) and can take on superpowers of sorts and walk through walls--the later case proving no matter how good the illusion, the world is indeed virtual; something made of mathematical constructs called polygon meshes with cladding over virtual surfaces called textures &amp;mdash; which together with the game engine are rendered to us as objects we see with our ''''{{TG|C|camera position}}'''' color and depth in three dimensions (unless we trespass inside, breaking the illusion). 

In the Trainz graphical worlds one can design and create boats, planes, automotive or truck vehicles and drive them as well as our beloved Trainz with far more cars than could fit on a 'Basement Railroad Empire' physical model railroad--and in Trainz the dynamic operation of that mass of cars (a consist in railroad parlance) changes the dynamic operating behavior of the train. If you load a string of coal cars the train becomes different to drive. If you try to accelerate a loaded train too fast, the wheels will slip and you could well go backwards. This makes Trainz endlessly different, for there is always a new possibility to explore if you are adventurous enough to tinker and customize to suit yourself. 

And that customization is another strength of Trainz. The software is extensible and expansive enough you can mess around with trial and error and may do things no one else thought possible before. Admittedly after sixteen years development (Trainz software began taking shape in 1998, was first released in beta test in mid-2000 A.D.) the major 'new things' are being done by users with a software bent, for they invariably involve interactive scripting efforts to interact with the virtual world generated in Trainz.

&amp;nbsp;
===Trainz Warts===
'''Errors, Faults, Faulty assets, Bad Content, Faulty content''' are all synonyms in Trainz-speak for the same situation:
 
An asset has become or was distributed with malformed components.
* Many times the errors are simple errors of assumptions as a content creator did variations on a theme, in effect {{TA|Reskinning}} at least parts of her creative output without a full up test, or cutting, pasting, and quickly editing an element, alas incorrectly. This happened a lot in {{TL|T06|pre-T06}} assets which is why that version instituted the initial error checking into the ''before-commitment and before-uploading'' process (as well as pre-cdp generation)&amp;mdash;which has made the bleeding stop, but left the errant cdp file on the {{TL|DLS}} unchanged.
:* Many times these got fixed, but for legal (copy rights) reasons, and lack of a past  ability to replace a faulty {{TL|DLS}} asset, or for lack of understanding how, the fixed version has an entirely different KUID. The originators data base knows these first versions are obsoleted by a replacement by the inclusion of a {{TR|C|obsolete-table}} entry; anyone with both items has no problems thereafter, but the database and we Trainzers has no easy {{TL|CM}} tool to tell us the new KUID is available. (We learn how to check to compensate for a system sometimes abused or historically less capable.)
* Another kind of error or fault occurs when the asset needs an tweak to conform to a newer level of asset technology. 
* The flaw in Trainz content is most often frequently something which can be 'fixed' by small 'tweaks'&amp;mdash;hand edited changes into the files in the assets defining folder(s) opened in the  operating system. When they aren't persuadable by this small effort, the Trainz forums become a gold mine and recourse.
* The worst case, the asset is missing key data (a mesh or texture) that is unobtainable. When all else fails, return the item for a refund. All $0.00 spent. 
* PEV, Andi06, Ianwoodmore, and Pcas1986 are expecting a 95% asset repair rate on older-to-oldest content with the next release of Asset-x and TARDIS (Their claims, their test benchmarks and statistical evaluation &amp;mdash; all as of mid-April 2014) which means less than 2% of DLS content will fail their upgrade process, and that remaining older content with faults needing hand editing will be no more than 1&amp;ndash;2% of the DLS population overall, and dropping. (There is a slowly proceeding N3V DLS cleanup project which will eventually eliminate those.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ingredients==
1 vegan pie crust
===Pie filling===
*1 1/4 cup sugar
*1/2 cup corn starch 
*1/4 teaspoon agar
*1/4 teaspoon salt
*1 1/4 cup non-dairy milk 
*1 cup cold water
*3/4 cup fresh lemon juice
*1 1/2 tablespoons lemon zest
*1/8 teaspoons turmeric

===Meringue===
*9 teaspoons tapioca starch
*9 teaspoons potato starch
*1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
*3/4 teaspoons guar gum
*1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons cold water
*1/2 cup sugar
*3/4 teaspoons lemon juice

#Keep the filling warm and covered while preparing the meringue.

===Meringue===
#First, add the starches, baking powder, guar gum, lemon juice, and about half the water, mix it by hand until stiff peaks start to form. Then add the rest of the water and the sugar slowly and mix. It should be thick enough that it will have stiff peaks that don’t fall. If it is not thick enough, add a little more tapioca starch and mix. 
#To form peaks in meringue, using a rubber spatula, touch flat side of spatula on meringue and pull away. Repeat over entire surface of meringue.

===Pie===
#As soon as the meringue  is done, pour the filling into the pie crust and while the filling is hot spread meringue over filling, carefully sealing to edge of crust. Bake in a 350 °F (180 °C). oven for 10-15 minutes. Cool on rack for 1 hour. 
#Serve at room temperature or chilled.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Solresol, being based on 7 syllables, has a wide variety of ways to be written. The most popular are: 

*''' The musical tones are written out in full (do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si) 
*''' The musical tones are abbreviated (d, r, m, f, so, l, s)
*''' The musical tones are written as numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
*''' The musical tones are written on a musical staff (do=c, re=d, mi=e, fa=f, sol=g, la=a, si=b)
*''' The musical tones are written as colors (Do=red, re=orange, mi=yellow, fa=green, sol=blue, la= indigo, si= violet) 
*''' The musical tones are written in a stenographic script. 

Out of these, the full written out form, the abbreviated, and the number forms are the most widely used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Solresol, a word can be a noun, a verb, an adjective, or an adverb. Since figuring out all this from contact would be frustrating, the inventor of Solresol, François Sudre, made a way to distinguish the forms of a word. The placement of emphasis or stress on a certain syllable would make it one part of speech. In the case of nouns, the stress is on the first syllable

However, since there isn't a regulating body of Solresol, no official way to show this stress has been established. However, one way has been widely used. In this system, a circumflex (ˆ) would be placed above the vowel of the syllable that has the emphasis. 

With this in mind, let's see some examples with some basic Solresol nouns. 


Fâresimi- Cat 
Dôsiredo- Milk 
Mîsolredo- Person

[[Image:Pysolfc-all-in-a-row-screenshot.xcf|thumb|alt=All in a Row in PySolFC|A Deal of All in a Row Solitaire in PySolFC in midplay]]

This game is akin to [[Solitaire card games/Golf|Golf]] and [[Solitaire card games/Tri Peaks|Tri Peaks]], and is very similar to [[Black Hole (solitaire)|Black Hole]]. The game's objective is to put the entire deck into the foundation.

The cards are dealt to the tableau in columns of four. The foundation (the &quot;row&quot;) can be started from any column, and afterwards it is built with cards incremented or decremented from the previous card by one (where kings and aces wrap).

Only the top cards of each pile in the tableau are available for play.

The game ends if there are no more top cards that can be moved to the Black Hole. The game is won if all of the cards end up in the Black Hole.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This game is largely similar to [[Solitaire card games/Calculation|Calculation]] except that there isn't a tableau, and there is only one waste pile instead of four
[[Category:Solitaire card games]]
==Play==

To begin the game, four cards (regardless of suit) are removed from the deck and placed in a row: an ace, a two, a three, and a four. Another four cards are placed in a row below those four cards: a two, a four, a six, and an eight. The table below shows how this is arranged:

{| cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot;
|-----
! A
! 2
! 3
! 4
|-----
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 2 || align=&quot;center&quot; | 4
| align=&quot;center&quot; | 6 || align=&quot;center&quot; | 8
|}
The cards on the second row compose the foundations themselves, while the cards on the row above denote how the cards should be built on the foundations. The foundation placed under the ace starts with the two and it is built in ones. The foundation under the two starts with the four and it is built in twos, and so on. The table below shows how the foundations should be built:

== Regarding your thesis ==

Have you searched the literature? I took part in a doctoral thesis interview about three years ago, along with quite a few others; there was a simple survey for a different thesis, and one with essay questions for a third, which were earlier. Have you found those studies? Or would you like me to dig up what information I have on them as a participant?

      <text xml:space="preserve">It's difficult to define what emotions are, but in general they share some characteristics. First, they are automatic processes. That means that you don't choose to be emotional or not, for the most part. Emotions kind of feel like they happen to you, and might choose to deal with them. You don't choose to be angry. At best, you can choose to do something that you expect will make you angry. From an evolutionary perspective, emotions are like the automatic settings on a camera, in that they tend to produce behavior that is generally adaptive, without requiring deliberative thought (Greene, 2013, 134). Emotions also tend to have &quot;action tendencies.&quot; That is, emotions are not just feelings, but they tend to ready the body for certain kinds of actions. Fear, for example, prepares you for fleeing or fighting by raising blood pressure, increasing focus, etc. Even the facial expressions of some emotions can be related to their evolutionary function. For example, the fear facial expression expands the nasal cavity and widens the eyes, enhancing smell and enlarging the field of view. The disgust expression crinkles up the face, reducing the chance of a pathogen entering the body through the eyes or nose. 

Emotions vary widely in how they are implemented in the brain. This is because emotions are evolutionarily old. Reasoning, on the other hand, has a fair degree of unity, depending critically on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, Greene, 2013, 136).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Discrete Random Variables ==
=== Expected Value ===
The expected value, shown by E(X) or sometimes referred to as the mean, can be calculated from a given probability distribution. It can be defined as &lt;math&gt;\sum x_ip_i&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the probability for value &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;.  For example :

A spinner has the probability distribution
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4
|-
| &lt;math&gt; P(X = x) &lt;/math&gt; || 0.2 || 0.2 || 0.5 || 0.1
|}
E(X) can be calculated by summing all the values times their respective probabilities :
&lt;math&gt; (1 * 0.2) + (2 * 0.2) + (3 * 0.5) + (4 * 0.1) = 2.5 &lt;/math&gt;

=== E(X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and E(X)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ===

At times, you will be required to calculate E(X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and E(X)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (For use in calculating the variance of a discrete random variable, for example)
The value of E(X)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is simply your value of E(X), squared. Using the same spinner from the previous example, our value of E(X)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; would be &lt;math&gt; 2.5^2 = 6.25 &lt;/math&gt;

E(X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is a little more challenging, however. Suppose we are using the same spinner as before when we calculated E(X) and E(X)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Calculating the expected value of &lt;math&gt;x ^ 2&lt;/math&gt; means we must square all out values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (which is the values the spinner can land on). This gives us the probability distribution
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;x ^ 2&lt;/math&gt; !! 1 !! 4 !! 9 !! 16
|-
| &lt;math&gt;P(X^2 = x^2)&lt;/math&gt; || 0.2 || 0.2 || 0.5 || 0.1
|}

From here, we can calculate our value for E(X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) the same as if we were calculating E(X) :

&lt;math&gt; (1 * 0.2) + (4 * 0.2) + (9 * 0.5) + (16 * 0.1) = 7.1 &lt;/math&gt;

Note that our values for E(X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and E(X)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are not equal!

=== Expected value for E(kX) and E(X + k), where k is a number ===

To calculate the value of E(kX), we need to move the value of k outside of the brackets. This leaves us with kE(X). E(X) can now be calculated normally, and then multiply by the value of K. For our spinner example, the value of E(2X) is 2E(X), where E(X) = 2.5. Our value for E(2X) must then be 5.

To calculate the value of E(X + k), we need to move the value of k outside of the brackets again. We are left with E(X) + k and can calculate the value normally. For our spinner example, the value of E(X + 3) is E(X) + 3, which is 5.5.

=== Variance ===

The variance of a discrete random variable is defined as the expectation of sqaure minus the square of expectation or in other words : &lt;math&gt; Var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2 &lt;/math&gt;. In turn, the standard deviation(σ - Lower case greek letter sigma) of a discrete random variable is defined as the square root of the variance or : &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{Var(X)}&lt;/math&gt;

For our spinner example, the value of E(X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) that we calculated was 7.1 and our value for E(X)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was 6.25. Therefore, our value for the variance of this spinner would be : &lt;math&gt; Var(X) = 7.1 - 6.25 = 0.85 &lt;/math&gt;

Our value for the standard deviation of the spinner would be : &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{0.85} = 0.9219544457 = 0.9220 (4. sf) &lt;/math&gt;

== Draft Notes ahead of contributions ==

=== Getting Bayesian: Priors and Posteriors ===
All parameters in DCM, such as connections between regions, have prior values (beliefs prior to seeing the data) and posterior values (estimated parameter values after seeing the data).

==== Priors ====
If you take a look at a DCM, you will find the priors in DCM.M.pE (prior mean of each parameter) and DCM.M.pC (prior covariance of each parameter). Whereas DCM.M.pE is simply laid out with matrices for A, B, C etc, DCM.M.pC is an nxn matrix, where n is the number of parameters. To make DCM.M.pC intelligible, you can convert this to the format with separate matrices for A,B,C etc. The code is as follows:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;Cp_matrix = spm_unvec(diag(DCM.M.pC), DCM.Ep);&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

If you'd like to know the priors on each connection in the A-matrix, you can then simply do:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;full(Cp_matrix.A)&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The priors for DCM are set by the script spm_dcm_fmri_priors.m . If you wish to change any of them, however, don't alter this script. Rather, set your new priors in DCM.options:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
% These two override spm_dcm_fmri_priors
DCM.options.pE = my_pE; % Prior means
DCM.options.pC = my_pC; % Prior covariance

% These are used only if the above two are not set:
DCM.options.precision = x; % exp(x) is the prior covariance on DCM.a entries
DCM.options.decay = y; % y is multiplied by the prior means
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Post-hoc DCM ===

==== A walk-through of the code ====

===== 1. Bringing the number of free parameters to less than 16 =====

Each iteration of the greedy search begins by listing the indices of A,B and C-matrix parameters with non-zero prior variance. The resulting list of parameters, k, are those which post-hoc DCM will switch on and off while searching the model space:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;k = spm_fieldindices(DCM.Ep,'A','B','C');
k = k(C(k));
nparam = length(k);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

If there are more than 16 parameters, those with the least evidence are removed. To prepare for this, priors and posteriors of the parameters are collected into vectors - prior variables begin with 'p', posteriors begin with 'q'. Any parameters with zero prior covariance are removed from all these variables, performed by conducting an SVD on the prior covariance matrix: 
 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
U     = spm_svd(pC);
qE    = U'*spm_vec(qE); % Posterior means stripped of those with zero prior covariance
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The code then loops over each parameter in k (those with non-zero prior variance), and creates an updated prior variance vector with one parameter switched off, by having its variance set to zero. This is then used to generate a reduced prior covariance matrix (using the matrix U from the SVD above, rather than pc):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
r      = C; r(k(i)) = 0;
R      = U(r,:)'*U(r,:); % The updated prior covariance is later given by R*pC*R
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Armed with this reduced prior covariance matrix without the ith parameter, the full model can now be compared to the reduced model:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
Z(i,j) = spm_log_evidence(qE,qC,pE,pC,pE,R*pC*R);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

After repeating this for each parameter, only the 8 parameters in k which when removed give the strongest evidence are retained.

===== 2. Searching all possible reduced models =====
Safe in the knowledge that the number of free parameters (listed in variable k) is not excessive, a list of all possible prior parameter vectors is generated, each with a different parameter switched off:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;K = spm_perm_mtx(length(k));
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Models with each of these prior covariances are then evaluated, just as described above:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
for i = 1:length(K)
  r      = C; r(k(K(i,:))) = 0;
  R      = U(r,:)'*U(r,:);
  G(i,j) = spm_log_evidence(qE,qC,pE,pC,pE,R*pC*R);            
  ...
end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The results of the search across models are then collated (variable S). If models from multiple subjects are given, their log evidence (free energy) is pooled by adding the free energy of each. The evidence is then made relative to that of the full model (the last entry in S):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
S     = sum(G,2);
S     = S - S(end);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

And converted to a posterior probability for each model:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
p     = exp(S - max(S));
p     = p/sum(p);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

If we started with more than 16 parameters, and if any parameters were removed, then all the steps described are repeated.

== Conjunction ==
Conjunction analysis allows the experimenter to ask &quot;do two or more conditions activate the same voxels&quot;? You may find two different kinds of conjunction analysis used:

* '''Global null'''. The null hypothesis is that all conditions are null in a given voxel. Therefore, a single condition having an effect would be sufficient to disprove the null hypothesis. This is implemented in SPM when pressing the 'global' button by taking the minimum of two statistical images. 

* '''Conjunction null''' Given two conditions, A and B, the conjunction null hypothesis is that there is no activation for condition A OR no activation for condition B. So to disprove it, both condition A and B would have to be show an effect.</text>

==Introduction==

{{TOC right}}

''Cohomology'' is a strongly related concept to homology, it is a contravariant in the sense of a branch of mathematics known as [[category theory]]. In homology theory we study the relationship between mappings going down in dimension from n-dimensional structure to its (n-1)-dimensional border. However, in cohomology the maps are reversed, and instead of chain groups we study groups of mappings from those groups.

Although this description may imply that somehow cohomology theory is no more or less powerful than homology theory, this impression would be wrong, as it turns out that the cohomology of a space is often more powerful. Further knowing the homology of a space gives us the cohomology and the cohomology greatly restricts what homology a space can have.

==Hom(A,B) and Categorical Duals==

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition of Hom(A,B):
Hom(A,B) is the group of all homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;h:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; under composition. However, the term can be made applicable in many fields, in the context of topological spaces it is the group of continuous functions. Thus it is better to think of the group as ''the group of all structure preserving functions''.
}}

This construction is at the core of category theory which has been successful in acting as a foundational theory for large parts of algebraic topology. For now what we need is the idea that the dual of a group &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;C^*=Hom(C,G)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(C^*)^*=Hom(Hom(C,G),G)&lt;/math&gt;

==Cochain Complex==

In homology theory we used the chain complex

:&lt;math&gt;\cdots C_n \xrightarrow{\partial_n} C_{n-1} \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

to form our homology groups &lt;math&gt;H_n(X)=Ker(\partial_n) / Im(\partial_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt;. Using that as our inspiration, we form 

:&lt;math&gt;\delta^n:C^*_{n-1}\to C^*_n&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C^*_n=Hom(C_n,G)&lt;/math&gt; for a given group G. Our cochain complex is as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\cdots Hom(C_n,G) \xrightarrow{\delta^n} Hom(C_{n-1},G) \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

To find our cohomology groups &lt;math&gt;H^n(X;G)&lt;/math&gt; note that this is relative to our chosen group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; so for a given method we have to choose &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; appropriately.

It could be said that mathematics in general owes its credibility to ancient [[Ancient_History/Greece|Greece's]] Euclid. What is probably his most famous work, ''Elements'', revolutionized the concepts of  geometry and [[Mathematics|mathematics]] as a whole through the presentation of a simple logical method. This method is summarized by Leonard Mlodinow:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, make terms  explicit by forming precise definitions and so ensure mutual understanding of all words and symbols. Next, make concepts explicit by stating specific axioms or postulates so that no unstated understandings or assumptions may be used. Finally, derive the logical consequences of the system employing only accepted rules of logic, applied to the axioms and to previously proved theorems &lt;ref&gt;Mlodinow, Leonard. Euclid's Window: The Story of Geometry from Parallel Lines to Hyperspace. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Throughout its history, many mathematicians have influenced the development of topology.  While Johann Benedict Listing is not credited with a memorable discovery in terms of the field of topology, he is still considered one of the founding fathers. This is because he gave topology its name. While he published very little on topology, he is remembered for ''Vorstudien zur Topologie'', which was the first document to use the word topologie (English: topology) to describe the field. He is also often credited with discovering the Möbius strip independently of August Ferdinand Möbius &lt;ref&gt;Breitenberger, E. Johann Benedikt Listing. History of Topology. James, Ioan Mackenzie. Amsterdam: Elsevier BV, 1999. 909-924&lt;/ref&gt;.


The origins of topology date back to the eighteenth century and the [[wikipedia:Seven Bridges of Königsberg|''Königsberg Bridge Problem'']], a problem of relative position without regard to distance &lt;ref&gt;Königsberg bridge problem. ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. 2011. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/321794/Konigsberg-bridge-problem&lt;/ref&gt;. While this problem is often regarded as the birth of graph theory, it also inspired Euler's development of the topology of networks &lt;ref&gt;Goodwin College of Professional Studies. ``The Beginnings of Topology&quot;.  Drexel University. 1998. http://mathforum.org/isaac/problems/bridges1.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Königsberg, now Kaliningrad, was founded in 1255 and became a prosperous seaport &lt;ref&gt;``Königsberg&quot;. ''Encyclopedia Americana''. 1831. Vol. 7 Pg. 345&lt;/ref&gt;. The city resides on the banks of the Praegel, now Pregolya, River. Citizens could use seven bridges that crossed the Praegal, but the question of whether or not one could pass through the town and use each bridge exactly once would turn out to be the catalyst in the creation of the mathematical field of topology. Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler would be the one to discover the answer was no. He determined that the graph defined by the location of the bridge was not what is now called a Eulerian graph &lt;ref&gt;Singh, Suresh, G. Graph Theory. New Delhi: PHI Learning Private Limited, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;. This solution entitled ''The Solution of a Problem Related to the Geometry of Position'' was submitted to the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg in 1735 &lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Robin J. &quot;Graph Theory&quot;.

Euler is also well known for his research in the combinatorial qualities of polyhedra. He considered the edges (&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;), which he called ''acies'', the faces (&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;), or ''hedra'', and the vertices (&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;), called ''angulus solidus''. Euler realized the importance of these three properties claiming that they &quot;completely determine the solid&quot;. His research resulted in the well-known ''Polyhedral Formula'': &lt;math&gt;v-e+f=2&lt;/math&gt;. However, Euler's formula applies only to convex solids &lt;ref&gt;Richeson, David. &quot;The Polyhedral Formula&quot;. ''Leonhard Euler: Life, Work, and Legacy''. Bradley, Robert E., Sandifer, Charles Edward. Amsterdam: Elsevier BV, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1813 Antoine-Jean L'Huilier recognized this limitation of the formula and provided a generalization for a solid with &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; holes: &lt;math&gt;v-e+f=2-2g&lt;/math&gt;. This was the first known result of a topological invariant &lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, J. and Robertson, E. &quot;A History of Topology&quot;. University of St. Andrews. 1996. http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Topology\_in\_mathematics.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

August Ferdinand Möbius was one of the main contributors of the topological theory of manifolds. In 1865, Möbius presented an article in which he decomposed several orientations of surfaces in polygonal nets. His most famous example was a non-orientable surface, which is now called the Möbius strip&lt;ref&gt;Pickover, Clifford A. The Möbius Strip: Dr. August Möbius's Mathematical Band in Mathematics, Games, Literature, Art, Technology, and Cosmology. Thunder's Mouth Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Russian born mathematician Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor, the father of set theory, is another mathematician to whom we owe credit for topology. Concepts of set theory and cardinality are fundamental for the study of topology. Today, Cantor is a truly celebrated mathematician, especially considering that set theory and the idea of infinity do not seem to have a truss of mathematical ideas from which they could have been developed. Sadly, these ideas were not welcomed by a nineteenth century world, and Cantor spent many years of his adult life struggling with public criticism. A German mathematician by the name of David Hilbert  described Cantor's discoveries in the infinite domain as an &quot;astonishing product of mathematical thought&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Crilly, T. and Johnson, D. &quot;The Emergence of Topological Dimension Theory&quot;. History of Topology. James, Ioan Mackenzie. Amsterdam: Elsevier BV, 1999. 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1877, Cantor showed that the points on a 2-dimensional square had a one-to-one correspondence with the points on different line segments, and this caused others to begin asking questions about the idea of dimension, leading to the development of dimension theory &lt;ref&gt;Krantz, Steven G. An Episodic History of Mathematics: Mathematical Culture Through Problem Solving. The Mathematical Association of America, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, many mathematicians challenged themselves with more abstract problems. Maurice René Fréchet, a French mathematician, helped these mathematicians considerably in 1906. He explained that if a distance can be defined between two different mathematical entities, then real and complex number concepts can be applied &lt;ref&gt;Rezende, Lisa. Chronology of Science. New York: Infobase, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;. Fréchet, along with Schoenflies, Hausdorff, and others, would be one of the first to study &quot;general topology&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Eynde, R. Vanden. &quot;Development of the Concept of Homotopy&quot;. History of Topology. New York: Elsevier BV, 1999. 65-102&lt;/ref&gt;. Fréchet developed the theory of metric spaces, which was based on Cantor's theory of sets &lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, Clifford. Archive for History of Exact Sciences. Springer-Verlag, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;.


German mathematician Felix Hausdorff followed in Cantor's footsteps with regard to set theory. In fact, Hausdorff was one of the first to teach set theory. In the summer 1901, he had 3 students &lt;ref&gt;Hausdorff, Felix, Plotkin, Jacob M. Hausdorff on Ordered Sets. American Mathematical Society, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;. The idea that a topology possesses a lattice of open subsets had been around almost as long as the idea of topology itself, but Hausdorff was the first to emphasize the importance of these sets in defining topological concepts &lt;ref&gt;Aull, Charles E., Lowen, Robert. Handbook of the History of General Topology. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;.


French mathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré discovered his talent at an early age. In fact, he took first place in a national mathematics competition while he was still in school. Poincaré was the first to study Fuchsian groups, dealing mainly with their underlying geometry and topology &lt;ref&gt;Stillwell, John. Mathematics and its History. San Francisco: Springer-Verlag, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;. Poincaré is most famous for ''The Poincaré Conjecture'' which states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A compact smooth ''n''-dimensional manifold that is homotopy equivalent to the ''n''-sphere &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt; must in fact be homeomorphic to &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt;. One can think of a compact manifold as a manifold that lives in a finite region of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and that has no boundary &lt;ref&gt;Gowers, Timothy, Barrow-Green, June, Leader, Imre. The Princeton Companion to Mathematics. Princeton: Princton University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This conjecture would not be proven until 2003 by Grigory Perelman &lt;ref&gt;O'Shea, Donal. The Poincare Conjecture: In Search of the Shape of the Universe. New York: Walker Publishing Company, Inc., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:Europe-Republic_of_Kosovo.svg|thumb|200px|right|Map showing location of Kosovo in Europe (small green dot)]]
'''Kosovo''' is a small country in south-eastern Europe.  It shares borders with [[Wikijunior:Europe/Serbia|Serbia]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Albania|Albania]] and [[Wikijunior:Europe/Macedonia|Macedonia]].  The capital city is [[w:Pristina|Pristina]].  Kosovo is not part of the [[../EU|European Union]] but uses the [[w:Euro (currency)|Euro]] as its currency.  Kosovo is only recognised as an independent country by about half of the countries in the world - other countries consider it to be a province of Serbia.
&lt;br&gt;

==Kosovo's History==
Until 2008 Kosovo was part of Serbia, previously it had been part of '''Serbia and Montenegro''' and before that a part of Yugoslavia.  Kosovo declared itself independent in 2008.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|Yugoslavia|Between the end of World War 2 and the early 1990s Yugoslavia was a country in south-eastern Europe.  It consisted of Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia.  Serbia contained two provinces: Vojvodina and Kosovo.  Yugoslavia collapsed in the 1990s after violent civil wars in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and latter attacks by Serbia on Kosovo which was stopped by NATO.}}

&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Overview_of_the_Pristina_center_from_the_hill.png|300px|thumb|left|Pristina, the capital of Kosovo]]

==Kosovo's Geography==
[[Image:ChildrensDayInKosovo2.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Girls in Kosovo]]
Kosovo has many rivers, lakes and forests.  There is one national park: Šar Mountains National Park.
&lt;br&gt;

==Kosovo's People==
The '''population of Kosovo is 1.7 million'''. Kosovan Albanians make up about 90 percent of the population. Serbians are the largest minority group. The main religons are [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Islam|Islam]] and [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Christians]] (both Orthodox and Catholic). It is not clear how many people follow these religions because census don't ask these questions.

The official language of Estonia is [[Wikijunior:Languages/Albanian|Albanian]]. A minority speak [[Wikijunior:Languages/Serbian|Serbian]].

;Usage
# This page auto-categorized Trainz Wikibooks redirect terms into the auto-[[:Category:Trainz redirect to sections pages]].
# The redirects for all sections must use underscores after the # character for wikimarkup to build the proper path. 
# The template should only be used when a hard redirect is created to link into a section title. 
# Further, it is highly recommended that the {{tl|Anchor}} template be used after the beginning of that targeted section with the same link name.
## AND an HTML comment be created at the Anchor citing that the redirect page targets the name.
# It's proper placement is on '''the same line''' as the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect [[Trainz/whatever page name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/code&gt; as in the below example:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect [[Trainz/whatever page name#The_section_title]]{{R to Trainz section}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* to check the proper inclusion, separate the '#' from the word redirect like:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;# redirect [[Trainz/target page name#The_section_title]] {{R to Trainz section}]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
* It will sometimes also display the message in Preview if not properly installed, such as putting the template on a second line in the redirect page, hence the message might sometimes be produced indicating an error:
&lt;div&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

==Introduction==
The '''Trainz Driver''' GUI module is the active gameplay mode of Trainz, and it may surprise the new user&amp;mdash;probably the least used of the three main Trainz run-time modules. Most avid Trainzers prefer and enjoy the many seductions of the creative side of the hobby to the entertainment side, not but we do drive, just not all that often.
 
Yet Driver skills will come into play as necessary skills if you do want to play, and some of us play so much we buy fancy expensive video cards able to drive three widescreen monitors, and expensive console controllers which mimic a real locomotives cab controls.

'''Trainz Driver''' is the part of the Trainz program suite that allows you to control trains on a layout and is the'' 'really doing things' (missions)'' or interactive 'Gameplay' part of the software system, and the part the new Trainzer first becomes comfortable with. 

Trainz Operations can be as simple as driving a light engine around a circle of track or as complicated as operating a large {{wp|railyard|marshalling yard}}, with many different trains arriving for you to manage. Driver game play adventures are called {{TL|Sessions}} or {{TG|S|Scenarios}} (older, phased out in forthcoming Trainz: A New Era expected late 2014) and are the scripted activities which puts you into the cabin of the locomotives and usually require you to ''perform to some &quot;task and standard&quot; ''(keep to a schedule, this type is frequently scored, so you can beat your former best) or sort and place traincars in the correct places (Switching scenarios) and many combinations of these in problem solving. 

==Cameras==
;Camera view, Camera position, Camera mode
:: Camera location, directional angles from that co-ordinate axis, and zoom are how we see inside the Trainz virtual world&amp;mdash;they define a viewpoint from which we observe, all generated by the graphics engine. They place us within the game graphics.
{{TL|Driver}} has four ''camera viewpoints or ''''camera modes'''''':
# {{kpb|1}} selects an '''Internal camera'''&amp;mdash; there most often will be more than one; you know you're in an early loco model when there aren't at least five. Use '''{{kpb|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;|&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}''' to select by toggling between them.
# {{kpb|2}} selects an '''External camera''', this is attached to the consist somewhere and moves with the train, use '''{{kpb|+}} / {{kpb|-}}''' to select which traincar the camera follows by scan-toggling between them. This mode normally starts on the engine so {{kpb|-}} will move the camera towards the rear of the Train. This is also the camera mode in Railyard.
#  {{kpb|3}} selects the '''Tracking Camera mode'''. This is a camera in a fixed location the route designer places in the world with a viewpoint to showing the Train externally either at a fixed direction &amp; angle, or which stays in place, but stays focused on the train and rotates (tracks) to stay locked on the targeted car. Use {{kpb|+|-}} as in camera mode 2 to view a different anchor car.
#  {{kpb|4}} selects the '''Free Camera mode''', and is arguably the feature which lead to Trainz successful growth. This is also the Camera mode used in Surveyor and it's focal point is always at the center of your display.{{bullR
}} The Mouse, mouse wheel, and keyboard arrow keys '''{{kpb|&amp;uarr;}}, {{kpb|&amp;larr;}}, {{kpb|&amp;rarr;}}, &amp; {{kpb|&amp;darr;}}''' are used to position, zoom, and move this camera about including through objects. {{bullR
}} Use '''{{kpb|RMBh}}''' and drag the tool pointer (cursor) right, left, up or down screen away from screen center to slide the camera around, or rotate the view angle. (Surveyor Options settings dependent, customize to suit self: two controls pan and rotation) {{bullR
}} This lets us use '''{{kpb|LMB}}''' and clicks using the''''' 'mouse pointer'''''' (tool tip) to operate junctions, turn valves, turn the [[DCC Mode]] dial, operate slider controls, and generally toggle or select button options, and like actions.

===Cameras===
There are four main camera modes available in Driver to allow you to enjoy your train from any angle. The camera control buttons are situated on the top right of the Driver screen, just below the game time, current speed and speed limit indicators. They are, from left to right, Cab View, External View, Tracking View and Roaming View.
*Cab View seats you in the cab of the locomotive, and allows you to operate the cab controls when in cab mode.

*External View allows you to view your train from any angle, but the train remains in the centre of view and the camera revolves around it. To select a different vehicle simply click it.

*Tracking View allows you to watch your train from any of the tracking cameras placed around the route. These are essentially fixed viewpoints placed in surveyor; they don't move but can pan depending on the type of camera used. When the selected train is not in sight of any tracking cameras, the view reverts to external view until it is in range of another.

*Roaming View is available in TRS2004 and later versions, and allows you to move the camera in any direction using the arrow keys, without being anchored to anything. It is possible to zoom in and out using this view, but not to pan or tilt; the pan and tilt is the same as your last External View.

==Train Control Modes==
In Driver it is possible to control trains in two ways: either DCC mode or Cab mode. When launching a driver session you are asked which one to use, and Driver then operates in your chosen mode for the remainder of the session.


===DCC Mode===
DCC mode essentially operates like a model train set - to move your train you get a circular dial where moving it clockwise is forwards and anticlockwise is backwards. The further away from the 12 o'clock position you move the dial, the faster your train will go in that direction. DCC mode is designed to operate with a less realistic physics model than Cab mode, and is useful for people who wish to have a play with a layout or manage a lot of trains without getting too in depth with one particular locomotive.[[Picture of DCC mode]]


=={{TG|C|CAB Mode}}==
[[file:Trainz_2014-0424-07_Driver_CAB Mode_Sequence_Norfolk_&amp;_Western_Route-02.png|thumb|Steam Locomotive in Cab Mode &amp;mdash; most of the labeled items respond to mouse {{kp|LMBH}}+drag to control.]]
{{anchor|CAB Mode|Cab mode|cab mode}}&lt;!-- redirect to section targets here ---&gt;
;CAB '''''meaning''' Cabin Mode
: The more realistic and more challenging of the two driving modes in Trainz.
 
Train consists in CAB mode operate very differently for the full physics of each traincar is simulated, as is the delay for the air brakes systems to begin to have effect, wheel slippage on the Locos, and a host of other Real World physical modeling that is one of the attributes of Train simulators where once,'' 'for a long while,' ''Trainz software separated itself ahead of other competing packages.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Several challengers have rose up in the past decade, and each for a time claimed to do better than Trainz at realistically modeling the physical factors. Possibly it is true&amp;mdash;testing their scant stable of 20-30 prime movers against selected Trainz locos&amp;mdash;but it is unlikely across the board, as some loco creators ''figure this tested good enough'', while only a real Railroad Employee, also a purist, would likely recognize a difference. If the modeling is not perfect, it is ''close enough for most Trainzers to get along with!''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Picture of Cab Mode]]

In {{TL|Cab Mode}} the user can operate the driver's controls inside the 3D virtual cab by Click-N-Drag with the mouse, as well as use a superset of the hotkeys that are available in {{TL|DCC mode}}; most of which operate similarly but with a few important differences, and there are a few other differences driving locomotives with Diesel, Diesel-Electric, Electric, and Steam Loco prime mover technologies.
* 

Cab mode involves operating locomotives from their cabs and pulling levers and pressing switches for reversers, regulators, brakes and other controls, just like on a real locomotive. Instead of the DCC dial you get the Heads Up Display, which displays useful information such as throttle position, brake position and brake pipe pressure. Driving locomotives in cab mode is discussed in detail elsewhere in this Wikibook.

===Managing Multiple Trains===
At the bottom left of the Driver screen in TRS2004 and above is a portrait of a man. He is the driver for your train. If you have placed multiple trains then you can click on your driver's portrait to show the drivers for the other locomotives in the session and select them and their trains. 

To operate two or more trains simultaneously is relatively straightforward - of course the easiest way is to simply set each locomotive up to run and leave them to it. The problem with this method is that the locomotives will simply travel until either the session ends, you stop them manually or they derail - they will not obey switches, signals or buffers. This is where your drivers come in handy.

The most effective way to run multiple trains in a session is to give orders to the drivers. The long rectangular pane at the bottom of the Driver screen shows the orders for the currently selected driver. The symbol closest to the driver's portrait is his current order, with other orders progressing from left to right across the pane. To assign an order to your driver simply right-click in the order pane and choose an order from the menu. The most common orders are 'Drive To', 'Drive to Trackmark', 'Drive Via Trackmark' (In TS2009 and later the word 'Navigate' is used instead of 'Drive'), 'Load' and 'Unload'. When carrying out orders. the drivers will drive the train, keep to the speed limits and obey signals. They will also change switches (turnouts/points), provided that the path is clear and that no other driver is already in control of them. The degree of success to which drivers execute their orders is largely dependent on how effectively the layout is signalled and tracked. Whilst carrying out orders the driver is in control of the train - the DCC control or HUD is inaccessible. To go back to manual control tell your driver to 'stop train'; He will bring the train to a standstill and the DCC control or HUD will reappear.

==Other Controls==

===Switches===
Switches (also known as turnouts or points) are controlled by a large set of arrows over them, the current selected path (left or right) is shown by the green arrow. It is possible to have a maximum of 3 diverging tracks from a switch, and in that case there are three arrows. Click the set of arrows to select which path to take. 
By default, no current version of Trainz uses with animated turnouts with blades due to the way that track is laid in [[Surveyor]]. Hpwever third party-created animated turnouts are available from the [[DLS]], although they work in a slightly different way.
If you click a switch and the direction does not change, there could be one of three reasons why:
*1) Your train is standing too close to or on the turnout and therefore the switch cannot be changed in case of derailment.
*2) You are not clicking in the right place. Particularly with later versions of Trainz and in areas densely populated with switches, you may find that the wrong switch is moving. Try readjusting your camera angle and try again.
*3) The switch is currently under the control of an AI driver because his path takes him in that particular direction and he's close by. Find which driver is causing the problem, tell him to 'Stop Train' to regain control of the switch and the tell him to 'Continue Schedule' once that you are clear. If you obey the signals of a layout that is well signalled, this problem should be rare.
*From TS2012 upwards a yellow padlock icon indicates when a switch has been 'locked' by a train - either because a manually controlled train is too close or an AI driver has called a route across it.

===Signals===
Although not technically a control, signals are of course worth mentioning as a basic feature of Driver. Trainz features two basic types of signal, the modern colour light and the traditional semaphore. Signals are generally placed in 'blocks', but this is covered in more depth elsewhere in this wikibook. A feature of Driver is that if you hover your mouse over a signal aspect, Trainz will explain why the signal is showing that aspect. This is especially useful when a train reaches a signal at 'danger', as you can hover your mouse pointer over the signal to find out why it is at danger. Driver will then say for example, 'block is in use by another train'. If you then click on the red aspect, Driver will take you to the cause of it; for example in this case Driver will focus on the train currently fouling the block. The same system also works of the line is closed - Driver will take you to the closed turnout so that you can change it if required.

===Couple/Decouple mode===
(description required)

==Other Screens==

===Map View===
Map View shows a 2d birds-eye representation of the layout and all consists on it. It is useful for learning a new layout or navigating a complex one. The Map View button on the bottom right of the Driver screen.

===Waybills===
In TRS2004 and later, the [[active industries]] send a waybill to the awaybill screen when they get below a certain stock level, this show you where products are most needed.

==DCC Mode ==
{{anchor|DCC Mode|DCC mode}}&lt;!-- redirect to section targets here ---&gt;
;DCC Mode dse
: (''simulated'') Digital Command Control. The simpler of the two driving modes in Trainz. The term comes from the world of model railways where DCC chipsets automate railcar behaviors, but really applies to the '''dial type controllers'' used in electric powered Model Railroad. In Trainz, the term refers to a simulated ''dial controller'' or'' the 'power pack' ''that will be somewhat familiar to anyone that has played with a typical (non-Lionel) model railroad such as {{wp|H.O. Scale}} trainsets from toy and department stores.

* clean sand or salt

'''Preparation'''

Scoop a little sand into plastic baggies.  
Add around 10-15 drops of food coloring.
Seal the baggie and shake it up. 

Let the sand dry and have fun playing.  We left our sand right in the open baggies and let it dry overnight.  If you wanted to play right away, you could spread the sand out on a tray and it would dry much sooner.

== Create at least 2 sand art projects. ==

'''Sand art bottles:''' 

* Remove any labels from your bottle and wash it with soapy water. Rinse the bottle and allow it to dry completely.
* Create a funnel by rolling a sheet of heavy paper into a cone shape,holding it in place with a few staples or tape. Make sure the pointed end of your funnel fits into the neck of the bottle and that the opening at the bottom is no wider than 1/8 inch.
* Hold the paper funnel inside the neck of the bottle with one hand, and use a teaspoon to add the first color of sand a little at a time. Gently jiggle the funnel if the sand gets clogged in it. Start with less sand and add more a teaspoon at a time, if you wish.
* Examine the first layer and decide whether you want the colored-sand stripes to be flat and horizontal or diagonal. If you want diagonal strips, hold the bottle at an angle and tap it so that all the sand rests in one corner. Hold the bottle at this angle and add the second layer of sand, directing the point of the funnel into the empty corner.
* Continue adding layers of sand in different colors, taking care not to move the bottle around too much or too quickly, as this will cause the colors to mix together and destroy the layered look. Use the point of the funnel to direct each layer of sand into position. Stop when the bottle is full of layers of colored sand.
* Apply hot glue to the inside of the bottle neck and insert a cork, or apply glue around the outside of the neck and screw on its cap. Do not shake the bottle or the layers will be destroyed, and you will have a bottle of mixed multicolored sand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Reasoning&quot; is not well-defined, but in this book we'll use it to refer to deliberative, mostly conscious processing. It can be distinguished from faster, more old brain processing such as emotional processing. One way to look at the function of reasoning is to allow us to override our emotional impulses for longer-term goals. For example, your old brain might want you to eat the chocolate cake, but your reasoning system puts the brakes on that out of a longer-term desire to lose weight (Greene, 2013, 137).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Operators ===

Now, a program that just prints out text isn't very useful. To make a program that is useful we will need to learn a few more things about Lua. One of these things is the concept of ''operators''. An operator is something that takes one or two values, does some work on them, and produces a new value. For example, in Lua we have the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator, which takes two numbers, adds them together, and produces their sum.

{{Code:Lua
| code =
= 2 + 2
| output =
4
}}

Lua also has the &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; operator, which subtracts one number from another; the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; operator, which multiplies two numbers; and the &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; operator, which divides one number by another.  

{{Code:Lua
| code =
= 100 - 50
| output =
50
}}

{{Code:Lua
| code =
= 5 * 4
| output =
20
}}

{{Code:Lua
| code =
= 10 / 2
| output =
5
}}

One operator that you may find very useful is the &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt; operator. This is the ''concatenation'' operator, which takes two strings (two bits of text) and joins them together.

{{Code:Lua
| code =
= &quot;Hello, &quot; .. &quot;Fred!&quot;
| output =
Hello, Fred!
}}

      <comment>/* Strings */ elab, correct typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Source Documentation and Comments|Decorators}}
Python is a strongly idiomatic language: there is generally a single optimal way of doing something (a {{wp|programming idiom}}), rather than many ways: “[[w:There's more than one way to do it|There’s more than one way to do it]]” is ''not'' a Python motto.

This section starts with some general principles, then goes through the language, highlighting how to idiomatically use operations, data types, and modules in the standard library.

==Principles==
Use exception for error-checking, following EAFP (It’s Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission) instead of LBYL (Look Before You Leap): put an action that may fail inside a &lt;code&gt;try...except&lt;/code&gt; block.

Use [[Python Programming/Context Managers|context managers]] for managing resources, like files.

Use properties, not getter/setter pairs.

Use dictionaries for dynamic records, classes for static records: if a record always has the same fields, make this explicit in a class; if the fields may vary (be present or not), use a dictionary. 

Use &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; for throwaway variables, like discarding a return value when a tuple is returned, or to indicate that a parameter is being ignored (when required for an interface, say).

Use implicit True/False (truthy/falsy), except when needing to distinguish None (from 0 or []), in which case use &lt;code&gt;is None&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;== 0&lt;/code&gt; explicitly.

Use the optional &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; clause after &lt;code&gt;try, for, while&lt;/code&gt; not just &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;.

==Imports==
For very robust code, do not use &lt;code&gt;from m import n&lt;/code&gt;, as this creates a new binding, which is not necessarily in sync with the existing binding: &lt;code&gt;m.n&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; can differ if either is assigned to (creating a new binding).

In practice, this is generally ignored, as changing a module post-import is rare, so this is rarely a problem, and both classes and functions are imported from modules so they can be referred to without a prefix.

For robust code with low typing, one can use a renaming import to abbreviate a long module name:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import module_with_very_long_name as vl
vl.n  # easier than module_with_very_long_name.n, but still robust
&lt;/source&gt;

==Operations==
;Swap values
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
b, a = a, b
&lt;/source&gt;

;Attribute access on nullable value
To access an attribute (esp. to call a method) on a value that might be an object, or might be &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;, use the boolean shortcircuiting of &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
a and a.x
a and a.f()
&lt;/source&gt;
Particularly useful for regex matches:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
match and match.group(0)
&lt;/source&gt;

;in
&lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; in can be used for substring checking

==Data types==
===Lists===
;Indexing
Use &lt;code&gt;list.enumerate()&lt;/code&gt; if you need index as well, but iterate, don’t index:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
for i, x in enumerate(l):
    # ...
&lt;/source&gt;
Anti-idiom:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
for i in range(len(l)):
    x = l[i]  # why did you go from list to numbers back to the list?
    # ...
&lt;/source&gt;

;Finding first matching element
Python does not have a &lt;code&gt;list.find&lt;/code&gt; method. Instead, use &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; and a generator expression
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
try:
    x = next(n for n in l if n &gt; 0)
except StopIteration:
    print('No positive numbers')
else:
    print('The first positive number is', x)
&lt;/source&gt;
Use &lt;code&gt;enumerate&lt;/code&gt; if you need to find the index, as in:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
try:
    x = next(i for i, n in enumerate(l) if n &gt; 0)
except StopIteration:
    print('No positive numbers')
else:
    print('The index of the first positive number is', x)
&lt;/source&gt;

The reason for this construct is twofold:
* Exceptions let you signal “no match found” (they solve the semipredicate problem): since you’re returning a single value (not an index), this can’t be returned in the value.
* Generator expressions let you use an expression without needing a lambda or introducing new grammar.

;Truncating
Use &lt;code&gt;del&lt;/code&gt;, don’t self-slice:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
del l[j:]
del l[:i]
&lt;/source&gt;
Anti-idiom:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
l = l[:j]
l = l[i:]
&lt;/source&gt;
The simplest reason is that &lt;code&gt;del&lt;/code&gt; makes your intention clear: you’re truncating.

More subtly, slicing creates another reference to the same list (because lists are mutable), and then unreachable data can be garbage-collected, but generally this is done later. Deleting instead immediately modifies the list in-place (which is faster than creating a slice and then assigning it to the existing variable), and allows Python to immediately deallocate the deleted elements, instead of waiting for garbage collection.

In some cases you ''do'' want 2 slices of the same list – though this is rare in basic programming, other than iterating once over a slice in a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop – but it’s rare that you’ll want to make a slice of a whole list, then replace the original list variable with a slice (but not change the other slice!), as in the following funny-looking code:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
m = l
l = l[i:j]  # why not m = l[i:j] ?
&lt;/source&gt;

;Sorted list from a set or dict
You can create a sorted list directly from any iterable, without needing to first make a list and then sort it. These include sets and dictionaries (iterate on the keys):
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
s = {1, 'a', ...}
l = sorted(s)
d = {'a': 1, ...}
l = sorted(s)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Tuples===
Use tuples for constant sequences. This is rarely necessary (primarily when using as keys in a dictionary), but makes intention clear.

===Strings===
;Substring
Use &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; for substring checking.

;Building a string
To make a long string incrementally, build a list and then join it with &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; – or with newlines, if building a text file (don’t forget the final newline in this case!). This is faster and clearer than appending to a string, which is ''slow.'' (In principle can be &lt;math&gt;O(nk)&lt;/math&gt; in overall length of string and number of additions, which is &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; if pieces are of similar sizes.)

Don’t do this:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
s = ''
for x in l:
    # this makes a new string every iteration, because strings are immutable
    s += x
&lt;/source&gt;
Instead:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
# ...
# l.append(x)
s = ''.join(l)
&lt;/source&gt;
You can even use generator expressions, which are extremely efficient:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
s = ''.join(f(x) for x in l)
&lt;/source&gt;

If you do want a mutable string-like object, you can use &lt;code&gt;StringIO&lt;/code&gt;.

* [http://www.skymind.com/~ocrow/python_string/ Efficient String Concatenation in Python] – old article (so benchmarks out of date), but gives overview of some techniques.

===Dictionaries===
To iterate through a dictionary, either keys, values, or both:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
# Iterate over keys
for k in d:
    ...

# Iterate over values, Python 3
for v in d.values():
    ...

# Iterate over values, Python 2
# In Python 2, dict.values() returns a copy
for v in d.itervalues():
    ...

# Iterate over keys and values, Python 3
for k, v in d.items():
    ...

# Iterate over values, Python 2
# In Python 2, dict.items() returns a copy
for k, v in d.iteritems():
    ...
&lt;/source&gt;
Anti-patterns:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
for k, _ in d.items():  # instead: for k in d:
    ...
for _, v in d.items():  # instead: for v in d.values()
    ...
&lt;/source&gt;

FIXME:
* setdefault
* usually better to use collections.defaultdict

&lt;code&gt;dict.get&lt;/code&gt; is useful, but using &lt;code&gt;dict.get&lt;/code&gt; and then checking if it is &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; as a way of testing if the key is in the dictionary is an anti-idiom, as &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; is a potential value, and whether the key is in the dictionary can be checked directly. It’s ok to use &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and compare with &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; if this is a potential value, however.

Simple:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
if 'k' in d:
    # ... d['k']
&lt;/source&gt;

Anti-idiom (unless &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; is a potential value):
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
v = d.get('k')
if v is not None:
    # ... v
&lt;/source&gt;

;Dict from parallel sequences of keys and values
Use &lt;code&gt;zip&lt;/code&gt; as: &lt;code&gt;dict(zip(keys, values))&lt;/code&gt;

==Modules==
===re===
Match if found, else &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
match = re.match(r, s)
return match and match.group(0)
&lt;/source&gt;
…returns &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; if no match, and the match contents if there is one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is it conquest or &quot;Liberation of Western Europe&quot;? I mean, should it be &quot;Soviet defeat over nazi Germany&quot; or something more positive sounding then &quot;conquest&quot;. Even though it later became a race over who will occupy what between US and SSSR it does not mean this is right title for liberation or defeat over nazis! Right mister propaganda minister?
:Maybe ''Soviet offensive'' would be more appropriate.  Certainly not anything about ''liberation'' as there are over 100 million Europeans who would argue that the Soviets never liberated anything.  If a good name is decided then it will be easy to move the page to the new title.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:46, 16 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

    <title>Introduction to Philosophical Logic/Predicate Calculus</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Predicate calculus''', also called '''Logic Of Quantifiers''',  that part of modern formal or symbolic logic which systematically exhibits the logical relations between sentences that hold purely in virtue of the manner in which predicates or noun expressions are distributed through ranges of subjects by means of quantifiers such as “'''all'''” and “'''some'''” without regard to the meanings or conceptual contents of any predicates in particular. Such predicates can include both qualities and relations; and, in a higher-order form called the functional calculus, it also includes functions, which are “framework” expressions with one or with several variables that acquire definite truth-values only when the variables are replaced by specific terms. The predicate calculus is to be distinguished from the propositional calculus, which deals with unanalyzed whole propositions related by connectives (such as “and,” “if . . . then,” and “or”).

The traditional syllogism is the most well-known sample of predicate logic, though it does not exhaust the subject. In such arguments as “'''All C are B and no B are A, so no C are A''',” the truth of the two premises requires the truth of the conclusion in virtue of the manner in which the predicates B and A are distributed with reference to the classes specified by C and B, respectively. If, for example, the predicate A belonged to only one of the B’s, the conclusion then could possibly be false—some C could be an A.

'''Modern symbolic logic''', of which the predicate calculus is a part, does not restrict itself, however, to the traditional syllogistic forms or to their symbolisms, a very large number of which have been devised. The predicate calculus usually builds upon some form of the propositional calculus. It then proceeds to give a classification of the sentence types that it contains or deals with, by reference to the different manners in which predicates may be distributed within sentences. It distinguishes, for example, the following two types of sentences: “'''All F’s are either G’s or H’s''',” and “'''Some F’s are both G’s and H’s.'''” The conditions of truth and falsity in the basic sentence types are determined, and then a cross-classification is made that groups the sentences formulable within the calculus into three mutually exclusive classes—(1) those sentences that are true on every possible specification of the meaning of their predicate signs, as with “'''Everything is F or is not F'''”; (2) those false on every such specification, as with “'''Something is F and not F'''”; and (3) those true on some specifications and false on others, as with “'''Something is F and is G.'''” These are, respectively, the tautologous, inconsistent, and contingent sentences of the predicate calculus. Certain tautologous sentence types may be selected as axioms or as the basis for rules for transforming the symbols of the various sentence types; and rather routine and mechanical procedures may then be laid down for deciding whether given sentences are tautologous, inconsistent, or contingent—or whether and how given sentences are logically related to each other. Such procedures can be devised to decide the logical properties and relations of every sentence in any predicate calculus that does not contain predicates (functions) that range over predicates themselves—i.e., in any first-order, or lower, predicate calculus.

Calculi that do contain predicates ranging freely over predicates, on the other hand—called higher-order calculi—do not permit the classification of all their sentences by such routine procedures. As was proved by '''Kurt Gödel''', a 20th-century ''Moravian-born American mathematical logician'', these calculi, if consistent, always contain well-formed formulas such that neither they nor their negations can be derived (shown tautologous) by the rules of the calculus. Such calculi are, in the precise sense, incomplete. Various restricted forms of the higher-order calculi have been shown, however, to be susceptible to routine decision procedures for all of their formulae.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It doesn't seem as though language would have much to do with consciousness--we feel that we are conscious of a roller coaster ride without having to put words to it. However, Helen Keller, who was born blind and deaf, said &quot;Before my teacher came to me, I did not know that I am. I lived in a world that was a no-world... When I learned the meaning of `I' and `me' and found that I was something, I began to think. Then consciousness first existed for me.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Jabr, F. (2014). Speak for yourself. Scientific American mind. January/February, 46—51.&lt;/ref&gt; Now, we don't know what Keller meant, exactly, by thinking and consciousness, but her report is intriguing. What does it mean for animals, who have no language?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== IP Message on Spam ==
Ok, I read it.  First, I would say that this falls under &quot;good faith&quot;. Second, I do not see a catagory that would reject this under good faith.  
So (pardon me being naive) it seems that would leave it into the grey area of &quot;is it useful and relevant?&quot;  I would say so, but being in that grey area, I would think it best to let the community decide?  As I mentioned, I fail to see how it is conceptually different from other links on the page.  

About the other links, I certainly do not want them to appear as &quot;spam&quot; as I think they are quite useful to the readers of those pages.  But, if that's the way it's done, would it be acceptable to link the two different pages ONCE apiece from somewhere within Wikipedia?  

For example, I had another external link deleted (by the same person) on the pages &quot;Curve fitting&quot; and &quot;Regression Analysis&quot;.  These are closely related pages.  Would it be acceptable to link the external site that demonstrates curve fitting through regression from, say, only the Wiki Curve Fitting page?  

As an aside, would it help if I &quot;registered&quot; to reduce the attacks on the pages I edit? In other words, am I being singled out for having an IP address instead of a registered account? 

Thank you. {{unsigned|24.130.168.37}}

Hi. I'm new to Wiki, and this is my first page. But I don't know how to make it a stub, though I have all intentions to. [[User:Tyroneweaver|Tyroneweaver]] ([[User talk:Tyroneweaver|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tyroneweaver|contribs]]) 17:58, 5 April 2014 (UTC)

== Reviewer Message from [[User:Xania]] ==
I have noticed that you've been active with reviewing recent changes and reverted nonsense and vandalism which is great.  If you ever have time there are unchecked edits dating back about 9 months which can be found at [[Special:ValidationStatistics]].  I'm slowly making my way through the pages (it was about 1400 unreviewed a few weeks ago and now down to about 1000).--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:43, 18 March 2014 (UTC)


:You recently warned [[User:Madeline Barlow]] for [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Puzzles/Riddles&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=2619103 this] edit.  It seems to be a poorly formatted edit but certainly not vandalism.  It doesn't seem a good idea to warn somebody about vandalism for their first edit to Wikibooks.

::::Yeah, fine.  I Queried some of the pages because they were in the mainspace but without a front page and another page because the title was most probably wrong (as above where ''bicycle'' is spelled ''bycycle'').  Hopefully one of the contributors will move or rename pages soon otherwise I'll move all pages to the user name space.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:44, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

== [[Professionalism/Growth Hacking]] ==

Is there a reason for reverting 7 edits by 2 different logged-in users and one IP user [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Professionalism/Growth_Hacking&amp;action=history here]?  I can't see any vandalism in any of these edits and if there is vandalism in ''one'' of those edits then reverting is not the way to fix the problem.  Rejecting edits will reject ''all'' edits between the last approved edit and the most recent.  It is hard to see the exact changes in this page because the edits are so frequent and by several users.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:27, 16 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Controlling a Stage''' deals with the inputs and outputs of a single stage: construction/receival and issuing of [[../Glossary#Work Package|work packages]]; tracking and reporting progress through the stage; and capturing and acting on [[../Glossary#Issue|issues]].

The key activities of this process are explained below.

The Trainz community is international and we would be remiss if we didn't point out that there is much to be learned from selfless Trainzers who have put together educational tutorials ahead of our efforts. Since the user interface in Trainz has evolved only slowly  many tutorials written for Trainz from the earliest days still have much to teach the newcomer and experienced Trainzers alike. Please enjoy mining these gems for the many golden nuggets and insights they contain.&lt;noinclude&gt;

== Looking for help ==
Greetings:
My name is Ivan Robaina Bychko and I am a 19 years old Cuban Wikipedia who currently works in several articles about Philosophy both in Spanish Wikipedia and at my university (University of Santiago -Universidad de Oriente-/you can see the link here: www.uo.edu.cu).
I am very interested in philosophy and I would be very thankful if you would be willing to help me to collect some information about it that is difficult to find in bibliography (It is even harder to find to me since I do not have international internet connectivity). In case you want to contact me, my e-mail account is: nayesda.daria@medired.scu.sld.cu
Humbly waiting for your willingness to help me
Sincerely yours,
Ivan</text>

      <comment>Use &lt;nowiki /&gt; to prevent ‘News:’ from being treated as an URI scheme; enclose Perl package names in &lt;code /&gt;.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Name ==

&lt;code&gt;News&lt;nowiki /&gt;::NAAF::Common&lt;/code&gt; – common NAAF functions and constants

== Synopsis ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use News::NAAF::Common qw (anystring uuid asn_1_prepare);

my $naaf_header_magic
    = $News::NAAF::Common::magic_uuid;
my $naaf_asn_1
    = asn_1_prepare ();
my $a_string
    = anystring (&quot;Hello, world!\r\n&quot;);
my $a_uuid
    = uuid (&quot;30b9d3f8-fe78-432e-8076-72547e4dbf59&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Interface ==
&lt;!-- NB: [[w:Man page]]s are not unknown to have whole paragraphs contained within description lists; as MediaWiki markup does not seem to provide a way to express such a structure, plain HTML is used below instead --&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $naaf_header_magic = $News&lt;nowiki /&gt;::NAAF::Common::magic_uuid;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;This variable holds the UUID value used as the “magic” in the &lt;code &gt;NAAFHeader&lt;/code&gt; NAAF header entry.  The UUID is &lt;code &gt;365768c5-49ef-4cd3-b308-f4b5b98514f0&lt;/code&gt; for the current version of the format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $naaf_asn_1 = asn_1_prepare ();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return a new &lt;code &gt;Convert::ASN1&lt;/code&gt; object, pre-loaded with the NAAF ASN.1 definition and suitable for encoding and decoding NAAF data structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $as = anystring ($string);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return a new hash reference representing a Perl string as a NAAF &lt;code &gt;AnyString&lt;/code&gt;.  Currently, this function will return a &lt;code &gt;uTF8String&lt;/code&gt; variety if the string given is pure-ASCII, and a &lt;code &gt;octetString&lt;/code&gt; otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $uuid = uuid ($uuid_string);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return a 16-byte binary representation of the UUID given as a dashed-hexadecimal string.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{#babel:cdo|zh|en-3|}}

'''English''': I am born and raised in Fuzhou, and therefore I am a native Fuzhou Dialect speaker. I can also speak Mandarin Chinese and English fluently. I also understand most of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). I am able to type Chinese characters by Wubi IME. Technically, I am a computer programmer, and good at computer programming. My main programming languages are C and C++, also I can write PHP web pages. The main browser I am using is Chrome. I am also interested in mathematics, and able to write mathematical equation in LaTeX. I also write some articles in LaTeX. The operating systems I am using or have been used are DOS, Windows and Linux. I prefer using command-line interface rather than Graphical User Interface, because it is much more convenient to use.

'''Mandarin Chinese''': 我是福州本地人，會講福州話。我也能講一口流利的普通話和英語。我也能看懂絕大多數的國際音標。我會使用五筆輸入法。技術上，我是一名計算機程序員，熱愛程序設計。我主要使用的編程語言是C語言和C++語言，我也會用PHP語言寫網頁。我主要使用的瀏覽器是Chrome。個人感興趣於數學，同時能用LaTeX寫數學式子。有時，我也用LaTeX來寫一些論文。我正在使用和用過操作系統有DOS、Windows和Linux。相對於圖形用戶界面，我更喜歡命令行界面，因為我認為這用起來更方便。

'''Min Dong Chinese''': -{我是福州本地儂，會八講福州話。我也會八講熟練其講普通話共英語。我也看會會意大部分國際音標。我會八寫福州話漢字，固加會八使五筆輸入法。敆技術懸頂，我是蜀隻計算機程序員，喜歡程序設計。我主要使其編程語言是C語言共C++語言，我也會別使PHP語言寫網頁。我主要使其瀏覽器是Chrome。個人對數學有興趣，會別使LaTeX寫數學式子。有時，我也使LaTeX來寫仂囝論文。我正在使其共使過操作系統有DOS、Windows共Linux。相對圖形用戶界面，我更更喜歡使命令行界面，因為我見覺這使起去比較方便。}-</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The attraction of gamifying a task is that it may take on the addictive qualities of a game, getting contributors to put more effort in by making them feel more rewarded. This reward might be a personal sense of achievement or the social value of showing off the badge.

A down-side of gamification is that it can potentially ruin motivation. A person’s motivation can be ''intrinsic'' (doing the task for its own sake) or ''extrinsic'' (based on external incentives such as pay or prizes). A well-replicated finding in psychology is that extrinsic motivation decreases intrinsic motivation. In other words, if someone is already enthusiastic to contribute, heaping them with prizes and incentives will make them less likely to contribute, or do their best work, in future. Incentives seem to draw attention to themselves rather than to the benefit created by the work. Contributors may come to see themselves as working for the incentives rather than for the good of the work itself and its outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, S. (2007) ''Irrationality''. London: Pinter &amp; Martin. ISBN: 9781905177073, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Extrinsic motivation can also create perverse incentives: when people are rewarded for their number of contributions, or for other achievements defined by the software, the actual quality of the work may be sacrificed. This happened for the citizen science project [[:w:Galaxy Zoo|Galaxy Zoo]] when it introduced a score and other gamification. When Galaxy Zoo introduced certain game-like elements, like a score, they found that the quality of results dipped.&lt;ref&gt;Shubber, K. (12 September 2013) [http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-09/12/fraxinus-gamifying-science How Facebook and gaming could help scientists battle disease] ''Wired''&lt;/ref&gt;

A forum moderator of the site [http://www.galaxyzooforum.org/index.php?topic=279431.0;nowap writes]:

{{quote|In the early days of Galaxy Zoo we did have a ranking system [for top contributor and so on], but it led to people being careless with classifications, unhappy about their position, suspecting each other of somehow cheating etc. So things improved without it.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Within Wikipedia, three types of &quot;achievements&quot; can get recognition:

* Getting a piece of content (an article or an image) up to a high standard
* A pattern of exemplary behaviour, such as diligent copy-editing across many articles
* An increase in total edits to an arbitrary milestone

Each of these results in badges that users can display publicly, but which are optional.

Content that passes a formal quality review (including [[:w:Wikipedia:Good article criteria|Good Article]], [[:w:Wikipedia:Featured article criteria|Featured Article]], or [[:w:Wikipedia:Featured picture criteria|Featured Picture]]) reflects well on the users who create or improve it. Users can add badges to their profile to show which quality content they have been involved with. This helps the user’s reputation and credibility within the site.

One prolific Wikipedian’s user profile shows the quality content they are associated with. The FA, A, FL, GA and DYK badges refer to articles they have helped reach specific quality standards. This user has also had numerous facts included in the On This Day (OTD) and In The News (ITN) sections of Wikipedia.

MediaWiki software records many measures of user activity: edits to articles, comments to other users and so on. So Wikipedia ''could'' have been configured to post a colourful badge on a user’s profile announcing each thousand edits they make, or every hundred vandal edits reverted. Instead, it mostly relies on users voluntarily giving each other badges. [[:w:Wikipedia:Barnstars|Barnstars]] are informal awards that users can give each other. They reward good work in a particular topic area or good deeds such as reverting a great amount of vandalism. Since Barnstars come from other contributors, not automatically from software, the practice encourages positive interactions between users and a feeling of real appreciation. The positive incentivising effect of barnstars has been confirmed by experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Restivo, M., van de Rijt, A. (2012) Experimental Study of Informal Rewards in Peer Production. ''PLoS ONE'', 7(3) [Online]. DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0034358 Accessed 17 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Citation Barnstar Hires.png|thumbnail|right|The Citation Barnstar, an award for Wikipedians “who provide references and in-line citations to previously unsourced articles.”]]

It would be technically possible for these barnstars to automatically appear in a trophy cabinet for each user. In reality, the contributor chooses whether or not to show off these awards. This is how differences in intrinsic/extrinsic motivation is handled: those who want to socially signal their achievements can build trophy cabinets; others who are not interested in awards can treat badges as just a personal message of thanks.&lt;ref&gt;Algan, Y., Benkler, Y., Morell, M.F., Hergueux, J. (2013) [http://www.eief.it/files/2013/08/yann-algan.pdf &quot;Cooperation in a Peer Production Economy: Experimental Evidence from Wikipedia&quot;] [Pre print]. Accessed 17 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributors with a competitive mindset can be extremely productive, so long as they do not interfere with or discourage others. Then again, a project built exclusively around competition will repel the intrinsically-motivated people. Some of the awards internal to Wikipedia direct competitive instincts towards collaboration with others: this is visible in some Barnstars, such as the Barnstar of Diplomacy or the Teamwork Barnstar. Getting articles or images reviewed is partly an individual achievement but requires working constructively with a reviewer and responding to feedback. Hence many of the badges and awards that are available within Wikipedia, along with other initiatives such as mentorship between users, incentivise friendly co-operation. This is not to say that Wikipedia has the ideal mix, since more could be done to make it friendly and welcoming.

;Tip: Thanking a contributor

If a user is helpful to you, or improves an area that you want to see improved, a quick thanks may well be appreciated. Wikimedia makes this easy. Every user on any Wikimedia site has a Talk page: its name will begin “User talk:”. The “+” or “Add topic” tab at the top of the page enables anyone to add a public message for that user. Alternatively, the heart icon at the top of the page activates a feature called “WikiLove”: a wizard that makes it easy to give a user a friendly, personalised message or an award. These messages are from one person to another, so it is important to explain in a personal way what you are thanking the user for.

[[:w:Wikipedia:Service awards|Service Awards]] are badges users can add to their profiles to recognise a total number and duration of edits. Although it is a rough measure of seniority, edit count is largely meaningless as a measure of quality: an individual edit can fix a typo, introduce a typo, or add ten thousand words of excellent encyclopedic text. The service awards include “Experienced editor”, “Veteran editor” and similar, or alternatively “Grognard Mirabilaire”, “Tutnum”, and similar deliberately ludicrous terms. So depending on their attitudes to their edit count, Wikipedians have three options for displaying their experience as editors: collect service awards, ignore them as irrelevant, or collect silly service awards. As of January 2014, about 500 English-language Wikipedians describe themselves as “Veteran Editors” versus about 100 for the equivalent “Tutnum”.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While contributors appreciate attribution, and can earn status from the quality or quantity of their work, explicit gamification and badging are not essential to successful crowdsourcing. In fact they are potentially disastrous if enforced when the project’s goal is one that contributors already admire, such as free education or advancing science.

Status and badges motivate some people, and creating and awarding badges is an opportunity for creative expression and social interaction. Designed well, badges can direct competitive instincts into collaborative behaviour. Then again, personalities differ: badges that appeal to one contributor might seem offensively infantile to another.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some computer games have an addictive quality which comes from having many “achievements”, frequently reminding players of their progress. Each new achievement gives a sense of accomplishment for the player, and since the steps are relatively minor, the next reward is just around the corner. The term “[[:w:gamification|gamification]]” applies when a large task is broken into many relatively minor, achievable goals which are salient in the form of points or trophies. We might ask if successful crowdsourcing requires gamification; for instance, is Wikipedia gamified? The answer is actually not straightforward.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Improving a highly specialised scientific database might seem the sort of task that needs to be kept to experts rather than opened up to the general public. In fact, it fits the earlier description of tasks that benefit from crowdsourcing. It can be broken down into many small, independent steps, each of which can be checked individually, and at least some of the necessary skills are widely available. A crowdsourcing project does not have to leave everything to the public but can invite them to build on something created by professionals.

Image: Data about a protein family on Wikipedia

The [[:w:Pfam|Pfam protein families database]], used extensively by biochemists, has benefitted from a bi-directional linking with Wikipedia. Encyclopedia articles have been populated with information from Pfam and corrections or expansions can be fed back into it. This puts the Pfam data where it will be very easily found and used by researchers, students and other users, with links to the official site for verification. It also puts any errors where they can be seen and acted upon. The Pfam maintainers realise that minor errors can occur in a large database, but they use that as a reason to make the data as visible as possible rather than as an argument against publication.

Changes to the Wikipedia articles are not copied immediately into the database, but are collected by a script and manually checked. The Pfam maintainers write:

{{quote|Most edits are simple format or typographic improvements, but many have also provided valuable scientific content, including significant improvements to and expansion of important articles.&lt;ref&gt;Finn, R. D. et al. (1 January 2014) &quot;Pfam: the protein families database&quot; ''Nucleic Acids Research'' volume 42 issue D1 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt1223 DOI 10.1093/nar/gkt1223]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With a more controversial topic (such as current politicians) the proportion of vandal edits would be much higher, but protein families are stable enough that anyone editing an article is at least trying to improve it.

So there is a role for the public to play in maintaining a scholarly database. Since “the public” includes highly qualified people, this role is not restricted to low-value contributions. Collaboration between the professional Pfam community and interested members of the public would be impossible to arrange prospectively, but thanks to wiki technology and shared data they can work in parallel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[:w:OpenStreetMap|OpenStreetMap]] (OSM) is “an open initiative to create and provide free map data to anyone who wants them”. Its maps are built from imports of existing free databases and from individuals using widely available GPS devices and software. OSM presently has one and a half million registered users and about 30% of registered users have made at least one edit. The “Open” means both an open process of gradual improvement and that the resulting geodata is open for use in other web sites and apps.

[[File:Southampton from OpenStreetMap.png|thumb|right|OpenStreetMap's view of Southampton, UK]]
OSM is not a Wikimedia site and its output looks very different from Wikipedia, but as a community has striking similarities with Wikipedia which underlie its success.

* There is an overarching, easily-understandable goal.
* Existing things such as Ordnance Survey maps can serve as a tangible model of the goal, even though the content of OS cannot be copied.
* The goal allows scope for individual choices and judgements (for instance, in interpreting what it means to document all the features of a particular area).
* There is still a strong limit on individual judgement and hence disagreement (because the map has to reflect real, notable geographical features).
* People may make very different contributions, but the direction of progress is clear. It is verifiable that the map is becoming more accurate and detailed.
* Users retain legal ownership of contributions but apply a free licence (CC-BY-SA and an open data licence) to allow reuse.
* The free licence and hosting by a nonprofit foundation show contributors that they are working for the public good.
* The technology makes each contribution record publicly visible, so people can build reputations. Particularly productive or disruptive users will stand out.
* It is technically possible to insert pranks or hoaxes, but those will be visible to the other contributors and can be undone.
* Coverage is uneven, reflecting the distribution of the required technologies and the interests of contributors.
* If it had waited to be “finished” before being published, it would not exist in a useful form. Releasing the incomplete product to the public has been crucial in getting them to improve it.
* There are leaderboards for contributors and users can build up showcases of badges and awards, but game-like rewards are not central to the site and many contributors ignore them.

As well as encouraging casual users to edit, OSM’s interface also puts a high priority on exporting and reuse. Too much control and scarcity would be counter-productive: the ease of getting data out gives people confidence to put their data in. Free reuse has led to the ubiquity of OSM in ever more applications and devices, which in turn gives the public a stake in its quality.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:How_to_create_a_Wikipedia_Town._The_story_of_MonmouthpediA.pdf|thumb|right]]
In an ambitious but successful project, a small group of Wikipedians worked with local people, public bodies and businesses to [[:w:Wikipedia:Monmouthpedia|thoroughly document the Welsh town of Monmouth]]. They wrote articles and shared digital media relating to its history, buildings, notable people, and even individual objects in local museums. This spawned hundreds of articles and over 1000 uploaded images, resulting in about 400,000 hits on Monmouth-created content in one year. The booklet [[:File:How_to_create_a_Wikipedia_Town._The_story_of_MonmouthpediA.pdf|&quot;How to create a Wikipedia Town&quot;]] summarises their methods and lessons learned.

The motivation for the wiki contributors took many forms. There were competitions to encourage articles and translations, with on-wiki badges and prizes such as t-shirts. While not financially very valuable, the prizes were a tangible sign of appreciation for the volunteers, many of whom were in countries far away. Wikipedia project pages had [[:w:Wikipedia:GLAM/MonmouthpediA/Geoffrey_of_Monmouth_Challenge/Points|leaderboards]] to highlight users who had created or translated particularly large numbers of articles, and examples of the best images submitted.

So the opportunities for recognition and competition were there if contributors wanted the elements of a game, but visibility was not the only motivation. The project’s publicity focused on the historical and political significance of Monmouth, its density of museums and other cultural and educational institutions. It also emphasised the value of free knowledge, of developing skills, and of working online with people from different languages and cultures. The project also showed that everyone in the community could contribute, from the local authority who released digital media under a Wikipedia-compatible licence to individual enthusiasts with computers or cameras.

Monmouth also illustrates the value of open and free content in the sustainability of a project. People are presently encouraged to access the local articles through multilingual QR codes that can be read with a mobile phone, but technology will move on. The main achievement of the project is a great amount of freely-available content in a form that can be endlessly remixed and repurposed. When new location-related technologies arrive, Monmouth will be ready for them because so many of its features are described in Wikipedia articles with embedded geographical data.</text>

The educational and research value of images or other digital media can be enhanced by additional work:

* restoration (such as cropping, colour balance, removing specks)
* contextualisation (such as embedding a portrait in text about the subject)
* improving metadata (categorising, adding machine-readable information, translating the description into other languages)

Image collections may well have content and expertise but not the capacity to do this. So it makes sense to work with a project which has volunteer labour and wants content.

Wikimedia Commons hosts the digital media files that are embedded in Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia sites. Its content is freely reusable, either because its copyright has lapsed or it has been given a relevant free licence. It has reached many millions of files partly as a result of partnerships with museums, libraries, and other cultural institutions. Its purpose is not just to host media but to enable crowdsourced improvements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Not everybody wants images to be restored. Many who want to use an image in a paper or blog post will prefer a cleaned-up version. On the other hand, some researchers are primarily interested in exactly what is removed by image restoration: the texture of the paper, the degradation of an old photograph. Wikimedia Commons' solution to this trade-off is to allow access to multiple versions. This is an example of non-paternalism: giving choices to the user rather than making them on their behalf.

There are two senses in which Commons gives access to multiple versions of a file. A slightly changed file can be uploaded as a new version: the software will show the most recent by default but older versions are still available. [[:File:Hyder_Khan_of_Ghazni_in_1939-42.jpg|&quot;Hyder Khan of Ghazni&quot;]], shared by the British Library, has nicely vivid colours as a result of digital restoration. The older, unrestored versions are still linked under &quot;File history&quot;.

More substantial changes can be uploaded as a separate version with a link back to the original. Freedom to do this comes naturally from the free licences. A major change might be a drastic restoration or it might create a derivative work, for example [[:File:Einstein_1911_Solvay.jpg|extracting a portrait of Albert Einstein]] from a group photo.

;Tip

Within Commons, images are being edited to make derivative versions or combined to make collages, forming a web of related files. To navigate through this web, use the &quot;what links here&quot; button in the left navigation of any page on Commons.

The Commons page for each file shows where the file is embedded on other Wikimedia sites, including Wikipedia. Daily view statistics for Wikipedia pages are also public. This data is all machine-readable, allowing the creation of [https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM/Resources/Tools software tools] that track total views of a batch of images. This is how the British Museum can demonstrate [http://tools.wmflabs.org/glamtools/glamorous.php?doit=1&amp;category=British+Museum&amp;use_globalusage=1&amp;ns0=1&amp;depth=9 more than 27,000 uses of its images] across Wikimedia by the start of 2014 and how the Archivist of the United States was able to [http://blogs.archives.gov/aotus/?p=5179 announce one billion hits during 2013] on the National Archives’ content shared through Wikimedia.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Restoration can include cropping, fixing colour balance, contrast, orientation and hiding damage. It is achievable with widely available software, including free software such as [[:w:GIMP|GIMP]]. This is an ideal task for crowdsourcing.

* The tools and skills are widely distributed, not restricted to institutions
* The task of restoring a batch of images can be broken down into many small steps which do not depend on each other
* The open process means that nothing is lost if someone does a bad job: another restorer can start again from the origina.
* It is publicly verifiable what each user has contributed, so contributors can get recognition for their work
* Involving the crowd does not prevent professionals from doing the work: it just gives the professionals another platform to work on and a chance for more feedback

Volunteers will not work systematically through an entire archive but will pick the images they find interesting or which are most likely to be valued by the wider community. Wikipedia volunteer Durova’s motivation is clear [http://durova.blogspot.co.uk/2009/03/getting-it-wright.html when she writes] about restoring a picture of the Wright Brothers’ first flight from an original provided by the US Library of Congress:

{{quote|This is arguably the most important photograph in aviation engineering history. It’s an honor to work on a version that hundreds of thousands of people will see in dozens of languages.}}

&lt;gallery mode=packed heights=300px&gt;
File:Wrightflyer_highres.jpg
File:First_flight2.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This may contrast with motivations of professionals, who want to get a whole batch of work finished. The trade-off for professionals is that crowdsourcing might speed up restoration of the whole batch, but working efficiently might require them to concentrate their own effort on the less interesting parts of the collection.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Getting digital content reused in research and education is partly about giving it a useful context, which could be an article explaining its significance, or a worksheet that describes an educational use.&lt;ref&gt;Poulter, M. (5 December 2013) [http://digitisation.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2013/12/05/what-wikimedia-can-do-for-digitised-content/ &quot;What Wikimedia can do for digitised content&quot;] ''Jisc Digitisation and Content Programme blog''&lt;/ref&gt; Contextualisation is potentially an enormous amount of work, unless you realise that academics and informal learning communities seek photographs, diagrams and other media for their materials. They will provide the context if the media are suitable and if the barriers to doing so are minimal.

Lowering the barriers for these audiences means lowering the legal barrier by giving them permission in advance to copy and reuse: this is what free licensing achieves. It also means putting content where they are looking for it. These are arguments for sharing through Commons in addition to the content holder’s own site.

Wikipedia articles are the clearest example of a context that brings digital media to a large audience, and this is a key reason for sharing material via Commons. Just because an image is relevant to a topic does not necessarily mean it can be embedded in the Wikipedia article. This will come down to the consensus of Wikipedians working on that article about how many images are needed and which have sufficient relevance, technical quality, and aesthetic appeal. If you have a portrait of a historical figure whose Wikipedia article lacks a picture, then there will be no problem adding it. On the other hand, if you have an image related to Henry VIII of England, getting it into [[:w:Henry VIII of England|that already-developed article]] is going to require discussion with the article's contributors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Restoration and improvement of digital media are ideal applications for crowdsourcing. Wikis and free licensing can connect media collections with remote institutions or hobbyists who want interesting content to work on. Wikimedia Commons offers these benefits as well as the crucial ability to embed media in Wikipedia pages. To get these benefits, content holders need the courage to open up their content and metadata for editing by others.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once an image is uploaded to Commons, its description and metadata are open for editing by anyone, just like Wikipedia. The possible changes include:

* linking terms in the description to explanations (such as Wiktionary definitions or Wikipedia articles)
* translating the description into other languages
* categorising
* and in rare cases improving or correcting the description

The more discoverable the files are on Commons, the more likely they are to be found. So it is strongly advisable to include a full catalogue description and meaningful categories when the files are uploaded. There are Wikimedia noticeboards and mailing lists which can be used to raise awareness of media collections that are being shared.

A set of images shared by the US Library of Congress included one from the aftermath of the Wounded Knee Massacre, showing &quot;scattered debris&quot; according to the catalogue description. With the image substantially cleaned up by a Commons volunteer, the &quot;debris&quot; was identifiable as four corpses of Sioux people. The Library's description was updated to reflect this, as was the programme of an exhibition featuring the photograph.
&lt;gallery mode=packed heights=300px&gt;
File:Wounded_Knee_aftermath.jpg
File:Wounded_Knee_aftermath3.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Other media ==
Similar restoration and improvement can happen with audio, and free software for editing and clean-up is widely available as it is for images. An example is an [[:File:Tony_Benn_Interview.ogg|interview with British politician Tony Benn]] which has been [[:File:Tony_Benn_Cleaned_Interview.ogg|cleaned up]] for use in [[:wikinews:Wikinews_interviews:_Tony_Benn_on_U.K._politics|a Wikinews article]], fixing the frequency balance and removing pauses. Commons has relatively little audio content and its requirement for unrestricted formats means that OGG and FLAC audio files are used rather than the more familiar (but patent-encumbered) MP3.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although aimed at biomedical projects, the rules here are abstract enough to be broadly applicable:

* Masum, H., Rao, A., Good, B.M., Todd, M.H., Edwards, A.M., et al. (2013) ‘Ten Simple Rules for Cultivating Open Science and Collaborative R&amp;D’. ''PLoS Computational Biology'', 9(9). [http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003244 DOI 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003244] (Accessed 17 February 2014).

This article is aimed at experts who want to improve Wikipedia, but many of the points apply to lay contributors and to working with other collaborative communities:

* Logan D.W., Sandal M., Gardner P.P., Manske M., Bateman A. (2010) “Ten Simple Rules for Editing Wikipedia” ''PLoS Computational Biology''. [http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000941 DOI 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000941] (Accessed 17 February 2014).

There are several books about how to contribute to Wikipedia as an individual user. This one is more about the cultural factors that contribute to Wikipedia’s success:

* Joseph, M. Reagle, Jr. (2010) [http://reagle.org/joseph/2010/gfc/ ''Good Faith Collaboration: The Culture of Wikipedia''] MIT Press.

In this popular book, Clay Shirky looks at crowdsourcing in more depth:

* &lt;font size=3&gt;Other than one meter used for a short time in 1937, postage meter use in Turkey began in 1954.
* All franks contain “TÜRK POSTALARI” or “TÜRKIYE CUMHURIYETI”. 

* The stamps are grouped according to appearance:
:: A – Frank with scalloped single-line frame line
:: B – Frank with simulated-perforation outer frame line and straight inner frame line
:: C – Franks with straight frame lines along all sides
:: D – Frank without outer frame line and with town mark attached 
:: E – Frank with frame lines at top and bottom only, top line always with indented semi-circles
:: F – Frank with frame lines at top and bottom only, top line always straight

'''NOTE''': For more detailed information about the meter stamps of Turkey, see ''Die Absender- und Postfreistempel der Türkei'', by Otto Gleixner, self-published 1995, Seefeld, Germany.

The interface implemented is rather high-level; the instances can be directly queried for specific NAAF objects (including NAAF stream [[../News::NAAF::NAAFHeader|header]] and [[../News::NAAF::NAAFTrailer|trailer]] records, specific netnews [[../News::NAAF::Article|articles]] and [[../News::NAAF::Group|groups]], and [[../News::NAAF::Connection|server connections]]), while the implementation takes care of actually reading the stream (in possibly arbitrary order), uncompressing it as necessary, decoding the data and wrapping it into suitable Perl objects.

This implementation will read only the ''parts'' of the NAAF stream relevant to the queries performed, provided that all the conditions below are met.
# The filehandle associated with the NAAF stream is seekable.
# The stream is ''properly terminated'' with an ''uncompressed'' delimiter record (the ''tail''), aligned to the ''tail alignment'' boundary (as specified in the NAAF stream header record.)
# The tail has the ''last part length'' (or ''last part compressed length,'' if the stream is compressed) field properly set.
# The last record of the last part (as pointed to by the tail) is the NAAF stream trailer, with its ''offsets'' field having all the subfields relevant to the queries to be performed properly set.  (Please note that the ''parts'' subfield is currently used by ''all'' the implemented queries, along with the ''compressed parts'' subfield should the input stream be ''compressed''.)

Otherwise, this implementation will fall back to reading the stream in order until the requested object is found, possibly uncompressing the stream, while also caching the data being read.

Unless otherwise noted, the methods described below are “safe” in the sense that they always return the requested object, or raise an exception if the request cannot be fulfilled for some reason.

== Interface ==
&lt;!-- NB: [[w:Man page]]s are not unknown to have whole paragraphs contained within description lists; as MediaWiki markup does not seem to provide a way to express such a structure, plain HTML is used below instead --&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $ro = News&lt;nowiki /&gt;::NAAF::ReadOnly-&gt;new ($input);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $ro = News&lt;nowiki /&gt;::NAAF::ReadOnly-&gt;new ($input, \%options);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return a new &lt;code &gt;News&lt;nowiki /&gt;::NAAF::ReadOnly&lt;/code&gt; object associated with the input filehandle given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ro-&gt;close ();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the &lt;code &gt;News&lt;nowiki /&gt;::NAAF::ReadOnly&lt;/code&gt; object, invalidating it for any future use, and potentially allowing for the memory occupied by the associated data structures to be reclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'''Note''' that it’s an error to use any method other than &lt;code &gt;close&lt;/code&gt; itself on a &lt;code &gt;News&lt;nowiki /&gt;::NAAF::ReadOnly&lt;/code&gt; object after it has been closed with &lt;code &gt;close&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $naaf_header = $ro-&gt;header ();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return the NAAF stream header as a [[../News::NAAF::NAAFHeader|News::NAAF::NAAFHeader]] object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $naaf_trailer = $ro-&gt;trailer ();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return the NAAF stream trailer as a [[../News::NAAF::NAAFTrailer|News::NAAF::NAAFTrailer]] object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $article = $ro-&gt;article ($index);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return the netnews article associated with the given non-negative integer index as a [[../News::NAAF::Article|News::NAAF::Article]] object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $connection = $ro-&gt;connection ($index);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return the netnews server connection record associated with the given non-negative integer index as a [[../News::NAAF::Connection|News::NAAF::Connection]] object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $group = $ro-&gt;group ($index);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return the newsgroup record associated with the given non-negative integer index as a [[../News::NAAF::Group|News::NAAF::Group]] object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.70}}

Blender offers several different kinds of editing windows specifically to do with animation.

== Timeline ==
You have previously come across the Timeline [[File:Blender269TimelineIcon.png]] view as the simplest way to see the keyframes in an animation. This window also includes transport controls that you can use to start and stop the animation, jump to a particular frame with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}, and scrub by dragging across a time range with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.

This window also lets you define ''markers'' which you can name to identify important points in the animation, for informational purposes. Also, using the “Bind Camera to Marker” function, you can dynamically switch the active camera at marked points in the animation, to cut between different viewpoints.

== Graph Editor ==
You previously saw how to define keyframes for animating a property, such as an object position or material setting. But what if you get a keyframe definition slightly wrong? Perhaps the timing is slightly off, or the movement is not quite right. You could delete the keyframe and try again. But, in many cases, it would be easier if you could get into the actual definition of the keyframe and tweak it around a bit, move its time position, adjust the animated property values, that kind of thing.

This is the purpose of the Graph Editor [[File:Blender270GraphEditorIcon.png]]. It gives you the most detailed, low-level view possible of your animation, by drawing an ''FCurve'' for each animated property of the selected object, representing how the property value varies over time. Each curve has control points located at each of its keyframes, and you can move these points around—horizontally to change the timing, or vertically to change the keyframe value—as well as add and remove points.

== Dope Sheet ==
The Dope Sheet [[File:Blender270DopeSheetIcon.png]] gives a high-level view of your animation, similar to the Timeline, but slightly more detailed. Here you see the separate keyframes for each animated object, and you can do some limited editing, like moving the keyframes around, and duplicating and deleting keyframes, but you can’t seem to add entirely new ones.

Actually, this window can show any of five different editor submodes: Dope Sheet, Action Editor, Shape Key Editor, Grease Pencil or Mask. The Action Editor is useful in conjunction with the NLA Editor (below).

* '''See also:''' [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Animation/Editors/DopeSheet Dopesheet] on the Blender Wiki.

== NLA Editor ==
The NLA (“Non-Linear Animation”) Editor [[File:Blender270NLAEditorIcon.png]] represents a different way of setting up an animation: instead of thinking of it as a single linear sequence of keyframes, you break it up into ''actions'', which are separate sequences that can be arranged in various ways. You can also duplicate an action any number of times, position the copies at different times in the overall animation, and even attach them to different objects. But they still share a single set of FCurve contents, which you can edit in the Graph Editor as you would a monolithic linear animation sequence, and your changes will take effect in all copies of the action.

To edit the contents of an action in the Graph Editor, you select the action and {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} into “tweak mode” (analogous to Edit mode in the 3D view). {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} again takes you out of Tweak mode.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Actions do not appear in the Timeline or Dope Sheet.''' This means that, once you start to use actions, you no longer get a correct overview of your animation in these two windows. The Timeline is still useful for its transport controls, but otherwise you should stick to the NLA Editor for your overview.}}

However, the Action Editor submode of the Dope Sheet now becomes useful, for creating new actions. These start out initially empty of any keyframes or FCurves, but you can add these in Tweak mode.

* '''See Also:''' [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Animation/Editors/NLA NLA Editor] on the Blender Wiki.

== To Summarize... ==
The above description may seem rather confusing in places. Basically, there are two ways to organize your animation:
* Linear, as a single sequence of FCurves and keyframes
* Non-linear, as a sequence of actions, each consisting of a sequence of FCurves and keyframes. The nonlinear data can be further divided into multiple overlapping ''tracks'', which combine together at any moment in time to produce the complete animation.

Objects that can have animation data attached to them can have both kinds, linear and nonlinear. You can even attach both kinds at once, though then the linear animation data takes precedence. It is easy to change your mind and switch back and forth; typically, the development of a simple animation might start out linear, then change to nonlinear as it gets more complicated.</text>

;Usage
This page auto-categorized Trainz Wikibooks redirect terms into the auto-[[:Category:Trainz redirect pages]]. 
* It's proper placement is on '''the same line''' as the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect [[Trainz/whatever page name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/code&gt; as in the below example:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect [[Trainz/whatever page name]]{{R from Trainz alternative name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* to check the proper inclusion, separate the '#' from the word redirect like:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;# redirect [[Trainz/target page name]] {{R from Trainz alternative name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
* It will sometimes also display the message in Preview if not properly installed, such as putting the template on a second line in the redirect page, hence the message might sometimes be produced indicating an error:
&lt;div&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;
This page is a redirect from a Wikibooks [[Trainz]] page which either has been moved, or renamed, or a colloquial term or abbreviation with coverage on the targeted page receiving redirected links.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What Is This Book For?==
{{TOC right}}

This wikibook is intended as a general overview of undergraduate mathematics. In any one field, it may not have the widest coverage on this wiki but the idea is to present the most useful results with many exercises that are tied in carefully into the rest of the book.

It can be used by readers as a hub to connect their current knowledge to what they want to know, laid out in a traditional textbook style, and for editors as a source to expand out from and create more specific titles.

The project was inspired by the ''Feynmann Lectures in Physics'' which feature as recommended reading below, for mathematical physicists. It also owes a debt to the early success of [[Linear Algebra]].

==Before We Begin==

We expect that the reader have the level usually required of a student starting a university level course that heavily requires mathematics. For example in the UK an A level equivalent is required.

Specifically it would be useful to know skills like this:

*Be able to perform basic arithmetic with real numbers
*Be able to find roots of polynomials
*Know the basic meaning of terms like ''function'' and ''set''
*Be able to roughly sketch simple graphs without plotting large numbers of points
*Know how to differentiate simple functions with the Sum, Product, Chain and Quotient rules
*Know how to integrate simple functions by parts and by substitution
*Be able to use either a scientific hand calculator or an equivalent computer program

If you follow the material in this wikibook, then find yourself stuck not knowing a method we assumed, please try looking for a work in K12 to give you the right skill.

===Contents===

Typically larger courses, such as real analysis, are 20 credit courses in the 360 credit breakdown of an undergraduate degree. So it should not be assumed that all courses are the same in scale. Most courses are assumed to be 10 credit courses but more material may be included to help cover the different course structures internationally.

[[Wikibooks:Welcome|Welcome to Wikibooks]]! You do not need to [[WB:LOGIN|log in]] to read or edit books at Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
* A username of your choice for directly attributing [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|your contributions]].
* A personal user page, a [[WB:TALK|talk page]], and a [[Help:Tracking changes#Watching pages|watchlist]] to monitor pages that interest you.
* The ability to [[WB:MOVE|rename]] pages and to [[WB:PREFS|customize]] some aspects of the Wikibooks interface.
* People will recognize you as a member of the Wikibooks community, and you will be eligible to [[WB:REVIEW|review]] pages.
* Your IP address will be hidden from most users, which may give you a greater sense of security and privacy.

We hope that you choose to join our community as a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].

=== Description ===

Three relational competencies were identified: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Communication|communication]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Cooperation|cooperation]] and integration.

=== Definition ===

Integration refers to the process of combining efforts to integrate supplier and customer information and inputs into internal planning (Swink et al., 2007).

=== Items ===

To what extent do the statements apply to the relationship of your company with your suppliers and customers? (1 – strongly disagree; 7 – strongly agree):

*We have full access to joint planning systems. (0.80)
*We synchronize our production plans. (0.67)
*We carry out joint electronic data interchange. (0.62)
*We have knowledge of inventory mix/levels. (0.77)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Agility (alpha = 0.85, CR = 0.84) ==
=== Description ===

Two dimensions of resilience were identified: agility and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Robustness|robustness]].

=== Definition ===

Agility is defined as the ability of a supply chain to rapidly respond to change by adapting its initial stable configuration (Wieland/Wallenburg, 2012).

=== Items ===

Please indicate the speed of reaction with which your company can engage in the following activities should changes occur (1 – slow; 7 – fast):

*Adapt manufacturing leadtimes. (0.63)
*Adapt level of customer service. (0.82)
*Adapt delivery reliability. (0.85)
*Adapt responsiveness to changing market needs. (0.76)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Robustness (alpha = 0.87, CR = 0.87) ==
=== Description ===

Two dimensions of resilience were identified: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Agility|agility]] and robustness.

=== Definition ===

Robustness is defined as the ability of a supply chain to resist change without adapting its initial stable configuration (Wieland/Wallenburg, 2012).

=== Items ===

To what extent do the statements apply to your supply chain? (1 – strongly disagree; 7 – strongly agree):

*For a long time, our supply chain retains the same stable situation as it had before changes occur. (0.71)
*When changes occur, our supply chain grants us much time to consider a reasonable reaction. (0.73)
*Without adaptations being necessary, our supply chain performs well over a wide variety of possible scenarios. (0.92)
*For a long time, our supply chain is able to carry out its functions despite some damage done to it. (0.80)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FUN-beg|alttitle1=Introductory Trainz: A brief outline of Trainz history}}


&amp;nbsp;
=A brief outline of Trainz history=
[[File:TRS2004 historic advances, a Scenario--Hightand Valley Coal begins.JPG|thumb|TRS2004 made historic advances with interactive industries and an generalized extension of the Scenario system of single use TrainzScripts into today's powerful [[Trainz/sessions|sessions]].
* This TRS2004 Graphics panorama image on a laptop shows the first less developed yard at Greenwood station in a famous scenario shortly after it  begins (called '''Highland Valley Coal''' by Chuck Cee Bee Barkman).&lt;br
/&gt;The map was slightly modified in TRS2004 as Highland Valley Industries (HVI) and used for an introduction to '''Interactive Industries Tutorial'''&amp;mdash;a major advance in TRS2004's technologies&amp;mdash;and republished in each release up through the release of {{TL|TS2009}}. That HVI map, adapted from this one, has a slightly expanded yard noticeably different in the left side of this view.]]
Trainz was developed over 3&amp;ndash;4 years beginning about 1996 in consultation and in collaboration with various model railroading clubs by Australian game developer {{wp|N3V Games|Auran Pty. Ltd}}, which had by then established itself as one of the premier gaming companies in Australia under the stewardship of chief programmer Greg Lane, Paul Olsen in development and Graham Edelsten. It's early releases were a pale shadow of what was to come but when released in 2001 the input of interested model railroaders quickly lead to a succession of improvements and extended capabilities.
 
This became a pattern, accumulate major changes whilst setting up the evolution and making incremental changes and bug fixes through {{wp|service pack}} releases, each making a stable code software step. Trainz service packs unlike many commercial packages are free, and so the improvements continued steadily through releases in 2005 and Trainz 2006, which leveraged the stable and hard won game engine and features such as interactive industries being released with a powerful database manager, upload manager and download manager known as {{TL|Content Manager Plus}}, the father of today's CM utility which is little changed but for refinements.
 
In 2005&amp;ndash;2007 Auran over extended developing a different computer game (Fury) and Trainz and Auran both survived bankruptcy proceedings but the game now was managed under {{wp|N3V Games}} which renewed Trainz development leading to the &quot;World Builder Edition, {{TL|TS2009}} and has continued to grow and evolve beating back several competitors over the ensuing decade years. Auran Development Pty Ltd became Auran Holdings Pty Ltd after the bankruptcy reorganization and still retains the rights to the program. The original chief engineer, and indeed most of the professional staff were lost during the dark months, and even the busy web site went dark for five weeks. N3V quickly hired back staff members willing to return, notably chief programmer Chris Bergmann who had joined the company in 2000. Bergmann can be frequently found inteacting on the Auran web board as ''''''Windwalkr''''''. (e.g. Google &quot;{{Col|Site:forums.auran.com Windwalkr|blue&quot;)

&amp;nbsp;
==Localisation==
Multilingual language support has been built into Trainz since Trainz 1.3, increased in the best selling {{TL|TRS2004}} and expanded in the hugely popular {{TL|TRS2006}} (TR06) release in [[w:2005|2005]]. Next followed a handful of regionally focused releases including three in English based on the TR06 technologies which focused enclosed content featuring ''regional routes of interest'', albeit with some changes to unimportant graphics (skins) but some incremental alterations of data definitions portending events to come. These differed from TRS2004 and TRS2006 in the philosophy of bundled included content&amp;mdash;instead of a potpourri of widely varying routes and their regional assets, the regionally focused routes were {{TG|S|scenery}} and {{TG|T|trackside asset}} biased by their thematic localizations, and tended to include less assets overall but perhaps more or interest to those also developing virtual railways in that same world region.

Other TRS2006 spinoffs were European regional releases: ({{TL|TRS2007}} (France &amp; French speaking lands) and {{TL|TRS2007|2008}} (German and Eastern European routes) which expanded the product's language offerings and soon added a rich supply of Europe and Eastern European routes. This same time span saw three English releases known as Trainz Classics ({{TL|TC1&amp;2}} and {{TL|TC3}})&amp;mdash;offerings partnered with third party content creators which delivered &quot;professional quality&quot; routes with a bounty of specialty assets and also offered slightly new technologies (V2.7 &amp; V2.8, game engine advancements are usually first included in an English release), when N3v Games assumed control of publication and development.
 
Year 2008 saw and end to 'game stagnation' with the release of {{TL|TS2009|TS2009: World Builders Edition}} sporting improvements mainly in Surveyor, 2009 the evolved dual-mode {{TL|TS2010|TS2010: Engineer's Edition}}, {{TL|TS2012|TS2012: 10th Anniversary Edition}} (aka '''TS12 or Trainz Simulator 2012''') which is the latest Microsoft Windows installment in the franchise and was released in April of 2011 and it's SP1 upgrades in late 2011. In 2012&amp;ndash;2013 N3V games released Trainz MAC under the iOS operating system as well as tablet computer versions. 

Two targeted releases are in development for 2014, the later a full 64bit version with highly upgraded graphics known now as '''TANE or T:ANE, ''Trainz: A New Era''''' with funding in part supported by a modest amount raised by KickStarter pledges.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Iteration or any traversal of a collection is ''not'' part of the Visitor Pattern ==

This is a common misunderstanding of the Visitor Pattern. This pattern is only concerned with double-dispatch in computer languages which only provide a single-dispatch mechanism. It is possible to use this pattern to make single requests to elements of a collection, similar to direct or random file access. It is also possible to use the visitor pattern to drive the traversal of elements in a collection to obtain different ordering, filtering, maintaining state etc. &lt;br /&gt;
This pattern ''is especially useful'' when combined with the [[w:Composite pattern]] to define a hierarchical structure containing many instances of different elements from an object hierarchy, and to process those elements by traversing either a sub-branch or the complete tree structure. note: two types of hierarchies
* a structure, a collection of instances of objects
* object hierarchy, the definitions of unique, related classes with a common parent
But, this is a particular specialization of the pattern, not simply the pattern itself.&lt;br /&gt;
I will let this information digest a while before embarking on changing the description.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Uganda=

* &lt;font size=3&gt;Uganda was a British colony until it gained independence in 1962. For several years after independence it’s postal affairs were managed communally with Kenya and Tanzania, and it used meter stamps inscribed with all three country names. Only a few postage meters were put into use with UGANDA alone as the country name. For stamps used before independence and for post-independence stamps inscribed KENYA, UGANDA and TANZANIA see EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY. More stamp types than the two listed here are likely in use.
&lt;/font&gt;

{{TOC right}}

The '''Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms''' are properties that homology theories of topological spaces have in common. The quintessential example of a homology theory satisfying the axioms is singular homology, developed by Samuel Eilenberg and Norman Steenrod, which we have already met.

One can define a homology theory as a sequence of functors satisfying the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms. The axiomatic approach, which was developed in 1945, allows one to prove results, such as the [[Mayer–Vietoris sequence]], that are common to all homology theories satisfying the axioms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0245/survey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

If one omits the dimension axiom (described below), then the remaining axioms define what is called an extraordinary homology theory. Extraordinary cohomology theories first arose in K-theory and cobordism theory.

==Formal definition==

The Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms apply to a sequence of functors &lt;math&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt; from the category of pairs (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''A'') of topological spaces to the category of abelian groups, together with a natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\partial : H_{i}(X, A) \to H_{i-1}(A)&lt;/math&gt; called the '''boundary map''' (here ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') is a shorthand for ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'',∅)). The axioms are:

# '''Homotopy''': Homotopic maps induce the same map in homology. That is, if  &lt;math&gt;g:(X, A) \rightarrow (Y,B)&lt;/math&gt; is homotopic to &lt;math&gt;h:(X, A) \rightarrow (Y,B)&lt;/math&gt;, then their induced [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] are the same.
# '''[[Excision theorem|Excision]]''': If (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''A'') is a pair and ''U'' is a subset of ''X'' such that the closure of ''U'' is contained in the interior of ''A'', then the inclusion map &lt;math&gt;i : (X-U, A-U) \to (X, A)&lt;/math&gt; induces an [[isomorphism]] in homology.
# '''Dimension''': Let ''P'' be the one-point space; then &lt;math&gt;H_n(P) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Additivity''': If &lt;math&gt;X = \coprod_{\alpha}{X_{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;, the disjoint union of a family of topological spaces &lt;math&gt;X_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;H_n(X) \cong \bigoplus_{\alpha} H_n(X_{\alpha}).&lt;/math&gt;
# '''Exactness''': Each pair ''(X, A)'' induces a [[long exact sequence]] in homology, via the inclusions &lt;math&gt;i: A \to X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j: X \to (X, A)&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt; \cdots \to H_n(A) \to^{\!\!\!\!\!\! i_*} H_n(X) \to^{\!\!\!\!\!\! j_*} H_n (X,A) \to^{\!\!\!\!\!\!\partial_*} H_{n-1}(A) \to \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''P'' is the one point space then  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'') is called the '''coefficient group'''. For example, singular homology (taken with integer coefficients, as is most common) has as coefficients the integers.

==Consequences==

Some facts about homology groups can be derived directly from the axioms, such as the fact that homotopically equivalent spaces have isomorphic homology groups.

The homology of some relatively simple spaces, such as ''n''-[[sphere]]s, can be calculated directly from the axioms. From this it can be easily shown that the (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-sphere is not a [[retract]] of the ''n''-disk. This is used in a proof of the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]].

==Dimension axiom==

A &quot;homology-like&quot; theory satisfying all of the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms except the dimension axiom is called an '''extraordinary homology theory''' (dually, '''extraordinary cohomology theory'''). Important examples of these were found in the 1950s, such as topological K-theory and cobordism theory, which are extraordinary ''co''homology theories, and come with homology theories dual to them.

==Rules==
First the four aces are taken out and laid on the tableau to start the foundations. Then four columns of three cards are placed overlapping each other separately under the aces. After that, nine columns of four cards, also overlapping each other, are dealt to the right of the aces and first four columns. If the player decides to lay out all of the cards, he must make sure that there are four rows of thirteen cards and the first four cards on the first row should be the four aces.

[[Image:Bisley (solitaire).jpg|center|550px|The initial layout of the game of Bisley. This follows the overlapping-cards rule set rather than the laying-out-the-cards rule set.]]

Here is the method of game play:
*Only the bottom cards are available for play. Thus, if the cards are overlapping, it is the exposed card of each column; if the cards are laid out, it is the card at the bottom of each column.
*Only one card can be moved at a time.
*The cards on the tableau can be built either up or down by suit.
*Whenever a column becomes empty, it stays empty for the rest of the game.
*The foundations (the four aces) are built up by suit. However, whenever a King is released and becomes available, it becomes a foundation and is placed above its counterpart ace foundation to be built down, also by suit. The same thing can be done for the three other kings. This rule also gives the player an opportunity to place a card on one of the foundations of the same suit if it can be placed on either of them.

The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations. It actually does not matter where the ace and king foundations of each suit would meet and how many cards the ace and king foundations of each suit will have. At the end of one game for example, the K♠ is the only one on its foundation while the rest of spade cards are built on the A♠; the A♣ remains unbuilt because all club cards are built on the K♣; the A&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;♥&lt;/span&gt; is built up to 4&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;♥&lt;/span&gt; while the K&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;♥&lt;/span&gt; is built down to 5&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;♥&lt;/span&gt;; and the A&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;♦&lt;/span&gt; is built up to 8&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;♦&lt;/span&gt; while the K&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;♦&lt;/span&gt; is built down to 9&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;♦&lt;/span&gt;. In fact, the ace and king foundation of a suit can meet anywhere.

'''Mathematical induction''' is a method of [[mathematical proof]] typically used to establish that a given statement is true of all [[natural number]]s.  It is done by proving that the '''first''' statement in the infinite sequence of statements is true, and then proving that if '''any one''' statement in the infinite sequence of statements is true, then so is the '''next''' one.

The method can be extended to prove statements about more general [[well-founded]] structures, such as [[tree (set theory)|trees]]; this generalization, known as [[structural induction]], is used in [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]].

Mathematical induction should not be misconstrued as a form of [[inductive reasoning]], which is considered non-[[rigor]]ous in mathematics. (See [[Problem of induction]].) In fact, mathematical induction is a form of [[deductive reasoning]] and is fully rigorous.

==History==
The earliest implicit traces of mathematical induction can be found in [[Euclid]]'s proof that the number of primes is infinite and in [[Bhaskara]]'s &quot;[[Chakravala method|cyclic method]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Induction Bussey&quot;&gt;Cajori (1918), p. 197&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The process of reasoning called &quot;Mathematical Induction&quot; has had several independent origins. It has been traced back to the Swiss Jakob (James) Bernoulli, the Frenchman B. Pascal and P. Fermat, and the Italian F. Maurolycus. [...] By reading a little between the lines one can find traces of mathematical induction still earlier, in the writings of the Hindus and the Greeks, as, for instance, in the &quot;cyclic method&quot; of Bhaskara, and in Euclid's proof that the number of primes is infinite.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest implicit [[proof]] by mathematical induction for [[Arithmetic progression|arithmetic sequences]] was introduced in the ''al-Fakhri'' written by [[al-Karaji]] around [[1000]] AD, who used it to prove the [[binomial theorem]], [[Pascal's triangle]], and the sum formula for [[integral]] [[Cube (algebra)|cubes]].&lt;ref&gt;Katz (1998), p. 255: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Another important idea introduced by [[al-Karaji]] and continued by [[Ibn Yahyā al-Maghribī al-Samaw'al|al-Samaw'al]] and others was that of an inductive [[argument]] for dealing with certain arithmetic sequences. Thus al-Karaji used such an argument to prove the result on the sums of integral cubes already known to [[Aryabhata]] [...] Al-Karaji did not, however, state a general result for arbitrary ''n''. He stated his theorem for the particular integer 10 [...] His proof, nevertheless, was clearly designed to be extendable to any other integer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
His proof was the first to make use of the two basic components of an inductive proof, &quot;namely the [[truth]] of the statement for ''n'' = 1 (1 = 1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and the deriving of the truth for ''n'' = ''k'' from that of ''n'' = ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katz (1998), p. 255: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Al-Karaji's argument includes in essence the two basic components of a modern argument by induction, namely the truth of the statement for ''n'' = 1 (1 = 1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and the deriving of the truth for ''n'' = ''k'' from that of ''n'' = ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. Of course, this second component is not explicit since, in some sense, al-Karaji's argument is in reverse; this is, he starts from ''n'' = 10 and goes down to 1 rather than proceeding upward. Nevertheless, his argument in ''al-Fakhri'' is the earliest extant proof of the sum formula for integral cubes.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Karaji|title=Abu Bekr ibn Muhammad ibn al-Husayn Al-Karaji}}
{{quote|&quot;Al-Karaji also uses a form of mathematical induction in his arguments, although he certainly does not give a rigorous exposition of the principle.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) used the inductive method to prove the sum of [[fourth power]]s, and by extension, the sum of any integral [[Exponentiation|powers]], which was an important result in [[integral]] [[calculus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;induction Katz&quot;&gt;Victor J. Katz (1995), p. 165-169.
{{quote|&quot;The central idea in [[ibn al-Haytham]]'s proof of the sum formulas was the derivation of the equation [...] Naturally, he did not state this result in general form. He only stated it for particular integers, [...] but his proof for each of those ''k'' is by induction on ''n'' and is immediately generalizable to any value of ''k''.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz (1998), p. 255-259.&lt;/ref&gt; He only stated it for particular integers, but his proof for those integers was by induction and generalizable.&lt;ref name=&quot;induction Katz&quot;/&gt; [[Ibn Yahyā al-Maghribī al-Samaw'al]] came closest to a modern proof by mathematical induction in pre-modern times, which he used to extend the proof of the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle previously given by al-Karaji. Al-Samaw'al's inductive argument was only a short step from the full inductive proof of the general binomial theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Katz (1998), p. 259: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Like the proofs of al-Karaji and ibn al-Haytham, al-Samaw'al's argument contains the two basic components of an inductive proof. He begins with a value for which the result is known, here ''n'' = 2, and then uses the result for a given integer to derive the result for the next. Although al-Samaw'al did not have any way of stating, and therefore proving, the general binomial theorem, to modern readers there is only a short step from al-Samaw'al's argument to a full inductive proof of the binomial theorem.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these ancient mathematicians, however, explicitly stated the inductive hypothesis. The first rigorous explicit exposition of the principle of induction was given by [[Francesco Maurolico]], in his ''Arithmeticorum libri duo'' (1575), who used the technique to prove that the sum of the first ''n'' odd integers is ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The inductive hypothesis was also discovered independently by the Swiss [[Jakob Bernoulli]], and the Frenchmen [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Fermat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Induction Bussey&quot;/&gt;

==Description==
The simplest and most common form of mathematical induction proves that a statement involving a natural number ''n'' holds for all values of ''n''. The proof consists of two steps:
# The '''basis (base case)''': showing that the statement holds when ''n'' = 0.
# The '''inductive step''': showing that '''''if''''' the statement holds for some ''n'', '''''then''''' the statement also holds when ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is substituted for ''n''.
The assumption in the inductive step that the statement holds for some ''n'' is called the '''induction hypothesis''' (or '''inductive hypothesis'''). To perform the inductive step, one assumes the induction hypothesis and then uses this assumption to prove the statement for ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

The description above of the basis applies when 0 is considered a natural number, as is common in the fields of [[combinatorics]] and [[mathematical logic]]. If, on the other hand, 1 is taken to be the first natural number, then the base case is given by ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

[[Image:Dominoeffect.png|thumb|right|300px|A formal description of mathematical induction can be illustrated by reference to the sequential effect of falling [[Domino effect|dominoes]].]]
This method works by first proving the statement is true for a starting value, and then proving that the [[Process (general)|process]] used to go from one value to the next is [[valid]]. If these are both proven, then any value can be obtained by performing the process repeatedly. It may be helpful to think of the [[domino effect]]; if one is presented with a long row of dominoes standing on end, one can be sure that:
# The first domino will fall
# Whenever a domino falls, its next neighbor will also fall,

so it is concluded that ''all'' of the dominoes will fall, and that this fact is inevitable.

Another analogy can be to consider an infinite set of identical lily pads, all equally spaced on a pond. If a frog wishes to traverse the pond, he must:

# Determine if the first lily pad will hold his weight.
# Prove that he can jump from one lily pad to another.

Thus, he can conclude that he can jump to all of the lily pads.

==Axiom of Induction==
The basic assumption or ''axiom of induction'' (accepted not proved) is, in [[Table of logic symbols|logical symbols]],

: &lt;math&gt;\forall \mbox{ predicates }P,\, (P(0) \land \forall k [P(k) \Rightarrow P(k+1)]) \Rightarrow \forall n P(n) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the proposition in question and ''n'' is a natural number.

In other words, P(0) being true along with (&quot;P(k) is true implies P(k+1) is true&quot; for all natural k) being true together imply that P(n) is true for all natural n. A proof by induction is then a proof that these two conditions hold, thus implying the required conclusion.

==Examples==
Suppose we wish to prove the statement:

:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

for all natural numbers ''n''; call this statement  ''P''(''n''). (This is a special case of [[Faulhaber's formula]].) This is a simple formula for the sum of the positive [[natural number]]s less than or equal to number ''n''. The proof that the statement is true for all natural numbers ''n'' proceeds as follows.

Check if it is true for ''n'' = 1.  The sum of 1 and no other number is simply 1. And 1(1 + 1) / 2 = 1. So the statement is true for ''n'' = 1. Thus we have that ''P''(1) holds.

Now we have to show that if the statement holds when ''n'' = ''m'', then it also holds when ''n'' = ''m'' + 1. This can be done as follows.

Assume the statement is true for ''n'' = ''m'', i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + \cdots + m = \frac{m(m + 1)}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Adding ''m'' + 1 (which is clearly the left-hand side's next term) to both sides does not change the equality:

&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + \cdots + m + (m + 1) = \frac{m(m + 1)}{2} + (m+ 1)&lt;/math&gt;

By algebraic manipulation we have for the [[left-hand side and right-hand side of an equation|right-hand side]]

:&lt;math&gt;
= \frac{m(m + 1)}{2} + \frac{2(m + 1)}{2}
= \frac{(m + 2)(m + 1)}{2}
= \frac{(m + 1)(m + 2)}{2}
= \frac{(m + 1)[(m + 1) + 1]}{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we have 

:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + \cdots + (m + 1) = \frac{(m + 1)[(m + 1) + 1]}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that this is equivalent to the assertion made by P(''m'' + 1). This proof is conditional: we made the assumption that P(''m'') is true, and from that we derived ''P''(''m'' + 1). Thus, if P(''m'') is true, ''P''(''m'' + 1) must also be true. Symbolically, we have shown that

:&lt;math&gt;P(m) \Rightarrow P(m + 1).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Now, to finish, we use the process of mathematical induction:

#We know ''P''(1) is true by substituting in 1 for ''n''.
#Since ''P''(1) implies ''P''(1 + 1), we get ''P''(2).
#Similarly, since ''P''(2) implies ''P''(2 + 1), we get ''P''(3).
#With ''P''(3), ''P''(4) follows.
#From ''P''(4), we get ''P''(5).
#Etc. (Here is where the axiom of mathematical induction comes in.) 
#We may conclude that P(''n'') holds for any natural number ''n''. [[Q.E.D.]]


A further, more elaborate example is the [[Inequality_of_arithmetic_and_geometric_means#Proof_by_induction|proof of the inequality of the arithmetic and geometric means by induction]].

==Variants==
In practice, proofs by induction are often structured differently, depending on the exact nature of the property to be proved.

=== Starting at some other number ===
If we want to prove a statement not for all natural numbers but only for all numbers greater than or equal to a certain number ''b'' then:
# Showing that the statement holds when ''n'' = ''b''.
# Showing that if the statement holds for ''n'' = ''m'' ≥ ''b'' then the same statement also holds for ''n'' = ''m'' + 1.
This can be used, for example, to show that ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 2''n'' for ''n'' ≥ 3.  A more substantial example is a proof that

:&lt;math&gt;{n^n \over 3^n} &lt; n! &lt; {n^n \over 2^n}\mbox{ for }n\ge 6.&lt;/math&gt;

In this way we can prove that ''P''(''n'') holds for all ''n'' ≥1, or even ''n'' ≥&amp;minus;5.  This form of mathematical induction is actually a special case of the previous form because if the statement that we intend to prove is ''P''(''n'') then proving it with these two rules is equivalent with proving ''P''(''n'' + ''b'') for all natural numbers ''n'' with the first two steps.

===Building on ''n'' = 2===
In mathematics, many standard functions, including operations such as &quot;+&quot; and relations such as &quot;=&quot;, are binary, meaning that they take two arguments. Often these functions possess properties that implicitly extend them to more than two arguments. For example, once addition ''a'' + ''b'' is defined and is known to satisfy the [[associativity]] property (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c''), then the trinary addition ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' makes sense, either as (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' or as ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c''). Similarly, many axioms and theorems in mathematics are stated only for the binary versions of mathematical operations and relations, and implicitly extend to higher-[[arity]] versions.

Suppose that we wish to prove a statement about an ''n''-ary operation implicitly defined from a binary operation, using mathematical induction on ''n''. Then it should come as no surprise that the ''n'' = 2 case carries special weight. Here are some examples.

====Example: product rule for the derivative====
In this example, the binary operation in question is multiplication (of functions). The usual [[product rule]] for the [[derivative]] taught in [[calculus]] states:

:&lt;math&gt;(fg)' = f'g + g'f. \!&lt;/math&gt;

This can be generalized to a product of ''n'' functions. One has

:&lt;math&gt;(f_1 f_2 f_3 \cdots f_n)' \!&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;= (f_1' f_2 f_3 \cdots f_n)
+ (f_1 f_2' f_3 \cdots  f_n)
+ (f_1 f_2 f_3'\cdots  f_n)+\cdots +(f_1 f_2 \cdots f_{n-1} f_n').&lt;/math&gt;

In each of the ''n'' terms, just one of the factors is a derivative; the others are not.

When this general fact is proved by mathematical induction, the ''n'' = 0 case is trivial,&lt;math&gt;(1)' = 0 \!&lt;/math&gt; (since the [[empty product]] is 1, and the [[empty sum]] is 0). The ''n'' = 1 case is also trivial, &lt;math&gt;f_1' = f_1' \!.&lt;/math&gt; And for each ''n'' &amp;ge; 3, the case is easy to prove from the preceding ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 case. The real difficulty lies in the ''n'' = 2 case, which is why that is the one stated in the standard product rule.

====Example: Pólya's proof that there is no &quot;horse of a different color&quot;====
{{main|All horses are the same color (paradox)}}

In this example, the binary relation in question is an equivalence relation applied to horses, such that two horses are equivalent if they are the same color. The argument is essentially identical to the one above, but the crucial ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 case fails, causing the entire argument to be invalid.

In the middle of the 20th century, a commonplace colloquial locution to express the idea that something is unexpectedly different from the usual was &quot;''That's'' a horse of a different color!&quot;.  [[George Pólya]] posed the following exercise: Find the error in the following argument, which purports to prove by mathematical induction that all horses are of the same color:

*Basis: If there is only ''one'' horse, there is only one color.
*Induction step: Assume as induction hypothesis that within any set of ''n'' horses, there is only one color.  Now look at any set of ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 horses.  Number them: 1, 2, 3, ..., ''n'', ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.  Consider the sets {1, 2, 3, ..., ''n''} and {2, 3, 4, ..., ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}.  Each is a set of only ''n'' horses, therefore within each there is only one color.  But the two sets overlap, so there must be only one color among all ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 horses.

Beginning the induction at 1, the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 case is trivial (any horse is the same color as itself), and the inductive step is correct in all cases ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3. However, the logic of the inductive step is incorrect when ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, because the statement that &quot;the two sets overlap&quot; is false. Indeed, the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 case is clearly the crux of the matter; if one could prove the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 case, then all higher cases would follow from the [[transitive relation|transitive]] property of the equivalence relation.

===Induction on more than one counter===
It is sometimes desirable to prove a statement involving two natural numbers, ''n'' and ''m'', by iterating the induction process. That is, one performs a basis step and an inductive step for ''n'', and in each of those performs a basis step and an inductive step for ''m''. See, for example, the [[Addition_of_natural_numbers/Proofs|proof of commutativity]] accompanying ''[[addition of natural numbers]]''. More complicated arguments involving three or more counters are also possible.

===Infinite descent===
{{main|Infinite descent}}

Another variant of mathematical induction – the method of infinite descent – was one of [[Pierre de Fermat]]'s favorites. This method of proof works in reverse, and can assume several slightly different forms. For example, it might begin by showing that if a statement is true for a natural number ''n'' it must also be true for some smaller natural number ''m'' (''m'' &amp;lt; ''n''). Using mathematical induction (implicitly) with the inductive hypothesis being that the statement is false for all natural numbers less than or equal to ''m'', we can conclude that the statement cannot be true for any natural number ''n''.

==Complete induction==
Another generalization, called '''complete induction''' (or '''strong induction''' or '''course of values induction'''), says that in the second step we may assume not only that the statement holds for ''n'' = ''m'' but also that it is true for ''n'' less than or equal to ''m''. 

In complete induction it is not necessary to list the basis case as a separate assumption.  When considering the first case, it is vacuously true that the statement holds for all previous cases; the inductive step of complete induction in this situation corresponds to the basis case in ordinary induction.  Thus the proof then of the inductive step in complete induction needs to be able to work with an empty antecedent; the first proof above is not of this kind (but can be converted).  

Complete induction is most useful when several instances of the inductive hypothesis are required for each inductive step.  For example, complete induction can be used to show that 
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{fib}(n) = \frac{ \varphi^n - (-1/\varphi)^n }{\sqrt{5}}&lt;/math&gt;
where fib(''n'') is the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[Fibonacci number]] and &lt;math&gt;\varphi = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2&lt;/math&gt; is the [[golden ratio]]. By using the definition fib(''m'' + 1) = fib(''m'') + fib(''m'' – 1), the identity above can be verified by direct calculation for fib(''m'' + 1) if we assume that it already holds for both fib(''m'') and fib(''m'' – 1). To complete the proof, the identity must be verified in the two basis cases ''n'' = 0 and ''n'' = 1. 
&lt;!-- Should an actual proof be put in? Yes, otherwise the difference from the basic type is puzzling, and I am not sure how to do it briefly. --&gt;

Another proof by complete induction uses the hypothesis that the statement holds for ''all'' smaller ''n'' more thoroughly.  Consider the statement that &quot;every [[natural number]] greater than 1 is a product of [[prime number]]s&quot;, and assume that for a given ''m'' &amp;gt; 1 it holds for all smaller ''n'' &amp;gt; 1.  If ''m'' is prime then it is certainly a product of primes, and if not, then by definition it is a product: ''m'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where neither of the factors is equal to 1; hence neither is equal to ''m'', and so both are smaller than ''m''.  The induction hypothesis now applies to ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so each one is a product of primes.  Then ''m'' is a product of products of primes; i.e. a product of primes.  Note both that the base case (''m'' equal to 2) was never explicitly considered, and that the hypothesis that ''all'' smaller numbers than ''m'' are products of primes was used, since the factors of ''m'' are ''[[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' unknown.

This generalization, complete induction, can be derived from the ordinary mathematical induction described above. Suppose P(''n'') is the statement that we intend to prove by complete induction. Let Q(''n'') mean P(''m'') holds for all ''m'' such that 0 &amp;le; ''m'' ≤ ''n''. Apply mathematical induction to Q(''n''). Since Q(0) is just P(0), we have the base case. Now suppose Q(''n'') is given and we wish to show Q(''n''+1). Notice that Q(''n'') is the same as P(0) and P(1) and ... and P(''n''). The hypothesis of complete induction tells us that this implies P(''n''+1). If we add P(''n''+1) to Q(''n''), we get P(0) and P(1) and  ... and P(''n'') and P(''n''+1), which is just Q(''n''+1). So using mathematical induction, we get that Q(''n'') holds for all natural numbers ''n''. But Q(''n'') implies P(''n''), so we have the conclusion of strong induction, namely that P(''n'') holds for all natural numbers ''n''.

===Transfinite induction===
{{main|Transfinite induction}}
The last two steps can be reformulated as one step:
# Showing that if the statement holds for all ''n'' &lt; ''m'' then the same statement also holds for ''n'' = ''m''.

This is in fact the most general form of mathematical induction and it can be shown that it is not only valid for statements about natural numbers, but for statements about elements of any [[well-founded set]], that is, a set with a [[partial order]] that contains no [[infinite descending chain]]s (where &lt; is defined such that ''a'' &lt; ''b'' means that ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''a'' ≠ ''b''). 

This form of induction, when applied to [[ordinal]]s (which form a [[well-order]]ed and hence well-founded class), is called ''[[transfinite induction]]''. It is an important proof technique in [[set theory]], [[topology]] and other fields.

Proofs by transfinite induction typically distinguish three cases:
# when ''m'' is a minimal element, i.e. there is no element smaller than ''m''
# when ''m'' has a direct predecessor, i.e. the set of elements which are smaller than ''m'' has a largest element
# when ''m'' has no direct predecessor, i.e. ''m'' is a so-called limit-ordinal

Strictly speaking, it is not necessary in transfinite induction to prove the basis, because it is a [[vacuous truth|vacuous]] special case of the proposition that if ''P'' is true of all ''n'' &lt; ''m'', then ''P'' is true of ''m''.  It is vacuously true precisely because there are no values of ''n'' &lt; ''m'' that could serve as counterexamples.

==Proof or reformulation of mathematical induction==
The principle of mathematical induction is usually stated as an [[axiom]] of the natural numbers; see [[Peano axioms]].  However, it can be proved in some logical systems. For instance, it can be proved if one assumes:
* The set of natural numbers is [[well-ordered]].
* Every natural number is either zero, or ''n''+1 for some natural number ''n''.
* For any natural number ''n'', ''n''+1 is greater than ''n''.

To derive simple induction from these axioms, we must show that if P(''n'') is some proposition predicated of ''n'', and if:
* P(0) holds and 
* whenever P(''k'') is true then P(''k''+1) is also true
then P(''n'') holds for all ''n''.

We first show that if P(''k'') is true for all ''k'' &amp;lt; ''m'', then P(''m'') is also true.  If ''m'' is zero, then P(''m'') is true. If ''m'' = ''k'' + 1, then P(''k'') is true because ''k'' &amp;lt; ''m'' and so P(''k''+1) is true which means that P(''m'') is true. The rest follows from applying the principle transfinite induction (see below).

===Generalization===
[[Transfinite induction]]: Given a [[well-ordered]] set, W, and a proposition, P, such that whenever ''m'' is such that P(''k'') is true for all ''k'' &amp;lt; ''m'', then P(''m'') is also true. We can show that P(''n'') is true for all ''n''. Let S be the subset of W for which P(''n'') is false. We first show that S has no minimal element. Consider any element ''m''. Either P(''k'') is true for every ''k'' &amp;lt; ''m'' or there is a ''k'' &amp;lt; ''m'' such that P(''k'') is false. In the first case, P(''m'') must be true and ''m'' does not belong to S and so ''m'' is not the least element of S. In the second case, P(''k'') is false for some ''k'' &amp;lt; ''m'' and so ''k'' is in S and smaller than ''m''. Thus, ''m'' cannot be the least element of S. Now if S has no minimal element and is a subset of a [[well-ordered]] set, then S must be empty and so P(''n'') must be true for all ''n''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dewikify}}
In [[mathematics]], a proof by '''infinite descent''' is a particular kind of [[proof by contradiction]] which relies on the facts that the [[natural numbers]] are [[Well-order|well ordered]] and that there are only a finite number of them that are smaller than any given one. One typical application is to show that a given equation has no solutions.

Typically, one shows that if a solution to a problem existed, which in some sense was related to one or more natural numbers, it would necessarily imply that a second solution existed, which was related to one or more 'smaller' natural numbers. This in turn would imply a third solution related to smaller natural numbers, implying a fourth solution, therefore a fifth solution, and so on. However there cannot be an infinity of ever-smaller natural numbers, and therefore by [[mathematical induction]] (repeating the same step) the original premise&amp;mdash;that any solution exists&amp;mdash;must be incorrect. It is disproven because its logical outcome would require a [[contradiction]].

An alternative way to express this is to assume one or more solutions or examples exists. Then there must be a smallest solution or example&amp;mdash;a [[minimal counterexample]]. We then prove that if a smallest solution exists, it must imply the existence of a smaller solution (in some sense)&amp;mdash;which again proves that the existence of any solution would lead to a contradiction.

The method of infinite descent was developed by [[Fermat]], who often used it for [[Diophantine equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Weil | first = André | author-link = André Weil | title = Number Theory: An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre | publisher = [[Birkhäuser Verlag|Birkhäuser]] | year = 1984 | pages = 75–79 | isbn = 0-8176-3141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two typical examples are showing the non-solvability of the Diophantine equation ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and proving [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]], which states that any prime ''p'' such that ''p''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;([[Modular arithmetic|mod]]&amp;nbsp;4) can be expressed as a sum of two [[square number|squares]] (see [[Proofs of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares#Euler.27s_proof_by_infinite_descent|proof]]). In some cases, to a modern eye, what he was using was (in effect) the doubling mapping on an [[elliptic curve]]. More precisely, his ''method of infinite descent'' was an exploitation in particular of the possibility of halving [[rational point]]s on an elliptic curve ''E'' by [[Inversive geometry|inversion]] of the doubling formulae. The context is of a hypothetical rational point on ''E'' with large co-ordinates. Doubling a point on ''E'' roughly doubles the length of the numbers required to write it (as number of digits): so that a 'halved' point is quite clearly smaller. In this way Fermat was able to show the non-existence of solutions in many cases of Diophantine equations of classical interest (for example, the problem of four perfect squares in [[arithmetic progression]]).

== Number theory==
In the [[number theory]] of the twentieth century, the infinite descent method was taken up again, and pushed to a point where it connected with the main thrust of [[algebraic number theory]] and the study of [[L-function]]s. The structural result of [[Mordell]], that the rational points on an elliptic curve ''E'' form a [[finitely-generated abelian group]], used an infinite descent argument based on ''E''/2''E'' in Fermat's style.

To extend this to the case of an [[abelian variety]] ''A'', [[André Weil]] had to make more explicit the way of quantifying the size of a solution, by means of a [[Glossary of arithmetic and Diophantine geometry#Height function|height function]] – a concept that became foundational. To show that ''A''(''Q'')/2''A''(''Q'') is finite, which is certainly a necessary condition for the finite generation of the group ''A''(''Q'') of rational points of ''A'', one must do calculations in what later was recognised as [[Galois cohomology]]. In this way, abstractly-defined cohomology groups in the theory become identified with ''descents'' in the tradition of Fermat. The [[Mordell–Weil theorem]] was at the start of what later became a very extensive theory.

== Application examples ==

=== Irrationality of √2 ===
The proof that the [[square root of 2]] (√2) is [[irrational number|irrational]] (i.e. cannot be expressed as a fraction of two whole numbers) was discovered by the [[ancient Greek]]s, and is perhaps the earliest known example of a proof by infinite descent. [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] discovered that the diagonal of a square is incommensurable with its side, or in modern language, that the square root of two is [[irrational number|irrational]]. Little is known with certainty about the time or circumstances of this discovery, but the name of [[Hippasus]] of Metapontum is often mentioned. For a while, the Pythagoreans treated as an official secret the discovery that the square root of two is irrational, and, according to legend, Hippasus was murdered for divulging it.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie J. Morris, [http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt669/student.folders/morris.stephanie/emt.669/essay.1/pythagorean.html &quot;The Pythagorean Theorem&quot;], Dept. of Math. Ed., [[University of Georgia]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Clegg, [http://nrich.maths.org/2671 &quot;The Dangerous Ratio ...&quot;], Nrich.org, November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt von Fritz, [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1969021 &quot;The discovery of incommensurability by Hippasus of Metapontum&quot;], Annals of Mathematics, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; The square root of two is occasionally called &quot;Pythagoras' number&quot; or &quot;Pythagoras' Constant&quot;, for example {{harvtxt|Conway|Guy|1996}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The [[ancient Greek]]s, not having [[algebra]], worked out a [[Square_root_of_2#Geometric proof|geometric proof]] by infinite descent ([[John Horton Conway]] presented another [http://www.cut-the-knot.org/proofs/sq_root.shtml geometric proof (no. 8 ' ' ' )] by infinite descent that may be more accessible). The following is an [[algebra]]ic proof along similar lines:-

Suppose that √2 were [[rational number|rational]]. Then it could be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

for two natural numbers, {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}. Then squaring would give

:&lt;math&gt;2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2q^2 = p^2, \, &lt;/math&gt;

so 2 must be a factor of ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and therefore 2 must also be a factor of ''p'' itself (if 2 did not divide ''p'', then the [[prime factorization]] of ''p'' (the product of its primes) would contain no 2's. So when one squares ''p'' by squaring all its factors, there still would be no 2's in the resulting prime factorization of ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. But since  ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''has'' been found to be divisible by 2, ''p'' must be divisible by 2 as well.)

As 2 is a factor of ''p'', we can now express p as 2 x some number ''r''; thus

:&lt;math&gt;p=2r&lt;/math&gt;

But then
:&lt;math&gt;2q^2 = (2r)^2 = 4r^2, \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q^2 = 2r^2, \, &lt;/math&gt;
so 2 must be a factor of ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and therefore 2 must also be a factor of ''q'' itself, and ''q'' can be written as 2 x ''s'' for some whole number ''s'' (same reasoning as above). Therefore ''p''/''q'' can be written as (2 x ''r'')/(2 x ''s''), and we find that ''p'' and ''q ''are not the smallest natural numbers making √2: we can write √2 as ''r''/''s'' where ''r''&lt;''p'' and ''s''&lt;''q''. Therefore if √2 could be written as a rational number, it could always be written as a natural number with smaller parts, which itself could be written with yet-smaller parts, ''[[ad infinitum]]''. But [[Well-ordering principle|this is impossible in the set of natural numbers]].  Since √2 is a [[real number]], which can be either rational or irrational, the only option left is for √2 to be irrational.

(Alternatively, this proves that if √2 were rational, no &quot;smallest&quot; representation as a fraction could exist, as any attempt to find a &quot;smallest&quot; representation ''p''/''q'' would imply a smaller one existed, which is a similar contradiction).

=== Irrationality of √''k'' if it is not an integer ===

For positive integer ''k'', suppose that √k is not an integer, but is rational and can be expressed as &lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'', and let ''q'' be the largest integer no greater than √k.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sqrt k&amp;=\frac mn\\[8pt] &amp;=\frac{m(\sqrt k-q)}{n(\sqrt k-q)}\\[8pt]
&amp;=\frac{m\sqrt k-mq}{n\sqrt k-nq}\\[8pt] &amp;=\frac{nk-mq}{m-nq} \text{ } (\text{replacing the first }m\text{ in the numerator with }n \sqrt k\text{ and }\sqrt k\text{ in the denominator with }m/n)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

(
The numerator and denominator were each multiplied by a positive expression less than 1, and then simplified independently, to show both products were still integers.  Therefore, no matter what natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'' are used to express √k, there can always be smaller natural numbers ''m' ''&lt;''m'' and ''n' ''&lt;''n'' that have the same ratio.  But infinite descent on the natural numbers is impossible, so this disproves the original assumption that √k can be expressed as a ratio of natural numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sagher | first = Yoram |date=February 1988 | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume = 95 | page = 117 | title = What Pythagoras could have done}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-solvability of ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''s''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;===

The non-solvability of &lt;math&gt;r^2 + s^4 =t^4&lt;/math&gt; in integers is sufficient to show the non-solvability of &lt;math&gt;q^4 + s^4 =t^4&lt;/math&gt; in integers, which is a special case of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and the historical proofs of the latter proceeded by more broadly proving the former using infinite descent. The following more recent proof demonstrates both of these impossibilities by proving still more broadly that a [[Pythagorean triangle]] cannot have any two of its sides each either a square or twice a square, since there is no smallest such triangle:&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Stan, &quot;Fermat's method of ''descente infinie''&quot;, ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 95, July 2011, 269–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose there exists such a Pythagorean triangle. Then it can be scaled down to give a primitive (i.e., with no common factors) Pythagorean triangle with the same property. Primitive Pythagorean triangles' sides can be written as &lt;math&gt;x=2ab,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;y=a^2-b^2,&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;z=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;, with ''a'' and ''b'' [[coprime|relatively prime]] and with ''a+b'' odd and hence ''y'' and ''z'' both odd. There are three cases, depending on which two sides are postulated to each be a square or twice a square:

*'''''y'' and ''z''''': Neither ''y'' nor ''z'', being odd, can be twice a square; if they are both square, the right triangle with legs &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{yz}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt; and hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; also would have integer sides including a square leg (&lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt;) and a square hypotenuse (&lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt;), and would have a smaller hypotenuse (&lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; compared to &lt;math&gt;z=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;).

*'''''y'' and ''x''''': If ''y'' is a square and ''x'' is a square or twice a square, then each of ''a'' and ''b'' is a square or twice a square and the integer right triangle with legs &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt; and hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; would have two sides (''b'' and ''a'') each of which is a square or twice a square, with a smaller hypotenuse than the original triangle (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; compared to &lt;math&gt;z=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;).

*'''''z'' and ''x''''': If ''z'' is a square and ''x'' is a square or twice a square, again each of ''a'' and ''b'' is a square or twice a square and the integer right triangle with legs &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z}&lt;/math&gt; also would have two sides (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) each of which is a square or twice a square, and a smaller hypotenuse (&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z}&lt;/math&gt; compared to {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;)}}.

In any of these cases, one Pythagorean triangle with two sides each of which is a square or twice a square has led to a smaller one, which in turn would lead to a smaller one, etc.; since such a sequence cannot go on infinitely, the original premise that such a triangle exists must be wrong. This implies that &lt;math&gt;r^2 + s^4 =t^4&lt;/math&gt; cannot have a solution, since if it did then ''r'', ''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' would be the sides of such a Pythagorean triangle.

For other proofs of this by infinite descent, see&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Mike, and Perella, Malcolm, &quot;Descending to the irrational&quot;, ''Mathematical Gazette'' 83, July 1999, pp. 263–267.&lt;/ref&gt; and.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara, Roy, &quot;Fermat's last theorem in the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4&quot;, ''Mathematical Gazette'' 91, July 2007, 260–262.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-solvability of ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 3(''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ===

Infinite descent can be used to show that there are no integer solutions to

:&lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=3 \cdot (s^2+t^2)&lt;/math&gt;,

other than &lt;math&gt;a=b=s=t=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose there is a nontrivial integer solution of the equation. Then there is a nontrivial nonnegative integer solution obtained by replacing each of &lt;math&gt;a,b,s,t&lt;/math&gt; by its absolute value. So it suffices to show that there are no nontrivial nonnegative integer solutions.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;a_1, b_1, s_1, t_1&lt;/math&gt; is a nonnegative solution.  We have

:&lt;math&gt; 3 \mid a_1^2+b_1^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

This is only true if both &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; are divisible by 3. Let

:&lt;math&gt;3 a_2 = a_1 \text{ and } 3 b_2 = b_1. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt; (3 a_2)^2 + (3 b_2)^2 = 3 \cdot (s_1^2+t_1^2) \, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; 3(a_2^2+b_2^2) = s_1^2+t_1^2, \, &lt;/math&gt;

which yields a new nontrivial nonnegative integer solution ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Under a suitable notion of size of the solutions, e.g. the sum of the four integers, this new solution is smaller than the original one.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} This process can be repeated infinitely, producing an infinite decreasing sequence of positive solution sizes. This is a contradiction, because no such sequence exists. This shows that there are no nonzero solutions for this [[Diophantine equation]].

In [[logic]], '''proof by contradiction''' is a form of [[Mathematical proof|proof]] that establishes the [[Truth#Formal theories|truth]] or [[validity]] of a [[proposition]] by showing that the proposition's being false would imply a [[contradiction]].   Since by the [[law of bivalence]] a proposition must be either true or false, and its falsity has been shown impossible, the proposition must be true.

In other words, to prove by contradiction that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, show that &lt;math&gt;\lnot P \Rightarrow \perp&lt;/math&gt; or its equivalent &lt;math&gt;\lnot P \Rightarrow(Q\and\lnot Q) &lt;/math&gt;. Then, since &lt;math&gt;\lnot P &lt;/math&gt; implies a contradiction, conclude &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof by contradiction''' is also known as '''indirect proof''', '''apagogical argument''', '''''reductio ad impossibile'''''. It is a particular kind of the more general form of argument known as ''[[reductio ad absurdum]].

== Examples ==

A classic proof by contradiction from mathematics is the [[Square root of 2#Proof by infinite descent|proof that the square root of 2 is irrational]].  If it were rational, it could be expressed as a fraction ''a''/''b'' in lowest terms, where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers, at least one of which is odd.  But if ''a''/''b'' = √2, then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; must be even. 
Because the square of an odd number is odd, that in turn implies that ''a'' is even. This means that ''b'' must be odd because a/b is in lowest terms.

On the other hand, if ''a'' is even, then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a multiple of 4.  If ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a multiple of 4 and ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a multiple of 4, and therefore ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is even, and so is ''b''.  

So ''b'' is odd and even, a contradiction.  Therefore the initial assumption&amp;mdash;that √2 can be expressed as a fraction&amp;mdash;must be false.

===The length of the hypotenuse is less than the sum of the lengths of the two legs===
The method of proof by contradiction has also been used to show that for any [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|non-degenerate]] [[Right triangle]], the length of the hypotenuse is less than the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides. The proof relies on the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. Letting ''c'' be the length of the hypotenuse and ''a'' and ''b'' the lengths of the legs, the claim is that ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''c''.
As usual, we start the proof by negating the claim and assuming that ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c''. The next step is to show that this leads to a contradiction. Squaring both sides, we have (''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or, equivalently, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''ab''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A triangle is non-degenerate if each edge has positive length, so we may assume that ''a'' and ''b'' are greater than 0. Therefore, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''ab''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Taking out the middle term, we have ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We know from the Pythagorean theorem that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We now have a contradiction since strict inequality and equality are [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]]. The latter was a result of the Pythagorean theorem and the former the assumption that ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c''. The contradiction means that it is impossible for both to be true and we know that the Pythagorean theorem holds. It follows that our assumption that ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c'' must be false and hence ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''c'', proving the claim.

===In mathematics===
Say we wish to disprove [[proposition]] ''p''.  The procedure is to show that assuming ''p'' leads to a logical [[contradiction]].  Thus, according to the law of non-contradiction, ''p'' must be false.

Say instead we wish to prove proposition ''p''. We can proceed by assuming &quot;not ''p''&quot; (i.e. that ''p'' is false), and show that it leads to a logical contradiction. Thus, according to the law of non-contradiction, &quot;not ''p''&quot; must be false, and so, according to the [[law of the excluded middle]], ''p'' is true.

In symbols:
 
To disprove ''p'': one uses the [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] (''p'' → (''R'' ∧ ¬''R'')) → ¬''p'', where ''R'' is any proposition and the ∧ symbol is taken to mean &quot;and&quot;. Assuming ''p'', one proves ''R'' and ''¬R'', and concludes from this that ''p'' → (''R'' ∧ ¬''R''). This and the tautology together imply ''¬p''.

To prove ''p'': one uses the tautology (¬''p'' → (''R'' ∧ ¬''R'')) → ''p'' where ''R'' is any proposition. Assuming ¬''p'', one proves ''R'' and ¬''R'', and concludes from this that ¬''p'' → (''R'' ∧ ¬''R''). This and the tautology together imply ''p''.

For a simple example of the first kind, consider the proposition, ¬''p'': &quot;there is no smallest rational number greater than 0&quot;. In a proof by contradiction, we start by assuming the opposite, ''p'': that there ''is'' a smallest rational number, say,&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

Now let ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/2.  Then ''x'' is a rational number greater than 0 and less than ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. (In the above symbolic argument, &quot;''x'' is the smallest rational number&quot; would be ''R'' and &quot;''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (which is different from ''x'') is the smallest rational number&quot; would be ¬''R''.) But that contradicts our initial assumption, ''p'', that ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; was the ''smallest'' rational number. So we can conclude that the original proposition, ¬''p'', must be true — &quot;there is no smallest rational number greater than 0&quot;.

[Note: the choice of which statement is ''R'' and which is ¬''R'' is arbitrary.]

It is common to use this first type of argument with propositions such as the one above, concerning the ''non''-existence of some mathematical object. One assumes that such an object exists, and then proves that this would lead to a contradiction; thus, such an object does not exist. For other examples, see [[Irrational number#The square root of 2|proof that the square root of 2 is not rational]] and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]].

On the other hand, it is also common to use arguments of the second type concerning the ''existence'' of some mathematical object. One assumes that the object doesn't exist, and then proves that this would lead to a contradiction; thus, such an object must exist. Although it is quite freely used in mathematical proofs, not every [[philosophy of mathematics|school of mathematical thought]] accepts this kind of argument as universally valid. See further [[Nonconstructive proof]].

===In mathematical logic===
In [[mathematical logic]], the proof by contradiction is represented as:

: If
::&lt;math&gt;S \cup \{ P \} \vdash \mathbb{F}&lt;/math&gt;
: then
::&lt;math&gt;S  \vdash \neg P.&lt;/math&gt;

or

: If
::&lt;math&gt;S \cup \{ \neg P \} \vdash \mathbb{F}&lt;/math&gt;
: then
::&lt;math&gt;S  \vdash P.&lt;/math&gt;

In the above, ''P'' is the proposition we wish to disprove respectively prove; and ''S'' is a set of statements, which are the [[premise]]s — these could be, for example, the [[axiom]]s of the theory we are working in, or earlier [[theorem]]s we can build upon. We consider ''P'', or the negation of ''P'', in addition to ''S''; if this leads to a logical contradiction ''F'', then we can conclude that the statements in ''S'' lead to the negation of ''P'', or ''P'' itself, respectively.

Note that the [[union (set theory)|set-theoretic union]], in some contexts closely related to [[logical disjunction]] (or), is used here for sets of statements in  such a way that it is more related to [[logical conjunction]] (and).

==Notation==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hand of Eris]]. --&gt;
Proofs by contradiction sometimes end with the word &quot;Contradiction!&quot;.  [[Isaac Barrow]] and Baermann used the notation Q.E.A., for &quot;''quod est absurdum''&quot; (&quot;which is absurd&quot;), along the lines of [[Q.E.D.]], but this notation is rarely used today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://robin.hartshorne.net/QED.html Hartshorne on QED and related]&lt;/ref&gt;  A graphical symbol sometimes used for contradictions is a downwards zigzag arrow &quot;lightning&quot; symbol (U+21AF: ↯), for example in Davey and Priestley.&lt;ref&gt;B. Davey and H.A. Priestley, Introduction to lattices and order, Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others sometimes used include a pair of [[Hand of Eris|opposing arrows]] (as &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\!\leftarrow&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow\!\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;), struck-out arrows (&lt;math&gt;\nleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;), a stylized form of hash (such as U+2A33: ⨳), or the &quot;reference mark&quot; (U+203B: ※).&lt;ref&gt;The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List, pg. 20.  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Hardegree, ''Introduction to Modal Logic'', Chapter 2, pg. II&amp;ndash;2.  http://people.umass.edu/gmhwww/511/pdf/c02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The &quot;up tack&quot; symbol (U+22A5: ⊥) used by philosophers and logicians (see [[contradiction]]) also appears, but is often avoided due to its usage for [[orthogonality]].

==Quotations==
In the words of [[G. H. Hardy]] (''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''), &quot;''Reductio ad absurdum'', which Euclid  loved so much, is one of a mathematician's finest weapons. It is a far finer gambit than any [[chess]] [[gambit]]: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers the game.&quot;

{{redirect|Brute force method|similarly named methods in other disciplines|Brute force (disambiguation)}}
'''Proof by exhaustion''', also known as '''proof by cases''', '''perfect induction''', or the '''brute force method''', is a method of [[mathematical proof]] in which the statement to be proved is split into a finite number of cases and each case is checked to see if the proposition in question holds.&lt;ref&gt;Reid &amp; Knipping 2010, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; A proof by exhaustion contains two stages:

# A proof that the cases are exhaustive; i.e., that each instance of the statement to be proved matches the conditions of (at least) one of the cases.
# A proof of each of the cases.

In the [[Curry&amp;ndash;Howard isomorphism]], proof by exhaustion and [[case analysis]] are related to ML-style [[pattern matching]].

==Example==
To prove that every [[integer]] that is a [[Cube (arithmetic)|perfect cube]] is a multiple of 9, or is 1 more than a multiple of 9, or is 1 less than a multiple of 9.

'''Proof''':
&lt;br&gt;Each cube number is the cube of some integer ''n''. Every integer ''n'' is either a multiple of 3, or 1 more or 1 less than a multiple of 3. So these 3 cases are exhaustive:
*Case 1: If ''n'' = 3''p'', then ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 27''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a multiple of 9.
*Case 2: If ''n'' = 3''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, then ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 27''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;27''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;9''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, which is 1 more than a multiple of 9. For instance, if ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 then ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 64 = 9x7&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.
*Case 3: If ''n'' = 3''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, then ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;27''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;27''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;9''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, which is 1 less than a multiple of&amp;nbsp;9. For instance, if ''n'' =&amp;nbsp;5 then ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 125 = 9&amp;times;14&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1.∎

==Number of cases==
There is no upper limit to the number of cases allowed in a proof by exhaustion. Sometimes there are only two or three cases. Sometimes there may be thousands or even millions. For example, rigorously solving an [[Chess endgame|endgame]] [[Chess problem|puzzle]] in [[chess]] might involve considering a very large number of possible positions in the [[game tree]] of that problem.

The first proof of the [[four colour theorem]] was a proof by exhaustion with 1,936 cases. This proof was controversial because the majority of the cases were checked by a computer program, not by hand. The shortest known proof of the four colour theorem today still has over 600 cases.

Mathematicians prefer to avoid proofs with large numbers of cases, as they seem inelegant, and in general the probability of an error in the whole proof increases in proportion to the number of cases. A proof with a large number of cases leaves an impression that the theorem is only true by coincidence, and not because of some underlying principle or connection. Other types of proofs—such as proof by induction ([[mathematical induction]])—are considered more elegant. However, there are some important theorems for which no other method of proof has been found, such as
* The proof that there is no finite [[projective plane]] of order 10.
* The [[classification of finite simple groups]].
* The [[Kepler conjecture]].

{{dewikify}}

In mathematical analysis, the '''intermediate value theorem''' states that if a continuous function ''f'' with an interval [''a'', ''b''] as its domain takes values ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b'') at each end of the interval, then it also takes any value between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b'') at some point within the interval. This has two important specializations: If a continuous function has values of opposite sign inside an interval, then it has a root in that interval ('''Bolzano's theorem''').&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Bolzano's Theorem |urlname=BolzanosTheorem}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, the image of a continuous function over an interval is itself an interval.

==Motivation==
[[Image:Intermediatevaluetheorem.svg|thumb|280px|The intermediate value theorem]]

This captures an intuitive property of continuous functions: given ''f'' continuous on [1, 2] with the known values ''f''(1) = 3 and ''f''(2) = 5. Then the graph of ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') must pass through the horizontal line ''y'' = 4 while ''x'' moves from 1 to 2. It represents the idea that the graph of a continuous function on a closed interval can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper.

==Theorem==
The intermediate value theorem states the following: Consider
an interval ''I'' = [''a'', ''b''] in the real numbers ℝ and a continuous function ''f'' : ''I'' → ℝ. Then,

*''Version&amp;nbsp;I.'' if ''u'' is a number between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b''),
:: {{nowrap|''f''(''a'') &lt; ''u'' &lt; ''f''(''b'') }}&amp;nbsp; (or&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap| ''f''(''a'') &gt; ''u'' &gt; ''f''(''b'')}}&amp;nbsp;),
:then there is a ''c'' ∈ (''a'', ''b'') such that ''f''(''c'') = ''u''.

*''Version&amp;nbsp;II.'' the image set ''f''(''I'') is also an interval, and either it contains [''f''(''a''), ''f''(''b'')], or it contains [''f''(''b''), ''f''(''a'')]; that is,
:: {{nowrap|''f''(''I'') &amp;supe; [''f''(''a''), ''f''(''b'')] }}&amp;nbsp; (or&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap| ''f''(''I'') &amp;supe; [''f''(''b''), ''f''(''a'')]}}&amp;nbsp;).

'''Remark:''' ''Version II'' states that the set of function values has no gap. For any two function values ''c''&lt;''d'', even if they are outside the interval between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b''), all points in the interval [''c'', ''d''] are also function values,
:: [''c'', ''d''] &amp;sube; ''f''(''I'').
A subset of the real numbers with no internal gap is an interval. ''Version I'' is obviously contained in ''Version II''.

==Relation to Completeness==
The theorem depends on (and is actually equivalent to) the completeness of the [[real number]]s. It is false for the [[rational number]]s ℚ. For example, the function {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 2}} for ''x'' ∈ ℚ satisfies ''f''(0) = &amp;minus;2 and ''f''(2) = 2. However there is no rational number ''x''  such that ''f''(''x'') = 0, because  √&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:overline&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; is [[Irrational number|irrational]].

== Proof ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Continuity property]] --&gt;
The theorem may be proved as a consequence of the [[completeness (order theory)|completeness]] property of the real numbers as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Essentially follows {{cite book |title=Foundations of Analysis|first=Douglas A.|last=Clarke|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|year=1971|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We shall prove the first case {{nowrap|''f''(''a'') &lt; ''u'' &lt; ''f''(''b'');}} the second is similar.

Let ''S'' be the set of all ''x'' in [''a'', ''b''] such that ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''u''. Then ''S'' is non-empty since ''a'' is an element of ''S'', and ''S'' is bounded above by ''b''. Hence, by completeness, the [[supremum]] ''c'' = sup ''S'' exists. That is, ''c'' is the lowest number that is greater than or equal to every member of S. We claim that ''f''(''c'') = ''u''. 

Fix some ''ε'' &gt; 0. Since ''f'' is continuous, there is a ''δ'' &gt; 0 such that |&amp;thinsp;''f''(''x'') − ''f''(''c'')&amp;thinsp;| &lt; ε whenever |&amp;thinsp;''x'' − ''c''&amp;thinsp;| &lt; ''δ''. This means that
:: ''f''(''x'') − ε &lt; ''f''(''c'') &lt; ''f''(''x'') + ''ε''
for all ''x'' between ''c'' − ''δ'' and ''c'' + ''δ''. By the properties of the supremum, there are ''x'' between ''c'' − ''δ'' and ''c'' that are contained in ''S'', so that for those ''x''
::''f''(''c'') &lt; ''f''(''x'') + ''ε'' ≤ ''u'' + ''ε''.
All ''x'' between ''c'' and ''c'' + ''δ'' are not contained in ''S'', so that for those ''x''
::''f''(''c'') &gt; ''f''(''x'') − ε &gt; ''u'' − ''ε''.
Both inequalities
::''u'' − ''ε'' &lt; ''f''(''c'') &lt; ''u'' + ''ε''
are valid for all ''ε'' &gt; 0, from which we deduce  ''f''(''c'') = ''u'' as the only possible value, as stated.

An alternative proof may be found at [[non-standard calculus]].

== History ==

For ''u'' = 0 above, the statement is also known as ''Bolzano's theorem.'' This theorem was first proved by [[Bernard Bolzano]] in 1817. [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] provided a proof in 1821.&lt;ref name=&quot;grabiner&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were inspired by the goal of formalizing the analysis of functions and the work of [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]. The idea that continuous functions possess the intermediate value property has an earlier origin. [[Simon Stevin]] proved the intermediate value theorem for polynomials (using a cubic as an example) by providing an algorithm for constructing the decimal expansion of the solution.  The algorithm iteratively subdivides the interval into 10 parts, producing an additional decimal digit at each step of the iteration.&lt;ref&gt;Karin Usadi Katz and [[Mikhail Katz|Mikhail G. Katz]] (2011) A Burgessian Critique of Nominalistic Tendencies in Contemporary Mathematics and its Historiography. [[Foundations of Science]]. {{doi|10.1007/s10699-011-9223-1}} See [http://www.springerlink.com/content/tj7j2810n8223p43/ link]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the formal definition of continuity was given, the intermediate value property was given as part of the definition of a continuous function. Proponents include [[Louis Arbogast]], who assumed the functions to have no jumps, satisfy the intermediate value property and have increments whose sizes corresponded to the sizes of the increments of the variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Arbogast}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Earlier authors held the result to be intuitively obvious, and requiring no proof.  The insight of Bolzano and Cauchy was to define a general notion of continuity (in terms of [[infinitesimal]]s in Cauchy's case, and using real inequalities in Bolzano's case), and to provide a proof based on such definitions.

==Generalization==

The intermediate value theorem can be seen as a consequence of the following two statements from [[topology]]:
* If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[topological space]]s, ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is continuous, and ''X'' is [[connected space|connected]], then ''f''(''X'') is connected.
* A subset of ℝ is connected if and only if it is an interval.

The intermediate value theorem generalizes in a natural way: Suppose that ''X'' is a connected topological space and (''Y'', &lt;) is a [[total order|totally ordered]] set equipped with the [[order topology]], and let ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' be a continuous map. If ''a'' and ''b'' are two points in ''X'' and ''u'' is a point in ''Y'' lying between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b'') with respect to &lt;, then there exists ''c'' in ''X'' such that ''f''(''c'') = ''u''.  The original theorem is recovered by noting that ℝ is connected and that its natural topology is the order topology.

==Converse is false==

A &quot;Darboux function&quot; is a real-valued function ''f'' that has the &quot;intermediate value property&quot;, i.e., that satisfies the conclusion of the intermediate value theorem: for any two values ''a'' and ''b'' in the domain of ''f'', and any ''y'' between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b''), there is some ''c'' between ''a'' and ''b'' with ''f''(''c'') = ''y''.  The intermediate value theorem says that every continuous function is a Darboux function.  However, not every Darboux function is continuous; i.e., the converse of the intermediate value theorem is false. 

As an example, take the function ''f'' : [0, ∞) → [&amp;minus;1, 1] defined by ''f''(''x'') = sin(1/''x'') for ''x'' &gt; 0 and f(0) = 0. This function is not continuous at ''x'' = 0 because the [[limit of a function|limit]] of ''f''(''x'') as ''x'' tends to 0 does not exist; yet the function has the intermediate value property.  Another, more complicated example is given by the [[Conway base 13 function]].

Historically, this intermediate value property has been suggested as a ''definition'' for continuity of real-valued functions{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}; this definition was not adopted.

[[Darboux's theorem (analysis)|Darboux's theorem]] states that all functions that result from the [[derivative|differentiation]] of some other function on some interval have the [[intermediate value property]] (even though they need not be continuous).

==Implications of theorem in real world==

The theorem implies that on any [[great circle]] around the world, the [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[elevation]], [[carbon dioxide]] concentration, or any other similar scalar quantity which varies continuously, there will always exist two [[antipodal points]] that share the same value for that variable.

''Proof:'' Take ''f'' to be any continuous function on a circle. Draw a line through the center of the circle, intersecting it at two opposite points ''A'' and ''B''. Let ''d'' be defined by the difference ''f''(''A'') &amp;minus; ''f''(''B''). If the line is rotated 180 degrees, the value &amp;minus;''d'' will be obtained instead. Due to the intermediate value theorem there must be some intermediate rotation angle for which ''d'' = 0, and as a consequence ''f''(''A'') = ''f''(''B'') at this angle.

This is a special case of a more general result called the [[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]].

Another generalization for which this holds is for any closed convex n (n &gt; 1) dimensional shape. Specifically, for any continuous function whose domain is the given shape, and any point inside the shape (not necessarily its center), there exist two antipodal points with respect to the given point whose functional value is the same. The proof is identical to the one given above.

The theorem also underpins the explanation of why rotating a wobbly table will bring it to stability (subject to certain easily-met constraints).&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Devlin]] (2007) [http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_02_07.html How to stabilize a wobbly table]&lt;/ref&gt;

Overriding the typography refresh - see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Typography_refresh
To use it, copy the following code to [[Special:Mypage/vector.css]].
Alternatively, choose a skin other than Vector in your preferences.
Works ok for me with Firefox 27.0.1 and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but has not been tested
in different environments. There may also still be glitches of one sort or another.
Let me know if you have any suggestions for improving it.

&lt;!-- Please add categories to the bottom of this page, and add interwikis to Wikidata. --&gt;

This template produces a '''table of contents box''', for navigation between pages within a book. Has the same color and font format as the Table of Contents (TOC).   As a result it matches it well and can be used for other links.   Use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags for hard returns within the content.   An example of its use and the result are shown below.

This box was made to place adjacent to the page Table of Contents, in a table cell, to hold links to other pages in the book. The colors are taken from &lt;nowiki&gt;class=&quot;toccolors&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;.toccolours {
	border: 1px solid #aaa;
	background-color: #f9f9f9;
	padding: 5px;
	font-size: 95%;}&lt;/pre&gt;

A top-margin was added to give vertical separation.

=== Usage ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{tmbox|type=notice|text='''Please do not delete all the content from pages.'''&lt;br /&gt;Page blanking may be mistaken for [[WB:DWV|vandalism]] and does not delete the page. If you wish to have this page deleted please instead add {{tlx|delete|your reason}} to the top of the page and preserve the previous contents, or if it is a duplicate page, add {{tlx|previous edit history|other page name}} to the page instead, so that an administrator can fix it. Please read the [[WB:DP|deletion policy]] to learn more about when pages should be deleted and alternatives to deletion. Thank you.
