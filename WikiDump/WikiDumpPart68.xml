      <text xml:space="preserve">== &lt;u&gt;'''Intro from a guru'''&lt;/u&gt; ==
Looks like this is a class project. If you guys need something, just ask (the [[WB:ADMIN|admins]] are usually around). If you like, you can help us keep track of class projects by registering this one at [[Wikibooks:List of class projects]]. This way, the regulars will know that you're working as a group on this project and we can better help out. A good starting point for anyone involved in this is [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]] - just a quick primer so you know how things are done around here.

Finally, if there's an instructor or group leader, please identify them as such. Having a single contact point makes life much easier.

I hope all of you find this as exciting a project as I (and the other folks here) do. My [[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|talk page]] is always available if you need anything, or [[WB:HELP]] is read by the community at large. Happy editing! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:40, 10 January 2008 (UTC)
:While I'm not your prof, I am familiar with Wikibooks. You guys have done great work, and it seems like the kind of thing your prof is looking for. Unfortunately, it's also looking less and less like a [[WB:WIW|textbook]] as time wears on. This is often a problem with class projects (in fact, we're dealing with another one right now). ''If'' this is supposed to be a textbook, then great. I can give you some pointers on what you'll need to do to make it more textbook-like (create a table of contents, split the page off into several modules organized in a coherent way to teach someone about something...). ''If'' this isn't really intended to be a textbook, but something more like a [[v:WV:IS|course]], then Wikibooks may not be the best home for it. Don't panic; you'll never lose your work. This is not said to scare you, but instead to help you find the best wiki to host your project.
:Please do have someone respond to this, and we can move forward in one direction or another. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:49, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

== &lt;u&gt;'''Assignment Guidelines'''&lt;/u&gt; ==


 '''General Note To The Class''': As per our class discussion on Thursday, we will now be posting our responses to the WikiBook, not the
 discussion page. Responses should engage critically with one or more concepts from the textbook.  Feel free to include examples of personal
 experiences when relevant.  Be sure to include page number citations to the textbook (or other sources) when appropriate.
 **Do not post your responses to the discussion page, as we will be reserving that space for editorial comments (e.g. I think this section
 is getting repetitive . . .  or, I'm not sure that everything in this section is relevant . . . or, I really think this paragraph would work 
 well in this other section . . .)  
 **Seeing as we've agreed to construct this book in the form of a collective dialogue, please remember to include your signature after all
 of your postings to the WikiBook the and discussion page.
 **These changes have also been made to the &quot;Posting to our WikiBook&quot; section to avoid any confusion.

If you have any questions regarding the assignment guidelines, post them here.

== &lt;u&gt;'''How to Format Your Responses'''&lt;/u&gt; '''(Ask the Editors)''' ==

If you have any suggestions or concerns about formatting, post them here.


*I moved all the entries that were [in the motivation section] to the WikiBook.  Unfortunately, that meant deleting everyone's summaries for the week.  Apologies go out to all of you who put the effort into those postings.  They will still be able to be viewed and assesed by Michele in everyone's contribution page, so I'm thinking that he'll take that into account during evaulation (at least I hope he will). If not, you can blame it all on me.
:--[[User:Maurosavo|Maurosavo]] ([[User talk:Maurosavo|talk]]) 16:50, 25 January 2008 (UTC)


::::* (SIDEBAR) Let me assure you that absolutely all individual contributions will be accessed using this form--[[Special:Contributions]]--and taken into account during evaluation. 
::::--[[User:Yasya|Yasya]] ([[User talk:Yasya|talk]]) 17:58, 25 January 2008 (UTC)


*Following Mauro's lead, I transfered the &quot;Classroom Management&quot; entries to the Wikibook.  
:Seeing as we did not create subheadings on the &quot;discussion page&quot; until our second week, this section remains disorganized.
:Perhaps each contributor can organize their old entries, and place them under the appropriate subheading. 
:--[[User:Mjcaskenette|Mjcaskenette]] ([[User talk:Mjcaskenette|talk]]) 21:48, 27 January 2008 (UTC)


*Initially, I deleted all of the old Wikibook entries in the Classroom Management section, as Mauro had done.  However, in discussion with Michel, we agreed this might have been a bit extreme.  I restored the old notes; please try to integrate your old discussion passages within them.  Perhaps someone would like to restore the old Motivation notes as well.  Mauro?  Any takers?
:--[[User:Mjcaskenette|Mjcaskenette]] ([[User talk:Mjcaskenette|talk]]) 07:14, 28 January 2008 (UTC)


*Hello Editors! I have no idea why, but my entire response is underlined!  I posted under &quot;Cognitive Views of Learning&quot; under the heading, &quot;Becoming Knowledgeable: Some basic principles&quot;  I don't know if this is an issue, but if it is, let me know how to fix it!! Thanks.
:--[[User:Colillis|Colillis]] ([[User talk:Colillis|talk]]) 19:28, 1 February 2008 (UTC)


*Hey guys.  An observation regarding the &quot;Cognitive Views of Learning&quot; section: Several people have summarized material from the text.  That's great, and it helps fuel our discussions.  But I don't think we should add our signatures to material that has been merely summarized.  What if you revise or add to someone's summary?  Do you delete their signature, and/or add your own?

:Signatures should be used to acknowledge our personal interjections, interpretations, ideas and experiences.  The extra signatures just seem like clutter, and besides, we don't want to take credit for ideas that aren't ours. 
:The Editors may want to take a few of these signatures out. 
:--[[User:Mjcaskenette|Mjcaskenette]] ([[User talk:Mjcaskenette|talk]]) 03:49, 4 February 2008 (UTC)

== &lt;u&gt;'''Major Reorganization'''&lt;/u&gt; ==
As promised, this week the whole page was divided into several sub-pages that correspond thematically with the weekly reading topics. The links to the new sub-pages are available under [[PsycholARTSical:_Psyched_about_the_arts#Book_Contents|'''Book Contents''']]. Don't hesitate to contact me in case you have any questions, problems, suggestions. --[[User:Yasya|Yasya]] ([[User talk:Yasya|talk]]) 07:47, 2 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rowe, George Duncan == 

=== “A Celebrated Oarsman who prefers cricket to rowing and golf to both” (Spy), July 4, 1906 ===

[[Image:Rowe_GD_Vanity_Fair_1906-07-04.jpg|thumb|right]]''Mr. George Duncan Rowe was born forty-nine years ago in a South American Republic.  He came to England and commenced to educate himself at Marlborough College.  He played in the Cricket Eleven of that school; if he missed a catch or made a blob he always handed in his resignation (which was never accepted) to Plumpton Wilson, the captain.  From Marlborough he went to University, Oxford, and found his way into the Eight.  In 1879 he was in the beaten crew, but in 1880 was President, and won.  He helped to take his college boat to the head of the River, and to keep it there.''

''He is a veteran member of the Leander Committee, and has been Honorary Secretary and Captain of the Club.  To his efforts is mainly due the erection of the fine Club-house at Henley, and he has always taken a hand in schemes that make for the Club’s prosperity and reputation.  He is a steward of Henley Regatta, and represents O.U.B.C. to the Committee of the Amateur Rowing Association.''

''He is a partner in the firm of Rowe and Pitman, stockbrokers, and is very prosperous.  He sings, and was a member of the Magpies; but retired because there was too much Brahms for his taste.  He also plays croquet and the piano.  At Univ. he was such a model of propriety that he was one of the few undergraduates who were not sent down after certain regrettable incidents.  His character has not degenerated with the effuxion of time.''

''He is believed to prefer cricket to rowing, and golf to cricket; but he rowed better than he played cricket, and is a better cricketer than golfer.''

[[Image:Leander_clubhouse_c1898.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Leander Club, Henley-on-Thames, c. 1898]]George Duncan Rowe (1857-1934) went head of the river at Oxford with University College in 1877 and 1878, and rowed in the Boat Race in 1879 and 1880.  He was president of the O.U.B.C. the latter year, succeeding W.H. Grenfell.  He co-captained Leander in 1883.  As secretary (1887-97), he helped secure Temple Island for a Leander enclosure when the club was still based at Putney and orchestrated the construction of the Henley boathouse a decade later.  It  “is a great institution for that Club,” wrote &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 22, 1897), “with a site on the bank close to the bridge, coffee and reading rooms, twenty bedrooms, ladies’ coffee-room, and a verandah balcony round two sides of the building.  For luxury no modern rowing club house can come near it, and the architecture makes it a thing of beauty, and in full keeping with the weeping willow villa which it adjoins.”  In 1900, he made the White House Meadow, where the Remenham Club and Regatta enclosure now stand, available as an enclosure for Leander members in lieu of Temple Island.  Club president from 1919 to his death in 1934, Rowe would offer up his resignation at the annual dinner, to find it ignored and be “unanimously and uproariously reelected for another year.”{{ref|Times}} 

Of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; rowing prints, none but Rowe’s mentions golf.  Although the sport originated centuries ago in Scotland as every pilgrim to St. Andrews knows, it did not become popular in England until the very end of the nineteenth century, as part of the broader surge in Victorian recreational sport.  It then came in “with an almost comical rattle,” recalled W.B. Woodgate.  “When I left Oxford [in 1867] not one Southron in five hundred could have explained the meaning of a ‘tee’ or a ‘caddy,’ and would have deemed the interrogator to be punning as to the ‘cup which cheers, but not inebriates.’  In the sixties, seventies and eighties, when I now and then played in North Britain, it was looked upon by every nine out of ten of my Scottish friends as a mere stop-gap to kill time on a non-sporting day, and not a subject for life’s devotion any more than billiards.”{{ref|Woodgate}}

=== Toilettes for Henley Week ===
In its early and middle years &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; limited its remarks on rowing fashion to such items as Woodgate’s occasional slash at unsanctioned “blazers.”  En route to the 1914 absorption into the women’s magazine &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Hearth and Home&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; started carrying such articles as Mary Howarth’s “Toilettes for Henley Week:  Fashions the River Gods Approve,”appearing in the same issue as Mr. Rowe:

[[Image:Ladies%27_Oval_boating_costume.jpg|thumb|200px|]]''The liquid tones of the river gods beguile us to Henley this week, where there are fascinations, material as well as aquatic, though I write a little too soon to be able to state whether the elements will be favourable to so sylvan a fête as the Regatta.  I only know that there have been some very pretty and dainty dresses and also some charming specimens of millinery prepared for the event.  Specially have I approved the white handkerchief lawn gowns, with their wealth of plumetis embroidery, and the blanche linen skirts, quaintly made en corselet, with short pleated jackets to match, worn with a pair of blue or mahogany brown suède gloves to match, and white hat with soft blue or brown ribbon on it to match.''

:''AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ZEPHYR COSTUMES.''

''Last week’s heavy downpour has freshened the country most delightfully.  How green is the wheat now, already heavy in the ear, and how scarlet are the poppies; how the wild roses gem the verdant hedgerow.  Everything is essentially juvenile, and so must the Henley toilette be (I refer to its newness or freshness), or perish the hope of its success.''

''It would be ungrateful to the dressmakers to forget to mention the practical little toilettes they are presenting in checked zephyr; simplest and least pretentious of fabrics, but most effective for a river fête.  The chance of introducing a touch of daring colour is possible when a black and white zephyr is chosen that permits a little cherry coloured silk to figure as an outline to the soft white mousseline vest, and about the high collar of the same fabric.  That most useful adjunct, the sunshade, may be requisitioned to intensify the brightness of the cherry shade, and thus to throw up the cool black and white check of the gown.''

''The simpler the muslin frock the better for Henley week.  White haircord and coloured dimities may prove the most successful of frocks.  Then for older wearers it would be foolish to forget the very soft glossy foulards that are so useful, and Tokio silk that makes so graceful a dress for a club lawn.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Shearman, Montague == 

=== “A.A.A.” (WAG), July 4, 1895 ===
[[Image:Shearman_M_Vanity_Fair_1895-07-04.jpg|thumb|right]]''Though he looks older, he was born only eight-and-thirty years ago to an athletic solicitor of the Adelphi; who once helped to win the Steward’s Cup at Henley.  At Merchant Taylor’s School he won prizes for Hebrew and most other subjects; but being a fat, overgrown boy he showed no athletic prowess -- beyond captaining the school football team -- until he got to Oxford:  which he did with a scholarship that entitled him to run for something else.  Accordingly he was well beaten in the Freshmen’s Sports; after which he suddenly developed into a sprinter, and in his second term beat all Cambridge comers in the Hundred Yards and won the English Amateur Championship over that distance.  Then he got his Rugby football Blue; and proceeded to represent Oxford against Cambridge in three different events at one meeting -- namely, the Hundred Yards, the Quarter Mile, and the Putting of the Weight:  which is a record performance for any single man.  After this he ran second to his brother, John Shearman, in the Championship Quarter Mile; notwithstanding which brotherly love continued, and a year later he won that event also.  In the meantime he had, for variety’s sake, rowed in the St. John’s Eight, played La Crosse for England against Scotland, and, by way of relief, scored two First Classes in the schools -- one in Classical Moderations, the second in Greats; so that he may be fairly regarded as a mental and physical athlete of degree.  Having thus done a good deal to improve sport by example, he began precept and became one of that triumvirate who founded the Amateur Athletic Association which holds its sixteenth Championship Meeting at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, when he will for the twelfth revolving year act as referee.  His, indeed, is the chief credit for the building up of this Association; of which he has been Honorary Secretary or Vice-President all its life.''

''Having just avoided being sent down from Oxford (for too much noise made at an old-fashioned Commemoration), he got called to the Bar fourteen years ago; and though he now enjoys a good and substantial Common Law practice, he has not yet taken silk, nor has he stood for Parliament, nor achieved any other extra-legal performance save writing the Badminton book on Athletics.  Yet is he commonly alleged to be a very reliable advocate, a most conscientious man, and shrewd person who never gives an opinion without knowledge.  Those who know him vow that he is also a good friend and a safe man; and withal he is so modest that it is believed that his only enemies are the jealous.  He is a sedate fellow with a sense of humour; who is respected even by bookmakers.  He once took great part in a Town and Gown row:  whence he carries the impression of a brickbat on his forehead to this day.''

''He is a man of much virtue; and he is cleverer than he looks.  He is known to his friends as “Tont.”''

Montague Shearman (1857-1930) rowed in the 1882 Thames Cup for the Thames Rowing Club.  Like fellow rower and O.U.A.C. President W.H. Grenfell, Shearman once swam Niagara below the falls.  He became president of the Amateur Athletic Association in 1915, succeeding Lord Alverstone (who as Richard Webster, Q.C., had defended fellow Cambridge athletics star C.B. Lawes in the ''Belt'' case).

Professionally, Shearman became a King’s Counsel in 1903. It was prescient of VANITY FAIR to have depicted him as a finish line judge at the tape, for he was elevated to the King’s Bench in 1914 to fill one of several vacant judgeships, one made so by the retirement of Mr. Justice Channell. In that role Shearman presided over some of the famous murder cases of the day. “Although he never pretended to be a profound jurist, he was not afraid of grappling with legal problems or of making up his mind.”[1] Yet, despite all these favourable comments, reality was very different. Shearman’s mind was preset, overriding even his judicial duties, as became most obvious in the Thompson-Bywaters trial in 1922 (described in detail in Criminal Justice by René Weis and other accounts). His shameless abuse of authority in support of the prosecution case provoked a sense of outrage, the Observer noted. Shearman even called on the jurors, shrewdly but unmistakebly, to share his prejudice against the prisoners: “I think you will feel disgust .. but your feelings of disgust will not run away with you” the New York Times quoted him reminding the jury just before their verdict. How could a judge ever make such an implying statement at this decisive moment of a trial, one must ask, if not to make the jurors aware that they are, and if not, better be disgusted. So advised by Justice Shearman, aged 65 at the time and an impressive figure, the jury had no choice other than the verdicts of guilty, also on Edith Thompson whose hand had never been involved in the crime. For the tragic hanging of the innocent young woman Shearman bears the full blame, he committed this judicial murder in cold blood. “The Court is not a theatre” he once said, but what he did himself was far worse: he made the Court a deadly playground for his very personal moral beliefs. He should have been put on trial for it himself, and hanged rather than knighted, many felt.  -   A 1927 operation arising from an old rugby injury impaired his speech, and he retired in 1929.

=== The 1878 Boat Race:  Oxford Sliding ===
Oxford won the 1878 Boat Race by about 300 yards, or forty seconds.  W.B. Woodgate, recalling in 1909 the Boat Race eights he’d observed for over half a century, chose this Oxford crew and the Cambridge crews of 1899 and 1900 as his favorites.  “There have been divers other smart crews, as also sundry feeble ones; but I think that the three which I have named are entitled to preference; and if again one of the trio is to be selected, I incline to the 1878 crew, if only in view of the undeniable quality of the team which they ran clear away from.”  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (April 20, 1878) was likewise impressed:

''The experts in rowing who went to see the contest of 1878, if they did not see a good race, saw some remarkably good rowing.  The winning boat was a good one, and the like of the two after “oars” in it are not often to be seen.  The Cambridge men were overmatched both in strength and style.  There was a noticeable difference between their manner of getting their oars through the water and that of the Oxford crew.  Apart from the question of strength, the Oxford style was better and more effective than that of their opponents.  It is not fair to criticise a losing boat, for a losing crew never row their best; but Cambridge rowed a better stern chase than some University crews we have seen.''

Woodgate recalled the 1877 and 1878 Oxford crews in his comments on the 1897 Boat Race for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (April 8, 1896):

''Oxford, though on paper very much the same crew as last year, were some lengths faster than their 1896 crew.  Improved sliding was the main cause of this.  There was a similar instance in the 1877 and 1878 Oxford crews.  The material in the latter was rather weaker than in the former (the dead-heat crew); but the 1878 crew was some hundred yards faster through improvement in sliding since the preceding year.''

R.C. Lehmann, who never rowed a Boat Race but coached many crews for both sides, noted in his &lt;u&gt;Complete Oarsman&lt;/u&gt; (1908), that Oxford won the 1878 race almost entirely with body swing, hardly using their legs.  It took S.D. Muttlebury coming along several years later to drive out that old orthodoxy (fixed-seat body swing) and bring in the new (leg drive and swing):

''The fault of using nearly the whole of the body-swing without the help of leg-power is never inculcated now, for there is universal agreement in regard to the principles of the matter.  It has, however, in times past, had its advocates and exponents, chiefly, I think, at Oxford.  The late Mr. D.H. McLean, in his luminous and concise article on ''Rowing'' in the &lt;u&gt;Encyclopedia of Sport&lt;/u&gt;, refers to the Oxford crew of 1878.  The crew was composed of first-rate material, and gave a splendid exhibition of power, body-form, uniformity and pace, but its sliding was, according to our existing ideas, absolutely unorthodox.  Mr. McLean may have seen the crew as a small boy at Eton, for they practised there occasionally if my memory serves me.  I saw them during their practice at Putney, and I remember being particularly struck by one feature of their rowing.  Though they used their bodies at the beginning with immense dash and gusto, they used their legs scarcely at all.  As they finished their stroke their knees were bent, and in this position they showed above the sax-boards of the boat.  This meant that they relied practically entirely on their bodies, and treated the slide as a mere incident of the stroke, and an unimportant one at that.  As they started from this as a principle, they were doubtless wise in not attempting to use their legs to any great extent.  Had they done so they would inevitably have split their waterwork up into two separate parts, and their uniformity would have suffered.  Some little time after this, as a result of four successive defeats at the hands of Cambridge, Oxford men recognised the true doctrine, and have ever since been among its most brilliant exponents.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== McCalmont, Harry Leslie Blundell ==

=== “Mr. H.L.B. McCalmont” (Spy), October 5, 1889 ===

[[Image:McCalmont_HLB_Vanity_Fair_1889-10-05.jpg|thumb|right]]''Born seven-and-twenty years ago, under circumstances which rendered his education at Eton a matter of course, he developed into a big and robust young fellow, who, at the age of nineteen, was chosen to stroke the Eton Eight at Henley.  He also lent weight to his side in the Field Game.  At a later period he gravitated into a Lieutenancy of the 6th Royal Warwickshire Regiment, whence he has since transferred to the Scots Guards.''

''He is a big, cheerful, rosy-faced young man, very popular and quite unaffected.  He is fond of horses, and he has perpetuated the colours of the Eton Field Game in those under which he races.  Before Hugh McCalmont -- well known, among other things, as a very rich Ulster landlord -- died two years ago, he made “Harry” McCalmont, who was the eldest of his grand-nephews, his heir, so that he is rich; and though he has not yet fully come into his own, his fortune having been left in trust for his benefit for seven years, he has recently bought an estate in Herefordshire.  He is a thoroughly good fellow and a very eligible young man.''

=== “Giralda” (Spy), January 9, 1896 ===
[[Image:McCalmont_HLB_Vanity_Fair_1896-01-09.jpg|thumb|right]]
''Within the span of his four-and-thirty years he has made himself one of the best-known men of his age in the country.   Beginning at Eton as a slim athlete who presently developed weight that made him quite useful as stroke of the Eton Eight and in the Field Game, he went into the Warwickshire Militia and thence into the Scots Guards.  With the late Captain Lawrence, of the Rifle Brigade, he founded the Army Football Association, and he has consistently shown himself a sportsman of the best class.  He took to coaching, which he has long given up; he grew fond of horses, and with the famous Isinglass came, saw, conquered, and made his popularity as an owner general; so much so that he has been modestly heard to say that he is better known in many quarters as the “owner of Isinglass” than by his own name.  But his chief sport is yachting; to which he is devoted.  He was partner with Lord Dunraven in ''Valkyrie III.;'' and he now owns the fastest and finest steam yacht afloat in the ''Giralda'', which can do two-and-twenty knots.  He also holds the International Cup for steam yachts.  His devotion to sea-sport has developed in him keen naval tendencies, and these made him fight the Newmarket Division at the General Election; which fight resulted in a triumph for himself and Conservatism.  Though he has not yet been heard in the House, there can be no doubt that Imperialism will profit by his vote and voice when he is.  He is very rich and quite generous; yet being a shrewd fellow, he is not to be taken in; and it is much to say for him that no word has ever been said against him in any branch of sport.''

''He is a thoroughly straightforward, cheery, hearty fellow, full of common sense.  He is very fond of horses, and he owns, in Cheverly Park, a nice place at Newmarket.  But he is rarely seen on horseback.''

''He has grown a beard.''

Harry Leslie Blundell McCalmont (1862-1902) stroked Eton in the 1880 Ladies’ Plate and rowed for Kingston R.C. in the Wyfolds and the Grand in 1881.

His great-uncle died unmarried, leaving him the entire estate in trust.  From 1887 to 1894, McCalmont received £2000 per year, enough to fund his initial forays into the turf.   One proved remarkably successful:  his colt [[w:Isinglass_%28horse%29|Isinglass]] won an unprecedented £57,455.  In 1894, McCalmont received the balance of the estate plus interest amounting to £4 million and went into yachting, the other sport for which he featured in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;.  In 1895 McCalmont was elected to Parliament as a Conservative, was reelected in 1900, and was decorated 1902 for his services in the South African war as colonel of the Sixth Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire regiment.  He died of sudden heart failure at age forty, married without children, leaving the bulk of the estate much as he came to it:  to a distant relation, the son of his father’s first cousin.

=== Henley 1880: Eton in the Ladies’ ===
Dr. Warre coached the 1880 Eton eight, which included H.L.B. McCalmont, D.H. McLean, and G.C. Bourne, for the Ladies’ Challenge Plate.  They beat Caius on the first day but on the second, overexposed to the heat and sun during the fifteen mile carriage ride from Eton to the regatta, the crew wilted and lost to Trinity Hall, as Bourne recalled:

[[Image:Four-in-hand_to_Henley_c1880.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Four-in-hand to Henley Regatta, c. 1852]]
''For some time past the weather had been very hot and some of the leading members of the school, among them Puxley, had excited the wrath of Dr. Warre by walking about with Japanese umbrellas over their heads.  On the second day of the Regatta we left Eton in close and sultry weather.  After we had driven some three or four miles the sun broke through the clouds and shone down with great violence on our heads protected only by our white caps.  As ill luck would have it Puxley was the first to put up an umbrella as protection against the heat.  “Put it down; none of that,” said Warre, ''patiens pulveris atque solis,''{{ref|Latin}} and we had to drive on without proper head-cover in almost tropical heat.  Mindful of my recent rupture with Dr. Warre [over an ill-fated boat design] I dared not protest, and we arrived at Henley in a state of exhaustion.  The heavy-weights suffered the most from the heat, and McCalmont and one or two others had splitting headaches.  We were a beaten crew as we paddled down to the post, and when we were half-way down the course McCalmont turned to me and said, “I am no use to-day, old fellow.  There seem to be two Henley churches and I don’t know which side of the river they are on.”  He had a slight sunstroke and was quite unfit to race.''

''We led our opponents at first, but our rowing was lifeless and got worse as we went on.  Our plight was worse because the stroke-side oars, having suffered more from the sun than the bow-side, were pulled round over the whole course.  There was a following breeze which helped the light but lively Trinity Hall crew:  they caught us before the corner and won rather easily.  Thus the heaviest and most powerful crew that had ever been sent out from Eton -- I do not think that a heavier has been sent out since -- terminated its career ingloriously.  The story is not complete without the addition that Dr. Warre himself was ill for ten days afterwards from the effect of that long drive in the baking sun, and when he recovered, made me a very handsome apology.  The next year, when the weather was again hot, he was solicitous that we should provide ourselves with wide-brimmed hats and protect ourselves against the heat of the sun by any means that we thought fit.''{{ref|Bourne}}

== The ~ in LaTeX ==

Hi, Your comment &quot;afaik you put a ~ before \ref and \label commands - I forgot why...&quot; has a simple answer. The ~ is a non-breaking space, so it won't put &quot;page&quot; at the end of a line, and a number at the beginning of the next line. This is how &quot;properly typeset&quot; literature should appear. 06:25, 21 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

== JavaScript/Contents ==

Yes, you're right, no pages like &quot;XY/Contents&quot; should exist. However, lots of books violate [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style#Title pages|Manual of Style]] and create &quot;cover page&quot; on page &quot;XY&quot; and create table of contents on &quot;XY/Contents&quot;; what's worst, some even name chapters like &quot;XY/Contents/Chapter name&quot; to get free backward links to table of contents, which is dreadful. Book table of contents should always be placed on page named the same as the book.

This was also the case here: [[JavaScript]] was first a cover page with categories and interwiki, than someone came and removed all this, making a redirect. I restored the cover and fixed the TOC.

The problem is that English Wikibooks has no policy on cover (title) pages and currently there's a total mess. Some people put categories and interwiki here, other put there, sometimes there are some different sets of both on both pages. Noone knows where to link to from bookshelves: to table of contents or to cover?

On Polish Wikibooks there's a clear policy: all interwiki and categories should be only on cover page if it exists and all links to book should lead to the cover page, not table of contents. That's the best solution, because if there's a cover, readers should see it first when clicking on book title (otherwise the cover would not make any sense); in the same time the table of contents cannot be a subpage (&quot;/Contents&quot;), because this would break automatic backward links.

We lack such policy here. Unfortunately I'm not very active on Wikibooks, so I don't have time to fix it. However, if you have time, it would be good to start preparing it. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:36, 11 September 2008 (UTC)

: Sorry for elbowing myself into this discussion, but just a quick note. There is a bit of a mess with the page structure, but there is a clear preference by the current community for placing an overview of the contents on the book main page and the MoS strongly recommends doing it that way. We do, however, give editors some leeway to do things the way they like. Better a poorly structured book than no book at all (structure can always be fixed once they come to their senses ;-) ).
: We don't have bookshelves any more (these have been replaced by [[Wikibooks:subject pages|subject pages]]) and they are being phased out. Links should always point to the main page. If book contributors want readers to start on a cover/splash page, then so be it.
: As for the state of affairs, this derives from the fact that many books were created well before the manual of style had taken hold. Most of the language books are very similar and may have been formatted by a small number of people (many seem to be minimal courses from some Peace Corps program or something similar) and/or be the case of a meme spreading. I've been fixing a few, but it takes a while. If you plan to do work on this, make sure to check whether the books have active contributors before doing anything drastic. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:01, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

== English ==

I just [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=English/Basic_componenents&amp;diff=1437274&amp;oldid=1437002 removed] your speedy delete request because the page still is part of the book structure. There are also other pages that are similarly empty of content. It would be better to deprecate these pages before deleting them. Leaving red-links would be even more confusing to future contributors. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:09, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

: Sounds good. How do I tag a page as deprecated? I used to do it using {{tlx|Editor note}}, but is there a standard way? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 15:15, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

:: If a page qualifies for [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deletion]], you tag it as {{tlx|delete}} as you did. But before that, it's generally a good idea to deprecate it by removing links that point to it. This shows that the page isn't used any more, helps make sure it won't just get recreated later and leaves a clearer replacement-structure for future contributors.
:: You can see what links to the page you are viewing by clicking on the &quot;[[Special:WhatLinksHere/User talk:Dan Polansky|What links here]]&quot; link in the toolbox in the side-bar (on the left in the default skin).
:: Not that this procedure needs to be overly rigid and formal. In the case of deletions, content gets the benefit of the doubt and your fellow Wikibookians may prefer keeping it if they don't know where you plan to take the book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:31, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

::: What exactly are you doing to the English book/project?  I spent a long time creating an 'English' page which would serve to direct users to the specific book they were looking for as 'English' on its own was too general.  Why couldn't you have just included all the other books on the English language that you'd found into the original 'English' page rather than 'subject:English language'?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:27, 26 April 2009 (UTC)
:::: I post my reply here: [[Talk:English#Splitting_again]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:19, 27 April 2009 (UTC)
:::: I guess I should also post a reply here:  I have split again several books on English that you have &quot;merged&quot; by adding the prefix &quot;English/&quot; to them. I did it per Wikibooks policy that Wikibooks books should not have their subject in their title as a prefix, only a book title. I was aware that I was undoing your move. After careful consideration, I decided to take that step, as I came to the conclusion that your move--adding the prefix &quot;English/&quot; to the book titles--was after all not a good idea. At least one user---Martin Kraus--agrees with my move, as follows from [[Talk:English#Splitting_again]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 09:00, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

Dan, I think this English category has to be ordered somehow, I wrote more about that in English Grammar talk page. In short, I think that there should be three grammars for different levels, called something like Comprehensive English Grammar, Advanced English Grammar and Beginners English Grammar, and these should be separate from learning modules. All other grammars should be deleted. Otherwise, people have done great work, but there is still no certainty. [[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 18:15, 28 April 2009 (UTC)

: For the record, I guess you are referring to [[Talk:English Grammar#English grammars]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 09:36, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

== Subject pages ==

Hi Dan,

Subject pages such as the one you created at [[Shoe]] belong in the subject name-space (just prepend &quot;Subject:&quot; to the title). As for that particular case, I would recommend a slightly more subject-oriented title such as leather-works, crafts, or something similar. Note also that a book can belong to multiple subjects. The hierarchy isn't very good, but you can browse the existing ones from the [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]]. Adding new subject pages to that hierarchy will increas its accessibility and make it easier to maintain. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:15, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

== Rhetoric and Composition Wikitext ==

Hi, Dan. I noticed you've been more active than anyone else on our Rhetoric and Composition wikibook, and I wondered if you'd like to get involved in our efforts to revise it this semester. I have a group of four graduate students in my Digital Rhetoric and Pedagogy class, and I intend to make editing this book part of the syllabus. If you're interested in helping out, perhaps by focusing on the most problematic areas, let me know. I can be reached here or at matt@mattbarton.net

Thanks,

Matt
: Thank you for the offer. I am now busy with other things, I am afraid. I am looking forward to seeing that nice Wikibook revised by you and your students. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 22:57, 18 January 2011 (UTC)

== C++ Programming ==

Some notes to myself and others about ''C++ Programming'' Wikibook. The Wikibook seems to have been hijacked by {{user|Panic2k4}}. The editor's tactic used to gain editorial control over the book seems to consist above all in controlling the talk page [[Talk:C++ Programming]]. He asks editors to post to one of three other places ([[Talk:C++ Programming/Content]], [[Talk:C++ Programming/Conventions]] and [[Talk:C++ Programming/Q&amp;A]]), and he removes discussions from that page without properly archiving them. As a consequence, it is hard to figure out what has been discussed and what the consensus has been.

I have discovered this when I tried to remove a big text from the main page of the book. I wanted to post on the talk page what I was doing and that [[User:Ruakh]] has done the same thing before, only to find that the talk page contains some oddly formatted sections, and that it is nowhere clear where a note on my change could be posted. The talk page was in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;oldid=1903255 this revision].

Further digging around in the history of the talk page has lead to the discovery that the user has been a subject of arbitration in [[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4_vs._SBJohnny]]. My reading [[Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4_vs._SBJohnny/Plaintiff_Charges]] has confirmed my impression of what the user was doing to ''C++ Programming''.

If ''C++ Programming'' Wikibook is to be brought to sanity, the foremost task is to prevent the user from further hijacking the talk page [[Talk:C++ Programming]], so that various editors can start posting their supporting and opposing posts on various subjects concerning the book. It is essential that posts to that talk page are allowed to remain there for an extended period of time, such as several months. Archiving should only take place when the page becomes too long.

Panic2k4 has complained about my edits on [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Adrignola&amp;oldid=2294755 the talk page of Adrignola] at 02:28, 31 March 2012.

This post of mine seems best posted to my talk page, as this is the only page over which I exercise extensive editorial control, a page from which posts cannot be removed by user Panic2k4 or any other rogue editor. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 12:46, 31 March 2012 (UTC)

==Saylor.org Textbooks==
Hi Dan, I've noticed that you have made significant contributions to the [[Rhetoric and Composition]] textbook as well as the [[C++ Programming]] book. I have been working with the [http://www.saylor.org/about/ Saylor Foundation] to produce new textbooks on these subjects. If you have time and are interested we would love for you to check out our book pages ([[Saylor.org's English Composition]] and [[Saylor.org's C++ Programming]]) and possibly make some contributions! --[[User:Azin|Azin]] ([[User talk:Azin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Azin|contribs]]) 19:54, 31 May 2012 (UTC)

== Article Edit in [[Windows_Batch_Scripting]] ==
Is there any particular reason why you removed some of the Links like [[w:cmd.exe|cmd.exe]] in [[Windows_Batch_Scripting]]? --[[User:Albin77|Albin77]] ([[User talk:Albin77|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Albin77|contribs]]) 05:14, 15 February 2013 (UTC)
: I think Wikibooks should only rarely link to Wikipedia from the middle of the text. Each Wikibook should be standalone, independent of Wikipedia for the content. The reader should not need to go to Wikipedia to get a clarification. If a clarification is needed, the Wikibook should provide it directly. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 19:57, 15 February 2013 (UTC)
:: I agree (apart from the consideration to write for &quot;a reader&quot; if you dont specify him/her for example by his knowledge, otherwise long arguments might occure). But did you consider the link not containing required information to understand the paragraph but containing a shourtcut for a source for the purpose of further reading, for whatever reasons the reader might have to acuire further knowledge? For me it's nice to have a direkt link to at least one other source, which you can access directly before searching the internet. If the text is understandable without the link, it does no harm, or dont you want delete it for another reason?  If it's not understandeble, maybe it's better to take out that piece of information altogehter, move it to a different area in the book or into the discussion section etc. If you decide to leave it anyway, and I'm the reader I would appreciate a link with info that helps me to understand it. Anyway, just wanted to offer you a second perspective, if you want to consider one. --[[User:Albin77|Albin77]] ([[User talk:Albin77|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Albin77|contribs]]) 22:37, 15 February 2013 (UTC)
:: PS. currently I very busy, so if I dont answer write a note on my discussion page, then I'll get an email.

== Pidgin 2 ==

Note to myself and whoever cares to read: I have recreated [[Pidgin]] page with new content.

== [[Python programming]] ==

Please explain what in particular you are not happy with.  And actually I contributed to Programming Python all the way back in 2006.  I suppose what makes me entitled is the same thing that makes you entitled.  Programing Python in particular is actually a bit of mess.  I am working on organising it basis of not knowing python, and building incrementally on previous topics.  I do not think I have turned anything 'upside down' and if you would like to have a conversation about organisation, I would be more than happy to.  

I also suggest you should use a more conciliatory tone.  What makes you entitled to use such an abrasive tone? I'm on the IRC channel if you would care to discuss.

::Your did you not respond entirely.  Your attitude is shocking.  Programming Python *IS* a mess.  Decorators are talked about Classes.  The navbars do not link between articles.  The text page basically talks about strings.  And my favourite, there is a section called 'Intro': Intro is not even a word.  And I almost forgot about the Discussion pages: I archived what seemed me as no longer relevant.  Capitalisation is inconsistent.  The list goes on and on.  What gives you right to revert improvements?  I would be happy to discuss if you took a more cooperative tone.  I do not contend that my view is gospel, but it is very peculiar why you are being so hostile.  Please explain.

Your edits today seem to be very disruptive.  I understand that there are differences between editors of this book but that is not the way to sort out your differences (constantly reverting and undoing).  I have reverted one of your edits while others I will leave for the other editors of the book to address and undo if they wish.  I'd suggest you consult the other editors more.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:04, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
: I don't believe my edits were &quot;very disruptive&quot;. They were not disruptive at all, IMHO. I reverted changes made by user Hackbinary that are not based on consensus and are opposed by me. Your revert in [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Python_Programming/TalkNav_Start&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=2638336 diff] in [[Template:Python Programming/TalkNav Start]] is hard to understand; the template is entirely pointless and should ideally be deleted. Since user Hackbinary has nothing of substance to contribute yet pushes his way in matters of taste, he should ideally be blocked from editing the pages under dispute. There is absolutely no reason why an editor with nothing of substance to contribute should be allowed to engage in an edit war with an editor with substantive contribution and get his way in matters of taste. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 17:35, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:What you say may be true.  I really don't know much about the book's subject or the history of the problems but it seems courteous to at least leave a message on the user's talk page if you plan on reverting their edits.  If you wish to get further opinions on this then you should post a notice in the Reading Room.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:12, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:: I do not think it good or productive to leave a message on the user's talk page when reverting the user's changes. Doing so is not a common practice on Wiktionary, my home wiki; is it a common practice on Wikibooks? When you are doing a revert, are you usually notifying the user? If so, can you post some diffs of such behavior of yours? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 17:32, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:: You will find that the majority of times I revert changes I leave a message on the talk page.  Generally only IP edits are reverted and if I am reverting several hours later then I may not leave such a message.  I don't usually revert logged-in users' edits instead editing them in some way.  I think that I leave messages far more often that other active users and there is no policy on this but I would consider it to be polite to do so especially when reverting a regular user's edits.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:24, 28 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

The Wikibooks community [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/General&amp;oldid=1087292#Consensus_check decided] to allow [[WB:ADMIN|administrators]] to grant and revoke the patroller and rollbacker permissions. For administrator, bureaucrat and CheckUser access, see [[Wikibooks:Administrators]]. For bot access, see [[Wikibooks:Bots]].

Admins have the trust of the community, and use their discretion when granting or revoking these rights. Requests are made at [[WB:RFP]], where any admin can grant the right if they choose to. Declined requests should be explained and archived for later perusal. Granted requests will be logged at [[Special:Log/rights]], and may be archived into the history.

The following are very loose &lt;s&gt;guidelines&lt;/s&gt; ideas for granting and revoking the tools - they are ''not a big deal''. Admins are responsible for making good decisions regarding which users get the tools. Admins are absolutely not to wheel war with user rights - those admins which do will not be permitted to change user rights.

==Rollbacker==
#User understands and applies [[Help:Editing#Rollback|rollback]], [[Wikibooks:Dealing with vandalism]] and [[Wikibooks:New page patrol]]
#User is a vandal fighter and currently reverts incorrect edits
#User has not edit warred
#User has no history of blocks
#User has not had +rollback revoked (admin discretion on whether to give another chance)

==Process for revoking rights==
;For +rollbacker
:User gets one warning, then +rollbacker is revoked on the spot by any admin</text>

=== “Havvy” (Spy), July 4, 1901 ===

[[Image:deHavilland_RS_Vanity_Fair_1901-07-04.jpg|thumb|right]]''When a boy at Eton he so successfully concealed his skill as an oar behind many eccentricities of style that he found no place in the Eton Eight; but at Oxford he suddenly developed, or else his hidden merits were quickly discovered by a perspicacious coach:  for he twice rowed in the Dark Blue Eight before he was chosen President of the O.U.B.C.  Then he went to Wellington for a schoolmaster:  whence he migrated to Eton eleven years ago.  At Eton he turns out good oars and employs his leisure moments in teaching the young idea to shoot.  Since he began to coach the Eton Eight they have carried off the Ladies’ Plate at Henley for seven successive years; and although they were disgracefully beaten last year, he hopes this week to begin a new series of Etonian victories.  He is a young man in the forties, who although he has been a pedagogue for fifteen years, is neither narrow-minded nor pedantic; but being one of the cheeriest and most unconventional of “beaks” he is quite popular with all good fellows, including both his contemporaries and the more difficult tribe of boys.  He is a good all-round sportsman who can shoot and ride, while his military aspect is the envy of the other Officers of the Eton Volunteers.  He is an admirable coach who has turned out many brilliant oars; there is no more welcomed or more nervous man at Henley; he is a bold and almost reckless tow-path horseman; and he is known to all Etonians, past and present, as “Havvy.”''

Reginald Saumarez de Havilland (1861-1921) rowed with D.H. McLean at Eton, winning the Trial and Upper Eights in 1880.  At Oxford he won the University Pairs for Corpus Christi and was in the Boat Race crews of 1882 and 1883, despite a lifelong affliction with asthma.  “He was said to have had the roundest back and the strongest blade of all men of his day; his muscles were like iron, and were laid on his shoulders and back in great slabs, which caused the apparent roundness.”{{ref|Times}}  He was president of the O.U.B.C. in 1884, succeeded by D.H. McLean.  

After a stint at Wellington, de Havilland returned to Eton in 1889 as a House Master and, according to the Eton Boating Book, “was almost at once invited to coach the Trial Eights.”{{ref|EBB}}  He took over the Eight in 1893 from S.A. Donaldson, who found “[h]is method of dealing with the boys differ[ent] from the Warre tradition in the fact that he trains them as if they were men, and is not content with a marked beginning and a lively recovery, and the ‘swing, swing together’ of the Eton Boating Song.”{{ref|Donaldson}}  “Havvy” preserved Warre’s fixed-seat orthodoxy while increasing the slides to fifteen inches and layering on Muttlebury’s style for rowing on them.{{ref|Drinkwater}}   “The principles of both [fixed and sliding seats] are the same,” he wrote in a 1913 pamphlet for Eton junior coaches.  “The slide is merely an artifice for lengthening the stroke.”{{ref|RSdH}}  Although de Havilland never himself competed at Henley, he coached Eton to eleven victories in the Ladies’ Plate over a twenty-six year career, including a seven-year run starting in 1893 with H.G. Gold at stroke.  “Apart from his technical skill in shaping an oarsman and welding together the crew,” recalled The Times, “in which he carried on the torch of Edmond Warre, he had an unrivalled power of keeping them cheerful and dispelling the young oarsmen’s nervousness by his fatherly care of them during the trying ordeal of Henley Week.  This must have won many races, besides laying the foundation of lifelong friendships.”{{ref|Times2}}  He retired in 1920 and died the following year of heart failure.

=== The 1884 Torpids ===
Nearly all &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; rowing coverage concerned the Boat Race or, in lesser proportion, Henley Regatta.  Yet occasionally the odd article about the Oxford or Cambridge college races would slip in, such as this one (March 1, 1884) on the Torpids featuring a Corpus crew coached by de Havilland:

[[Image:Oxford_Eights_week_photo_c1900.jpg|thumb|rights|350px|Oxford Eights week, c. 1900]]''The Torpids came to an end at Oxford on Wednesday, after the usual six days’ racing.  The Corpus boat kept the headship with unexpected ease.   They are a strong, rough lot of hard workers, and, “form” being more necessary  in the Torpids -- rowed as they are in clinker boats against a rapid stream -- than in any other races, their strength told.  University fell every night, and finished in the disgraceful position of nineteenth boat.  Wadham won five places, making two bumps on the last day.  But the event of the races was the success of the despised Jesus men.  Ever since the memorable year when the Jesus coach was heard to scream in despair from the tow-path to his College eight, “You’re all rowing very bad but five:  and five is rowing d____d bad,” the Welshmen have consistently remained at the “bottom of the river;” but at last their pluck is rewarded.  They have risen three places, and amongst their victims is St. John’s; and they would have bumped University had the races lasted two days longer.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== McLean, Douglas Hamilton == 

=== “Ducker” (Spy), April 8, 1897 ===
[[Image:McLean_DH_Vanity_Fair_1897-04-08.jpg|thumb|right]]''A few years after his birth -- which happened some seven-and-thirty years ago in Australia -- he came to England to learn; but being an insubordinate little fellow he disagreed with seven or eight Head Masters before he was disciplined by the strong right arm of the Lower Master at Eton.  So soon as he could swim he took to the river and studied the theory of rowing with a strength and solemn industry that presently made him so proficient on it that he rowed in three Eton eights.  Then he went to New College, and continued to row so well on the higher reaches of the Thames that he was sent to Putney to row against Cambridge.  This happened five times; and he is said to have once lost the race by breaking his oar at a critical moment.  Since then, as coach, he has made many other oars; and it is not too much to say that the last five Dark Blue victories are more or less due to his knowledge of the art of rowing and his facile readiness to impart that knowledge to others.''

''His chief occupation is coaching:  but when he is otherwise employed he lives in Somersetshire; where it is hard to communicate with him because he is remarkably averse from opening his letters.  He has, however, played cricket for his county, and he has shown himself a smart wicket-keeper.  He is also a fair shot, a very painstaking billiard-player, and a dignified person, who is equally imperturbable whether he is sitting as a Justice of the Peace or watching a close boat race.''

''He has been seen smoking a cigarette.''

Douglas Hamilton McLean (1863-1901) rowed for Eton, New College, Oxford, Oxford Etonians, and Leander over a ten-year career before becoming a highly-regarded coach.  (For &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; to tease that coaching was “his chief occupation” suggests its familiarity with the ARA’s restrictive definition of amateur, which excluded anyone “employed in or about boats.”)  McLean’s success was not a foregone conclusion, for although he “had shown considerable promise in Lower Fours and Lower Eights [and] sat up well in a boat,” recalled G.C. Bourne of his Eton days, McLean “was astonishingly clumsy in wrist and shoulder action.  For a long time I thought that he never would make an oarsman . . . .”{{ref|Bourne}}  By the end of the 1882 season, McLean had won the Trial Eights once (at 12 stone 8, with R.S. de Havilland exactly two stone lighter), the House Fours and School Pulling twice, the Upper Eights three times, and was second Captain of Boats.

[[Image:Cigaros_Primeros_Superiores_cigar_box_graphic_w_oars_1890.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cigar box with rowing motifs, c. 1890]]At Oxford McLean won the University Pairs for New College in 1885 and 1886, the same years he was O.U.B.C. President, and went head of the river in 1887.  He was Captain of Leander in 1888.  He rowed in five Boat Races, winning in 1883 and 1885.  Although Cambridge won in 1884 by three lengths, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (April 12, 1884) found McLean “by far the best oar of the sixteen engaged, and is the best that has rowed in this race -- always excepting West -- for three years.”  Yet McLean never had much success at Henley.  He won the Ladies’ in 1882 with Eton and the Goblets in 1885 with his brother, Hector, but came up emptyhanded for the Grand despite six attempts.  T.A. Cook recalled one moment of off-the-water drama involving McLean at Oxford in 1885:  

''Benson had brought one of his companies down, at that time, to act Othello in the old theatre; and Miss Featherston-haugh as Desdemona was so ravishingly beautiful that when she was smothered in her night-gown an audible shudder went through all the spectators, and a tall  man in front of me stood up and suddenly fainted.  It was D.H. McLean, then President of the O.U.B.C., as I recognised when he was being taken out in the fresh air and a small undergraduate followed the procession carrying his gold spectacles.  I hope the curtain had by then descended, for I am sure nobody looked at anything except “Dukker.”''{{ref|Cook}}

Following his appearance in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;
, McLean went over to Cambridge at the request of W. Dudley-Ward to help turn around their program in 1898 and 1899.  In the South African war he commanded the 69th Sussex Company Imperial Yeomanry, and died of colitis in Johannesburg on February 8, 1901, becoming the only rower of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; to die in that conflict.

=== The 1887 Boat Race:  McLean’s Broken Oar ===
McLean was in India during the early Oxford trials.  On returning he, “god-like, severed the ''nodus Dei vindice dignus''{{ref|Latin}} by ousting Williams from No. 7 almost at the eleventh hour,” reported &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (March 19, 1887), predicting an Oxford victory.   “[He] is a born oar, and seems to row as well after his voyage from India as though he had been in the boat from the beginning.”  In the event, Oxford lost because McLean cracked his oar, which led to Ayling’s invention of the patented brass button to reduce strain on the shaft.{{ref|Drinkwater}}  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s account (April 2, 1887):

''Until the accident to Maclean’s oar crippled the Oxford Eight just after Barnes Bridge, we thought that our forecast of the Boat Race was going to be precisely fulfilled:  and had it not been for that cruel mishap, we firmly believe that Oxford would have reached the Ship before Cambridge.  So we believed from the start.  It seems a little ungracious thus to detract from the glory of the Light Blue victory but it is only justice to the vanquished.  Look at the race.  The Cantabs started off at two strokes to the minute more than Oxford; they had the better station; they had, as the event well showed, the better coxswain.  Of course they took the lead.  But they did so to a great extent on sufferance, and certainly we have never seen a long stern race rowed with fewer symptoms of raggedness or flurry than this one was rowed by the Oxford crew.  For a quarter of an hour the leaders kept their lead, rowing the faster stroke all the time.  Then the pace began to tell, the boat travelled more slowly, and the oar-blades began to strike irregularly.  All this time their rivals were rowing steadily through the worst of the weather, and at Thorneycroft’s they were naturally two clear lengths to the bad.  Then Titherington quickened slightly, and his men keeping well together, the gap began to decrease, until at Barnes Bridge there were not five yards of daylight between the two boats.  Now came the favouring bend of the river, and Oxford gained faster.  Just as their nose levelled with the other boat’s rudder came the crack.  Maclean’s (No. 7’s) oar floated away in two pieces, and the race was over.  Had it not been for this, Oxford must, we think, have passed their opponents, had not the latter been able to spurt strongly; and this we do not believe they could have done.  As it was, they did their best, and were quite unable to finish strongly, gaining only a length and a-half in the last 500 yards from their crippled rivals.''

''Now, the Oxford stroke meant to make this effort after Barnes Bridge.  Oxford knew that they would then have the bend in their favour, as well as comparative shelter from the wind; and they knew they had the advantages of weight and better condition.  The last five minutes of the race must have been a grand spectacle, at any rate; and the Oxford Eight, “fresh as daisies,” were rowing so well, with such uniform swing and time, that no oarsman could have thought them beaten, when an unkind fate suddenly extinguished their chance.  There was, in fact, every chance of their rivalling the Cambridge win of last year, when the victors were led through Barnes Bridge to overhaul their leaders in the last quarter of a mile, if only Titherington had spurted.  Why did he not do so before?  Had he really quickened at any time after Hammersmith, Cambridge must have been beaten.  Neither of the crews were first-rate in quality; but Oxford were an average crew with a headless stroke, and he lost the race.  To ourselves it seemed that Maclean’s temper got the better of him because stroke would not quicken, and that a vicious tug at his oar caused its collapse; and there was good excuse for temper in a fresh crew, trying to row their rivals down, but kept from doing so by the slow stroke of the man upon whom they could not quicken.  This is  not the first time an “accident” of this kind has happened to an Oxford Eight.  In 1877 the Dark Blues were winning easily, when, just at the same spot, Cowles’s oar snapped.  The result then was the famous dead-heat.  On each occasion Oxford has lost a victory by the breaking of an oar.  But on this occasion Oxford would have led, if their stroke had quickened, long before Barnes Bridge.''

[[Image:Broken_oar_cast_aside_Tip_Top_Weekly_1900.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Casting aside the broken oar, Frank plunged overboard to lighten the Yale boat.&quot;]]	''Hint to the respective Presidents of the University Boat Clubs:  -- Don’t in the future row with new oars, which have only been tried during the last two days of practice, when no hard work is done.  Better an old and well-tried blade than a good-looking new one.  Oar-blades and sword-blades alike need strong tests before they can be relied upon, as recent events have more than proved of both.''

Guy Nickalls’ account from No. 2 in the Oxford crew:

''There was no doubt over the whole course that we were the faster crew, but Frank Wethered damned the whole outfit.  An hour before the race we rowed two minutes at 40 from the start.  Dissatisfied with the row, which was certainly scrambled, we were taken back to the start and made to row as hard as we could back to the Mile Post.  When we started the race an hour later I was dead to the world and stale, as were all the new blues.  Cambridge led us a length under Barnes Bridge and Titherington was holding his spurt.  We were on Middlesex shore, and, out of the corner of my eye, I could see the Cambridge cox bobbing back to us at every stroke.  Titherington began his spurt; back they came to us.  I was opposite their stroke; we knew the race must be ours and Holland yelled:  “It’s all right, we’ve got ‘em!”  Then, “Ducker” McLean broke his oar off short at the button.  With the station in our favour and him out of the boat we could have won even then, but “Ducker” funked the oncoming penny steamers and, instead of jumping overboard as he should have done, we had to lug his now useless body along, to lose the finish.  That was disappointing.  Titherington was a fine stroke.''{{ref|Nickalls}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== McKenna, Reginald == 

=== “In the Winning Crew” (Spy), October 31, 1906 ===
[[Image:McKenna_R_Vanity_Fair_1906-10-31.jpg|thumb|right]]''Mr. Reginald McKenna is a man who takes himself and his politics with becoming gravity.  He was educated in the first place privately, in the second at King’s College, London, and in the third at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he developed views on the science of oarsmanship, and was promoted to a seat in the Cambridge Eight of 1887.  He was, moreover, in the crews that won the Grand and Stewards’ Cups at Henley.  On leaving the University he was called to the Bar, but abandoned that profession on his election to Parliament.''

''As Honorary Secretary of the Free Trade Union it has been the peculiar pride of Mr. McKenna to keep an eye upon Mr. Chamberlain.  When in 1904 Mr. Austin Chamberlain proposed a tax that might have assisted the tobacco-stripping industry, Mr. McKenna was earnest in his efforts to aid foreign labour as against British workers, and finally forced Mr. Chamberlain to yield a rebate.  This notable achievement met its reward in his subsequent appointment as Financial Secretary to the Treasury.''

''He was, and in some manner still is, a disciple of Sir Charles Dilke.  He is popular with his own side, and behind his air of aggression is earnest and sensitive.  He has now an opportunity to tackle reforms in the Customs, a department where justifiable discontent exists in the subordinate ranks.  It has yet to be seen whether he is equal to the task.''

=== “The Universal Puzzle Is:  Find Mr. McKenna” (Owl), April 23, 1913 ===
[[Image:McKenna_R_Vanity_Fair_1913-04-23.jpg|thumb|right]]
''Mr. M’Kenna is not famous, we regret to say.  He has held some public offices.  True.  He has made failures therein.  Also true.  Too true.  Always.  Everywhere.''

''I do not wish to be personal in these notes.  Yet I cannot help feeling that if Mr. M’Kenna is famous (as some say) let the rest of us be infamous.''

''Mr. M’Kenna is entitled to be addressed as right hon.  My laundress is both right and hon.  But she cannot control votes.  So I think she would not figure largely as the head of the Board of Education, or as First Lord of the Admiralty, as [sic] as Secretary of the Home Office.  Neither did Mr. M’Kenna.  Let us pass all that, however.''

''Mr. M’Kenna was born, and yet the place and date escape me.  He bowed the Cambridge Eight in 1887.  Good work.  On the strength of this it was publicly stated that Mr. M’Kenna was qualified for the Admiralty.  More than this or that is needed to qualify Mr. M’Kenna.''

''However, Mr. M’Kenna has been kept in the public eye -- very much as a cinder might be -- irritatingly and intrusively.''

''Mr. M’Kenna suffers most from his friends.  His enemies would soon forget him.  It is a great pity that Mr. M’Kenna should have greatness thrust upon him, for he was not born great, nor has he achieved it.''

''Too bad.''

''Really, it is all too bad.''

In outline, [[w:Reginald_McKenna|Reginald McKenna]] (1863-1943) shadows C.W. Dilke, his mentor -- Trinity Hall scholar and athlete in the Leslie Stephen mold, oarsman, barrister, Liberal M.P., Cabinet Minister, statesman.  The outline differs mainly in Dilke’s bent toward literary and foreign affairs, versus McKenna’s in finance, an interest rooted in a youth of near-poverty due to his father having lost most of the family money in the “Overend Gurney” bank failure of the 1860s. 

Born days after Dilke’s first appearance at Henley, McKenna went up to Trinity Hall when [[w:Steve_Fairbairn|Steve Fairbairn]] was keeping Jesus College head of the Cam and C.W. Dilke was in the Foreign Office.  McKenna had the good sense to learn from both in turn.  Graduating in 1885 as the Senior Optime of the mathematical tripos, he stayed on to take an unofficial degree in rowing.  Fairbairn tutored McKenna on the river and in his rooms which featured a slide, a rigger, and a portion of an oar to practice endless chain movements.  “I was in Trinity Hall at 6 a.m. every morning with Bristowe and McKenna, teaching these turns in 1886,” Fairbairn recalled.{{ref|Fairbairn1}}  That year McKenna rowed in the Hall eight that wrested the headship from Jesus and won the Grand.  In 1887 he rowed in the Cambridge crew that pulled away from  Oxford when McLean’s oar broke, and at Henley he won the Stewards’, the Hall having its ''annus mirabilis'' by taking the Grand, Ladies’, Thames, and Visitors’ as well.   (Hoping for the club to repeat, which of course it did not, Dilke gave £100 to their Henley fund in April 1888 and earned a vote of thanks that carried by acclamation.){{ref|THBC}}  In securing the 1887 victories, the club history credits McKenna with teaching the crews to use long slides, as de Havilland would do at Eton several years later:

''[McKenna] thought out the whole theory of rowing afresh for himself, being helped not a little by his knowledge of physics.  Sooner than anyone at the Hall he realised that the Jesus crews were on the right lines in adopting  the long 15-inch slide, and he convinced Bristowe and Propert of this; but though the Jesus crew, the only crew rowing on long slides, kept Head in ‘84 with the greatest ease, the official style at the Hall, with a succession of Etonian captains, was still the Etonian short slide with the emphasis on “beginning” and body swing, and it was not till ‘86 that the long slide won its way into general use.''{{ref|Bond}}

[[Image:Trinity_Hall_Henley_group_1887.jpg|frame|Trinity Hall's ''annus mirabilis'' at Henley Regatta, 1887; McKenna seated second from right]]During the late 1880s McKenna was a rowing guest at Dockett Eddy of Dilke, who was then in political exile following the Crawford case.  McKenna failed in his first run for Parliament in 1892, when Dilke reentered for the Forest of Dean, but won in 1895 despite being a Liberal and represented North Monmouthshire thereafter to 1918.  Shortly after the 1895 election Dilke went on record to say, in paraphrase, that “any man of ordinary parts who stuck to his task day after day and night after night for ten years would find himself on the Treasury Bench at the end.”{{ref|McKenna}}  McKenna took the advice and proved it right, becoming Financial Secretary to the Treasury in 1905.  Indeed, by 1905 McKenna could look back on a decade of close political association with Dilke to “say without qualification that he owed more to Charles Dilke than to any other six men dead or living,” in the words of McKenna’s biographer.

[[Image:Crusoe_Dilke_and_Man_Friday_McKenna_Punch_c1900.png|thumb|right|400px|McKenna and Dilke, ''Punch'', c. 1900]]''Exact knowledge, unremitting industry, lucid expression:  these were lessons that he might indeed have learnt for himself, but it was at the house in Sloane Street that he had received his introduction to Liberal society and it was by Dilke that he had been taught -- perhaps for better, perhaps for worse -- to prefer logic and hard facts to rhetoric and emotion  . . . [and] the paramount importance of businesslike administration.''{{ref|McKenna2}}

McKenna became President of the Board of Education in 1907 (shortly after his first appearance in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;) and First Lord of the Admiralty in 1908, from which position as “a staunch disciple of Dilke’s naval policy”{{ref|Nichols}} he promoted the buildup of the British fleet, which proved prescient for the 1914-18 war.  In 1911 he moved to Asquith’s Home Office where in 1913 he had to decide whether to force-feed imprisoned women suffragists or let them starve to death, a Hobson’s choice he attempted to resolve by seeking and obtaining passage of the “Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill-Health) Act, 1913.”  Generally known as the “Cat and Mouse Act,” the law gave McKenna discretion to “license out” prisoners who were close to starvation (so that any continuation of their hunger strike was on their own heads), but also to revoke parole promptly for any new offense.  It pleased hardly anyody:  neither the suffragists, for it did not give them the right to vote and weakened the political impact of their in-prison hunger strikes; nor did it please their opponents, who viewed early release on these grounds as an affront to law and order.{{ref|McKenna3}}  McKenna’s second appearance in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; dates to that episode, in which the magazine, by then under Allinson’s uninspired hand and destined for absorption into &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Hearth and Home&lt;/span&gt;, came down vitriolically for the suffragists.

During the war McKenna began to shift out of politics to spend the remaining third of his life in finance.  As Chancellor of the Exchequer, he financed Britain in the war and at home, following the rule laid out in his 1916 budget speech:  “We never borrow a pound without making provision in advance by new taxation sufficient to cover both interest and a liberal sinking fund.”  After the war he chaired the committee appointed to locate German capital held abroad and retrieve it for reparations.  Shut out of the coalition government formed in late 1916, McKenna soon joined the Midland Bank, becoming its chairman in 1919 and holding that post until his death in 1943.  “[H]is annual expositions on banking problems at the Midland Bank’s general meetings came to be regarded as one of the events of the banking year,” wrote the Times. “But he had many critics.  Though in fact a kindly and genial being, his manner, as the House of Commons had noted an an earlier date, was apt to be donnish.”  Lord Beaverbrook wrote that McKenna “likes to assert his view, and if you run against some projecting bump in his opinions you must merely nurse a bruise,” while an unnamed M.P. reportedly quipped that McKenna’s chosen epitaph would be:  “I WAS RIGHT.”{{ref|McKenna4}}

=== Early Fairbairnism ===
When [[w:Steve_Fairbairn|Steve Fairbairn]] of Melbourne, Australia came up to Jesus College, Cambridge in 1881, he had already formed definite views on rowing.  His eldest brother had also been up to Jesus and, coming back in 1877, stroked the Melbourne Rowing Club and the first winning Inter-State crew.  When asked, “Why don’t you row in the Varsity style?” he said:  “Because others can’t, and you will find [the Melbourne] style is better when you get into it.”  Steve Fairbairn thus came to Cambridge, “prepared to find the Varsity style not to perfection,” and indeed found as a freshman in the Blue boat “the coaching for style very bad.”  In reaction, at Jesus he not only rowed in but coached the May boat (which went head of the river 1875-85), telling the man who nominally had the job:  “Do you mind not speaking to the crew; your talking is upsetting their rowing.”  He rowed in the Boat Race 1882, 1883, 1886, and 1887, on the last occasion with Reginald McKenna. While Fairbairn’s major mark on English rowing came after his return from Australia to Jesus in 1904, where his coaching became progressively revered, it seems fair to infer that he taught McKenna in 1886 much of what he shared a half century later with the rest of the world in &lt;u&gt;Chats on Rowing&lt;/u&gt; (1934):

''Rowing like everything else is a religion, and I fancy oarsmen at times have been in the same frame of mind as the Scotch Meenister who after playing a bad round of golf said to his partner, “I must give it up.”  “What!  gi’e oop the gawf?”  “Na, na, gi’e oop the meenistry.”  Oarsmen and coaches are very apt to coach for too much length, for showy body form, thereby breaking the rhythm, or worshipping the golden calf.  The rhythmical movements of the good oarsman are not showy; they are all smooth and easy and machine-like.  The better the oarsman the longer and harder he rows, but the less do his movements show.  Trying to row too long breaks the rhythm and ruins the oarsman.''

. . . .

''[The oarsman] must go in for no showy movement.  He must not try for any exaggerations.  He must meet his stretcher fair and square.  In fact, rowing is summed up in the saying:  AS YOU MEET YOUR STRETCHER SO YOU MEET YOUR GOD.  And this applies to every walk in life.  If an oarsman sees that he does his best to propel the boat the next stroke, he will be doing his best to propel far more than the boat.''

. . . .

''Teaching to shoot the slide or to bend the back or to go for any point would be fatal, and there is a tendency to do this now, especially to shoot the slide.  Coaches must stick to concentrating the oarsman on working the oar to move the boat, and so get an endless chain movement.''

. . . .

''Probably every oarsman, when starting, thinks the stroke is a lot of separate movements; first a direct backward movement, a stop with the weight sitting on the seat, while the oar is taken out of the water, then the hands away, and then swing forward.  No doubt this was the thought of the old text-books, with their “drop the hands down, bring the oar out and then feather,” having by the way rowed the oar in, to touch the chest.  All hopelessly wrong; a collection of stops, and angular movements, instead of an endless chain, rounded, spinning movement, running one stroke into the next with no check.''

. . . .

''The best way to coach is to have two crews, and let the second crew keep in front of the first boat.  The best coach in the world is the bows of a faster boat moving behind a crew; it keeps them concentrated.''

. . . .

''Also the first rule in coaching is:  keep your mouth shut.  Have patience and get the crew keen, and improvement will come from the daily row conditioning the muscles, through the unconscious action of the Subjective Mind which has free play with the keen but silent coach.  Telepathy will pass his thought to the crew.''

. . . .

''As I frequently say, a man is a better oarsman after ten years than after five, the reason is that these movements that I am advising take a very long time to become a stereotyped part of the oarsman’s movements, owing to his not understanding, and consequently not practising, them.  Mileage makes champions, because the whole muscular system has to be conditioned.  One must not think that by learning watermanship through these exercises that nothing more is needed.  He will still require plenty of honest, long, hard work.''

. . . .

''The straight path to peace and contentment in rowing is to be got by eliminating all rush, worry, anxiety, and fear, and this is done by unscrewing the tension nut.  When the machines for shearing sheep came into use in Australia there was a tension nut, and when anything went wrong the shearers would screw up the tension nut, and so I suppose put more effort into the machine, and so when anything goes wrong in a boat the oarsman stiffens himself and increases the tension, and so spoils his rowing.''

. . . .

''There is an old saying that one should always practise the three C’s, “Keep Quite Cool,” and if every oarsman did that always, each would be doing his best, there would be no tension, and the faces would all be quite placid, and then they would be able to keep quite calm, cool, and collected (the five K’s).''

=== “''A Puritan’s Wife''” (Spy), February 4, 1897 ===
[[Image:Pemberton_M_Vanity_Fair_1897-02-04.jpg|thumb|right]]''Though he is but three-and-thirty years of age, he is an old Merchant Taylor; who took a Mathematical Scholarship, broke his arm, resigned the Honour, and went up to Caius.  He might by this time have been a dull Mathematician, with a glorious record put by in the secret places of Cambridge; but he had too much in him to become the slave of an exact science.  So he rowed and trifled alternately, till “Jelly” Churchill asked him to take the seventh oar in the Light Blue Eight:  which he declined to do, but took his degree and came to town.  One day he passed the office of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, and a bright idea struck him.  He walked in, and was shown a speaking-tube.  Through that channel he boisterously offered a contribution, which became the first of many.  That was ten years ago; and that bright idea made him.  He quickly developed literary tastes, and when he had done much fugitive work another idea struck him.  The House of Cassell felt it too; and the combination resulted in the boys’ paper which is called Chums.  That led to “The Iron Pirate”; which earned for its author the style of the “Jules Verne of England.”  But there are other pirates; and the Americans (according to one of their own papers) bought seven hundred thousands stolen copies of his:  which has made him very careful in the matter of transatlantic copyright.  Since then the story has been translated into four languages -- besides American and Russian.  A year later he published “Sea Wolves”; and last year he wrote “The Impregnable City.”  Then he began to edit Cassell’s new “Pocket Library,” and contributed to it “The Little Huguenot.”  He has since published “A Puritan’s Wife”; and his “Christine of the Hills” is expected “in a few days.”  Besides all this he contributes light literature to a dozen journals and magazines; he reviews books for ''The Daily Chronicle''; he has furnished several theatres with curtain-raisers; he has produced an Opera in New York; he has edited an important volume on Football; he runs &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Cassell's Magazine&lt;/span&gt;; and fills up the odd corners of his time with telling and writing stories -- more or less vain.''

''He is a very cheery, busy, active, volatile, nervous man, who has a pretty wit, an admirable wife, and a fund of excitable imagination.  He is restless, full of energy, and the owner of a ringing voice which has been used to advantage on the towpath.  Yet he wears a very decided chin under his good looks, and professes to be a judge of champagne.  He was once ready to write for ordinary rates; but now he commands high prices.  He has many friends; he is fond of all sport, owns an array of “pots” for each of which he has run, likes riding, and plays the host well.''

''He can sing a comic song with a voice which no pianoforte can drown.''

[[w:Max_Pemberton|Max Pemberton]] (1863-1950) rowed for Caius in the 1884 Ladies’ and Visitors’, losing to Muttlebury’s Eton eight in a heat of the former.  “The Caius first boat did fairly well during the two years I rowed in it,” Pemberton recalled, “and the excursion to Henley was a merry business even though we brought back no medals”:

''Our luck certainly was not good, but our spirits were high.  We might have won the Visitors’ had not the umpire’s launch stopped suddenly on the way to the post and mangled the bows of our four horribly.  In the Ladies’ we ran up against one of the heaviest Eton Eights that ever rowed at Henley.  While we averaged a little more than ten stone a man, they must have made nearly twelve, and they beat us handsomely.  Well do I remember an old Irish woman who stood on the Bridge as we passed under, humiliated by defeat, and who cried down to us:  “Arrah, and aren’t yez ashamed yerselves to be baten by the little boys.”  We certainly were not, all things considered.''{{ref|Pemberton1}} 

In 1886, Pemberton’s last year on the Cam, his crew held their place on the river but lost their heads at the bump supper (“which we persisted in holding at Caius whether we were among the bumpers or the bumped”):

''In the May term nobody did any work and all the rowing men were exceedingly intoxicated after the bump supper.  In my last year, our own First boat merely kept its place and there was little excuse for a riot.  But Leverton Harris’s rich papa asked the Eight to dinner at the Bull, and by each man’s plate he caused a magnum of champagne to be set.  The effect was a little unfortunate, as we had in the College at that time an obstinate and mistaken fellow who had refused to stand up in chapel when God Save the Queen had been sung upon an occasion of rejoicing.  As one man the Eight rose after dinner and made a bee line for the offender’s rooms . . . collecting other Eights as they went and singing the National Anthem with vigour.  Fortunately for the rebel, he had been warned that something of the kind might happen and his oak was both barred and bolted.  So the mob could merely stand upon his staircase, howling and singing in stentorian tones and wholly defying the poor little Dean, who begged them to be good.''

''Far from being good, they did, I fear, but deride that admirable Doctor of Divinity.  In my mind’s eye, there is a picture of the stroke of a lower boat, standing on the landing above and endeavouring to drop soda-water bottles on the head of the learned ecclesiastic below.  And every time he let the bottle go he cried:  “God save the b____y Dean”; a prayer of doubtful meaning, all the circumstances being considered.''{{ref|Pemberton2}}

When &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; featured Pemberton in 1897, he was ten years into a career of journalism and light literature.  He edited &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Cassell's Magazine&lt;/span&gt; until 1908, publishing about a novel a year on the side.  He then turned to farcical comedy that was then in demand and became well-known in theatre and knighted in 1928.  “At the Garrick he always had people around him, for he was well liked and welcome at any table,” wrote a friend to the ''Times''.  “He was full of reminiscences and had a tremendous memory for faces, having something interesting to say about almost everybody.”

=== Punts Amuck ===
When the Henley Stewards revised the course in 1886 they installed piles to mark it, but nothing to keep the growing armada of spectators at bay, who grew so thick in the days before motorcars that one could practically walk shore to shore on one pleasure boat to another.  “The press of craft led to many cheerful scenes,” Pemberton wrote in his autobiography, “ladies even deigning to hit other ladies with paddles and boathooks and men to personal combat of a violent kind.”{{ref|Pemberton3}}  From time to time this melée left the official oarsmen with no room to row, despite the efforts of watermen employed to keep the course clear, as happened to Guy Nickalls in the 1887 Diamonds:

[[Image:Punts_at_Henley_between_races_1914.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Henley course between races, 1914]]''In the final I met J.C. Gardner.  This was the first Jubilee year, and the Royal Party sat in launches on the Berkshire side of the river about a hundred yards below the winning-post.  When I was about one and a half lengths down on Gardner the crowd of boats swarming round the royal launches left room only for the man on the Bucks shore to get through.  I was allowed to crash into the Royal Party and smashed my scull and boat and left Gardner to finish alone.  The Princess of Wales, through Mrs. W.H. Smith (afterwards Lady Hambleden), sent me a kind, sympathetic note of condolence and trusted I was not hurt, but the Henley Committee never gave me a chance to re-scull the race.''{{ref|Nickalls}} 

As the problem of punts grew with the popularity of the regatta, it became a regular subject of Woodgate’s annual Henley commentary for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; in the 1890s.  “There were, if possible, more small craft than ever, and worse handled than ever, running amuck and quite devoid of watermanship. . . . It is intolerable that any cripple of a Cockney should be let loose for the day to do more damage that he is worth by incompetency to handle a common tub.”  (1892)  “There will always be congestion on the course and difficulties in clearing so long as the Conservancy are supine in enforcing their veto against pleasure boats mooring to piles in the course. . . . .  [Most] are largely made up of bounders and counter-jumpers on the spree.  These creatures coolly tie up and loll in their boats, blocking the passage and enjoying the nuisance which their lubberly conduct produces.”  (1896)  But his finest, longest salvo was July 18, 1895:

''The incompetence, and in many instances truculence, of non-rowing club cripples in the crowds on the reach becomes more marked each year.  It would not be a bad idea for the Thames Conservancy to place some limit upon the presence of these adventurers:  for example, in the case of persons not members of some recognised Club that competes, regularly or periodically, at Henley, to require a fee for a “license” to row or paddle on the reach during Regatta hours.  It would thin the mob, and have a tendency to man boats with competent hands.  “Keel to the current” is a maxim with all habitués when moving or halting; but duffers think nothing of sprawling broadside to the stream, blocking passage, and thus tangling a dozen or more passers-by in one knot of confusion.  Then, again, many of these loafers are devoid of good taste, as well as of watermanship.  Thus a brace of pariahs deliberately moored their punt, with ryepecked poles, in the middle of the Berks side-channel, just below the point -- (forming an “island” obstacle); and then lay down and amused themselves with watching the confusion which their obstruction occasioned.  Unfortunately, there was no specific by-law to meet and punish this act of rowdyism this year.  No one anticipated such gross misconduct; but next year, no doubt, Mr. Gough, the energetic Secretary of the Conservancy, will propound a rule and penalty to check such outrage.''

[[Image:Henley_regatta_race.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Henley course with piles and booms, 2004]]''One of the freaks of the normal Cockney on the spree at Henley is to lie in the bow of a progressing boat armed with a boat-hook, and to prod off with the spike all approaching craft, enjoying the fun of spearing timbers and ripping up carvels.  There were at least half-a-dozen such mischief-makers on the course this year.''


''“Punt paddling” should be stopped during Regatta hours.  A laden punt, thus propelled, cannot be “held” up sharply -- especially by the class of cripples who indulge in the trick -- when collision is imminent (unlike a row boat); it runs on like a battering-ram, and its iron-shod shelving prow sweeps destructively over gunwales and rowlocks of legitimate craft.  It is a form of navigation painfully on the increase, because it commends itself to the unskilfulness of the tyro, and can be learned in minutes, while it takes weeks to learn to punt and months to row decently.''

The Stewards cleared the course in 1899 by adding floating booms between the piles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Searle, Henry Ernest == 

=== “H. Searle/ Professional Champion Sculler of the World” (Spy), September 7, 1889 ===

[[Image:Searle_HE_Vanity_Fair_1889-09-07.jpg|thumb|right]]''When Beach, who was perhaps the finest sculler ever seen, had beaten Hanlan often enough to satisfy his ambition, he retired, and the Professional Sculling Championship of the World was claimed by Kemp, who in his turn twice defeated the once unbeaten Hanlan.  Then there arose a new sculler, a young Australian named Searle, and he having beaten Kemp, the World gained yet another Champion, whose Championship, together with some money, is staked upon the race which he will row with a Canadian named O’Connor on Monday.''

''Searle has a fine chest, but he sculls with a round back.  His form is not good, but his pace is remarkable.  He is a very decent young fellow of three-and-twenty years.''
	
English professional rowing grew out of wager matches sponsored by amateur gentlemen in the 1830s.  Though professionals both rowed and sculled, the greater prize money, and therefore fame, went to individual scullers whose past performance and present form were easier to handicap for gambling.  The necessary mix of money, talent, and interest was particularly strong in London, where the success of ad hoc wager matches and Doggett’s Coat and Badge led to the creation of a Championship of England sculling race in 1831, a year after the Wingfield Sculls were founded there for amateurs.  For many years only Londoners contested the Championship, its winners being taken into the service of the Royal Barge, but eventually it attracted local champions from Australia and North America and was renamed the Championship of the World.  Indeed, Australians held the title for twenty-two of the thirty-one years ending in 1907, starting with Edward Trickett in 1876.  Professional sculling peaked in England in the 1870s, while the young Thomas Eakins was painting the local champions of his native Philadelphia, but was still popular in 1889 when &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; featured Henry Ernest Searle (1866-89). 

As a professional and Australian, Searle stands apart from the other &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; rowers, to a man all Oxbridge or London amateurs.  Growing up on Esk Island in the Clarence River in New South Wales, the young Searle learned to row of necessity.  In addition to semiannual three-day journeys with his father to Grafton for supplies, Searle rowed seven miles a day to take himself, his brother, and sister to school -- early training a biographer later celebrated in verse:

[[Image:Henry_Searle_photo_1889.jpg|thumb|right]]:''Years rolled over all too placid,'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''When in boyhood calm and shy'' &lt;br&gt;
:''To the village schoolhouse lowly'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''Passed each morning wet or dry.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''Not as we have passed that journey,'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''Lagging every foot the way,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''But with feathered oar advancing'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''Back and forward twice a day.''{{ref|Bennett}} &lt;br&gt;

“[N]o doubt that laid the foundation for his pre-eminent position in the rowing world,” countryman Steve Fairbairn wrote to illustrate his axiom “Mileage makes champions.”{{ref|Fairbairn1}}  While Muttlebury and Nickalls were racing for Eton in 1884-85, Searle, who was a few months younger than “Muttle” and a few older than Guy, was taking on all comers on the Clarence.

By 1888, the time had come to try Sydney, which offered the best money, competition, and coaching in the land.  Backed by  John and Thomas Spencer, Sydney brothers who a decade earlier had backed Ned Trickett, Searle began his Parramatta campaign in a match against one Julius Woolf:

''Woolf had been defeated by Stanbury a fortnight earlier, so he was not much in favour with the betting public, and it looked as if Searle’s backers would have to be content with the bare prize-money.  John Spencer refrained from betting at all before the start of the race, and instructed Searle to hang back and “feel” Woolf in the early stages, and, as soon as he was sure of his man, to shake his head from side to side, but not to go in front until he got a sign from Spencer, who was in a boat following the race.''

''The race had barely started when Searle’s head was seen to wobble violently.  This caused loud laughter among those who had never seen Searle race before. They chaffed Spencer so unmercifully that he assumed a deliberately anxious look.  Meanwhile, his commissioners were snapping up every bet offered, with Woolf still leading and going great guns.  Suddenly Spencer waved a red handkerchief and in a hundred yards Searle was a length ahead, and the issue beyond doubt.''{{ref|Webb}}

In October the same year, Searle beat Peter Kemp, the then-reigning world champion, who the preceding month had defended the title against a former holder, the renowned Edward Hanlan of Canada.  Searle’s victory set him up to visit England in 1889 to face off against William O’Connor of Toronto, the North American champion, for the unprecedented purse of £1000.

Nickalls, en route to his third victory in the amateur Wingfield Sculls, met and trained with Searle that summer.  “We had many a long scull together on the tideway,” Nickalls recalled.  “An extremely nice man he was, too.  Powerful and rather on the heavy side, as he would be at that period of his practice, for it was two months before his race.  I . . . admired his sculling immensely, quite a different thing from the showing made by our other English professionals at that date.”{{ref|Nickalls}}  The chasm between amateur and professional perhaps fostered friendlier relations than they might have had, had there been any prospect of their competing in the same race.

Searle beat O’Connor handily but died less than three months later, having contracted typhoid fever on the ship returning to Melbourne.  “It was suspected that the heavy wagering on the race -- about £80,000 is said to have changed hands -- caused him to become the victim of foul play.”{{ref|Mansell}}  When his remains arrived in Sydney the whole city went into mourning, the crowd estimated at between one and two hundred thousand.{{ref|Bennett2}}  The local Sunday Times, in six long and dense columns describing the scene, declared that when “the white-winged spirit of the Champion floated upward towards the golden gates of the Jasper City,” the community felt that “a national loss had been sustained and that a calamity had overtaken our country.”{{ref|Sydney}}  A column in Searle’s memory erected in 1891 stands at the finish of the Parramatta course.

=== Professional Sculling ===
English professional sculling began to ebb in the 1870s, due partly to the greater prize money available in Australia and North America, but largely to its own “bad odor,” as decried in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (Feb. 18, 1888):

[[Image:Wallace_Ross_with_medals_1884.jpg|thumb|right|Wallace Ross, 1884]]''Though Monday last was an unpleasant day for the river, a huge crowd turned out to see the great Championship Professional Sculling race between Wallace Ross and Bubear.  Thousands, in their simplicity, expected to see a fine race.  The Englishman was said to be “fitter” than ever he had been before, and long odds were laid on him for the event, until just before the start, when the betting veered around to 5 to 4 on Ross.  For myself, I hoped against hope to see a race, but my prophetic soul told me I should not.  My prophetic soul was, as usual, right.  I saw a fiasco, as people who go nowadays to see races of this kind so often do.''

''Ross rowed right away from Bubear.  He started at forty to the minute.  When he had got a lead, he dropped into a paddle of twenty-six.  Bubear may have tried; but, if so, his trying is not worth much.  He was never in it after the first few yards, and Ross paddled home on a good tide, in shockingly bad time, as easy a winner as one could wish to see in any duffer’s race.''

''The disappointed public were very angry, and said many nasty things.  Journalists are, for particular reasons, less free-spoken; but though they may not say much, they think a good deal.  English professional sculling received a great blow on Monday last, from which it will not easily recover.  It has been in bad odour from some time past; and it will now be hard to re-excite interest in what is almost a ruined branch of sport; and I for one am not sorry for it.  I am sick of professional sculling; and it is certain that no one will be one whit the worse for its extinction, if it is to continue in its present circumstances.''

Just over a year later, with the prospect of Searle and O’Connor facing off in a “square” match, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (Sept. 7, 1889) took hope for professional sculling:

''Searle and O’Connor are to race over the tideway course on Monday, and all the sporting world will go out to see them.  The match is a remarkable one, if only by reason of the wonderful records that the competitors bring to these shores with them, Searle being the admitted successor to the once great Beach, and O’Connor having beaten every man of note in America.  It is also remarkable for its apparent genuineness.  Rightly or wrongly, every waterman and every follower of aquatics believes that the match will be “square,” and this is in itself enough to account for the large share of public interest that has centred upon the meeting.  To speak of the respective chances of the scullers is a little difficult, as we know so little of them when actually racing; and many a man who practises well has not the head or the heart to carry him through a big race.  In style -- and especially for a short distance -- O’Connor has the advantage; being a most pretty workman, save for the bad fault of letting his shoulders stand out at the finish.  The present champion, Searle, has a long, dragging stroke, holding his slide well with his legs, and maintaining the power well past the rowlock -- a style which is most telling over a long course.  Besides, he is a better built, and, I should say, a stronger, man than his opponent.  While, then, it must not be forgotten that O’Connor is a tremendous spurter, and is possessed of some amount of staying power, I am inclined to think that Searle will win, if the water be at all rough.  But it should be a close and exciting race.''

Professional sculling did continue into the twentieth century but had almost disappeared by the 1914-18 war.

So, maybe move this to the amsthm section.  I don't think it requires the amsthm package, but it does require some package.

[[Image:Autoblock.png|thumb|400px|An example of an autoblock causing collateral damage.]]
An '''autoblock''' is, as the name suggests, an automatic block of an [[w:IP address|IP address]] set by the [[m:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] software. Autoblocks are the result of an attempt to edit Wikibooks from an IP address  recently used by a blocked user. 

Each time a user edits Wikibooks, the IP address used to connect to the site is recorded by the MediaWiki software that powers Wikibooks. A log of IP addresses used by every user is kept privately, accessible only by users with [[m:checkuser|checkuser]] access to the MediaWiki software. When a blocked user attempts to edit the site, the IP from which they are editing is &quot;autoblocked,&quot; so that they may not make the same edit anonymously or under a different user name.

An administrator can disable autoblocking when blocking a user. This is done automatically by MediaWiki for common dynamic IP ranges such as those used by AOL. However, if an administrator is unaware that the user is editing from a dynamic IP pool, autoblocker is usually left enabled. Older indefinite blocks, dating from before the autoblock exemption whitelist and the option to disable when blocking, may also trigger autoblocks (while these can be fixed by unblocking and re-blocking the user, it is tedious to do so unless absolutely necessary). When this happens, users may be autoblocked as the result of a block on another user, often one using the same ISP, when they have personally done nothing wrong. This is referred to as &quot;collateral damage&quot;.

# User gets blocked
# User accesses site
# Software records IP address
# Software automatically blocks that IP address for 24 hours
# Any other IP address used by the blocked user is then blocked as well

There is an internal autoblock expiry time variable, which is set to 24 hours, meaning that autoblocks only last for 24 hours. However, in the case of dynamic IP pools, this may affect hundreds of users before the block expires. In the case of an indefinite block, autoblocks may continue to be set by the software weeks or months after the initial block has been set. (It is not uncommon to find autoblocks listed on [[Special:Ipblocklist]] where the initial indefinite block was issued in 2003 or 2004.) Users who find themselves autoblocked accidentally should contact the [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]] that issued the initial block and request an unblock. Unblocks may also be requested through your talk page by adding {{tlx|unblock|reason}}, or in the [irc://irc.freenode.net/wikibooks #wikibooks] IRC channel.

It is important for users to understand that administrators do not set autoblocks; once they have blocked a user with autoblocking enabled, autoblocks are set by the MediaWiki software. Autoblocks do not appear in administrators' block logs, and they are not notified of them. This is a necessary consequence of the need, stated in Wikibooks' [[foundation:privacy policy|privacy policy]], to keep logged-in users' IP addresses private. While the IP address responsible for every edit is recorded by the MediaWiki software, this cannot be accessed, even by administrators and even when the user is blocked. The only circumstances in which a user may be associated with an IP address are certain policy violations detailed by the [[m:Checkuser|checkuser policy]]; even then, access to the checkuser tool is granted only to a small group of trusted users, not administrators in general.

When IP addresses are autoblocked, they appear in [[Special:Ipblocklist]] (but not in the admin's block log) with a special mask that prevents the IP from being seen. Autoblocks register on [[Special:Ipblocklist]] and in the blocked user text with the name of the admin that set the original block, but that admin is not notified that a block has been placed. For example:

#Admin Susan blocks User:George for 24 hours. Unknown to Susan, George uses AOL to edit Wikibooks.
#User:Steven, who also uses AOL, signs on to Wikibooks, and is assigned the IP address last used by George.
#The MediaWiki software, detecting the use of the IP by Steven, and assuming it to be George, issues a 24 hour block in Susan's name. Susan is not notified of the block.
#Steven, misunderstanding the nature of an autoblock, angrily demands to know why Susan has blocked him.
#Much WikiDrama ensues.

It is helpful for all involved, especially AOL users, who are often chronically autoblocked by collateral damage, to remain patient and remember that it is the software, not the admin who is unfortunate enough to have his or her name appear on the block, who is responsible. Equally important is for admins to check [[Special:Ipblocklist]] regularly, and unblock all autoblocks from a particular user if more than two autoblocks are set in rapid succession. (If more than two IPs are autoblocked within seconds/minutes of each other, it is a good indication that it is a dynamic IP pool and the blocks are collateral damage.)

'''It is imperative, whether you post to your talk page or contact an admin via email, that you include the IP address or username that is reported in the block text, as the admin has no way of determining which IP is autoblocking you.'''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Muttlebury, Stanley Duff ==

=== “One of the Presidents” (Spy), March 22, 1890 ===
[[Image:Muttlebury_SD_Vanity_Fair_1890-03-22.jpg|thumb|right|400px]]''Born three-and-twenty years ago he became a “new boy” at Eton in the Easter Term of 1880; where, although he only took “Lower Middle,” he determined to make himself conspicuous.  So, being a big boy for his age, he donned “tails” and “shiny buttons,” and presently showed much promise as a “wet bob”; which he has since redeemed.  For, having successively won the Lower Boys Sculls and Pairs, he proceeded to develop into a rowing machine; and in that capacity he has since worked with fair regularity, breaking down much less often than the machinery of any of Her Majesty’s ships has been known to break down in any equal space of time.  He won the School Sculls at his second attempt, and he helped to win the Ladies’ Plate in 1885; after which he was reasonably welcomed to Cambridge, where rowing men were smarting under pretty frequent defeat on the tideway; and where he is now worshipped for four successive victories which he has helped achieve over Oxford.  He has won the Cambridge Pairs thrice, the Fours and the Sculls once, and last year he rowed in the Head Boat; while at Henley he has won the Goblets thrice and the Visitors’ once.  He still lives in hope of winning the “Grand,” as well as a fifth victory over the Isis men.  Yet he is not so good an oar as he was two years ago.''

''Like most machines he is adapted for one purpose only, and consequently he is not a brilliant scholar; yet he has a head which, it is currently reported, can stand more than that of any other man.  He is a fine swimmer, who has scored nearly as many pots in the water as he has on it; and he has upon occasion run at a good rate and played football with fitting violence.  He always likes to get a good start in a race, and rows better when he does so; yet he has never started before the word “Go” has been uttered.  He takes delight in tearing either side off a boat, for he can row on stroke or bow side.  He is a brilliant conversationalist, for in himself he has a never failing subject of conversation in which he is well posted; and he is the strongest man on earth (in a boat) as well as the most ugly.''

''He knows more of life in London than most men of double his age know, and he weighs fifteen stone when untrained.  He can tell stories, and he is supposed to be the most successful pot-hunter in England.''

''He personifies the triumph of matter over mind.''

“[U]ndoubtedly the greatest oar ever produced by Cambridge” and the first Cantab to win the Boat Race four times, Stanley Duff Muttlebury (1866-1933) appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; at the end of his third year as C.U.B.C. President and at the apex of his career, having captained Leander in 1889.  (He was the only VANITY FAIR rower to be shown in a boat -- with fixed pins, as swivels had not yet been accepted -- which he facilitated by letting Leslie Ward watch him practice rowing on the floor of his college room.){{ref|Ward}}  Muttlebury’s success came in part, as R.C. Lehmann wrote, from sheer strength:  “His blade sweeps through the water, as he swings his 13.10 / And pulls it all, and more than all, that brawny king of men.”  But success also came from effective use of a long slide, a refinement Muttlebury developed in the mid-1880s at Trinity College while Reginald McKenna was doing the same next door at Trinity Hall, both with the help of Steve Fairbairn.  In the resulting debate between “orthodoxy” and “Fairbairnism,” which flared again fifty years later in The Times, R.P.P. Rowe, the younger brother of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s G.D. Rowe, pointed to “Muttle” as the exemplar of both styles:

''Muttlebury had a natural aptitude which amounted to genius for rowing, and, as he was not only massively large and full of courage but herculean in muscular strength, it was inevitable that he should be an outstanding exponent of oarsmanship.  Added to this, he came to his prime when rowing was in a transitional stage, when the old methods of the straight back and the body catch, suited to the fixed seat and the short slide, had necessarily to be superseded by methods required by the long slide.  I consider that long-slide rowing sprang suddenly to perfection in Muttlebury, that on him this new (or partially new) art was built, and that if he could be rowing at his best today there would be an end of any conflict of styles.  At any rate, every one would agree “this is how to row, if one can somehow learn it”; the only question left would be how best to learn it.  Personally I claim his rowing to have been orthodoxy at its best; I have never in the last 40 years thought of orthodoxy in any other sense.''{{ref|Times}}

To Muttlebury’s strength and style might be added his sang froid, which one of his Third Trinity teammates recalled from the 1888 University Fours:

''In the University Fours in November, 1888, Third Trinity was drawn with Emmanuel.  Both crews had done fast times in practice, and in the race they were level at Ditton.  Here, rounding the corner, the Third Trinity boat gave a lurch, and Muttlebury, who rowed three and steered, found to his consternation that his sliding seat was jammed and was absolutely immovable.  Quick as thought he tucked the loom of his oar under his left arm, turned half round, and after two attempts wrenched the seat off the slides and threw it overboard.  The other three oars, not knowing exactly what was wrong, continued to paddle on briskly.  “Muttle,” now seated low down on the slideway, started to row again, but at the second stroke, owing to the strain caused when he pulled out the seat, the steering lacing gave way at his foot.  Calling out “Paddle on, you chaps,” he calmly stopped rowing, leant forward, and carefully secured the steering lace.  Then, after dipping his right hand in the water overside, he cried out, “Now come on,” and, to the encouraging sound of great cheering from the banks, started to pick up the stroke, Bevan, who rowed stroke, having to keep time as best he could by watching three’s blade out of the corner of his eye.''

''Emmanuel, who were in second station, had been coming up fast, and were now only about 50 yards off.  By common consent the race was practically over.  Not so to “Muttle.”  It was said that the water washed out of the Cam by “Muttle’s” blade rolled in huge waves to the tow path.  At the Railway Bridge the crews were level again, but it seemed to most people that Third could not continue with their heavy 13st. 10lb. man bumping about on the metal slide-way and the three light men trying to keep time with him at over 40.  However, “Muttle” called out for a “thick ‘un,” and on they went.  From the Railway Bridge he put in a number of these “thick ‘uns” of his, until Third, rowing 44, and steered a perfect course by “Muttle,” got their gun and won the race by a second amid great excitement.  There was a vast to-do among the timekeepers in comparing watches when it was discovered that the time was 10min. 26sec. -- 21sec. faster than the previous year’s record for the course.''{{ref|Times2}}

In 1890 Oxford won the first of its nine successive Boat Races and Muttlebury’s and Cambridge’s reign ended.  He finished at university that year and went to London where he became a stockbroker and joined the Thames R.C., winning the Stewards’ in 1894 but never the Grand.  For many years he helped coach Cambridge and was a steward of the Henley Regatta.

=== The 1890 Boat Race, Part I:  “A Poorer Lot than Usual” ===
In the correspondence between the University Boat Club Presidents to set the details for the 1890 race, the  date became a sticking point, flashing over when Guy Nickalls wrote that Cambridge wanted to get the best of everything because they were “a poorer lot than usual.”  Less than tactful stuff from a club that had lost four in a row.  To celebrate this “Inter-University Incident,” Rudy Lehmann, who at various times coached both Nickalls and Muttlebury, penned thirty-two stanzas for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Granta&lt;/span&gt;, the year-old Cambridge magazine that Lehmann edited and co-founded.  (Muttle wrote its initial “Rowing Notes.”)  First, for the February 1 issue, “The Quarrel:  ‘A Poorer Lot than Usual’”:

:''Strew your heads with dust and ashes, O ye'' &lt;br&gt;
:   '' sons of sedgy Cam;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Let your speech be meek and humble as the'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''baa of bleating lamb;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Let your bloods go robed in sackcloth and be'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''careless of their boots,--'' &lt;br&gt;
:''You’re “a poorer lot than usual, – rather'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''lower than the brutes.'' &lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Nickalls_photo_ILN_1889.jpg|thumb|right|300px]]
:''Fiery Nickalls wrote the latter, -- fiery'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''Nickalls, fine and large,--'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And his frenzied eye flashed fury as he sat'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''within his barge.'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Long enough have we submitted; now the time'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''has come to strike;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Shall “a poorer lot than usual” settle all'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''things as they like?'' &lt;br&gt;


:''“I, the winner of the Wingfields, of the'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''Diamonds winner too,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Who at stroke, or six, or seven am the'' &lt;br&gt;
:  ''  mainstay of the crew;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''I, whom friends call Guy or Luney,” -- it was'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''thus the chieftain spoke, --''  &lt;br&gt;
:''“Of ‘a poorer lot than usual’ will not tamely'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''bear the yoke.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''“Nay, my brothers of the Isis, let us write to'' &lt;br&gt;
:   '' them and say'' &lt;br&gt;
:''They shall trample us no longer in the old'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''familiar way;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And the banner of our Boat Club, as it flutters'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''in its pride,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''By ‘a poorer lot than usual’ shall no longer be'' &lt;br&gt;
:  ''  defied.”'' &lt;br&gt;


:''So he wrote it, and he signed it in the'' &lt;br&gt;
:   '' Presidential chair,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And he folded and addressed it, and he posted'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''it with care;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And the heedless postman bore it, little recking'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''of the frown'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Of “a poorer lot than usual” who reside in'' &lt;br&gt;
:  ''  Cambridge town.'' &lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Muttlebury_photo_ILN_1889.jpg|thumb|right|300px]]
:. . . . &lt;br&gt;


:''And they [the Cambridge boat club captains]'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''sat in solemn conclave, there within the'' &lt;br&gt;
:   '' panelled hall,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Where the golden names of oarsmen gleam'' &lt;br&gt;
: ''   and glitter on the wall;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Mighty Muttle read the letter, lord and master'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''of the crew,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''In “a poorer lot than usual” of socks and'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''shorts and shoes.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''Then they looked at one another as they heard'' &lt;br&gt;
:   ''it with dismay,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And one said, “This is awful,” and another,'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''“Let us pray”;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Till at last one rose and murmured, and his'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''fingers, as he rose,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Were -- “a poorer lot than usual” – extended'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''from his nose.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''“Thus,” he said, “I answer Nickalls of the'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''boast so loud and big;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Let him mount, and, if he likes it, ride to'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''Putney on a pig.'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Let him go to Bath or blazes, go to Jericho and'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''back,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Or -- “a poorer lot than usual” -- place his'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''head within a sack.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''“But when next he writes to Cambridge let him'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''try another plan;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Manners cost no more than twopence, and ‘tis'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''manners makyth man.'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And, O Muttle! if you meet him, tell him'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''plainly face to face'' &lt;br&gt;
:''That ‘a poorer lot than usual’ mean to beat'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''him in the race.”'' &lt;br&gt;


Then, for the February 15 issue,”The Reconciliation:  Oxford in Cambridge,” as Nickalls and R.P.P. Rowe had come to Cambridge to make peace, cemented at a banquet in their honor:


:''Oh! sadly flows the Isis, full sadly go the'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''crews,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And the Blue-aspiring oarsmen all have'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''yielded to the blues,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Through hall and quad and college sweeps the'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''universal moan,--'' &lt;br&gt;
:''“Give Guy and Reggie back to us; we cannot'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''row alone.”'' &lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Muttlebury_coaching_CUBC_from_steamer_1892.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Muttlebury coaching Cambridge, 1892]]
:''To Iffley drift the “toggers,” as slow as any'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''hearse;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''For while the men forget their form the coach'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''forgets to curse;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And bow, who screws most painfully, forgets to'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''murmur “Blank,”'' &lt;br&gt;
:''As the cox forgets his rudder-strings and runs'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''into the bank.'' &lt;br&gt;

:. . . . &lt;br&gt;

:''But Guy has hastened Camward; he leaves'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''them to their sighs,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And Reggie Rowe goes with him, curly Reggie'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''of the eyes--'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Reggie the slim and supple, the pride of all the'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''Eight,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Who never left his bed too soon, and never yet''
:    ''rowed late.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''See how our Muttle greets them; his childlike'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''smile is bland,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''That heathen Cantab, Muttle, -- as he shakes'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''them by the hand:'' &lt;br&gt;
:''“Now, welcome both to Cambridge; first lunch'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''and then away'' &lt;br&gt;
:''To watch ‘the poorer-----’  Hem! I mean the'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''crew at work to-day.”'' &lt;br&gt;

:. . . . &lt;br&gt;

:''Muttle at six is “stylish,” so at least the Field'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''reports;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''No man has ever worn, I trow, so short a pair'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''of shorts.'' &lt;br&gt;
:''His blade sweeps through the water, as he'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''swings his 13.10,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And pulls it all, and more than all, that brawny'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''king of men.'' &lt;br&gt;

:. . . . &lt;br&gt;

:''And, now the work is over, the rival chieftains'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''sit'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And talk of friendly nothings in their'' &lt;br&gt;
:    ''armchairs at the Pitt;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And yet methought I marked a shade of'' &lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 1890 - 1898:  Oxford’s Decade ==
In 1890 Oxford ended the Cambridge four-year run in the Boat Race and went on to win the next eight in a row.  Their success was due in no small part to having a disproportionate share of Etonians, who at school under the Oxford Etonian coach R.S. de Havilland won the Ladies’ Challenge Plate seven years straight from 1893 to 1899.  By then Leander Club had emerged from fifty years of relative obscurity to become the most successful of the gentlemen amateur clubs, largely by virtue of the 1893 “University Qualification Rule.”  By limiting undergraduate membership to the Oxbridge cream, it gave the club sufficient cachet more or less to ensure that those oarsmen would row for Leander when not for their own colleges.{{ref|Wigglesworth}}  In 1897, under secretary G.D. Rowe, Leander built a boathouse at Henley by the finish of the course, reflecting the club’s new fortunes.  The course had been altered in 1886, keeping the original length of about one mile 550 yards but shifting the start downstream to avoid the bend round Poplar Point and thereby, it was hoped, end the advantage the Berkshire station held over Buckinghamshire.  The alterations also entailed marking the outside boundaries with piles and narrowing the course so that it could no longer hold three crews abreast but only two, which led to extending the regatta from two days to three.  (The modern course, with the same distance and finish, was laid out in 1924 and made rail straight by moving the start from the Bucks to the Berks side of the Island.){{ref|Burnell}} 

On the technology front, in contrast to previous years there were no major advances to disrupt order; some crews toyed with oarlocks on swivel pins, and everyone got tubular iron outriggers to replace the solid kind -- an invention borrowed from the new bicycle craze -- but that was about it.{{ref|Wigglesworth2}}  In 1895 the Boat Race became the first major British sporting event to be filmed.  From the vantage of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, which started covering gentlemen’s sports in earnest after Bowles sold out in 1889 and its new owner brought W.B. Woodgate back on board to cover the Boat Race and Henley Regatta, Oxford, Eton, and Leander were on top and, on the whole, all was right with the world.  

There were, however, two lurking problems, one foreign, one domestic.  With the growth of rowing abroad came increased foreign interest in Henley Regatta.  Early entries such as the Shoe-wae-cae-mettes from Michigan for the 1878 Stewards’ were viewed almost as circus sideshows:  curious in costume, speech, and rowing style, but not a serious competitive threat.  However, as the number and average quality of foreign entries rose the attitude gradually changed, with the Henley stewards applying the same “amateur” standard for entries from abroad as for home crews, with the same exclusionary effect.  At the same time, the stewards and the rest of the gentlemen amateur rowing establishment kept their distance from foreign efforts to organize the sport, declining to affiliate with Le Fédération Internationale des Sociétés d’Aviron, the international governing body formed in 1892, and to participate in the European Championships that began the next year, and entirely avoided Olympic rowing until having to host it at Henley in 1908.  “England, which regarded bodily strength and vigor the exclusive property of her children, was not enthusiastic,” recalled Baron Pierre de Coubertin, about his experiences in the early 1890s organizing the first modern Olympic games.{{ref|Baron}}  British indifference left the French with the upper hand, so that while the Henley starting command is “Are you ready?  Go!”, in the FISA world it was for years “Êtes-vous prêts?  Partez!”; and because Henley’s one mile 550 yards did not convert into an attractive number in Napoleon’s metric system, FISA lopped off 123 yards to set 2000 meters as the new international standard.  To this day the Henley Regatta remains the only event on the international calendar outside FISA control.{{ref|Burnell2}}   “It is no spirit of criticism,” wrote Gully Nickalls of his uncle, H.G. Gold, who chaired the ARA from 1948 to 1952, “that I record that, in spite of all the forward-looking and imaginative activities in which he engaged on behalf of rowing he, like the great majority of his contemporaries, had no very great love for its international aspects.”{{ref|Nickalls}} 

If ignoring foreigners was relatively easy, the domestic front presented gentlemen amateurs with a more complex question, namely, redefining their own identity.  The old distinction drawn against “professional watermen” no longer worked, given the dwindling number of professionals remotely interested in racing without a purse, the mass influx of the new middle class with ample leisure who were flocking to the river, and the corresponding erosion under Dilke-sponsored legislation of such barriers as working hours and education levels that formerly kept amateur rowing socially exclusive.  In the late nineteenth century the debate continued to be framed largely as amateur vs. professional, but the results – chiefly the founding of the Amateur Rowing Association and the promulgation of its restrictive “amateur” definition – became increasingly detached from the publicly-stated rationales that underlay them.{{ref|Wigglesworth3}} 

The 1882 founding of the ARA came just before or after similar mid-Victorian organizing efforts in other sports:  tennis (Wimbledon 1877, Lawn Tennis Association 1888), cycling (Bicyclist’s Union 1878), athletics (Amateur Athletic Association 1880), boxing (Amateur Boxing Association 1881), association football (Football League 1888), and gymnastics (Amateur Gymnastics Association 1888).  Promptly after its founding the ARA defined “amateur” to bar, among others, anyone employed “in manual labour for money or wages,” a restriction that originated in the Henley Regatta rules of 1879.  The ARA imposed the definition on its member clubs and all regattas organized under its rules, thereby exporting the views of its London and Oxbridge governing members to the rest of the country.  Publicly, the new definition served to prevent cheating, preserve the “spirit” of the sport, and avoid the unfair advantage that would accrue to watermen and other non-amateurs due to their supposed extra training and strength.{{ref|Wigglesworth4}}  In truth, the means hardly served the ends and had other, rarely spoken rationales.  As noted earlier, the public schools imbued their cadets with some notion of the immutability of rank, even though many of them came from socially-ambitious, newly-rich families.  The Warden of Radley College, Woodgate’s alma mater, said:  “A gentleman both knows and is thankful that God, instead of making all men equal has made them all most unequal.  Heredity, rank, nobility of blood is the very first condition and essence of all Christian privileges and woe to the man who will honour no one except for his own merit and his own deeds.”{{ref|Radley}}  In addition, would-be gentlemen objected, at least in theory, to a dedication to sport to the exclusion of other affairs.  “To play billiards is the amusement of a gentleman,” wrote Anthony Trollope in 1868; “to play billiards pre-eminently well is the life’s work of a man who in learning to do so can hardly have continued to be a gentleman in the best sense of the word.”{{note|Trollope}}  As the athletics correspondent of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Saturday Review&lt;/span&gt; noted in 1867, “the facts of his being civil and never having competed for money are not sufficient to make a man a gentleman as well as an amateur.”{{ref|Wigglesworth5}} 

A byproduct of the ARA’s restrictive definition of “amateur” was the creation in 1890 of the National Amateur Rowing Association, which excluded only those who raced for money.  Anyone otherwise employed “in manual labor for money or wages” was welcome.  For a time some thought the NARA would serve as a political counterweight, forcing the ARA to moderate its definition and return to the center with a less exclusionary approach.  However, the first meeting between the two bodies went poorly and resulted in a “widening of the breach rather than a widening of the amateur definition.”  Indeed, with the NARA now available to house any club not able or willing to meet the ARA’s standards, the ARA felt free to add a further restriction in 1894 to bar anyone ever employed “in our about boats.”{{ref|Wigglesworth6}}   The restriction remained in place until 1956, with its repeal facilitating the merger that year of the two associations.  The ARA remains the U.K. governing body for rowing.{{ref|Wigglesworth7}}

=== “Wingfield Sculls” (Spy), July 20, 1889 ===

[[Image:Nickalls_G_Vanity_Fair_1889-07-20.jpg|thumb|right]]'''Only a few years ago there was at Eton a young wet-bob whose vigorous energy led him to dare so much, and to display such recklessness of consequence in daring, that he came to be known amongst his fellows as “Luni.”   But however well earned the style may have been, he has ever since persistently shown that he has method in what he does.  While still at Eton, he played football with success, and when not engaged in athletically breaking his bones or risking his neck, he feathered an oar with skill enough to attract the notice of the galley slave-drivers of the time, who quickly placed him upon a thwart in the Eton Eight, in which he greatly helped seven other boys to carry off the Ladies’ Challenge Plate at Henley.  After this, his success as a boat propeller was assured.  He went to Magdalen College, Oxford, and was found ready to row down all comers.  He took a seat in the Oxford Eight as of right, and has kept it for three years.  He rowed once with Lord Ampthill, and again with a son of the Leader of the House of Commons in the University Pairs; and he has rowed in various Eights and Pairs at Henley with a great deal more success than most men have any right to expect.''

''As a Sculler, Mr. Nickalls is even more famous.  When he had once won the Oxford Sculls he feared to contest them again because all other possible competitors feared to scull against him.  He rowed with such vigour against Gardner at Henley that he broke a scull and was beaten -- which he could well afford to be for once.  He holds the records over the Amateur Championship course; and he has now thrice won the Wingfield Sculls, no one having the stomach to contest them with him on the last occasion.  He always finishes a hard race as strongly as he begins it, and it is now confidently asserted that we have never yet seen his like in a skiff.''

''In spite of his youth -- he is but twenty-two years old -- and of his great achievements, Mr. Nickalls is not puffed up but is the owner of a very genial and hearty manner, which upon occasion becomes so boisterous as to show justification for the schoolboy estimate of his ways as summed up at Eton.  He has much capacity for exercise, and his excessive biceps is only surpassed in quantity by the size of his forearm.  His favourite sport is hunting, but he can catch fish and shoot birds.  He is also good at presiding over others, for while still President of the O.U.B.C., he presides over the Eton Club and over the Junior Common Room of his College, and he will presently be President of Vincent’s.  He is the best of friends, a man with whom, for other reasons, no one would care to quarrel.  But he is not fond of rowing, and is likely soon to retire upon his laurels.''

“But he is not fond of rowing, and is likely soon to retire upon his laurels.”  Unless tongue in cheek, this was &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s single worst rowing prediction, for [[w:Guy_Nickalls|Guy Nickalls]] (1866-1935) went on to accumulate a record to which none “can compare even remotely,” judged the Times obituarist.  It is thus fitting that he was the first rower to be featured as such in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, all predecessors having appeared in some other capacity (and Rev. E.J.H. Smith having been a coaching fluke).

Tom Nickalls, a founding member of the London Rowing Club, did not want his sons to become oarsmen, telling Guy, “Cricket, my boy, will take you round the world, and rowing, up and down the Thames.  I used to row for London, and I always wished I could play cricket.”{{ref|Nickalls1}}  But Guy became a “wet bob” almost immediately on arrival at Eton in 1880 and kept rowing for the next twenty-eight years, with a hiatus from 1898 to 1904 to attend to family and finances.  In his autobiography, he demurred:  “I do not wish for a moment to take any credit to myself. . . .  Nature has endowed me with a fairly strong body, a constitution of iron, and a will power or stubbornness above the average.  These I have tried my best not to abuse, and any man so built and constituted, given my opportunities, could no doubt have done the same.”{{ref|Nickalls2}}  Maybe so.  But few could win three events at a Henley regatta; or enter and win in their forties (and train by dragging a horse-roller around the lawn);{{ref|Nickalls3}} or shrug off a surgical divot in the leg to win the Grand and jump in a scratch pair for the Goblets:

''Somewhere about April [1892] I was breaking in some Arab polo ponies which my eldest brother had sent home from Cairo, and, in opening a gate, the one I was riding, a grey, suddenly plunged and swerved; consequence, a badly torn tailor’s muscle.  It put me hors de combat for a day or two, and, as there were no outward and visible signs of injury, I continued riding every morning.  At the end of April I could feel a hard lump as big as a goose’s egg deep on my inner left thigh.  I went up to see Wharton Hood, who told me that I had a bad suffusion of blood, and that when it ripened, so to speak, it would come more to the surface, in about six weeks’ time, and that then I should have to have it opened up. . . .''

''The exercise at Oxford and the dancing at Commem., for which I had a big party, including my wife to be, brought my bad leg to a head.  I had arranged to drive my party over to Henley with two of old Richard’s team, but before starting I went to see “Pego” Symonds, who vetted all the Varsity crews in those days.  He laid me out, proceeded to hone a knife, and then, with a “Hold tight,” he made two enormous deep gashes in my thigh, bound my leg up, and told me not to take it off for twenty-four hours.  When I did so, at Henley, I had a hole in my thigh that I could get my fist into.  The local saw-bones, Baines, fixed me up with two tubes, and, as there was no chance of walking for three weeks, I took to a bath-chair, in which Robeson, the ninth man [for the Leander eight], was kind enough to trundle me about.  I could row all right, but missed my usual running exercise badly.  The only means by which I could persuade Robeson to come as ninth man was a promise that I would go in for the Goblets with him.  The extra exercise certainly helped me to get fit, but we could never make a good pair.''{{ref|Nickalls4}} 

At Eton Nickalls won the Junior Sculling (1884), the School Pulling (1885-86), and School Sculling (1885).  At Oxford he won the University Sculls (1887), the University Pairs (1888-90, with W.F.D. Smith once, then twice with Lord Ampthill), and the University Fours (1886 and 1889), went head of the river in 1888 with Magdalene, and rowed in five Boat Races (1887-91), winning twice and being O.U.B.C. President in 1890.  He was Captain of Leander in 1892 and 1897.  He won the Wingfield Sculls four times (1887-89 and 1891), and at Henley won the Grand four times (1891-92 and 1896-97), the Ladies’ once (1885, with Eton), the Stewards’ seven times (1893, 1895-97, 1905-07), the Goblets six (1890-91 and 1894-97), and the Diamonds five (1888-90 and 1893-94).  All told, Nickalls won twenty-three events at Henley over twenty-two years, losing only thirteen of eighty-one races, a record that may never be equalled.{{ref|Page}}  Had he “ever made a spécialité of sculling, and got his hands and their work approximately accurate, no doubt that he would have been better than all,” wrote W.B. Woodgate; “as it was, now and then when he won Diamonds after grinding in other races at the same regatta, he showed evidence of pace which few amateurs could ever equal.”{{ref|Woodgate}}  Nickalls capped and completed his career by winning the 1908 London Olympic Eight with Leander a few months short of his forty-second birthday (see below).

From 1913 through 1916 Nickalls coached Yale, enticed to New Haven by Averell Harriman and a sufficient stipend to help see his two sons through Eton.  (Nickalls tried to join the army in 1914 on the outbreak of war, but was turned down on account of age.  By late 1917 the army had a change of heart, sending him to France, then age fifty, as a Captain in the 23rd Lancashire Fusiliers in charge of physical and bayonet training.)  Though his Yale crews won two of the three years he was there, Nickalls found the environment stressful and foreign.  He was partly to blame, by spouting opinions better left unsaid or if said, certainly not within earshot of the attentive rowing press.  Yet such remarks -- “Their paddling is bad, their rowing, worse” (about the Yale 1916 crew){{ref|Nickalls5}} -- were wholly in line with his personality:  as O.U.B.C. President, he nearly scotched the 1890 Boat Race by calling the Cambridge crew “probably a poorer lot than usual” in an official letter to his counterpart, S.D. Muttlebury.{{ref|Nickalls6}}  Son Gully later recalled:

''So far as he was concerned there were rarely two sides to any question.  He was right.  His opponents were not only wrong, but deliberately and wickedly wrong.  So strong were his opinions that in argument he became so fierce, vehement and aggressive that a change of subject came as a welcome relief. . . .''

''His tact was atrocious.  My mother went through agonies of apprehension.  Always she knew by the trend of the conversation when he was about to drop some particularly heavy brick, and, with frantic winks and nods and desperate endeavours to turn the conversation into other channels, gallantly she would strive to steer him clear of immediate trouble.  The difficulty was that he could never modify his point of view for the benefit of any one of the company.  Nor could he be prevented from saying exactly what he thought.  In private my mother would reproach him:  “‘You’re not sane.  You say such silly things.  No wonder you’re so unpopular.”  My father would reply:  “Of course I’m not popular.  Few people with any character are.”  He would then try to laugh off the matter and pretend that the whole thing was a grand joke.  Sometimes, if it was known that he was going to meet certain people, we would endeavour to warn him beforehand of all the possible pitfalls.  We were not particularly successful.  The conversation would take some unexpected turn and we were sunk.  Constant tutoring, combined with a certain mellowing natural to age, tended to improve his tact during his last few years, though he was never absolutely reliable.''{{ref|Nickalls7}}

The unbounded energy Nickalls brought to rowing carried through his later years, though lack of tact and impatience with detail kept him from ever converting much of it into commercial success as a stockbroker (1892-1922) or advertising agent (1922-35).  (Gully fared better, forty years the partner of Alfred Pemberton, son of Max, in their own advertising firm.){{ref|Gully1}}  A relentless gardener and tennis player, Guy “could garden for two hours before breakfast, cut and mark out two tennis courts before lunch, and start tennis at 2.30 and play till 8.30 if he could find anyone to oppose him.”{{{ref|LAJ1}}  Among Nickalls’ habits that must have maddened his opponents, recalled Gully, “was his way, when he or his partner were serving, of keeping only one score when leading in any game.  Thus, thirty, fifteen, was ‘Thirty here’; forty-fifteen, or forty-thirty, were both ‘Forty here’.  The other side had to keep their own score.”{{ref|Nickalls8}}  He also “had the greatest attraction and fascination to children, and he was never so happy as when surrounded by them, leading some expedition to bathe in the river, to ferret, to dig a badger, or to go beagling.”{{ref|LAJ2}}  “He had a wholehearted zest for life and all that it offered,” wrote Gully.  A friend recalled:  “Every minute of his time was occupied.  I don’t think he ever knew what it was to be dull or lonely.  He loved to be surrounded by people, preferably the young.  And for this reason he never really grew old.  With a more helpful bank balance he would have made an admirable host on the grand scale.”{{ref|Nickalls9}} 

On July 6, 1935 Zürich Rowing Club won the Stewards’.  “Thank God I have been spared to see what I believe to be the finest four of all time,” Guy told Gully.  The next morning, Guy was in an auto accident en route to Scotland to fish, and died the following evening.

=== The 1908 London Olympics:  Nickalls’ Finale ===
[[Image:Olympic_rowing_program_cover_1908.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]
Due to bad weather, there was no rowing at the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896.  There was at Paris in 1900 and St. Louis in 1904, but the U.K. sent only a sculler to Paris, St. George Ashe, who apparently had no ARA or other official backing, and sent no one at all to Athens or St. Louis.{{ref|Cleaver}}  The isolation ended when London agreed to host the 1908 Games.  The organizing committee assigned the rowing events to the ARA, whose Oxbridge leaders chose Henley as the venue and applied the ARA’s restrictive “amateur” definition to potential entrants, which effectively excluded the United States, France, Holland, Switzerland, and all but the Italian sculler from competition.  The Belgians made the cut and since they had won the Grand Challenge Cup in 1906 and 1907, as well as the European Championships for ten of the previous eleven years, the ARA were determined to field strong crews for Britain.  They selected two for the eights event:  a composite crew of old and new Leander men in the orthodox mold, and Duggie Stuart’s C.U.B.C., which won the 1908 Boat Race but whose “sculling” style the Leander veterans thought incorrigible.  At the Olympics, the Belgians beat Cambridge to advance to the final against Leander, and the stage was set for orthodoxy’s test.  Nickalls’ account:

''The actual racing was really too easy to be exciting.  We drew Hungary in the first heat, and paddled after the top of the Island.  In the next heat Canada made a better show.  They started at 43, and never got much below 40 at any point of the course.  We started at 41, and, continuing at a level 36, we were from a length to a length and three-quarters ahead all the way up the course.  After the Henley Regatta three-quarter mark, we let the stroke down to 34, and paddled in firmly, easy winners.  In the final we met the redoubtable Belgian crew, the terror of the then modern English oarsmen, the crew who had beaten the famous Cambridge crowd more easily than even we veterans had expected.  We were known to one and all as “the old crocks”.  I may say our style was admitted to be of the best, but would-be-wiseacres shook their heads knowingly.  Wait till the Belgians press them.  Well, I had never been beaten by either a colonial or foreigner, and I certainly wasn’t going to be in my old age, and this my absolutely last race.''

''The start was beautifully level; they did 43 and we a long crisp 42.  I had never felt the like of it, and never in my life had I felt like galloping at full tilt the whole distance.  We had a quarter of a length lead at the end of a minute, and, letting the stroke drop to 38, led half a length at the end of two minutes.  At the second signal box we led by three-quarters of a length, rowing 37.  Cockie [Maclagan] had warned us that unless absolutely necessary he was not going to ask for more than one “ten”, and that we were to let ourselves go and give it good and strong.  The psychological moment had arrived.  Cockie’s clear voice rang out immediately after the Belgians’ great spurt at Remenham Farm had subsided.''

''“Now then, Leander, we’ll have our ten strokes and let them know it!  One-----”''

''The boat fairly leapt out of the water, up to 38 again.  We fairly sang along, cleared them at once and began sailing away.  Bucknall dropped to 36 again.  The race was over.  We had them beat.  Don growled and broke into a paddle.  I was all for rowing in at 40, but Cockie looked back.''

''“Take it easy and keep together, Leander,” shouted he, and we swung over the line easy winners, by more than two lengths, in record time.  I had finished.  Thanks entirely to the unselfish and patriotic action of the “old crocks” turning out again to show the younger generation how to row properly, I remained unbeaten by any colonial or foreigner.  The victory of the orthodox in 1908 not only restored England’s prestige as the greatest rowing nation in the world, but straightened out the prevailing ideas on style and form which W.A.L. Fletcher and others had begun to decry.''{{ref|Nickalls10}}

“Having just witnessed Olympic regatta while winding up these pages,” wrote W.B. Woodgate in his memoirs, “I venture to criticize the form there.  It was below the average of ordinary Henley regattas between ‘90 and ‘02.  The Leander eight was good, but not superlative:  the Grand winners of ‘93 and 1902 would have beaten it, and others have tied it.  Fours, pairs, and sculls were all below Henley average.  Belgians, weaker than us, teach us valuable lessons in (1) uniform slide, (2) clean feather, (3) lively arm recovery.  If they adopted our longer trunk swing they would be deadly.  (Fas est et ab hoste doceri.)  It is discredit to modern Oxford coaching that good men like Kirby and Southwell should be spoilt, and Leander be driven to fall back on veteran welters.”{{ref|Woodgate2}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Smith, William Frederick Danvers (''Viscount Hambleden'') == 

=== “Head of the greatest publishing house in Christendom” (Spy), December 8, 1904 ===
[[Image:Smith_WFD_Vanity_Fair_1904-12-08.jpg|thumb|right]]''Many years ago, when newspapers were few, when advertisements were taxed, and when the telegraph carried no daily tale of diplomacy or horror from the outside world, a newsman set up in business in Duke Street, off Grosvenor Square.  His name was Smith.  The little shop grew and prospered so fast that a branch office was opened in the Strand.  Also he married; and from that union was born a Cabinet Minister.''

''He was not always a Cabinet Minister, though he was never a newsboy, as his enemies loved to have it.  But he grew in stature, wealth and wisdom until he became a very John Bull in person, with an organising imagination such as was even rarer in those days than now.  He obtained control of the railway bookstalls.  He learnt the tastes of the counties -- that Yorkshire does not buy poetry nor Manchester expensive books.  As education increased subscribers so did his business swell.  Lending libraries, railway advertising contracts -- in such new branches did he expand himself.  Finally he died, leaving something over two millions and the name of a shrewd and honest politician who had deserved well of his country.  His widow was granted the title of Viscountess Hambleden.''

''He left one son, the Honourable William Frederick Danvers Smith, who inherited much of his father’s wealth, and is heir to his mother’s title.  Freddie Smith was a pleasant-mannered Etonian, who found a place in his school eight, but was not allowed by the Oxford doctors to win the blue that would have otherwise been his.  However, he rowed at Henley for Leander in 1888, when D.H. McLean was captain, and Muttlebury was another member of the crew.  Through an effort to row about fifty to the minute they were beaten by Thames.  He also stroked the New College boat in 1889 when they hunted B.N.C. for the Headship of the river.''

''He learnt the details of his business, but since he became a Member of Parliament has practically given up any active participation therein.  But the work is in good hands.''

''The masses of high-piled literature on every bookstall at this festive season brings home the realisation that the firm of which he is titular head is, without doubt, the greatest publishing house in Christendom.  It stands between the British public and the British Press like a conduit, silently and evenly supplying its rivers of information.  In spite of all temptations and some abuse, it has held to cleanliness in print and picture, with one exception in a licensed jester that blushes to hear itself named.''

''Freddie Smith hunts a little and shoots a great deal.  He married a daughter of the Earl of Arran.  Lady Esther is a wise and charming hostess.  Her week-end parties at Greenlands by Henley, and her dinners, whether political or purely social, in London have a pleasant reputation.''

''Freddie is a quiet fellow, with a pleasant manner and a kind heart.  His conduct has never given gossip or criticism a chance.''

“The paper duty is gone.  For the full results of its removal men must wait until we of the nineteenth century are no more,” Gladstone wrote in 1861 on the repeal of the last of the “taxes on knowledge,” a measure sponsored by T.G. Bowles’ father, Milner Gibson.{{ref|Gladstone}}  Wentworth Dilke, grandfather of the eponymous rower of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; and proprietor of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Atheneum&lt;/span&gt; literary magazine, had also opposed the paper duty and by helping end it fostered the expansion of the popular press.  This proved a mixed blessing for his grandson, who used it to propogate his political views in the 1870s and early 1880s but was pilloried in print during and after the 1885-86 Crawford divorce case.  But another rower of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, [[w:Frederick_Smith%2C_2nd_Viscount_Hambleden|William Frederick Danvers Smith]] (1868-1928), could view the removal of the paper duty as having perhaps secured his future, for his grandfather and father, William and William Henry Smith, who had previously had the foresight and good luck to obtain long-term contracts for bookselling and advertising at a large number of railway stations, created a publishing empire that funded his entrée to Eton and Oxford.

At school and university, Freddie went went winless in four Henley appearances:  with Guy Nickalls and Lord Ampthill for Eton in the 1886 Ladies’, for Leander in the 1888 Grand (as &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; noted), and for New College in the Grand in 1889 and 1890.  But on leaving Oxford with a third class in modern history, Smith became a popular host to generations of university oarsmen at Greenlands, his expansive home just below the start of the Henley course.  His 1890 coming of age party set the tone.  “I never kept a game book nor jotted down anything in the nature of a shooting diary,” Nickalls recalled, “but our five days must have accounted for 2,000 pheasants and a number of partridges and hares.  All very pleasant.”{{ref|Nickalls}} 

In 1891 Smith inherited from his father not only Greenlands but also the family firm and a Conservative seat in the House of Commons, although the latter required ratification by the electorate at the October general election.  Smith kept his seat until resigning in 1910, and joined the Lords in 1913 when his mother died and he became Viscount Hambleden.  In neither place “did he make much figure as a politician,”{{ref|DNB}} unlike his father who held cabinet posts in the Disraeli and Salisbury governments.  But like his father, the younger Smith was a lifelong churchman and philanthropist, especially benefitting various London hospitals.  During the 1914-18 war, Smith served in Gallipoli and Egypt as Lieutenant Colonel of the Royal First Devon Yeomanry.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; featured him a year before his company lost two key contracts for railway bookstalls, which precipitated in 1906 the launching of 200 new bookstores, the predecessors of today’s ubiquitous WHSmith shops.

=== Problems in Pairs === 
En route to winning the 1888 University Pairs, Nickalls and Smith had a hiccough in training.  “Three days before the trial heat Freddie and I were rowing a course, and at the finish got too far over towards the Oxford bank,” Nickalls wrote.  “Fred’s oar caught a boat and it lifted him clean overboard.  We stopped dead.  I looked round to see what damage had been done, and saw Fred swimming towards the Brasenose raft, and I got ashore on the Varsity raft without upsetting.”{{ref|Nickalls2}}  R.H. Forster celebrated such problems in pairs in this 1893 verse: 

:''Stroke --'' &lt;br&gt;


:''Why did I row in a pair?'' &lt;br&gt;
::	''Why wasn’t I sooner beheaded?'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Why is Bow’s oar in the air,'' &lt;br&gt;
::	''While mine in the mud is embedded?'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Why is his language so rank?'' &lt;br&gt;
::	''Bargees might hear it and quiver.'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Why must he make for the bank?'' &lt;br&gt;
::       ''Why can’t he stick to the river?'' &lt;br&gt;


:''Bow --'' &lt;br&gt;


:''Difficult ‘tis to discern'' &lt;br&gt;
::	''Why o’er the stretcher Stroke lingers.'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Why does he bury the stern,'' &lt;br&gt;
::	''And bark on the gunwale my fingers?'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Why made that coach such a row? --''  &lt;br&gt;
::	''His cox at the game isn’t handy:'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Why am I now at the “Plough,”'' &lt;br&gt;
::	''Drinking hot water and brandy?'' &lt;br&gt;


:''The Impartial Observer --'' &lt;br&gt;


:''Here’s an infallible tip'' &lt;br&gt;
::       ''For all who would go a-light-pairing:--'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Smartness and watermanship'' &lt;br&gt;
::	''Move a boat faster than swearing.'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Whether at stroke or at bow,'' &lt;br&gt;
::	''Drop all that snapping and sneering;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And don’t think your mate such a cow,'' &lt;br&gt;
::	''Because you mismanage the steering.''{{note|Forster}} &lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Forster, Robert Henry == 

=== “Bill” (ELF), July 6, 1910 ===
[[Image:Forster_RH_Vanity_Fair_1910-07-06.jpg|thumb|right]]''Although Mr. Forster is best known in connection with rowing matters, his interests range over a large field, as a reference to “Who’s Who” will verify.  He is the author of many volumes of both prose and verse, is an archaeologist of repute, and is a barrister-at-law.  Nor does this complete the list of his acquirements and activities.''

''He was born at Backworth forty-three years ago, the son of a Newcastle mining engineer, and in due time went to Aysgarth School, Harrow, to make his  preliminary essays in learning.  His introduction to books and book-learning seemed to be to his liking, for he quickly started on the business of education in grim earnest.  The mere list of his successes is formidable, and calls for no comment: -- Entrance Scholarship, Harrow, 1881; Leaf Scholarship, 1885; Minor Scholarship, St. John’s, 1884; Foundation Scholarship, 1887; M’Mahon Law Student, 1891; 1st Class (3rd Division) Classical Tripos, 1888, and 1st Class (Senior) Law Tripos, 1889.  Although he is not in practice, he was called to the Bar in 1892, and, had he chosen, might have made a name for himself in the law.''

''But circumstances and tastes led him elsewhere.  He had for many years been fond of scribbling, and in 1898 published his first book, “The Hand of the Spoiler.”  This was quickly followed by other volumes -- “The Amateur Antiquary,” “Down by the River,” “A Tynedale Comedy,” “The Last Foray,” “In Steel and Leather,” “Strained Allegiance,” “The Arrow of the North,” “The Mistress of Aydon,” and several volumes of verse.  Of the prose work it is to be said that one could not expect better, while his verses are better than one could expect.''

''He has never essayed a wife, but, judging by his books, he is not a stranger to the sex.  He has been for many years captain of the Thames Rowing Club, and as a coach has the respect which success imposes.  On the river bank he has to perfection that mild, hesitating timidity of speech characteristic of successful coaches, and he has never been under any delusion as to the uses of a megaphone.''

George Baker Forster was First Captain of Lady Margaret Boat Club, won the Cambridge University Fours, rowed for C.U.B.C. against Oxford in the 1853 Grand (losing by a foot and a half to Chitty’s crew), and then retired from the sport.  His son, Robert Henry Forster (1867-1923), was a less successful oarsman but became an accomplished coach.  In 1888 at his first Henley Regatta, young Bill won the Ladies’ and the Thames with L.M.B.C. coached by his Trinity neighbor and future Thames R.C. compatriot, S.D. Muttlebury.  From 1892 to 1903, having become a barrister, he unsuccessfully vied for the Grand, Thames, and Wyfolds with the Thames R.C., was its Captain most years from 1896 to 1907, and later became vice president.  At the first part of the century the club’s fortunes “were at a very low ebb, owing to a paucity of good material,” recalled B.J. Angle, “and had it not been for Foster [sic] it is more than probable that the club would have permanently lost the position it had previously held in the rowing world.  From 1897 to 1903 Thames won practically nothing, but in 1904 Foster’s untiring efforts at last met with reward, and since that date the club has gone steadily forward, until now it has quite gained its former position.”{{ref|Angle}}  In 1910 he and Steve Fairbairn founded the Forster-Fairbairn Trial Pairs at Cambridge.

For writing on rowing, W.B. Woodgate and R.C. Lehmann take the gold among &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; contestants for prose and poetry respectively, but Forster contends for the combined event.  He wrote the first volume of the L.M.B.C. history and the lyrics for two club songs (“Si Je Puis” and “Carmen Aquaticum”), and several short stories on rowing (from which are excerpted “My garments expansion require” and “Problems in pairs”).  He also wrote “Notes on the Early History of Rowing” for the St. Johns’ College magazine, reflecting his deep interest in archaeology and ancient civilization.  There he conjectures that “rowing was [first] practiced on the Nile at least as early as the reign of Khufu (3733 B.C.),” because tombs of the fourth dynasty (3766 to 3566 B.C.) depict “boats and oars of a type which altered but little during the subsequent course of Egyptian history.”{{ref|Forster}} 

Bill once defined rowing as “seeking fame at the end of an eight-foot spruce.”

=== A Boat Race Fantasy ===
“[P]erhaps some day Mr. Forster will see his way to give us a real river story,” wrote &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;The World&lt;/span&gt; (July 5, 1904), a knock-off of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, for “there are few good accounts of boat-racing in fiction -- the Ouidaeque oarsman who strokes ‘crack’ eights untrained being the favourite rowing hero of fiction.”  After Oxford’s 1909-12 run in the Boat Race, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; published just such a tale (April 3, 1912), though its author, “Cambriouleur,” was probably not Forster but B. Fletcher Robinson.  Chastening the C.U.B.C. to “carry a reserve crew ready to step at a moment’s notice into the places of those who sink or expire” and otherwise to draw on all the resources of the University to gain victory, he launched into it:

''At this point you must allow me to relate the story of the great race of 18__, in which I played so conspicuous a part.  The true story of that thrilling contest has never yet been told in print.  In fact, only my grandchildren know it as it should be told.  Every year on Boat-race night I gather the little ones round my knee and relate the story.''

[[Image:CUBC_coach_on_horseback_engraving_1866.jpg|thumb|right|400px|&quot;Just at that moment who should be passing but the President of the C.U.B.C. on his ancient white charger!&quot;]]''I was training for the Lents.  I was a humble member of the Fifth Lent Boat, but one afternoon in early February our coach had been pleased to commend my oarsmanship.  “Well rowed, bow!”  he cried.  Just at that moment who should be passing but the President of the C.U.B.C. on his ancient white charger!  He heard the encomium and he looked in my direction.  Without turning my ear I could feel his eye upon me.  I rowed better than ever.''

''After Hall in the evening -- and I had dutifully passed my plate for a third helping of roast beef -- I was sitting in my armchair before the fire gazing pensively at my disused pipe, when there came a knock at the door.  I was scarcely surprised to see that my visitor was the President himself.  Instead of falling on the ground and worshipping, as I should have done in calmer moments, I asked him to be seated.  He informed me that he had just looked in to ask me whether I should care to occupy the vacant bow thwart in the University boat.  He said that bow had been giving a lot of trouble lately and had got to clear out.''

''“I was rather bothered,” he continued, “to know where to look for a thoroughly competent bow.  But I happened to be on the towpath this afternoon and I noticed the magnificent work you were doing.  I hope you won’t mind helping us out, old man.”''

''“Not a bit, old chap,” I answered.''

''“Spoken like a brick,” he replied.  “By the way, we have put forward the boat-race on account of your engagement in the Lents.  It is to be rowed to-morrow morning at ten o’clock.  We have just time to catch the train.  So come along.”''

''“Right,” I answered.  “Have I time to change?”''

''“You can change at Putney,” he said.  “I felt sure you wouldn’t refuse, so I have brought your blue along with me.”  He exhibited a complete rig-out of light blue which he had brought with him in a brown-paper parcel.''

''At the gate he suddenly remarked, looking at his watch:  “By Jove!  I’m not sure that we shall do it in time, even if we do catch the train.  Luckily, my horse is here.  If you don’t mind getting up behind me we shall be at Putney by half-past nine easily.”''

''I mounted the white charger behind the President, and clasping him firmly round the waist, we set out at a hard gallop along the Trumpington Road.  At Bishop’s Stortford the President looked at his watch.  I heard him swear.''

''“Only half-an-hour before the gun goes,” he exclaimed.  “You must change at once.”''

''So, while the white charger fled onward through Tottenham and Hempstead, I changed my clothes and donned the blazer and cap, the sweater and zephyr and shorts, casting my ordinary garments away as we rode.  It was hard work getting into the armholes, but it was for my University, my Alma Mater, and I did it.''

''We were only just in time.  The gunner stood with his lighted match at the porthole as we crossed Putney Bridge, and the vast concourse of spectators set up a thunderous shout of applause as we clattered down the towing-path.  It was the work of a moment to fling off our outer clothes and leap into our seats -- the President at stroke and I at bow -- just as the gun went off with a deafening crash.''

''I noticed the Oxford cox scowl and frown when he saw me take my seat.  I noticed the Oxford stroke set his teeth tighter.  We were off!''

''Heavens, how I pulled!  I was putting in two strokes to every one of the rest of the crew’s.''

''“Well rowed, bow!” roared the cox through his megaphone.''

''“Well rowed, bow!” roared the crowd on the banks.  I could see ladies waving their handkerchiefs and children shouting on the house-tops.  Faster and faster I rowed.  The Oxford crew were biting their nails with vexation as they slipped further and further astern.  The Oxford cox was cursing audibly.  The Oxford stroke was pale with vexation.  Faster and faster I rowed.''

''Suddenly the sky grew as black as pitch.  “A storm, by Heaven!” shouted our cox through his megaphone.  “Well rowed, bow!”''

''At that moment the black sky cracked open and a huge sheet of flame descended hissing upon the river.  As soon as my dazed eyes could take in the spectacle I saw that the Oxford stroke had been struck by lightning and was  gone.  With magnificent sportsmanship our own stroke determined to equalise matters and leapt into the stream.''

''Faster and faster I rowed.  Great angry billows rolled in upon our frail vessel as we shot through the gloomy arches of Hammersmith Bridge.  Surely no boat could live in such a sea!''

''Ah!  A huge green-backed monster descended upon our deck, carrying havoc as it came.  Seven, six, and five were swept overboard into the boiling flood.  Not to be outdone in generosity, the three corresponding Oxford oars dived overboard and swam for the bank.''

''Undermanned, waterlogged, and now at the mercy of wind and waves, we four survivors fought our way towards Barnes.  Another flash of lightning carried off four and three in each boat.  Faster and faster I rowed, and the stout ashen oar bent almost double in my hands, while the waves rose higher and higher.  Suddenly there was a shriek from cox.''

''“The rudder is broken.  I can steer no longer.  I am only a burden to you.  Farewell!  Well rowed, bow!”''

''I saw him plunge into the torrent, and two turned for a moment to grasp my hand.''

''“Barnes Bridge,” I shouted, “we’ll conquer yet!”''

''Then, hurrah!  the goal was close at hand, if I could only reach it.''

''There arose a great shout from the banks -- “Cambridge has won.”''

''“And  in record time, too, by Gad!” I heard the umpire remark.''

''I looked at the clock on the chimney-piece, and it said half-past ten.''

''That was the only time I ever rowed in the University Boat Race.''

[[Image:Ampthill_Lord_Vanity_Fair_1891-03-21.jpg|thumb|right]]''Oliver Arthur Villiers Russell, the second Baron Ampthill, whose father was that eminent diplomatist who will always be remembered by the name Lord Odo Russell, was born in Rome two-and-twenty years ago.  Naturally he went to Eton, where he became Captain of the Boats, President of “Pop,” and President of the Literary Society.  He was also second Oppidan in the School, but failed to rise above mediocrity in any physical line save rowing.  From Eton he went to New College, and to-day he will row his third University Boat Race; having been once beaten by Cambridge and having once succeeded in defeating them by a few yards after the best race on record since the Dead Heat of 1877.  He has often been beaten at Henley; but last year, in the stout companionship of Mr. Guy Nickalls, he won the Silver Goblets; and he has occasionally won other races.  At Oxford he has begun his school career over again, having been chosen President of the University Boat Club and of the Union Society; for which last office he beat an Archbishop’s son by six votes.''


''He is a very tall, very agreeable, and good-looking young man, with a long, strong back, which is worth much in a boat.  He is a Freemason and a Liberal Unionist, though he has not yet become famous in the House of Lords.  He intends to devote himself to the management of Foreign Affairs.  He can shoot.''


''He has many friends who call him “Dick.”''

Like Freddie Smith and most anyone else, [[w:Oliver_Russell%2C_2nd_Baron_Ampthill|Lord Ampthill]] (1869-1935) usually won when Guy Nickalls was in the boat and fared worse when he was not.  Wins with Nickalls were the 1888-89 University Pairs, the 1890-91 Boat Races and Goblets, and the 1891 Grand; losses without him were the 1887-88 Ladies’ and the 1889-90 Grand.  Three rare losses with Nickalls were the 1886 Ladies’, the 1889 Boat Race, and the 1889 Goblets, and two wins without him were the 1888 and 1890 University Fours.  So much for statistics.

Guy and Lord Ampthill were lifelong friends.  Their travails in the Silver Goblets give some indication why, as recounted by Nickalls:

[[Image:Guy_Nickalls_and_Lord_Ampthill_sitting_photo_c1892.jpg|thumb|right]][1889:]  ''Ampthill and I . . . met a very hot pair, Muttlebury and Gardner, in the final, which was one of the most severe races in which I was ever engaged.  Up to Fawley we changed places about four times, but neither of us ever got more than a few feet advantage.  We rowed level from there to the finish, stroke for stroke, side by side.  In the last ten yards I thought we had the race but alas, Muttle scrambled over the line two feet ahead in 8 minutes 25 seconds; all four of us at the last gasp.''{{ref|Nickalls1}}

[1890:]  ''In the pairs our only opponents were a very hot pair, Francklyn and Muttlebury, but in the actual race Muttle was too powerful for his bow.  They led us half a length at Remenham wall, where, not wanting to foul them, I called out to Muttle to get back in his water as I wanted to pass him.  Muttle was very apologetic, eased up and let Francklyn pull the boat straight again.  As we went by I was fouled by Francklyn’s oar, but naturally never claimed the foul, and, leading at Fawley by a quarter of a length, I could see we were quite safe, since every time Muttle tried to come up he had to put on the rudder against himself.  We paddled ahead, had over a length at the mile, and won easily.''{{ref|Nickalls2}}

[1891:]  ''Dick and I had some excellent racing for the Goblets.  In the first heat Frank Clarke and Hutchison led us by over two lengths at the half-mile, but I never believe or have believed that it is good for a big pair to start fast.  We were level at the three-quarter mile and had nearly a length the best of it at the mile, and, easing up slightly, beat them by half a length.  In the next heat the Thorn brothers led us by two lengths at Remenham.  We were level at Fawley and, going away, won ridiculously easily in a slow paddle.  The final against Wilkinson and Fletcher was another snorting race.  In 1890 at Oxford we had beaten them by four feet.  They got quite fast off the mark and led us by two lengths at Remenham, two and a half at Fawley, from which point I began, without quickening, to try and row them down, but gained nothing and tried spurting.  By the White House we had recovered a length and a half, but they were still clear of us; however, another desperate spurt reduced their lead to half a length at the Isthmian Enclosure, where I went mad and called on Ampthill and all his gods for one last spurt.  We wound it up and up, got level, and rowed for thirty yards or so, and our three last strokes lifted our boat over the line, winners by twelve inches.''{{ref|Nickalls3}}

[[Image:Ampthill_photo_ILN_1889.jpg|thumb|right]]At Oxford, Lord Ampthill was “a remarkably handsome, tall young man of splendid physique and great personal charm,” while in maturity he “was stout, and his strong, resonant voice and dignified manner made him a ‘master of assemblies.’”{{ref|Times1}}  With these qualities plus a “simple, straightforward character and unassuming friendliness”{{ref|Times2}} he collected presidencies, both athletic and non, to a degree rivalled only by W.H. Grenfell among the rowers of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;:  Captain of Boats and President of the Eton Society (1887-88), President of the O.U.B.C. (1891, succeeding Nickalls), President of the Union Society (1891), President of the London R.C. (1893-1935), and Pro Grand Master (1908-35, the number two spot in English Freemasonry).  Guy Nickalls made him godfather to son Gully, who recalled that Lord Ampthill “noticed that one of his chores was to take me to hear sermons.  I am somewhat relieved to think that he never carried this into effect, though through the years he showed me a great many acts of kindness and affection.”{{ref|Gully}}

Professionally, Lord Ampthill  did indeed devote himself to the management of Foreign Affairs.  He became Assistant Private Secretary to Joseph Chamberlain in the Colonial Office in 1895, Private Secretary in 1897, and Governor of Madras in 1900 at age thirty-one, and pro tem Viceroy in 1904 on the retirement of Lord Curzon, who said that in matters of administration Lord Ampthill had an old head on young shoulders.  That last position never became permanent, as he found himself increasingly allied with Indian nationals both in South and East Africa as well as their native country, and at odds with the British Government.  During the 1914-18 war, Lord Ampthill commanded a battalion of the Leicestershire Regiment and two of the Bedfordshire Regiment in France.

[[File:Lord Ampthill cornerstone for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, 2 July 1929.jpg|thumb|right|375px|Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon]]He died of pneumonia July 7, 1935, a day before Nickalls, prompting the following anonymous epigram among the various tributes in the ''Times'':

:''Oarsmen they lived, and silver goblets mark'' &lt;br&gt;
:''The well-timed prowess of their trusty blades:'' &lt;br&gt;
:''In death their rhythm kept, they now embark'' &lt;br&gt;
:''To row their long last course among the Shades.''{{ref|Times3}}  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

=== The 1890 Boat Race, Part II:  Tom Nickalls’ Insider Trading ===
Tom Nickalls, Guy’s father, co-founded the London Rowing Club in 1856.  In 1895, he presented the Nickalls’ Challenge Cup to go with the Silver Goblets, in honor of one or the other of his sons (Guy and Vivian) having won the event from 1890 to 1894.  A wealthy stockbroker, Tom knew the value of a hot tip and, as the father of the 1890 O.U.B.C. President, put that paternal access to good use before the Boat Race.  Guy’s version:

''[W]e did an enormous amount of long hard rowing and the crew were undoubtedly very fit, but about a week before the race, which was rowed on a Wednesday, we began to show signs of staleness.  On the Thursday my father came down to see us row, and it was quite palpable that we were off colour.  My father said:''

''“Why don’t you take the crew away for a change?”''

''I said:  “The O.U.B.C. have no money and cannot afford it.”''

''My father, I may say, had taken the odds of 7-2 on Cambridge very heavily.  He stood to take £7,000 off Paxton alone.''

''He telegraphed to the Grand Hotel at Brighton, booked rooms for us, and stood the crew a treat for a very long week-end, and away we went next day.  On Saturday morning, for a joke, we ordered eight bath-chairs and were pulled up and down the front.  Word was immediately telegraphed to London that all the crew were invalids, and it looked as if the race would not take place.  The weather was lovely, and we stayed at Brighton until Tuesday morning and went for a short paddle and a minute’s row in the afternoon.  A preliminary next morning, and then the race. . . .''

[After Oxford won:]  ''My father came to the quarters with George Rowe and a host of others to join in the festivities, and slipped a cheque for a hundred pounds into my hand.''{{ref|Nickalls4}}
 
&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s post-mortem (March 29, 1890):

''The sudden revulsion at the last in the betting, which installed Cambridge as hot favourites vice Oxford, arose thus.  Cambridge did a “record” time on the 20th which read A.1 on paper, -- though we discounted it somewhat in our comments last week.  Following this Cantab feat, Oxford went weak and amiss on Friday and Saturday; and if the race had been rowed on the last-named day, Cambridge must have won.  Even outsiders could see that Oxford were to pieces on Saturday.  So there was on Wednesday morning a reaction and a hurried “getting out” on the part of many early backers of Oxford.  Then the public rushed in, like sheep to a gap, and forced the odds up still more on Cambridge.  Meantime, a Sunday at Brighton had set the Oxonians up again, and on Monday they were as good as ever they had been.  Nothing could have been better than their form in surf that day; but only a few followed and watched them in the rain that afternoon.  So they never regained public favour, and started at a considerable discount.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Fletcher, William Alfred Littledale == 

=== “Flea” (Spy), March 18, 1893 ===
[[Image:Fletcher_WAL_Vanity_Fair_1893-03-18.jpg|thumb|right]]''The eldest son of Mr. Alfred Fletcher, J.P., D.L., and Director of the London and North-Western Railway Company, he was born at Allerton, near Liverpool, four-and-twenty years ago.  Having learned the rudiments of education at Cheam, he proceeded to Eton to amplify his knowledge, where he first became an inmate of Mr. (now Dr.) Warre’s House, and afterwards sojourned with Mr. Wintle.  But the river had more attraction for him than the Muses; and, although he had not been much of a boy in his early youth, he soon helped to win the Trial Eights, and went to Henley as No. 3 in the Eton Eight full five years back.  When he was not pulling an oar he played football, and was 12th man at Oppidan Wall.  At twenty he went up to the “House” at Oxford, and rowed on so well that he helped to win the Ladies’ Plate and the Thames Cup at Henley in 1889.  A year later he stroked the Oxford Eight at Putney vigorously enough to break a Cambridge run of four victories.  He was promoted to No. 7 next year, when Oxford, with one of the biggest and longest crews ever seen in a racing eight, reached “the Ship” a bare half-length in front of Cambridge.  Last year he went up one more, and at No. 6 again saw the Light Blue crew follow him home:  and in the same place he means to repeat the performance next Wednesday, having in the meantime been made President of the Oxford University Boat Club.  He has twice rowed in winning Leander crews at Henley; with Vivian Nickalls he has won the Silver Goblets; and both the Pairs and the Fours at Oxford have added to his reputation until he has come to be regarded as one of the finest galley-slaves that have yet been seen.''

''There are six feet and three inches of him, and he weighs within a few pounds of fourteen stone.  His chest, back, and stomach are all muscle; yet his shoulders are inferior and his arms comparatively inferior.  He has a ruddy face, which is even ruddier after a hard race when other men look pale.  He is so ready for a “rag” that he is always ruffling somebody’s hair; and less frequently he gets his own ruffled.  Yet is he not so ferocious a person as he pretends to be, for a child has been seen to play with him.  He takes a very large size in boots, and he is so fond of dogs that he shares his Oxford lodgings, in Alfred Street, with several of them, as well as with bow and No. 5 of his Eight.  He has just managed to struggle through the School of Political Economy, and he hopes by getting through two more easy Schools to achieve the degree which was, of course, his object when he went up to Oxford.''

''His College has presented him with a handsome salver as the benefactor of the Christ Church Boat Club.  He was a member of the Oxford Water Polo team; he has been President of the Oxford Etonian Club; and he is on the Committee of Vincent’s.  He is a capital shot, a staunch friend, and a really good fellow, full of British pluck.''

''His activity (perhaps) has earned for him the name of “Flea.”''

The Boat Race career of William Alfred Littledale Fletcher (1869-1919) illustrates H.G. Gold’s comment that “[t]he choosing of a crew must always present a matter of very great difficulty to the coach, and, when chosen, the fitting of each man into his proper place, where he will be of the greatest value, is still harder.”# {{ref|Gold}}  Late in life Guy Nickalls called Fletcher an “absolute classic” for No. 6, but as O.U.B.C. President Nickalls boated him at stroke for the 1890 Boat Race.{{ref|Nickalls}}  He was “hardly ideal” there, opined the &lt;u&gt;Official Centenary History&lt;/u&gt;, “for although his beginning was marked like lightning, his finish was deceptive and it was not until late in practice that the crew began to come to him.”{{ref|Drinkwater1}}  In Oxford’s one-length win “the doggedness, rather than the brilliance, of Fletcher was the outstanding feature.”{{ref|Drinkwater2}}  The next year Lord Ampthill did no better, putting himself at No. 6 and Fletcher at No. 7.  They won by half a length but “never developed the pace which they should have done,” muttered the Centenary History.  Lord Ampthill “had at his command eight men who were, individually, perhaps the best that have ever been seen in residence together; yet, of the greatest of these, only one, [Stroke] C.W. Kent, rowed in his right place.”{{ref|Drinkwater3}}  Finally, in 1892, President R.P.P. Rowe, the younger brother of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s G.D. Rowe, put Fletcher at No. 6 and Oxford won in record time.  The next year Fletcher kept himself there and became the first Oxford rower of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; to win four Boat Races, again in a new course record (18.45).  He ended his competitive career that season by winning the Grand with Leander and the Silver Goblets with Vivian Nickalls, a pair the Times later called “probably the fastest that ever rowed at Henley.”{{ref|Times}} 

[[Image:OUBC_VIII_standing_photo_1891.jpg|thumb|400px|OUBC 1891:  Lord Ampthill and Guy Nickalls, center seated; W.A.L. Fletcher standing second from right]]Fletcher coached the Oxford crews of 1894, 1897, and 1902-06, and the Cambridge crews of 1898-1900.  For his services on the Cam helping the light blue end Oxford’s string of Boat Race victories, the C.U.B.C. gave him a silver salver, a gold stop-watch, and two silver candelabra.{{ref|Cleaver}}  He then lost his touch, to judge from the record:  of his five pre-1901 crews, only one lost (Cambridge 1898); of his five post-1901 crews, only one won (Oxford 1905).  To the authors of the 1929 Official Centenary History, the fault lay largely and unforgivably in his abandoning the Oxford orthodox style:

''W.A.L. Fletcher was the next great coach [after R.S. de Havilland].  One of the greatest oarsmen himself, he learned the secret at Oxford and taught it to Cambridge in 1898 and 1899 -- a combination of swing and slide, together with a lightning entry -- and this was the foundation on which was built the magnificent Cambridge crew of 1900.  At that period Fletcher reached the zenith of his fame as a coach; afterwards he coached many Oxford crews, but having poor material he turned his mind to the rig of his men blaming himself for their want of success.  He forgot the physical side of oarsmanship, of which he had been so incomparable an authority, and remembered only the mechanical side.  Under his coaching, Christ Church went head of the river at Oxford and won the Grand Challenge Cup in 1908, though it is but fair to state that there was little opposition in the Grand on that occasion, in consequence of the Olympic Regatta which took place immediately after Henley; but the style taught by Fletcher, which was so successful in these Christ Church crews, did not blend with the attempts at orthodoxy in which other colleges persevered, and the effect on Oxford rowing was deplorable.''{{ref|Drinkwater4}} 

Apart from rowing and coaching, Fletcher was a big game hunter, explorer, and soldier.  Hunting and exploring took him to Siberia, Kenya, and Tibet.  Soldiering took him to South Africa and France.  He missed coaching for the 1901 Boat Race to face off against the Boers, described earlier under “Oarsmen at War” and earning a D.S.O.  “He spoke little, but meant all he said, and if he had once told a man to do something he could not imagine the possibility of its not being done -- either in rowing or anything else.”{{ref|Cook}}  In the 1914-18 war, Fletcher served as Captain of the 2/6th Rifle Battalion of the Liverpool Regiment.  His troops suffered the second mustard gas attack of the war, at Armentières in July 1917, which wiped out two companies and incapacitated 440 men, including Fletcher himself.  He was released from hospital two months later and resumed command, but was never the same and chose to give it up in July 1918.  “Few beyond his intimate friends know what it cost him to ask to be relieved, not from any sense of personal pride,” wrote a fellow captain, “but from his intense love for his battalion.”{{ref|Captain}}

In January 1919, two months after the armistice, the governors of British amateur rowing -- such as remained of it -- met in London to discuss how to revive the sport.  Attendees included Fletcher, acting chairman of the Henley Regatta; C.M. Pitman, acting secretary of the Amateur Rowing Association; G.D. Rowe, chairman of Leander; S.E. Swann, who due to the hiatus caused by the war was still President of the C.U.B.C.; and H.G. Gold.  Fletcher’s motion to hold a scaled-down Henley Regatta the next summer carried unanimously.  That event did come off, but Fletcher never saw it to fruition for he died on February 14, 1919 of broncho-pneumonia in the great influenza epidemic then sweeping the nation, which caught hold in his gas-weakened lungs.  A bronze by G.D. Drinkwater stands in his memory in the O.U.B.C. boathouse, dedicated “by rowing men of both universities.”

=== University Sports, Part II:  “The Serious Side” ===
By “Cambrioleur,” in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (March 27, 1912), covering the same ground as Woodgate had in 1873:

''Rags, bedders, dons, missions, tutors, lectures -- these are among the diversions of Cambridge life.  Our real business is the playing of games of every sort.  Nobody goes into training for a Tripos or a C.I.C.C.U. meeting, but for a Junior College Trial on the river a man will cheerfully forego his new accomplishment of smoking, rise at seven every day, and eat red beef-steaks without a murmur.  As we get up about nine o’clock and go to bed about eleven, it is clear that the hours from two to seven or eight which we spend on our games are the most important part of the day.  Real sportsmen, of course, begin their games before noon.  I remember how surprised a new lecturer was when he was compelled to change the hour of his lectures from twelve to eleven, because, as one of his pupils quite seriously explained to him, “You know, sir, you clash with the beagles.”  He had been trained in Germany, you see, and that was why he was surprised.  His dictionary informed him that a beagle was a species of dog, a Spürhund, and in Germany no professor ever clashed with a Spürhund.  It caused considerable comment a few years ago when Easter clashed with the Boat Race and the authorities refused to postpone Easter.  As I have already explained, every afternoon is a half-holiday at Cambridge.  The afternoon begins at two o’clock and ends at two o’clock on the following day.  The justification for this system -- if it needs any justification -- is that athletics at Cambridge occupy the years which are elsewhere devoted to the acquisition of bad habits, and that during his three or four years at Cambridge the undergraduate learns to throw his whole energies into something which has no monetary value -- that is, no immediate money value.  As a matter of fact, a Blue is worth about £120 per annum for life in the educational profession.  There is always a demand for Blues to instil the same earnest ideals into the rising generation of boys.  In my college everybody plays some game every afternoon -- everybody but that ass Hetherington Johnstone -- and he plays lacrosse.''

''Thus it will be seen that I have now reached the most important chapter of my theme.  I have had to sit back and take a deep breath before grappling with it.  It is frightfully momentous, this task of writing about Cambridge sport.''

''Had I the pen of “Camisis” and his almost unique knowledge of the Christian names of Cambridge athletes (the ones they don’t use and try to conceal from their best friends), had I the style of Mr. Sewell or Mr. F.B. Wilson, I might essay the task, even if I had -- as I have -- nothing whatever to say.  How is one to say anything new about the Boat Race, for example?  I observe that Mr. Guy Nickalls is rather keen on Cambridge this year, so I suppose we shall lose, as usual.  I feel convinced that the rival strokes will get their men smartly off the mark punctually to the tick of time by Putney Church clock and arrive at Mortlake about twenty minutes later.  Four or Five in one of the boats will show visible signs of distress, and Swann will spurt gamely more than once.  It will be a ding-dong struggle past the Doves, and daylight will be showing between the rival eights at Chiswick Eyot.  Of that much I feel confident.  But who will reach Mortlake first and by how much, and who will be defeated, but not disgraced, and what the dickens it matters if they do -- these things are hidden from my eyes.  I know that when Saturday comes I shall rush for a halfpenny paper like the rest of the world and feel seriously depressed for half-an-hour if we are beaten.  Thousands of staid parsons and their doctors and solicitors will do just the same; and nobody will know why.''

''When the sun has been harnessed to drive our mills, and when we have captured the energy of the tides, some philosopher will arise and seek to turn this immense output of power from the brains and muscles of two or three thousand young men, the pick of the country, into some useful and productive channel.  I believe they could drive a torpedo boat if they were properly geared.  Centuries ago there was a misguided youth at St. Abbs Hall, the son of an American commission agent, who determined to turn an honest penny out of the boat-racing.  Under the guidance of friends, who, I fear, judged his leg to be suitable for elongation, he opened a book on the Mays.  As soon as the college was aware of this the entire eight, with their cox, came to him secretly by night, one at a time, and asked him what odds he would give against them staying head of the river.  He started with cox at evens, but before he had got to bow he was giving three to one.  They all invested half-a-crown against their boat.  The thing seemed a dead cert. for him after that.  When the rest of the college rolled up to back their boat he cheerfully gave them five to one.  He booked nearly a hundred bets in sovereigns on those terms.  Of course, the boat stayed head -- in fact, it did the course in record time, and the precocious layer found that he had to balance nine half-crowns against five hundred sovereigns.''

''This prodigious industry of athletics is mainly a growth of the last twenty years, though the Boat Race and the cricket match have been in existence for over seventy.  Thirty years ago the average man was content to exercise himself on the Trumpington Grind, a solemn pedestrian excursion of five or six miles with conversational accompaniments.  Now there are about twenty-five different games of sufficient rank to provoke inter-University contest.  Of Blues and Half-Blues there must be nearly 200, all heroes.  We speak of them with bated breath.  Yesterday morning I heard two freshmen under my window.''

''“Did you notice that chap in the corner?”''

''“Yes; he seemed a harmless sort of person.”''

''“Harmless!  That was Spinks, the hockey Blue.”''

''“Good Lord!  And I talked to him as if he’d been just anybody!”''

''Unlike most ‘Varsity oars he does not come from Eton, but reflects credit on Durham School, where he first learned to pull under the winged words of Mr. R.H. Poole; who had himself gone through the mill at Oxford before he rowed bow of the Dark Blue Eight fourteen years ago.  From Durham he went to Trinity Hall in the October term of 1890, got into the Cambridge Eight at No. 7 in the year following; sat on the same thwart for two years, was “promoted” to No. 3 last year, and rowed at No. 6 on Saturday:  whence it is clear that he can row on either side of a boat.  On the Cam he has won the University Fours and Pairs, and he has also rowed at the Head of the River; though last year, as Captain of the Hall Boat Club, he rowed in the second boat and suffered bumps.  At Henley, too, he has had his successes, having helped to win the Visitors’ for his College, and rowing No. 3 in the high class Leander Eight which carried off the Grand Challenge last year.  Having achieved so much he was very properly chosen President of the Cambridge University Boat Club, when Mr. G.C. Kerr, of Trinity (also, oddly enough, a Durham man), left that pinnacle of aquatic fame vacant last summer.  For he is generally held to be both a good oar and a good fellow.''

''He is a very strong young man, whose hair and moustachios are as white as his face is sometimes red; and, like most of our strong young barbarians, he is quite a good-tempered fellow.  He is known as “Fogg,” and he is a puzzle; for it is impossible to tell where his forehead ends and his nose begins.  Yet is he quite a popular boy, who is not nearly so fierce as he often looks.  He was only beaten last Saturday because the Oxford crew were better than his own.''

''He has occasional flashes of dry humour; and he thinks that he can wrestle.''

After his appearance in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, Charles Thurston Fogg-Elliot (1870-1955) completed his rowing career by racing for Trinity Hall in the 1896 Grand.  After university, he became secretary to Lords Barnard and Curzon, Curzon noting that Fogg-Elliot’s taciturnity and flowing yellow mustache made him seem “like of forlorn Viking.”  In the 1914-18 war he was Captain in the Fourth Battalion of the Durham Light Infantry.

=== Henley 1893:  A Woodgate Sampler ===
[[Image:CUBC_VIII_photo_ILN_1892.jpg|thumb|right|330px|CUBC VIII, 1892]]
From about 1890 to 1906, W.B. Woodgate previewed and dissected the Boat Race and Henley Regatta for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;.  Here is one of his full Henley reports, from July 13, 1893:

''A very thirsty Henley!  Seldom, if ever, have more fluids been consumed on the course.  On the third day even Leander were run out of mineral waters soon after 5 p.m.  Houseboats were rather fewer.  The very proper concession of Oxon frontages to some of the London Clubs has reduced the space available for houseboat moorings.  In my opinion, every houseboat or owner thereof that advertised “to be let for the regatta,” after having obtained the favour of an anchorage, should be rigidly refused any entrée to the course in future.  These moorings are dispensed to enable certain subscribers to the regatta to enjoy their holiday and to entertain, if they desire to do so.  They are not given that they may be turned into cash by sub-letting.  I hope the Conservancy will see to stopping this abuse in the future.''

''The throng on the river was great just before and after lunch each day and mostly so on Friday.  I deprecate the current fashion of punt paddling when carried to any pace in excess of one and a-half miles in the hour.  A punt holds a good deal of momentum, especially when laden with three or four damsels and their swains lounging on cushions in her.  She is not under control like a boat handled with sculls:  paddles cannot back water nor hold her sharply when collision is imminent.  At the same time, the resource of paddling from the stern of punts or skiffs has great charms for the tyro.  It looks easier, and is easier, to a beginner, than the manipulation of sculls in a crowd.  Hence the superabundance of this mode of propulsion on regatta days.  All sorts and conditions of land-lubbers loaf on the river at a modern Henley Regatta.  Thirty years ago, when there was not one-sixth of the present fleet of pleasure craft, it was considered bad form to figure in a boat unless fully competent and up to racing class (at the regatta).''

''One piece of bad form has, I am glad to see, almost wholly vanished during the last four years -- namely, the display of coloured flannel coats (called “blazers”), pertaining to no recognised aquatic Club, still less to any Club that competes at Henley.  Lawn-tennis jackets of an abnormal medley of colours, village cricket Club coats, etc., were for a season or two recently flaunted on the Reach by land-lubbers.  Now they are properly scouted, and those who do not belong to contending Clubs wear plain mufti flannel jackets.''

''N.B.-- The old term “blazer” was applied only to a few of the more gorgeous College boating coats -- e.g., Lady Margaret, Magdalen, Balliol, Exeter; more sober jackets like those of Jesus (Cambridge), Trinity Hall, Pembroke Oxon, Dublin, the U.B.C.’s, Black Prince, and University College, each and all time-honoured on the course, were not so styled.  When lawn tennis begat “Joseph coats” in every village nook, then the term “blazer” was snapped up and extended to these monstrosities.''

''The rowing was a very good standard in every entry.  Leander were far ahead of all the Eights.  They won the final heat of the “Grand” only half extended by London.  London had beaten Thames with some ease, and Thames had disposed of the French crew.  Black Prince was not in it, and Dublin, after a fast and gallant start, were equally left behind in their heat against Leander.  Many had thought that a Cantab No. 7 might row “scissors” to an Oxford stroke; but Kerrison suited Kent well, and behind these two the rest of the men settled down to a mighty sweeping swing that carried all before it.  The crew never once really galloped after halfway; had they done so, probably records would have been cut.  As it was to win in 6 min. 56 sec. at a paddle from the head boat of Oxford (Magdalene) was a large order; and Magdalene had in their crew six “Blues,” two of them re-inlistments since the College races.  The change of stroke, putting Guy Nickalls there, improved the Magdalene Eight in the last week; but they had not the all-round strength of Leander, nor were some of the men so long in the reach and swing, but untidy in finish, which hampered them.  They improved much after they left their own storm-tossed tideway and reached smooth water.  Another ten days, if they could have remained in England, would have made them very formidable for the Metropolitan Regatta.''

''London were second best; a good long reach forward, no bucket, and a ‘Varsity swing.  Their fault was the feather under water; had they rowed as clean as Leander they might almost have won, for they were in better condition.  One or two Leander men needed another fortnight’s training.  Thames had some weak spots among their new hands, and though the general style was good, they had to lose their heat against their old rivals, London.''

[[Image:Henley_regatta_course_map_1893.jpg|thumb|right|380px|The &quot;New Course&quot; (1886 - 1922) from the 1893 program)]]''The Stewards’ Fours were a good lot -- either Thames or Chester good enough to win in many a season; but Magdalene were too good for all of them.  The outcry against Thames for boring the Frenchmen in their heat was only excusable under the impulse of chivalry to visitors.  No sane man who has seen Thames R.C.’s performances year after year ought to have dreamed of supposing that a bit of bad steering inferred foul play.  The T.R.C. are too thorough sportsmen for any such game.  Anyone may make an error in the heat of a race.  The sportsman who shoots behind a hare or under a rocketer, and tailors his game for the nonce, might as reasonably be accused of blundering on purpose.  Besides, with a competent umpire, lynx-eyed, in his wake, it would always be insanity for even an evil-disposed pilot to go out of his way to foul.  If the race had been between two British crews, no one would have heard another word of the affair.  The French style was quite British, and rather Oxonian; the French eight was about the stamp of a College crew halfway up the Oxford river.  The men were weaker all round than most of their opponents, and not fully together.  They would have made a good bid for the Thames Cup, and should about have won it; but as a matter of sport it was more correct and more plucky for them to fly at the highest game.  Their four was better class than their eight; better together, cleaner, and speedier of its sort.  The Frenchmen show that they appreciate the right principles of rowing.  Some day, if they get stronger men and better together, they may turn the tables on us.  Their boats are very well built, and fast.''

''Eton were a very hot crew, better than many of the Grand crews.  Radley rowed exceedingly well, but had not the strength and age of the Etonians.  It was a big order for the two boy crews to beat the various College crews, including the head of the Cam, in the way that they did.  The pick of these two boy eights are going to Oxford, so it is said; which ought to make it rosy hereafter for the O.U.B.C. at Putney.''

''Third Trinity were a good College four, and well earned the Visitors’ Cup.  Medway made a good début and a bold bid for the Wyfold.  Their stroke’s recovery and finish might well be copied by many of the crack crews.  Molesey just beat them; but the two crews were well ahead in merit of the rest of their field.  In the Pairs, Fletcher and Vivian Nickalls were facile principes much the stronger; for style nothing was better than the Ford and Holland pair.  Guy Nickalls had an easy win in the Sculls.  Everyone appreciated the sportsmanlike manner in which he pulled up for a restart with Boyd, the Dublin sculler, when the latter had jammed his slide and stopped for repairs.  Boyd and Kennedy, each in his turn, spread-eagled good opponents, but could make no headway against the resurrectionised ex-Oxford sculler, who seems to be as good an oar as ever -- may be even better.''

''There has been in certain journals a grumble against Leander and the composition of their crews, based upon the assumption that they monopolise all the talent, and so leave to other Clubs no material wherewith to win a Grand Challenge.  Now, of last year’s winning Leander (Grand) crew, three of the best men were this year rowing for Magdalene, and another for New College, while Leander men were to be found in every crew of note.  Each and all of these rowed for their College (or other) Clubs in priority to Leander; and the latter Club had to make up its team from what resources were left to it.  That those remaining resources were strong is due to the prestige of the Club, which secures such a pick of membership.''

''Leander is not a “nursery” Club.  It does not profess to educate oarsmen.  Herein it differs essentially from University and from tideway Clubs, which teach the tyro ab ovo.  Whereas the first rule of Leander is that the qualifications for admission to its pale are “good fellowship and proficiency in oarsmanship.”''

''Until an oarsman has graduated and has well earned his spurs, he is not even eligible for the Club.  It is this principle which secures so much competition for admission to the Leander fold.  The uniform is of itself a “diploma” in oarsmanship.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pitman, Charles Murray == 

=== “O.U.B.C.” (Spy), March 28, 1895 ===

[[Image:Pitman_CM_Vanity_Fair_1895-03-28.jpg|thumb|right]]''At Eton, once upon a time, a crew of eight Pitmans beat an eight of Mr. Cornish’s House in a boat race.  Charles Murray is the seventh of eight brothers; who included F.I. Pitman, the famous Light Blue stroke of 1884, 1885, and 1886, and T.T. Pitman, of the Eton Eight, who won the Half Mile Championship.  Born in Edinburgh three-and-twenty years ago, he began to acquire book-learning at Temple Grove, East Sheen; whence he went to Eton, rowed and became Captain of the Boats, sculled, played the Wall game, learned a little more, and did other wholesome things; after which he went to New College and stroked a first-rate Oxford eight in his first year.  A year later he rowed No. 7, and last year he stroked another eight:  an office that he is to repeat on Saturday, when he hopes to watch eight Cambridge galley-slaves toiling in his wake for most of the distance between Putney and Mortlake.  His other rowing achievements include the Grand and the Visitors’ at Henley, and the Oxford University Sculls, Pairs and Fours.  He is the newest President of the Oxford University Boat Club, and a typical young barbarian of the better sort.''

''He is a cheerful, wholesome boy, full of pluck.  He is also stroke of much judgment and an oar who always pulls his weight.  He therefore proposes presently to get called to the Bar.  He can tell a good story with pleasing inaccuracy, and he is often accused of unpunctuality; yet no one dislikes him.  He is inclined to be lazy outside a boat; he can shoot, and he has been seen trying to play golf.''

''He is the ruddy Secretary of Vincent’s; who is happily called “Cherry.”''

Like H.B. Cotton, his predecessor as O.U.B.C. President, Charles Murray Pitman (1872-1948) won four successive Boat Races.  In addition to the races listed in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, he rowed for New College in the Grand (1895-96), the Stewards’ (1895), and the Silver Goblets (1895-96) but took home no hardware on those occasions.

After taking his third class in law and history, Pitman became a barrister of the Inner Temple practising on the London and Southeast Circuit.  During the 1914-18 war he served as assistant to the Judge Advocate of the Fleet, became Judge Advocate in 1924, and from 1933-45 was Official Referee of the Supreme Court.  But he made time to co-author &lt;u&gt;Rowing&lt;/u&gt; (with R.P.P. Rowe, 1898) and the &lt;u&gt;Record of the University Boat Race&lt;/u&gt; (1909, and coach various crews on orthodox lines, including the 1920 Olympic eight.  He was Captain of Leander in 1896, Secretary from 1905 to 1920, and President from 1942 to 1946.

By the way, “young barbarian,” a phrase &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; used with both Pitman and C.T. Fogg-Elliot, hales from &lt;u&gt;Culture and Anarchy&lt;/u&gt;, an influential 1869 tract by Matthew Arnold of political and social criticism.  Arnold segmented British society into the aristocracy, middle, and working classes in a chapter entitled “Barbarians, Philistines, Populace,” comparing Victorian aristocrats to the ancient Barbarians “to whom we all owe so much, and who reinvigorated and renewed our worn-out Europe”:

''The Barbarians . . . had the passion for field-sports; and they have handed it on to our aristocratic class, who of this passion too, as of the passion for asserting one’s personal liberty, are the great natural stronghold.  The care of the Barbarians for the body, and for all manly exercises; the vigour, good looks, and fine complexion which they acquired and perpetuated in their families by these means, -- all this may be observed still in our aristocratic class.''{{ref|Arnold}}

=== The Silvery Thames ===
Pitman entertained rowing friends from around the world at Remenham Lodge, his “White House” overlooking the Henley course.  Here is  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s nostalgic and Imperialist paean to the river (July 3, 1912), alluding to the Henley Regatta visit by King George V and Queen Mary, the first by a reigning monarch:

''The presence of Henley Week, which this year will indeed be Royal in more senses than one, is but one more needed reminder that the River Thames does not, in fact, never has received the homage which it deserves.  The lines of Sir Walter Raleigh cannot be equalled for a poetic epitome of the glories of the most famous of the world’s rivers: --''

''“There are two things scarce matched in the universe -- the sun in heaven and the Thames on earth.”''

''When one considers that the first University, the most famous of our public schools, to say nothing of the metropolis of the Empire, it is no matter of wonderment that the Imperialist is as proud of the Thames as any Oxonian or the Etonian who is privileged to claim that masterpiece of Henry of Wykeham as his Alma Mater.  To the historian the places mentioned are but mere passing references to shrines of historic fact, to which must necessarily be added Windsor and Hampton Court.  But it is to the lover of the beautiful that the Thames reveals its manifold charms.  There may perhaps be more majestic charms in the grandeur of the Rhine or the St. Lawrence, or even in the wooded slopes of the Meuse or the Moselle, but to the lover of a silver stream set in a long, river valley, rich in English, beautiful, interchanging meadowland and forest, it is certain that the glorious Thames, to the artist, has charms that a brush delights to paint such vistas as the view of Windsor Castle from the river, or the quietude of a summer’s evening at Mapledurham Mill.''

''It is indeed a pity that society has hitherto despised the Thames, and neither would it be just to attribute such neglect to the much detracted English climate, for some of the best summers we have had have seen this curious cold shoulder turned on the river; and it is to be feared, with the exception of the Brigade of Guards Regatta and Henley, the Thames is a dead letter, and consequently has become deplorably bourgeois.  The only saving feature of the situation is the steady, consistent lovers of the river, to whom its old abbeys, churches, and bridges with a storied past alternate with riverside houses, gardens, and houseboats.  Here a stretch of dark, still water; there the splashing murmur of a tossing weir, and then a quiet, ancient village, which is so typical of the rural life which has been so characteristic of English country peace for so many centuries.''

''It is easy to understand how the River Thames has been identified so closely with English life and runs like a silver thread through the main events of our history.  Its very situation has made it the natural centre of all the great events that have occurred in its vicinity.  Not a century since the occupation by the Romans of London has the Thames valley been without the addition of some fresh monument of an historical character, and hardly a space has not some cherished memory.  Oxford, Abingdon, Reading, Runnymede are but links in that chain of events that has made the reading of English history a delight of all literary students.  It was my full intention, being Henley Week, to have devoted a large amount of space to the Thames I love so well, but I hope to return to the charge next week.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Crum, Walter Erskine == 

=== “Crumbo” (Spy), March 19, 1896 ===

[[Image:Crum_WE_Vanity_Fair_1896-03-19.jpg|thumb|right]]''Mr. Walter Eskine Crum, who is always called “Crumbo,” was born nearly two-and-twenty years ago:  and he is now quite a fine specimen of young English manhood.  Having learned to play cricket at Castlemount, Dover, he went to Mr. Durnford’s at Eton; where he took to the water so naturally that four years ago he was rowing for Eton at Henley.  After this he was made Captain of the Boats; and, when he went up to New College in October, 1893, he got his Blue while yet a freshman.  He has twice won the University Fours; and twice, with Pitman, has he beaten all other ‘Varsity Pairs.  He has also helped to win the Grand and the Visitors’ at Henley; and next week he hopes, for the third time, to see eight Cambridge men toiling behind his boat from Hammersmith to Mortlake.''

''His chief peculiarities are a beautiful complexion, an almost girlish look, a very frequent blush (which is the outcome of much modesty), a temper that will bear much chaff, and a chin that in times of depression looks as though it would fall off and explode on the floor.  Nevertheless, he is so generally liked that he gets their best work out of his men, and consequently he makes an excellent Dark Blue President.  His rowing is so exceedingly graceful, easy, and effective, that he is probably one of the best No 7’s that ever sat in a boat; wherefore his uncle, Mr. J. C. Tinné -- that magnificent Dark Blue heavy-weight of the late sixties -- shows an amount of pride in the boy that is quite refreshing to witness.  Beyond this he is a sportsman who can shoot high pheasants very well; while he has played football and taken a third class in Mathematical Moderations, and means to do something scientific in his Finals.  He is a very well-built young fellow of much symmetry and proportion, except as to his arms; which are long.  He is full of youth, and he delights in a bonfire.  Nevertheless, he is a very good fellow, and a cheerful, staunch friend who displays much ignorance of our standard novelists.''

''He wears large boots.''

Walter Eskine Crum (1874-1923) won four Boat Races (1894-97), as well as the Ladies’ (1893 for Eton), Visitors’ (1894 for New College), and Grand (1894 and 1897 for New College).  To the Times “he ranked among the best No. 7’s Oxford has ever known; for grace and ease of style he was, indeed, the ideal oarsman.”{{ref|Times}}  It is thus all the more amazing that he and C.M. Pitman, who together won the 1895 University Pairs, were unable to hold off Guy and Vivian Nickalls in that year’s Goblets, as Guy described:

''In the afternoon, in the Pairs, “V.” and I met Crum and Pitman in the heat for the Goblets.  Fifty yards above the top of the Island I steered into a pile, a fearful crack which split the boat.  Luckily, we were rowing with swivels, and it didn’t take long to clear ourselves and get going again, but in the interlude, Pitman and Crum spurted and had taken several lengths off us.  With a very leaky boat and a bent rowlock we started out to chase them.  It looked hopeless, but by dint of great efforts and a high stroke, we caught them at the half-mile mark.  We led at Fawley by half a length, getting slower and slower as the water rose over our heel traps.  By superhuman efforts we had a length and a half at the mile, with the water over my insteps.  The water continued to rise, and we were not clear of them when we passed over the line.''{{ref|Nickalls}} 

Professionally, Crum spent his short life in India, where he became President of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, a member of the Imperial Legislative Council, and was knighted in 1920.  During the 1914-18 war he was a major in the Calcutta Light Horse.  He died of heart failure in 1923 while in New York on business.

=== The 1896 Boat Race ===
W.B. Woodgate’s account for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (April 2, 1896):

''A better race was never seen between two eights from Putney to Mortlake; also a better average of joint style and merit, in most adverse circumstances of weather, would be hard to find.  The wind and water were enough to knock most crews out of form in half a mile; and yet, in these two crews, style was maintained to the end -- no going to pieces, no rowing short.  In the last minute Cambridge were twice buried in spray from rollers which struck the after stroke side rowlocks, and which smothered the looms of the oars on that side to an extent to check recovery for the instant.  Except for this, the losers, as well as winners, might have been paddling on parade from the start, so far as level action was concerned.''

[[Image:Boat_race_rough_water_above_Barnes_photo_1896.jpg|thumb|right|370px|Rough water above Barnes bridge]]
''The merits of strategy and generalship, which snatched the race out of the fire for Oxford, are self-apparent.  The Metropolitan Course is, all round, a fair one -- on smooth water.  That is, the trends and bends on one side are sooner or later practically counterpoised by similar concessions to the opposite station.  Surrey side is voted modern times the best, generally speaking, under the “revised” rules of boat-racing which forbid taking of water save at peril.  The reason for the choice is that the main advantage accrues in the first twelve to thirteen minutes of the race, and is enough, geometrically, to enable the crew on that side, if otherwise equal in pace with its rival, to obtain a clear length’s lead at Thorneycroft’s, and so cross clear, and enjoy the benefit of the bend to the right for the rest of the course:  the rival, by hypothesis, being no better, and therefore unable to overtake and to claim evacuation of the stolen water.  It was in 1870 that Oxford set fashion at defiance by choosing this side after winning the toss.  It was only this that enabled them to make so good a fight as they did on that occasion.  Since then the merits of the Surrey side have been more appreciated; and it has usually, though not always, been selected since that date.  In a nor’-easter, off the Fulham shore, the old favourite side, Middlesex, remains the best.  The Surrey station had extra advantage this year up to Chiswick, because of the beam wind which blew in Putney Reach, in which wind Oxford were to leeward.  That Oxford should have been only their own length behind at Thorneycroft’s with all this handicap is evidence that up to that point they must have been virtually travelling the faster of the two.  Accordingly, when at last the vantage of station became theirs, it was but a sequitur that they should begin to overhaul the leaders; and the only question was whether they had time to complete their task before the drop of the judge’s flag.''

''It is curious to note how the sporting Press plumped for Cambridge, and how they after the event attempted to make excuses for their miscalculation of relative merits.  The critics pinned their faith on the short-distance spins of Cambridge against sundry scratch eights, in which great speed was shown.   They overlooked the relative want of staying power shown by Cambridge when they last rowed a full course on the ebb.  Also, by a sort of blind consent, Oxford’s stroke was voted and published as “short” compared to that of Cambridge.  Yet, in the race, this so-called “shorter” stroke held its own from the outside station in the worst of the wind; doing some one and a-half (average of) strokes per minute fewer than the Cambridge men did during the first two-thirds of the course.  This fact shows that eyesight was at fault when it measured the Oxford reach as the shorter of the two -- not that Cambridge were short:  far from it.  Why the Oxford stroke had more propelling power, stroke for stroke, than that of Cambridge seems to be this:  Oxford had rather more grip of the “beginning”; Cambridge rather “felt” the water before they threw their full force on to the oar.  On the other hand, Oxford had more of a “drive” at the instant of catching the water, and so got well hold of the boat before she began to slip away.  If a light boat is not caught sharp at the beginning of the stroke, much of her resistance is distributed, thereby lessening the effect of the stroke.  Slow burning powders are well enough for heavy missiles; for pellets a quick propulsion is needed.''

''Two more powerful crews have seldom, if ever, opposed each other.  Differing from the sporting Press, I estimate these crews as being both of them faster than the average, and better over the course than last year’s winners.  Some of the men were extra good; all were up to par, and worthy of being “Blues” -- and this cannot be said every year -- still less of the whole list of ordinary losing crews.  Even winners often contain a man or two who only gets his seat because, though he is bad, other candidates are worse; and he is admittedly many degrees below the standard of his colleagues.  Nothing of this sort can be said of any of the sixteen this season.  It is hard lines that so good a stroke as Fernie, and so good a crew as that behind him, should be unable to score a win by reason of clashing with an extra good crew.''

''Jack Clasper, the builder, deserves commendation for his handiwork, both as to power of holding way after the stroke, and also for buoyancy in rough water.  The manner in which both ships rode through the waters was admirable.''

''The accounts of the relative positions of the boats during the race, as shown on diagrams and in text, are conflicting, and in many cases, I think, erroneous.  The greatest lead which Cambridge had was just when the boats straightened for Corney Reach, below Chiswick Eyot.  There were 35 feet to 40 feet of daylight then.  It is erroneous, not to say uncomplimentary to both strokes, to depict them, as some reports do, spurting suddenly in the middle of the course at from 30 a minute to 34 or more, and then dropping back again to slower stroke.  That is not the way in which high-class strokes race.  Nor were the two strokes guilty of such mistakes.  Save at a pinch, to save a cross or to reach a winning-post a few lengths off, strokes do not suddenly quicken nor whimsically vary their rate.  They try to settle down to the rate which does them and their men best justice, with regard to water, wind, and position in the course.  If they quicken, they do so gradually, not to risk dislocation of swing.  It reads graphically in a report to speak of violent “spurts” in the middle of a long course; but these spurts exist only in the imagination of the non-aquatic reporters.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Guinness, Rupert Edward Cecil Lee (''Lord Iveagh'') == 

=== “Rupert” (Spy), November 9, 1905 ===

[[Image:Guinness_RECL_Vanity_Fair_1905-11-09.jpg|thumb|right]]''Rupert Edward Cecil Lee Guinness, the heir to Viscount Iveagh and appropriate millions, is a plump, square, well-complexioned young man, who looks out upon a friendly world with a shrewd good nature.''

''At Eton he set himself to the oar with the best will in the world.  He won the School Sculling in ‘92, and rowed in the fine Eton eight which won the Ladies’ Plate at Henley in ‘93.  He looked sweet in his blue coat, as was then universally admitted.  Arriving in due course at Cambridge, he was welcomed by “Third Trinity” as a valuable rowing asset.  He won the Diamonds at Henley in ‘95 and the Diamonds and Wingfield Sculls in ‘96.  But he had the bad luck to develop a weakness of heart, which kept him from his place in the Cambridge eight.  Since his University days he has served in Africa with the Irish hospital, and become a politician, a Director of the London and North-Western, a member of the L.C.C., and the commander of the London Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, whose saucey fleet lies proudly at anchor off Blackfriars Bridge.  He is contesting Haggerston, and his supporters in that constituency are confident of his success, as is ever the custom of their kind.''

''He used to hunt before he motored.  He is quite a good shot.  He is a strong Tariff Reformer.  His popularity in Haggerston is not diminished by his generosity and the interest he takes in the Workmen’s Rowing Club on the Lee.  He is not a great orator, but has a breezy, direct style of speaking which scores his points and tells on political platforms.  He is a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron, but is rarely ill at sea.  He has a taste for old furniture, and has of late been adorning his new house in St. James’s Square.  He is most fortunately and happily married.  He never gambles; but he has had adventures.''

[[Image:Bill_East_cigarette_card_c1885.jpg|thumb|right]][[w:Rupert_Guinness%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Iveagh|Rupert Edward Cecil Guinness]] (1874-1967) joined Thames R.C. while a Cambridge undergraduate to have a London base to train with Bill East, the 1891 English professional sculling champion.  “[A]lthough not what any one would term a born sculler,” Guy Nickalls recalled, “[Guinness] confined himself to sculling and obtained useful proficiency by dint of long and careful practice with East.”{{ref|Nickalls}}  This “useful proficiency” included beating Guy or his brother Vivian or both to win the Diamonds and the Wingfield Sculls in 1895 and 1896, a hard thing to do those years.  Many years later Guinness, then head of the family firm, rewarded East by setting him up as landlord of the Three Pigeons pub in Richmond.{{ref|Page}}  Until being moved to the Henley River and Rowing Museum, the boat that carried Guinness’ thirteen-stone hung in the balcony of the Thames R.C., of which he was president from 1911 until his death fifty-six years later.  He was also president of the National Amateur Rowing Association.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; featured Guinness before his unsuccessful 1906 run for Parliament.  He won the Haggerston seat two years later, lost it in 1910, and was reelected in 1912 for southeast Essex -- the seat F.C. Rasch, another Eton and Third Trinity oarsman, had held from 1886 to 1908.  Guinness kept it until 1927, when on the death of his father he became the Earl of Iveagh and chairman of Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co., Ltd.  Despite the responsibilities of running a major brewing company he spent considerable time and money throughout his life on science and philanthropy, in recognition for which he became chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin and of the University of Reading and a fellow of the Royal Society.  He was a governor of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine endowed by his father, and founded the Wright-Fleming Institute of Microbiology.  Guinness also funded research at the Rothamsted Institute (formerly owned by yet another Eton and Third Trinity oarsman, C.B. Lawes), and advanced dairy farming through bottling and sterilization methods to reduce the incidence of bovine tuberculosis, among other measures.  By the end of his life, Elveden, his Suffolk estate, became the largest dairy farm in England, producing over a half a million gallons of milk per year.  Like his rowing career -- fueled by a vision, will power, and resources -- “[t]he experiment succeeded largely because of Lord Iveagh’s driving persistence and determinination to carry it through and because he had the means to experiment on so large a scale, and the resources to be able to accept losses on the farm in the early years before the enterprise could become fully efficient and eventually profitable.”{{note|DNB}}

=== Henley 1895 and 1896:  The Diamond Sculls ===
Vivian Nickalls, Guy’s younger brother, beat Rupert Guinness in the 1894 Diamonds by three-quarters of a length.  The following year Guinness returned the favor on Guy, who at the time had already raced for (and won) the Pairs, the Stewards’, and the Wyfolds, the second being in his opinion “a really magnificent race, ding-dong the whole damned way over the course” against a “very hot Thames R.C. four” that included S.D. Muttlebury.  Guinness, by contrast, “confined his efforts to sculling” and thus had only had “two nice gentle pipe-openers and no race out of him that day.”{{note|Nickalls2}}  W.B. Woodgate, who in his day likewise raced several events at one regatta, enjoyed Guinness’ performance but sympathized with the tired Nickalls in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 18, 1895):

''It was temporary insanity of Guy Nickalls, glutton for work and stayer though he is, to tackle a vastly improved sculler like young Guinness in the final “Diamonds” heat after the severe prior races and on the leeward station, while Guinness was fresh.  Guy Nickalls struggled grandly all the way, but could never get on level terms with his man.  Only those who have gone to the post a second and third time in a day, after punishing races, can realise the actual pain of warming up stiff and tired muscles in the first half of the race, and the limp feeling of weariness towards the close, when depleted muscle can no longer strain to its normal power.  Guinness has now got his hands beautifully level, both on entry and on feather; his sliding also has much improved; he might still nurse his slide a trifle later after the first catch, and emulate Hanlan’s actions; but anyhow he is already high-class, and will become a clinker.''

Guy Nickalls had pulled a bicep at Henley but three weeks later met Guinness again, in the Wingfield Sculls, which he recounted thus:

''I was a fool to go for the Wingfield’s, three weeks later, as I should have known that if an arm once gives on the tideway it nearly always goes again, and that is exactly what happened.  When I was leading comfortably at the Doves my arm suddenly went again, and as he passed me, I told Rupert he need not hurry as my arm had given out.  Opposite Thorneycroft’s he hit a log, and knocked a slice off the blade of his scull, which made his work all lop-sided.  Above Barnes my pilot kept shouting to me to go on, but I shook my head.  It was impossible with my arm to make any effort when, suddenly, I found myself catching him and at last level, and, only twenty yards to go, I made a despairing effort, got ahead, and then the gate of my swivel burst open.  Out came my scull and overboard I went, and we both literally floated together over the winning post, but, as he was in his boat and I was not, he naturally won, and my only salve came some two days later when my brother Vivian beat him in the final and won his third [Metropolitan] Championship.''

The next year, in 1896, Guinness met and beat Vivian Nickalls in the Diamonds.  Woodgate’s verdict for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 16, 1896):

''The sculling was of a higher class than I can remember.  I have seen better scullers than Guinness, the winner -- e.g., Guy Nickalls -- when at his best, the late T.C. Edwardes-Moss and (young) Frank Playford; but I never saw so many rivals each of whom was better than many a man whose name stands on the silver plates of the Diamonds box -- V. Nickalls, Swann, and Beaumont as instances.  To have been the best in such a field is of itself a record in the annals of the prize.  V. Nickalls was handicapped by handling an oar in two other crews, while his opponents could stick solely to sculling.  My estimate of the detraction of oars upon sculling practice is this:  If A and B are dead-level scullers on the 1st of April, then A goes to work with an oar, and grinds regularly and hard in a crew (in order to keep that crew going, and to get it into condition), and only sculls in spare moments up to the 1st of July, while B meantime devotes himself solely to sculling, B will be some four lengths better in a nine minutes’ race than A by the 1st of July; and it will take A another two or three months exclusive sculling after that to get back to level terms with B.''

''The reason is that the main speed in sculling depends on level actions of hands -- into the water and out of it.  If one hand gets one-twentieth of a second start or a fraction of an inch more stretch, or one blade varies one degree of an angle in the water, the boat turns to the pressure:  then the advantage stolen by the one hand has to be abandoned and eased off before the end of the same stroke, in order to bring the keel straight.  All this is waste of powder and loss of speed.  Now, an oar does not work a man all through in one plane; hence it tends to produce some irregularity in sculling action when the oarsman presently uses the same muscles from a sculling seat.  Still more, the time spent at the oar is lost to sculling practice.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Gold, Harcourt Gilbey == 

=== “Tarka” (Spy), March 23, 1899 ===

[[Image:Gold_HG_Vanity_Fair_1899-03-23.jpg|thumb|right]]''The President of the Oxford University Boat Club, who hopes to stroke his fourth ‘Varsity Eight to victory on Saturday, became the fourth (and last) son of Mr. Henry Gold, of Hedsor, in Bucks, three-and-twenty years ago.  Having acquired the name of “Tarka” in the nursery when his own name was too big for him, he went to Eton; where he is still remembered in “Hoppy’s” House.  He took to the oar so well that for three successive years he stroked the Eton Eight to victory in the Race for the Ladies’ Plate at Henley; and his memory is so strong that Eton has gone on winning that Plate ever since.  So he was made Captain of the Boats -- after he had got his Field Colours for football; and, accordingly, like so many good Eton oars, went to Oxford, to provide Magdalene College with a credit to the Isis.  He was made stroke of the ‘Varsity Eight right off; and in his first race he cut Cambridge down almost on the post, winning after a desperate struggle.  In 1897 he stroked one of the best Oxford Eights ever sent out, and won again; and last year he was able to watch Cambridge rowing after him to the Ship.  Besides this, he stroked Leander at Henley in 1896, when he won the Grand Challenge and defeated Yale; and, though New College just beat him the year after, he won the same race at last year’s Regatta; while in two of three years he also stroked the Leander Four to victory in the race for the Stewards’ Cup.  Yet with all these and other triumphs he has never won a race at Eton or Oxford with the single exception of the ‘Varsity Pairs in 1897!''

''He is a sturdily-built young fellow, with extraordinary powers of endurance; who can probably get as much out of seven other men in a boat as any stroke living.  He is a good fellow and an all-round sportsman; who, while he can ride well and shoot with promise, hates walking.  Nevertheless, in pious imitation of his father (who thinks nothing of playing sixty holes a day on the Hedsor links), he has lately taken to golf.  He has a dry humour that is quite his own; he can play the host; he can tell a story; but, unlike the rest of his family, he does not sing -- much.  He has met the examiners on several occasions; and, though sometimes defeated, he has managed in the end to score.''

''He has wonderful knees; and his legs are always loudly appreciated by the crowd at Putney.''

“The best stroke I have ever rowed behind was Harcourt [Gilbey] Gold” (1876-1952), wrote Guy Nickalls, who rowed No. 6 in Gold’s 1895 and 1896 Leander crews for the Grand (and later married his older sister).{{ref|Nickalls}}  Save for an 1897 appearance in the Goblets at bow, stroke was the only seat Gold ever rowed at Henley or in the Boat Race, winning ten of fourteen such events.  The 1899 Boat Race was not among the victories, however, as Cambridge won by over three lengths to end Oxford’s nine-year run and keep Gold from becoming the first stroke to win four.  He returned the favor a decade later, by coaching Bob Bourne’s Oxford crew to the first of his four straight wins and thereby holding Duggie Stuart of Cambridge to three.  Gold coached eighteen Oxford crews in all, as well as Nickalls’ Leander VIII that won the 1908 Olympic regatta at Henley.

Gold was Captain of Leander from 1898 through 1900.  He became a steward of the Henley Regatta in 1909 and joined its management committee in 1919, that year causing the creation of the stewards’ enclosure to give the regatta the financial sustenance of a regular subscriber base.  (Woodgate opposed the move:  he thought it would foster elitism.)  Gold published The Common Sense of Coaching in 1920 for Oxford college coaches with little experience, encouraging “unlimited patience and good temper” and cautioning “[i]t is probable as many crews have been marred as have been made from the bank.”{{ref|Gold}}  In 1945, he succeeded C.M. Pitman, his fellow Etonian and immediate predecessor as Oxford’s stroke, as chairman of the regatta.  In 1948 Gold became chairman of the Amateur Rowing Association, on which for many years he had represented the O.U.B.C., and the following year received the first knighthood for services to rowing.  In the 1914-18 war, Gold joined the Royal Flying Corps and was discharged a Lieutenant Colonel.  Professionally, like another Oxford Etonian G.D. Rowe, Gold had his own stockbrokerage, Harcourt Gold &amp; Co.

=== Romance and Rowing ===
Guy Nickalls married H.G. Gold’s elder sister, and Nickalls’ son Gully married Gold’s daughter.  Gold himself married a sister of G.S. Maclagan, who coxed his 1899 Oxford crew and the 1908 Leander Olympic eight that Gold coached and in which Nickalls rowed.  The connection between romance and rowing drew the attention of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; in an article by “A Bachelor” (June 28, 1873), who apparently had not himself so benefitted:

[[Image:Charming_girl_Eton_eyes_Leander_cheeks_Punch_1921.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&quot;Rowing man:  'Charming girl, your cousin, such Eton eyes; such Leander cheeks'&quot;]]''The attendance at the Oxford and Cambridge match and at the Henley Regatta seems to show that athletics are not on the decline as an art for wooing Englishwomen.  We recollect rowing in a public school crew at Henley and hearing two girls fairer than sunlight exclaim as we got into our boat and were adjusting the stretchers, “Oh, the darlings!”  They were wearing our light blue colours, and it is a certainty that the blood of the whole eight of us tingled to our finger-tips, and that we rowed like desperation on the strength of being darlings.  But a Trinity Cambridge crew pulled the Ladies’ Plate from us, and as we stepped out of the boat with our tongues lolling and our faces red as bricks these same water-nymphs cried indignantly in our hearing -- “Oh, the muffs!”  The fact is they had bet gloves on our success, and the defeat we had suffered -- it was not an ignominious one, only half a boat’s length -- was too much for their nerves.  They trampled our colours with scorn under their pretty boots, and would unquestionably have voted for our being pitched into the river had it been the custom to make an end of vanquished oarsmen as of worsted gladiators at Rome.  It is a question whether in England it does not occasionally pay better to be a victorious athlete than a good scholar. . . .  Cricketers, and oarsmen, too, play havoc in society as Detrimentals, and have a knack of carrying off heiresses in the teeth of circumstances and of richer gnashing suitors.  At worst they win girls who have connections instead of money, and the connections, after growling a bit for the form of the thing, locate the man of muscle in some snug post of emolument provided for out of the Consolidated Fund.  This comes of the difficulty of browbeating or despising a man who has his chambers full of prize-cups or presentation bats won by flood and field. . . .''

At times the direct route to matrimony lay through the father of the bride, as recounted in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (March 27, 1875) following that year’s Boat Race:

A propos ''of the University boat-race, the Paris &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Figaro&lt;/span&gt; tells a story of a “Mr. James Oxen,” who made his fortune by steering the Oxford crew.  It seems that fifteen years ago Mr. Oxen’s boat being behind that of Cambridge, a voice from the bank suddenly roared, “James, my boy, if you cut Cambridge in two my daughter is yours.”  By “a vigorous pull at his rudder,” Mr. Oxen showed himself equal to the occasion.  He did not strike Cambridge amidships, but he landed his own boat winner by half a length, and shortly afterwards married the heiress of a grateful parent “who had won a colossal sum in bets.”''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 1899 - 1914:  Fairbairnism and Foreigners ==
In 1899 Cambridge won the Boat Race for the first time since Muttlebury’s crew in 1890.  Cambridge won seven of the next nine, the last three with Duggie Stuart and his so-called “sculling style.”  In 1901 Oxford coach D.H. McLean died in the South African war.  In 1904 Steve Fairbairn returned from Australia to his alma mater, Jesus College, Cambridge, where he produced successful, distinctly unorthodox crews for the next thirty years (save of course for the 1914-19 hiatus).  Result:  Oxford’s orthodox went into a spell of doubt and self-criticism , which ended only with the Leander Olympic victory in 1908, Edmond Warre’s lectures “On the Grammar of Rowing” in 1907 and 1909, and Bob Bourne’s four-year run in the Boat Race starting in 1909, all played out in the pages of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;.

At the same time, the numbers and quality of foreign entries at Henley Regatta were increasing, setting off stress fractures throughout the community of gentlemen amateurs who were already straining under the largely domestic problem of defining what it meant to be an “amateur.”  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; had plenty to say about these subjects as well.

[[Image:Figaro_lady_sculler_1900.jpg|thumb|right|Figaro Illustre, 1890]]
While “Fairbairnism” and “foreigners” challenged the old order, “females” by and large did not.  The suffragist movement that McKenna confronted before the 1914-18 war and which included Dilke’s Women’s Property Act of 1870 and the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1878 among its roots, had no serious counterpart in rowing, though women did take up the sport in numbers as part of the late Victorian fashion for boating.  Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall, new Oxford colleges for women, both established boat clubs in 1884 and some twenty years later a university boat club for women was formed, but the O.U.W.B.C. rules of 1906 made clear the subordinate status of women’s rowing at the time:

:''Rule 1:  Young ladies shall take their outings at such times that they do not encounter gentlemen’s crews.''

:''Rule 2:  They shall have a draw string in their skirt hems so that no ankle is exposed.''

:''Rule 3:  If coaching by a gentleman is desired leave must be obtained from their moral tutors and a gentleman cox must act as a chaperone.''{{ref|Wigglesworth1}}
   
In similar vein, the Amateur Rowing Association decided in 1907 that it “did not legislate for ladies and therefore could not affiliate clubs containing ladies,” thus effectively blackballing them from ARA clubs in the same manner as manual laborers and “professionals.”{{ref|Wigglesworth2}} 

Since the rowing coverage in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; was almost exclusively dedicated to the Boat Race and Henley Regatta, the magazine paid no note to these developments, its sole reference to women in rowing being the appearance of a guest woman coxswain for the 1885 Oxford crew:

''The Oxford University Boat Club, with its old gallantry, is about to acknowledge the very useful steering of the eight by a lady, at Bourne End, during the absence of the coxswain, Mr. Humphreys.  The fair lady is the most graceful gondolier either in England or on the Continent, and has already distinguished herself at the oar under the able tuition and in the company of her husband.''{{ref|VF}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Italian Alphabet and Sounds==

Italian alphabet is identical to the English one but the sound of certain letters is different. There are double letter which sound differently from single ones and vowels are crucial and a lot more stressed than what they are in english. Every letter or sound is represented in one unique way, every letter is always read in the same way, you will never see ph for f or other tricks present in French and English, for instance.

== Particular phonemes ==
There are, however, digraphs/trigraphs that have their own particular phonemes:

! Letters
! Pronunciation
! Words in Italian
|-
|gli
|called &quot;laterale palatale&quot; [&lt;b&gt;ʎ&lt;/b&gt;], it's very close to the sound of &quot;&lt;b&gt;Y&lt;/b&gt;es&quot; or &quot;&lt;b&gt;Y&lt;/b&gt;iddish&quot; or the Spanish &quot;LL&quot;.
|Paglia ''(straw)'', Aglio ''(garlic)''
|-
|gn
|called &quot;nasale palatale&quot; [&lt;b&gt;ɲ&lt;/b&gt;], this sound is made by sticking your tongue on your palate while pronouncing a sort of N; as a result the sound will be nasal. In Spanish this sound is represented by the letter ñ, in English it could be rendered, for example, in a mispronounced &quot;onion&quot; ['ʌɲjən] 
Another way that it could be rendered is the same as the word &quot;Poignant,&quot; as the sound of the &quot;gn&quot; is identical to what it sounds like in Italian.
|Gnocchi, Bolognese
|-
|sce/sci
|the sound of the digraph SC (normally that of &quot;&lt;b&gt;Sk&lt;/b&gt;y), when followed &lt;u&gt;immediately&lt;/u&gt; by E or I, becomes that of &quot;&lt;b&gt;Sh&lt;/b&gt;ame&quot;. Coherently, the word &quot;&lt;b&gt;Sc&lt;/b&gt;h&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;rmo&quot; ''(screen)'', is to be pronounced like ''skermo'', not like ''scermo'', because of the letter h &lt;u&gt;immediately&lt;/u&gt; after the digraph.
|Scienza ''(science)'', Scegliere ''(to choose)''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Etherington-Smith, Raymond Broadley == 

=== “Ethel” (Spy), August 5, 1908 ===

[[Image:Etherington-Smith_RB_Vanity_Fair_1908-08-05.jpg|thumb|right]]''“Ethel” started on the race of this life in 1877 close by the Putney to Mortlake course, within a few days of the only dead-heat recorded in the annals of the Inter-University Boat Race, in 1877, and just fourteen years after his father had won the 1863 Grand Challenge Cup at Henley Regatta.''

''He was educated at Repton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he amassed most of the titular distinctions indicated in the alphabet above.''

''Having won the Colquohoun Sculls, the Lowe Double Sculls, the University Pairs and Fours, and rowed twice Head of the River, he, in 1899, became President of the C.U.B.C., when he materially assisted in preventing Oxford from gaining her tenth successive victory in the Boat Race.  In 1900 he was again victorious in a crew which has the proud distinction of having completed the course in a time which has never been beaten and only once equalled.  He has been Captain of Leander on four occasions, viz., 1903, 1905, 1906, 1908, and has won the Grand Challenge three times and the Stewards’ Cup twice, besides being runner-up for the Diamond Sculls against F.S. Kelly in 1902.  But Leander’s decisive victory over the Belgians the other day is, probably, the incident he is proudest of being associated with.''

''Not only as an athlete has he gained distinction; he is demonstrator of anatomy at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, and has held all the residential appointments, including that of House Surgeon.''

''As a physician he has cured the evils which beset the under and over-trained oarsman, and has written cleverly on the subject.  As a surgeon he has proved that apparently hopeless cases of fractured limbs can be set to rights under the manipulation of his deft fingers.''

''He likes himself best as an anatomical study for his pupils, and as a sculler, but he is at his best as an oarsman and friend.''

''As a motor cyclist he is a danger to himself and the public.''

“The finest and handsomest young athlete I ever drew as an under-graduate,” wrote Leslie Ward, “was R.B. Etherington-Smith [(1877-1913)], known to his intimates as ‘Ethel.’”{{note|Ward}}  In fact Ethel took his first degree in 1899, nine years before Ward drew him for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; to mark Leander’s victory in the 1908 London Olympics.  At age thirty-one he captained the crew, apologizing to teammate Guy Nickalls who was ten years older:  “I suppose they have asked me because I am about half-way down the line between yourself and Bucknall in age.”

Etherington-Smith died just after his thirty-sixth birthday from blood poisoning contracted while operating on a patient who had gangrene of the lung.

=== Staleness in Oarsmen ===
[[Image:Cadbury%27s_Cocoa_advert_with_rower_1885.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&quot;STRENGTH AND STAYING POWER.&quot; - TO ATHLETES. - The popular beverage for Breakfast, Luncheon, Tea, and Supper, in all seasons, is CADBURY'S COCOA; a pure refined Cocoa - exhilarating, comforting, and sustaining - providing in a concentrated form, admirable, nutritive, flesh-forming qualities, strength, and staying power.&quot; (1885)]]“From close observation of many crews, I think staleness is a weakening of the will to win,” wrote H.G. Gold, “due principally to a crew suddenly realising the superiority of its opponents.”{{note|Gold}}  Etherington-Smith, in contrast, included staleness among the “evils which beset the under and over-trained oarsman,” and though mere alcohol may not thrill Cole Porter, for Ethel it was just the thing for the old ennui:

''It is almost invariably found that at a certain period of training the men show signs of the hard work they have been undertaking by feeling “out of sorts.”  They are depressed in spirits, feel tired and disinclined for exercise, lose their usual hearty appetite, and go down in weight.''

. . . .

''This so-called staleness, which, as I have already said, is but a stage on the high-road to racing condition, is a very curious phenomenon and somewhat difficult to satisfactorily account for.  No doubt it is in great measure due to the hard physical work which has been accomplished, the body feeling the strain of the much-increased rate of metabolism necessitated thereby, but there is also a very marked nervous element.''

. . . .

''In the treatment of staleness champagne is of great value; indeed, when a man begins to show the signs of overwork a bottle of champagne for dinner in place of his ordinary liquor will often suffice to pull him round.  As a rule, it is not wise to give champagne except under these circumstances, or to allow it on more than two evenings during training, but should any man remain below par for several days without any sign of improvement he may be given champagne diluted with mineral water as his regular beverage for lunch and dinner.''

''A week-end visit to the seaside is a splendid antidote to this kind of staleness; the bracing air and change of scene, even for so short a period, often work wonders in restoring the cheerful spirits and brisk demeanour which are so characteristic of a well-trained crew.''{{note|Ethel}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Chapman, Wilfrid Hubert == 

=== “C.U.B.C.” (Spy), April 2, 1903 ===
[[Image:Chapman_WH_Vanity_Fair_1903-04-02.jpg|thumb|right]]
''Born on the 13th of December, 1879, he is known amongst his friends as “Teddy” for the sufficient reason that his brother’s name is Edward.  At fourteen he went to Eton, and there learned to row so well that he won the Ladies’ Plate in ‘97 and ‘98 as bow of the Eton crew.  He also ran so well that he won the School Mile, Steeplechase, and Half-Mile.  Of course he was in “Pop,” and was popular at Eton, though on one occasion his tutor is said to have dissented from the general opinion when a misadventure, while testing a rope fire-escape one Sunday afternoon in May, landed him among the Fourth of June geraniums above his tutor’s porch.  Trinity College, Cambridge, having been chosen to put the final polish on him, he determined that Oxford should not win a tenth successive Boat Race; so he was placed bow in the famous Cambridge crew of ‘99, and “Tabslogging” went out of fashion.  Owing to the unfortunate arrangement which still fixes the Boat Race and the Sports within a few days of each other, he decided to confine his energies to the muddy Cam, preferring the tideway to Queen’s Club.  Comparatively light and slightly built, he is an extraordinarily hard worker who never shirks his duties.  He is quaint and original, not particular about dress, and a good friend, who is much liked by all who know him and by many who do not.''

''In February, 1900, Second Lieutenant W.H. Chapman, of the Yorks Militia, might have been seen at Southampton struggling to get his men on board a transport for South Africa.  Still, he was not slow in gaining knowledge of the drill-book on active service; and the Boers showed their instinctive wiliness by keeping out of his reach.  Nevertheless, Captain Chapman was invalided home with fever in March of 1901; so he coached the Third Trinity May Boat to the Head of the River, and again showed his powers when Third Trinity won the University Fours.  Last year saw him on his old thwart in the winning Cambridge crew, and he made up at Henley for the previous year’s enforced idleness by helping to win the Grand Challenge and the Stewards’ Fours for Third Trinity.''

''He has a vivid imagination, but he is probably the best bow on the Thames.''

Wilfrid Hubert Chapman (1879-1915), “though light, was probably the most dashing bow who ever rowed in that place,” according to the Boat Race Official Centenary History, “and it was always difficult to find a two who could hold him.”{{ref|Drinkwater}}  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; featured him on the eve of his third and final Boat Race, which went off as follows:

''At the start Mr. F.I. Pitman, who was officiating as umpire for the first time, had some difficulty with the pistol, an antiquated affair which from time immemorial had been handed to the starter by old Tom Tims.  The pistol stuck at half-cock, and refused to go off for several seconds.  At the words “Are you ready?” Cambridge had squared their blades and the man in the stakeboat was unable to hold them against the drag of the tide.  Oxford were held more firmly, and so it was that Cambridge got a flying start of about a third of a length which the umpire, who was too taken up with the pistol in his hands, failed to notice.  This was most unfortunate, for the Oxford crew were dismayed at having been slipped, so easily it seemed, and rowed like a beaten crew from the first stroke.  The Cambridge crew also were upset by the incident and never really got together until quite near the finish of the race.  However, it made no difference to the result, for Oxford were quite outclassed.  Cambridge gained steadily and were two and three-quarters lengths ahead at Hammersmith (7 min. 15 sec.), four and a half lengths ahead at Barnes (16 min. 16 sec.), and won without exerting themselves by six lengths in 19 min. 33 sec.''{{ref|Drinkwater2}}

Chapman went on to win the Stewards’ that year and the next with Third Trinity, and the 1904 Grand with Leander in his only race for that club.

When the 1914-18 war broke out, Chapman was working for the Bombay Company in Karachi.  He asked for leave to enlist but was refused, so quit to rejoin the Sixth Yorkshire Regiment, commanded by his cousin.  Both of them were among the first killed in the August 7, 1915 landing at Suvla Bay in the Dardanelles, an operation that eventually took 40,000 British and Anzac lives.{{ref|Gallipoli}}  Captain Chapman was the only rower of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; to fall in action during the 1914-18 war.  W.F.D. Smith and R.C. Bourne also served at Suvla Bay but survived.

=== Henley 1901:  Leander v. University of Pennsylvania ===
Cornell entered the Grand Challege Cup in 1895 and Yale in 1896, neither advancing to the finals.  The University of Pennsylvania entry of 1901 held the most promise (or threat, depending on perspective) of the first foreign victory in the event.  However, while Lieutenant Chapman was fighting Boers, Leander with Dudley-Ward and Etherington-Smith held off the Quakers, as Woodgate reported in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 11, 1901):

[[Image:Leander_v_U_Penn_1901.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Leander Club v. University of Pennsylvania, final of the Grand, 1901]]
''The Grand Challenge Cup, with its destination, is naturally the leading feature of Henley at any time, and never more so than this year, when the best American eight that has up to now invaded us were threatening an expatriation of the Cup.  If they had succeeded it might have been said that our rowing coaches of the old country would have to go to school again, and to learn American doctrines.  And yet, even if such a disaster had overtaken us, the deduction would still have been unsound in certain respects.  There are four main desiderata for good quality in a crew:  1, strength; 2, style (of applying that strength); 3, unison; 4, condition.  The last-named comes practically first in any race of more than three or four minutes’ duration.  Also unison (No. 3) is of special importance; in light boats a crew not in unison tend to roll, and this, by lacing the spine of the oarsman out of the vertical, cripples the use of his trunk, and tells most against the capabilities of a crew that when steady on the keel use their bodies correctly.  Again, on sliding seats, unison of drive of the legs is very important.  So much so that, for illustration, if crew A have four men who slide quite correctly and four more who slide faultily, and crew B have eight men all sliding faultily, but with uniformity of fault, then the last-named (ceteris paribus as to strength and condition) may be expected go the faster.  Still, this admission should not justify a coach of an irregularly sliding crew A in teaching his one or two best sliders to come down to the level of the inferior.  He should rather strive, to the last hour, to raise all to the higher standard.  To return to the comparison between Leander and Pennsylvania.  Leander had the strength and the better general style.  They used their bodies with orthodox swing, and fully employed the “gluteus maximus,” the strongest muscle in the human frame.  They were short of practice, and by no means wound up in condition as compared to what  is usually seen in Oxford and Cambridge crews at Putney.  The Americans, while trusting mainly to slide, with a minimum of swing, and while finishing the stroke mainly with biceps and neglecting shoulder action to bring the oar home, worked in a perfect unison, far ahead in this respect of most British crews, while as to condition they were thoroughly fit, and had been in work for months.  Leander were not manned until the Monday fortnight before the Regatta.  They had only fourteen days actual rowing in the eight before the Regatta began:  and even those fourteen days were intermittent, with a four and a pair dividing attention; while the Americans had no practice outside their eight to divert or to fatigue them.  Leander raced themselves towards condition.  Had they met Pennsylvania on the Wednesday before they had the benefit of trial-heat gallops against New College and Belgium they might have just failed -- for “wind” -- to get home!  The draw was lucky for them in this respect.  In the race on Friday the actual start was in favour of Leander, who got in their second and third strokes ahead of those of their opponents.  Then both settled down; Leander at a more leisurely stroke than when they raced the Belgians on Thursday:  Americans were, to the eye, rowing some four or five strokes more in the minute, and they stole gradually ahead until they had a lead of 10 ft, more or less, at the end of a minute and a-half.  Du Vallon’s oar (Leander 2) was dipping opposite to the space between 3 and 5 of America.  Then that status remained for another minute.  Then came a Leander rush below Fawley Court which took Leander in front about as much as they had been behind.  After that Leander steadied at a slower stroke, and held their lead, and added a foot or two by the bridge gate.  Then Pennsylvania made their last effort, and for a quarter of a minute drew up a trifle.  Just below the Leander Inclosure Leander forced the pace again, and went faster than ever.  They were nearly clear at the Isthmian, had twenty feet daylight at the Grand Stand, and eased just before the flag fell, winning by an official length.  It was “bellows to mend” with sundry of the least trained of Leander when the race was over.  The Americans seemed less blown, and naturally so:  they simply had been unable to go the pace of the last half of the race; but they must have the credit of giving the hottest race for the Cup of all American visitors.  The Leander were a good average for Grand Challenge winners -- e.g., not equal to Leander of ‘93, and better than Leander of ‘98.  Another week of training would have made much difference in them.''

''There is a strong feeling among Henley oarsmen that, the Grand having been rescued this year, the Regatta should now be closed against foreign entries; because (1), when such visitors come, they specially prepare for weeks, months, and even years, for their coup, selecting their one occasion; (2) they enter for their one race only, which gives of itself special advantage, where the British Clubs are entering and practising simultaneously for a plurality of cups; (3) if British crews, in order to meet these specialised visitors on more equal terms, were to confine themselves to one cup only, the sport would suffer by reduction of entries for other events; (4) a bogus glamour of so-called “International” competition is thrown upon the racing under the present circumstances; whereas, as seen above, British crews cannot put forth their best and undivided strength for any one cup without thereby spoiling the Regatta sport.  If the “closing” should take place in future, then to show that it is not fear of visitors, in the abstract, which prompts the policy, I should be glad to see some International prizes founded for eights and fours to be rowed (say, about the 20th to the 30th of July) at Henley or Putney.  Such prizes would, perhaps, not bring out English crews to renew Henley battles if there were no “visitors.”  Accordingly, it might be understood that in the absence of any foreign challenges booked before a given time (say, the 1st of May) there would be no International Regatta  for the year.  It would be a nuisance, undoubtedly, for British crews to have to keep on training in event of challenges; but the nuisance would, all round, be less than the risk of letting the “Grand” be lost by some half scratch and overworked British crew, or the alternative of seeing all other Henley entries crippled in competition for the sake of meeting our visitors on more equal terms:  e.g., Leander pair scratched on Thursday solely to keep Burnell and Payne from rowing a third race in one day, on the eve of a so-called International battle for the Grand, while the Americans were resting from their labours.''

After months of controversy, including a proposal from W.H. Grenfell that the Henley Regatta exclude “foreigners and colonials,” the stewards decided at a special meeting in November 1901 that “it is inexpedient that any alteration in the Rules of the Regatta be at present made.”{{ref|Burnell}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Johnstone, Banner Carruthers == 

=== “Bush” (Spy), July 3, 1907 ===

[[Image:Johnstone_BC_Vanity_Fair_1907-07-03.jpg|thumb|right]]''Mr. Banner Carruthers Johnstone was born on the 10th of November, 1882.  In 1898 Eton saw him for the first time as a slim lad.  In his last year at the great school he rowed in the eight, and in his last term was Captain of the Boats.''

''In 1904 Mr. Johnstone appeared at Cambridge as a freshman of Trinity, and immediately continued his successful rowing career:  he rowed in the head of the boat [sic] four times; won the pairs, fours, and double sculls; he was also in the winning Leander crew for the Grand which beat the Belgians in the final heat.  He was twice elected Secretary, and once President of the C.U.B.C.''

''Mr. Johnstone rowed seven in the Cambridge crew that beat Harvard, and has rowed in the University boat race four times, being in the winning crew thrice.  This year he was elected Captain of Leander, perhaps the highest honour that can be paid to an oarsman, and is captaining the crew which everyone hopes will beat the Belgians in the final heat.  Besides all his successes at school and college, he distinguished himself at Henley, having won the Goblets, the Visitors’, and the Grand.''

''Not only is Mr. Johnstone an enthusiastic oar, he is also a keen soldier, having belonged for years to the Black Watch Militia.  His friends say that it was because of the requirements of military service that he commenced to grow a moustache, the result being his nickname of “Bush.”  The only other soubriquet by which he was known was “Syphon,” due, it is said, to his peculiar manner of laughing.''

''But Mr. Johnstone is something more than a mere athlete; in his last year at Trinity he won a second class in Political Economy, so that he may be taken to have a mind of his own and brains as well as muscle.''

''Altogether Mr. Johnstone is a fine type of a Scot, a man who can always be depended upon in a tight corner; brimful of pluck in a boat, rowing to his last ounce in a quiet determined way.  A friend and fellow oar, and good judge says of him, “He is modest and kindly -- one of the finest fellows I ever met in my life.”''

[[Image:Belgians_win_the_Grand_1907.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Sport Nautique de Gand, Belgium, win the Grand, 1907]]Banner Carruthers Johnstone (1882-1964) spent the better part of a decade battling Belgians for the Grand Challenge Cup.  On the first occasion, in 1905, he met and beat Sport Nautique de Gand in the final with Leander, marking the club’s twelfth Grand in fifteen years.  But the next year Leander fielded no entry for the event, Captain R.B. Etherington-Smith explaining that he had been unable to form a crew “capable of worthily representing the rowing of the Leander Club.”{{ref|Burnell}}  Johnstone thus rowed for Third Trinity, which lost to Club Nautique de Gand by two lengths in the semi-finals, and watched them defeat Duggie Stuart’s Trinity Hall by a third of a length to became the first foreign crew to win the Grand.  In 1907 both Johnstone and Stuart signed on at Leander, “the crew which everyone hopes will beat the Belgians in the final heat” (as &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; put it).  They lost in the semis to Steve Fairbairn’s hot crew from Jesus College, Cambridge, whom the Belgians then beat in the final.  At the 1908 London Olympics, the Belgians earned their way to the final by defeating Stuart’s Cambridge crew but lost to Leander, the other British eight, with Johnstone, Nickalls, and Etherington-Smith.  Finally, in 1909 the now-Royal Club Nautique de Gand evened the Belgian/British score to 2-2, beating Johnstone’s Leander in his last Henley appearance.
	
Johnstone set down his oars in 1909 to join the Ceylon Government Surveys and in 1913 joined the Colonial Civil Service in Zanzibar.  He spent the early years of the 1914-18 war in the Transport Corps in East Africa, and went to France in 1917 with the 1st Black Watch and 1st Infantry Brigade.  For many years he was the rowing correspondent for the Daily Telegraph.

=== Henley 1906:  The Debate on Foreign Entries ===
Just before the Belgian victory, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 4, 1906) supported keeping Henley confined to English “amateurs”:

''The proposal made by Mr. W.A.L. Fletcher that American entries should be barred from Henley in the future is certain to arouse hostility and irritation in the United States.  The occasion of Mr. Fletcher’s action is regrettable, coming, as it does, on the top of a newspaper discussion in America over the treatment accorded to visiting crews at the regatta.  Absurd charges were levied against the Henley officials, charges which no right-minded sportsman in America believed, but which nevertheless, stirred up much ill-feeling in that country.  We can imagine what form of newspaper comment will appear on receipt of the latest piece of intelligence.''

''It is desirable, therefore to place the English view of the question fairly before the American public, and the following article, from the pen of one of the best-known and most representative of English oarsmen, has been written with that intention:''

:''“The recent disclosures concerning the status of the Vesper crew bring into prominence the fact that the amateur, in an English sense, is hard to find outside the British Isles.  As far as America is concerned, the amateur status is non-existent -- at any rate, outside one or two universities, such as Harvard and Yale; and even in those seats of learning we may be pardoned if we regard some of their members as professional athletes.  We hear talk of men of prowess being sought for and maintained at the common expense in order that they may become useful representatives of their university in various branches of sport.''

:''“The Stewards of Henley Regatta have shown themselves to some extent timid, and to some extent supine, in dealing with foreign and colonial entries.  To what extent are they really acting for the good of Henley Regatta as a distinctive English institution in allowing outsiders to compete at all?  In making Henley an international regatta they are sacrificing the true amateur spirit to a desire of self-advertisement and to business instincts, which are thinly disguised under a veil of national representation.''

:''“Hitherto rowing has been the most pure, as well as the most unselfish of sports.  But year by year Henley is becoming a serious business.  The American fashion is to make any competition one of dollars, pure and simple; and though other countries may not be shameless in dealing in sport on monetary lines, it is not too much to say that all foreign and colonial crews come over here in a grim spirit of business which is at variance with our ideas of friendly and pleasant rivalry.''

:''“But even supposing that they do come over here to compete from sheer love of the game, is not Henley Regatta spoilt in many ways?''

:''“The International side of the competition is boomed by the Press, and the races which do not partake of an International character are considered of no interest.  Among rowing men there is quite enough interest to be found in the contests between college and college, or university and university, or between the ‘Varsities and the Metropolitan clubs; but the presence of some foreign competitor gives an air of seriousness to the regatta, and adds some bitterness to the struggle.  These things, to my mind, spoil much of the pleasure and entirely alter the tone of the regatta.''

:''“The regatta authorities need not concern themselves with the question as to whether International contests attract greater crowds.  The only people who are benefited by crowds are the railway companies.  The town of Henley itself gains no benefit from the thousands who pour down on to the course at midday and pour out of  town at sundown.  The catering is all done elsewhere.  The very cabs come from Reading or London.''

:''“Henley Regatta is more or less a society function, and it owes much of its status to the fact that it is a meeting-place of the two great English Universities -- Oxford and Cambridge -- and of Eton.  Take the ‘Varsities and Eton away, and it becomes of no more account than any of the weekly up-river regattas on the Thames.  To let in a number of semi-professionals just because they hail from some foreign country is a sure way to spoil the Regatta.''

:''“Our English amateur seldom cares to make too much toil of a pleasure.  In every English sport we see the professional element gradually ousting the amateur, and the only pure sport now remaining is rowing.  The amateur first-class cricketer is almost a professional.  How otherwise can we regard the Australian teams which come over here?  The Henley Regatta Stewards have at least made a big fight to preserve rowing from the same contamination.''

:''“It is plain that all American entries ought to be refused -- at any rate for a year or two -- and there can be little doubt that in allowing Colonial entries so late as the end of May the Stewards are asking to be fooled as to the amateur status of the entrants, just as they have been fooled before.  If this International business is to go on the Stewards should at least see that proper safeguards are forthcoming to ensure that foreign and Colonial crews shall come up to the English standard of amateur oarsmen, and not to the standard of foreign or Colonial amateurs.  If Henley Regatta is to maintain its place as a social function and the Queen of Regattas, the Stewards would do well to confine it as far as possible to the gentleman amateur -- a breed not often to be met with outside the United Kingdom.''

:''“This, of course, sounds very snobbish, but in Henley Regatta we have a purely English institution, at which we see clubs represented, who were represented any time from a quarter to three-quarters of a century ago.  Is not there some reason for protecting an institution of this historic character against the onslaught of modern professionalism, even if snobbishness is the principal weapon of defence?''

:''“Now is the opportunity for the Stewards to take action.  The miserable shortcomings of the N.A.A.O. of America in regard to their guarantee of the Vesper Crew’s amateur status should be utilised by the Stewards as a reason for revising the rules which at present govern foreign entries, and no assurances or guarantees should be accepted except from persons or Associations who have proved that they are willing and able to regard amateur rowing from the same standpoint as our true English amateur, for whom, and by whom, Henley was founded and exists.”''

The next week in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 11, 1906), after the race, Woodgate pointed to the segmented British club system as the cause of Trinity Hall’s defeat:

''There has been some sense and a good proportion of rubbish talked over the victory of the Belgians in the Grand Challenge Cup.  Let us consider the facts of the case.  The crew were not members of a single rowing club, but the pick of the best amateur oarsmen in Belgium --  a sort of Leander Club, in fact.  They had worked themselves up to a machine-like perfection in their own peculiar style.  As regards that style it is not the first time that it has been seen at Henley.  It is based on the principle that the long English swing and the application of strength necessitated in a sharp beginning exhaust a crew.  The professional English sculler rows with a close similarity to the Belgian style.''

''Against the visitors was a fine array of College crews.  I use the word “fine” to describe their numbers and comparative excellence rather than their great individual merit.  Leander had not brought out its usual formidable combination drawn from the pick of past and present oarsmen from both Universities.  The result was that the Belgians and Canadians were confronted by crews each picked and trained from a separate body of, at most, sixty or seventy young men -- for the greater proportion of men in a college do not row, or even try their luck in a tub.''

''Trinity Hall were rowed out against the Canadians on the Wednesday.  One of their men subsequently fainted, and I hear of a Belgian attempt -- done, no doubt, in all good spirit -- to snapshot him while in that condition.  They were brought back to life by good cheer on Wednesday night, but on Thursday they were stale, flat, and unprofitable, as the handsome beating the Belgians gave them proved.''

''I do not perceive any proof of the degeneracy of British rowing in this defeat.  Nor is there any evidence to be drawn therefrom on the advantage of the Belgian style.  What I believe, and I think that most oarsmen will agree with me, is the Belgian style would probably push a bad crew faster through the water than any other; but that the English style will send along a first-class crew faster than they would travel if rowing on Belgian lines.''

''Last week the question of foreign entries at Henley was discussed in this paper.  It is a curious fact that the emotional critics who from time to time condemn the entry of Leander as crushing out competition for the Grand from London, Thames, and the universities are the first to urge that foreign entries should be admitted.  Their argument is plainly illogical.  If such a combination of clubs as the Belgian crew is to row for the Cup, we must have a combination of clubs to meet it.''

''How are we to find a way out of this illogical situation?  I would suggest''

:''1.  That while the Grand Challenge Cup remains open to British amateurs, an International Cup be founded for which foreign and British crews might compete.  The Grand Challenge should thus remain as an incentive to College, school, and metropolitan rowing.''

:''2.  Or, That the date of entry be so arranged that a foreign crew must give a sufficient notice of entry to allow Leander to produce a representative British crew if there is no college or metropolitan crew strong enough to have a reasonable chance of victory.  I think this an inferior suggestion to the first; but it has been mentioned to me.''

''Those who talk about making cricket brighter must keep their hands off rowing.  There is no “gate” at Henley; nor are there professionals in the crews.  The meeting is for the encouragement of British oarsmanship, not for the amusement of the public.  Any action that the Committee take on these lines deserves, and will receive, support.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Stuart, Douglas Cecil Rees == 

=== “Duggie” (Spy), March 13, 1907 ===
[[Image:Stuart_DCR_Vanity_Fair_1907-03-13.jpg|thumb|right]]''Mr. Douglas Stuart is a great athlete.  He is also Mr. Douglas Stuart.  An oarsman of demoniac swiftness and skill, who has led the Cambridge crews to victory over Oxford and Harvard, the holder of the Colquhoun Sculls and the stroke of his University in the forthcoming Boat Race, his distinction in the world of sport goes without saying.''

''He was born at Kingston on March 1st, 1885.  Educated at Cheltenham College, where he received his boating colours.  He rowed later for the London Rowing Club, and at the age of nineteen only just failed to win the Diamond Sculls.  Last year the victory of Trinity Hall over the Argonauts at Henley was all his own.  And he hopes to add another leaf to his laurels on March the 16th.''

''Originally of health so delicate that he was not expected to live, he has made himself an athlete by sheer determination of will.  When racing, the passion and rapture of the contest possess him till he shouts aloud, and his eyes flame with a sort of joyous anger.  His presence infects his whole crew with the same combative high spirits.  It may well be that he owes his historic victories as much to his personality as to his muscle and skill.''

''Such a man is not likely to be a pessimist.  As all the world knows, “Duggie” is no ascetic, and enjoys life with a fullness only possible to so human a temperament.  Now and then his temperament carries him into scrapes, but where promptness and daring are required, he is never found wanting.  To jump from a college window into thirty feet of water, as he once did at Cambridge, is not an experience which many would covet.  But it proved as nothing to “Duggie.”  We append a snapshot of Mr. Stuart by that no less breezy personality, Mr. A.G. Hales.''

:''“I saw Stuart on Saturday last, and, as I watched the man whom friends and rivals alike admire and honour, I let my memory drift along the years whilst Fancy conjured up once more the forms and faces of great athletes, amateurs and pros., whom I have met.  Beach, Hanlan, Searle, Stansbury, Kemp, O’Connor, all went drifting by, crowned with their hard-won laurels, great oarsmen all, differing in some nameless fashion from the men who tried to match them, as this man differs from his fellows.  The river reeks with men who are good, but greatness comes to few, and Stuart is great; the old grey river has sung its song in his ears, and he has heard the song and held it.  The witchery of the water has got into his blood, and all its secrets are familiar things to him.  Others have wooed the waters just as zealously, but to them it was not given to draw into themselves the lore of the elements.  They plodded patiently and reached that mystic spot where the shadows and the sunlight meet, and there they stayed, hard held in the chains of mediocrity, but he passed over until he stood alone where all might see him, his winsome, boyish face the lode-star for all English eyes.  For England loves a sportsman who has no blemish.  When a man can do any one thing better than any other man amongst many millions of virile people, he singles himself out, and makes his own place, and this the Cambridge stroke has done by virtue of his gifts; and the chief of them is his brain force.''

:''“Let me make a pen picture of the man.  He stands exactly 5 ft. 8½ in. in height, and scales eleven stone two, a beautiful figure of a man, lean and hard.  One notices, too, his fair hair and blue-grey smiling eyes.  His pluck, his magnetism, are written all over him.''

:''“I asked him what was his hardest race, and he said, ‘Oh, all rowing men know that.  It was against the Canadians last year; the Argonauts at Henley.  I never want to go through anything just like that again.  They pumped me dry, and had me as nearly beaten as a man can be who wins.’  He did not say, what all his colleagues say of him, that in a race it is his personal magnetism, his virility, his unbounded pluck that makes his crew great.  As I talk to him I find him an ordinary fellow, but as I talk to his comrades I find that he is a giant.  He has the gift of leadership; knows how to get the last ounce out of men.''

:''“He has no formula for success.  I talked with him, and it all amounted to this:  if you have pluck you win, if you have it not, you drift down and lose.  He did not put it in those words, but when I had thought out our talk, that was all there was to it.  I have talked to many great soldiers; all they had to say was much as this man said:  ‘Fight on until you can’t fight any more; if you are alive at the finish, why, you win.’  The young Scots oarsman who strokes Cambridge will do big things in the round.  He will take his place in time with our big men.  He has heart, brains, patience, instinctive knowledge.  He would make an ideal leader of an exploring party in such a country as the hinterland of Russia.  He is built for it.’”''

“With the race of 1906 began a series of three Cambridge victories which have perhaps caused more controversy and dissension among oarsmen than any race or series of races during the whole history of the contest,” declared the Official Centenary History of the Boat Race.{{ref|Drinkwater1}}  “The controversy centred round the name of D.C.R. Stuart [(1885-1969)], who appeared for the first time this year.”   So appalled were the History’s orthodox authors of Stuart’s style, yet fond of the man, that they did not blame him for the “sculling” or “waterman” style that bore his name, but rather his unfathomably wayward coaches at Cambridge for permitting such delinquency: 

''That he should have been so closely identified with the new style as to be looked on as its founder, appears singularly unjust.  Full of dash, vigour, and tireless determination, Stuart was a born stroke, and would have done well in any style he had been taught to row.  So it seems that a large share of the responsibility for the introduction of ‘Stuart’s sculling style,’ as it came to be known, must lie with the Cambridge coaches of that time.  How the latter came to be led astray from the old traditions one cannot understand.  Mr. S.D. Muttlebury must have known better, for he himself rowed in a very different style in the ‘eighties, and, moreover, he had coached the great Cambridge crew of 1900.  Mr. Escombe and Mr. (now Colonel) Wauchope, who also bore a large share of the coaching of these crews, have been responsible for some of the best Cambridge crews of recent years, and would no doubt raise their hands in horror to see a modern University crew rowing in the style of 1906.  Nevertheless, for one reason or another, the old ideals were lost sight of, in a belief that pace was only to be derived from a very hard thrust with the legs in the middle of the stroke, little attention being paid to a long reach forward, a firm grip of the water behind the rigger, or a true combination of body and slide at the finish of the stroke. . . .  It was perhaps just retribution on the part of Fate that a strong Belgian crew from Ghent appeared at Henley Regatta this year, and carried away the Grand Challenge Cup.''{{ref|Drinkwater2}}

But to R.C. Lehmann, writing of Cambridge’s Stuart-led victory over Harvard in September 1906, two months after the Belgians won the Grand, “[t]here was nothing specially new in the Cambridge style.  It was founded on principles which have long been established, and of which the value has been proved in many a hard-fought contest”:

''Cambridge ought, in my opinion, to be ranked very high amongst good University crews.  When they were eventually wound up to a concert pitch they showed a beautiful working uniformity, and great quickness, elasticity, and dash.  The blades caught the water with marked precision and power, and the men applied both bodies and legs to the stroke in very good style.  The finish ended by being a firm one; the blades left the water in very clean style, and the recovery movements were fairly smart.  Had they possessed a longer swing and reach forward there would not have been much room for genuine fault-finding.  The merits I have indicated, combined with their exceptional racing ability, sufficiently account for their victory over their powerful and plucky opponents.''{{ref|Lehmann}}

Stuart stroked three successive Cambridge crews to victory before losing to Oxford in 1909 when he was President of the C.U.B.C.  His Trinity Hall crews were head of the river in 1907 and 1909, but he never won at Henley.  Stuart became a solicitor after taking a third class in the 1909 law Tripos.  In the 1914-18 war he served with the First Battalion of the Border Regiment and was badly wounded as a Second Lieutenant in the Battle of the Somme in July 1916.{{ref|Wylly}}  He later served as a Captain in the Courts Martial.  

Ever the iconoclast, Stuart wrote in 1929 in the ''Times'' that university crews should practice for only six weeks, given the experience and fitness of the eligible oarsmen and the risk of staleness from more extensive work.  “I do not know how it is in modern times, but as rowing was conducted 20 years ago there was not much fun in it, and rowing as a pastime was in reality an infernal bore.  Perhaps this explains what appears to be a lack of enthusiasm for this sport at Oxford.”{{ref|Stuart}} 

=== Stuart on Styles ===
In 1933 the editor of the ''Times'' received and printed a considerable number of letters on rowing theory, which confirmed his opinion that the subject was always calculated to produce a “controversy of almost theological fanaticism.”{{ref|Wigglesworth}}  Stuart’s contribution (Feb. 11, 1933): 

''Sir, -- Rowing would be one of the easiest of sports were it not for the continual wrangle on styles.  It is so much simpler than would appear from all that is written about it, the movements of an oarsman being so easy if he be allowed to do them naturally, instead of being made to contort himself to conform to some ideal style.''

''To judge from the views of the orthodox, there are hardly any crews which ever reach a standard fit to be described as oarsmanship, though this is rather hard on all the coaches who have been doing their orthodox best.  Doubtless the critics are right.  The amount of orthodox theory daily expounded from the towpath does not seem to give the results expected from it, and it is not surprising that some coaches have come to try other ways of pushing a boat along than by the old style, and, if the truth be told, with astonishing results.  It was, after all, inevitable, if the sport was to survive, that orthodoxy had to be modified, for it is an impossibility for most, and rowing it or trying to row it, became a daily drudgery, while the results were usually a dismal failure.''

[[Image:THBC_Mays_Head_group_photo_1907.jpg|thumb|right|430px|Trinity Hall Boat Club May boat, Head of the River, 1907 - Stuart seated center right]]''According to my memory, Australians, Americans, Belgians, Italians have all beaten English orthodox rowing, and the record of Jesus College, Cambridge, during the last 25 years seems to show very clearly that the new style has carried the day in all contests.  And one may appositely remark that the numerous defeats of English rowing have been caused entirely by the stubborn resistance of the orthodox die-hards to any modification in the fashion of rowing.  For be it remembered that it has been the invariable custom for England to be represented by orthodox crews, and it is these crews which have been defeated.  And these crews are the pick of either one or both Universities and coached by orthodox coaches.''

''Orthodox crews were nearly always drawn from the Universities, and this gave them a greater choice in numbers and physique, and a series of victories at Henley made people hastily conclude that the way these crews rowed was and is the only way to row.  At that time opposition was almost nil.  From the very fact of greater choice orthodoxy should have more than held its own, not only in first-class contests but in all others.  If opinion and coercion could have kept out the new style it would have done so, but, thanks to Mr. Fairbairn’s pertinacity, it is having a greater vogue than ever.  Thanks to it metropolitan rowing has been revived, and it is to be hoped that it will resist all attempts to make it return to the old style.  There are still plenty of unconvertible old stylists to keep their particular style going, while the metropolitan clubs have nothing to gain by going back to the old style in which for years they never won a race at Henley.''

''It has often been said that it was due to the failure to row in the orthodox way that foreign crews were able to take away the Grand Challenge Cup, but that is an exaggeration, for nearly all Oxford crews and most Cambridge, to say nothing about the Metropolitan crews, all of which were still floundering in orthodoxy, were unable, in spite of all, to put up any crews capable of keeping the foreigner out.''

''How was it that all the old-style coaches and all the old-style oarsmen were unable to turn out first-rate crews?  The answer is that the orthodox style is an impossible and artificial one, possible indeed to men after long experience and, above all, of fine physique, but impossible for most men and clubs where the pick is limited and time inadequate.  Not only it is impossible but it is unnecessary, for the new style is as fast as the old.  The fact of the matter is that orthodoxy was invented for fixed seats before slides were thought of, to which it is inapplicable.  The style of an oarsman must be adapted to the kind of  boat he rows in.  There is no other boat, so far as I know, in which the propelling machinery moves up and down to the extent that the human machine does in a racing eight.  This has an enormous effect on the pace of a boat.  This was not so in the old fixed-seat boats, or, at any rate, was vastly less.''

''Furthermore, the shoulder catch so dear to the orthodox is a sheer physical impossibility if the oarsman is to drive as hard as he can with his legs:  and, if he is not going to do that, how can he get the hard and quick beginning demanded?  If the oarsman is to adapt himself to the machine, he must make leg drive and not swing his principal point.  The weight of the oarsman must be driven straight from the stretcher, and the oarsman must not hold his slide, as Mr. Lowe has so aptly said.  Indeed, Mr. Fairbairn’s style shows conclusively that leg drive causing the oar to hit the water even very imperfectly gets a pace on the boat which all but the very best orthodox crews must envy.  If it were done as it could be done, and doubtless will be done, there will be no two opinions about style.''

''As to swivels, most coaches and oarsmen have never rowed with them and are no judges.  It is not too much to say that if swivels had been used the Grand Challenge Cup would never have been lost, in spite of orthodoxy.  They are far easier to use, save an enormous amount of labour, and have the added advantage of permitting a faster stroke to be used without more energy.  It used to be said that a fixed thole pin was necessary for a hard beginning, which most crews, we are told, never get.  Some ingenious fellow invented a swivel with such thole pin fixed; so some other excuse was found to prevent their being used.  Few oarsmen seem to realize that it is the movable sill which renders the swivels so efficacious.''

''It is quite certain that if coaches reflect on the apparatus used and adapt the style rowed to the form of the boat used, so that it has a chance to travel on the lines on which it was designed, other things being equal, unorthodoxy will beat orthodoxy every time.''

''I am, Sir, your obedient servant,''

“This sort of correspondence continued right up to the outbreak of war in 1939,” wrote rowing historian Geoffrey Page, “and although the controversy continued in somewhat less contentious form after the war, it was generally the pre-war generation that prolonged it.”{{ref|Page}}

Everard reports back that he had raised the alarm, saying that he had heard something downstairs, and had seen them bringing a man up. We assume, correctly as it turns out, that the injured man is Arthur, and we are led to believe that the hallway in which he was sitting is the one that ends at the doorway into the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic.

Everard has one brief appearance in this book. At the end of the book, as the four Heads of House, plus Harry and Hagrid, are meeting to consider the future of the school, Everard, here described as a sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe, strolls into his picture frame to announce that the Minister is on his way, he has just [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparated]] from the Ministry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bourne, Robert Croft == 

=== “A Good Stroke” (Ape Junior), March 29, 1911 ===

[[Image:Bourne_RC_Vanity_Fair_1911-03-29.jpg|thumb|right]]''The lightest-built man in the Oxford boat -- barring, of course, the cox -- is Mr. R.C. Bourne, the seasoned stroke upon whose lead and generalship the Dark Blues depend so much for their hopes of victory in Saturday’s great race over the historic course on the Thames tideway between Putney and Mortlake.''

''Robert Croft Bourne is an aquatic enthusiast who has the inestimable advantage of having led the victors in the last two inter-’Varsity Boat Race tussles.  Born in 1888, he first began rowing seriously when but twelve years old, and got into the Eton eight in 1906, because of the brilliant promise he showed on the water after being sent to the famous school.  Naturally he favors the classic Eton style, of which he is such a conspicuously good exponent, and which has served him time and again so admirably.''

''Ruddy-faced and handsome, with flashing dark eyes, Mr. Bourne looks the confident athlete all over.  He is very sure of himself, and has the gift of inspiring confidence in those who row at his bidding.  He is an absolute stranger to nerves, and, asked what he thought about when engaged in the big struggle of the year, Mr. Bourne nonchalantly replied that all he had to do was to look to his stroking, the other men having to respond to his lead.  With quite wonderful command he marks from the beginning most inspiringly, and gets through his work with a most effective body swing, which looks as easy as graceful to those who do not know the difficulties of oarsmanship.  Then he can swing out when the need comes without causing his men any unsteadiness or deterioration of rhythm.  He is a perfect genius in the boat, and is always intent on winning.''

''He smokes with moderation, has no hobbies other than his favourite sport, and is always hailed by his chums as “Bob.”  For he has grown quite fond of the diminutive that denotes in its way his very undeniable personal popularity.  But the presumptuous stranger who “Bobbed” him would quickly regret it, for he knows how to support the dignity belonging to such a ‘Varsity celebrity as he has become.''

Gilbert Charles Bourne rowed the Boat Race twice, in the winning Oxford crews of 1882-83.  An apostle of Warre’s orthodoxy, he married practical knowledge of rowing to professional grounding in zoology, marine biology, and mathematics to become a renowned rowing coach, with his Text-Book of Oarsmanship (1925), a milestone in the literature.  His only son, Robert Croft Bourne (1888-1938), also of Eton and New College, rowed and won four Boat Races, becoming the last rower of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; to do so and the only man ever to do it all at stroke.  He won the School Sculling at Eton in 1906, the University Sculls in 1910, the University Fours in 1911, went head of the river 1911-12, and was O.U.B.C. President for the 1911 and 1912 Boat Races.  Bob Bourne never won the Ladies’ (in three attempts) or the Grand (in six), but won the Stewards’ thrice (1912-14) and stroked his college crew in the final of the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, losing to Cygnet Swann’s Leander VIII.

In the 1914-18 war, young barrister Bourne started as a Second Lieutenant in the First Herefordshire Regiment.  In August 1915, he had one hand crippled and a lung seriously injured at Suvla Bay in the Dardanelles, the same battle that killed W.H. Chapman.  Since he had only one good eye to begin with -- the other having gone in a game of rounders at school -- Bourne moved from active service to the Claims Commission.  He was elected Justice of the Peace for Herefordshire in 1920, member of the city council in 1921, and in 1924 took the Oxford City seat in Parliament once held by J.W. Chitty.  “In the House of Commons, where he rose to be deputy chairman of ways and means (1931), Bourne’s name was canvassed as a possible Speaker,” said his Times obituary, “for, although on the platform he filled his speeches with too much information for a popular audience, he earned the respect of all parties by his mastery of the rules of procedure, the clearness and quickness of his rulings, his skill as a draftsman, and, above all, by that same strict impartiality which had secured for him as president of the Oxford University Boat Club the complete confidence of his fellow oarsmen in the justice of his choices when making up his crews.”  He died in office August 7, 1938, suddenly falling dead while walking on the moors near Strontian, Argyll.

=== The 1911 Boat Race ===
Airplanes followed the race for the first time.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (April 5, 1911):

''AN HISTORIC STRUGGLE.''

''The evening and the morning papers nowadays so forestall us of the weekly Press in matters of moment that one gets little chance in the great game of recordership in connection with hebdomadal journalism.  Yet how can we let the long-to-be-remembered aquatic event of 1911 pass without some notice in the columns of Vanity Fair, which has ever concerned itself with the best of sport?''

''Oxford, the favourites, won, and set up a new record for the race which should stand long.  The Dark blues covered the four and half miles Thames course in 18 minutes 29 seconds, winning by two boats lengths and three-quarters, and leading all the way from start to finish!  This is 18 seconds in front of record.''

''Two of the King’s sons followed the race in a launch; the weather was all that could be desired; aviators (including our Mr. Claude Grahame-White) flitted over the contending crews; and Cambridge, though clean rowed out at the end, gave a display of oarsmanship that would, in any of the years that have gone, have secured them the victory.  The battle of the Blues of 1911 will not readily be forgotten by those who witnessed it!''

''AN OLD OXONIAN’S VIEW.''

''“Why did our men win?”  “Because,” answered one who has himself stroked Oxford to victory, on being questioned by a Vanity Fair representative at the Grand Hotel dinner on Saturday night -- whereat, by the way, Justice Eldon Bankes, who rowed in the winning Dark Blue boat in 1875, presided -- “they were the better men and did their best on the day.  They were up to concert pitch, and went level all the way.  They have been admirably coached and kept together, and Mr. Bourne is simply a great coach, all bull-dog determination and no flourish.  His triple win is something for him to be proud of in after life, whatever Fame may have in store for him.”''

''LIGHT BLUE REFLECTIONS.''

''A prominent Cantab confided to our representative on the occasion referred to his conviction that the Light Blue lost because their this year’s men are inferior on the water to those of Oxford in everything but style.  “The Dark Blues are faster and stronger, undeniably, than the Cambridge crew, and are quite ahead of us, save as to polish.  Bourne set a pace we could not catch up, and, what is more, never halted in his terrific swing.  It was a great thing to keep so near the winner in a race so terrific.  The Cantabs have any amount of neatness and beautiful uniformity; but leg-drive, length, and sheer brute force -- I say it without hint of surely belittling the other side -- will always reduce science to nothingness when it comes to lasting over the long river stretch from Putney to Mortlake.  But you must not forget that we too have beaten record.  Only, Oxford went one -- nay, two and three quarters, better.”''

''WHAT THE MAN ON THE BANK THOUGHT.''

''A typical Cockney, who had -- per favour of the Chiswick Urban Council -- secured a stand of vantage in the Duke’s Meadows at Corney Reach, thought it the grandest race he had ever seen and it was his thirtieth.''

''He cheered the Dark Blues lustily as they hove in sight and shot past swiftly; he shouted encouragement to the Cantabs as they struggled doggedly in the wake; he was frantically loyal in his vociferous cheers as the prince of Wales and his brother were pointed out to him standing on the Hibernia a little behind the boats that had flashed up river.  “But, bli’ me,” he said, “these ‘ere eeryplaines caps all.  Not ‘arf!  I niver thort I’d live to see ‘em flying that ‘ow.  That ‘Gray an’ White’ chap, he’s a fair knockout.  He takes his airship just where he likes, and arsts nobody.  I reckon, though, that skylarking won’t ever be so pop’lar as the boat race.  It don’t seem so English, somehow -- no, nor so manly neither, guv’nor.  Gi’ me the good old Oxford and Cambridge.  And I don’t never hope to see a better race than to-day’s, nor a grander day for it.”''

''“Quite right, Bill,” chipped in his buxom “missus,” affably; “and now let’s go home -- it’s orl hover bar the sharting.”  And gatewards wended the pair with the throng, chattering happily as they went.''

=== “The Light Blue Stroke” (WH), April 3, 1912 ===

[[Image:Swann_SE_Vanity_Fair_1912-04-03.jpg|thumb|right]]''Hope ran high when this new member of the Swann family was ushered into the world one fine day in the Isle of Man; nor was this hope destined to be unfulfilled.''

''By his infantile antics in the nursery he clearly showed his determination to make a name for himself in the athletic world.''

''However, before he was old enough to walk or indulge in childish prattle, Fate decreed that he should travel, and his parents took him to Japan.  Here he stayed for seven years.  What happened during that time is not definitely known, but rumour has it that he started his career running races against little Japanese boys.  However that may be, he returned to England bursting with pride and good spirits, and practised jiu-jitsu tricks on his youthful companions.''

''After this he started seriously to “follow in his father’s footsteps,” and few will deny that so far he has succeeded.  He has rowed for Cambridge twice, each year at different ends of the boat, but, like his father, he has suffered defeat by the Bourne family.''

''In his first year at Cambridge he stroked a Trinity Hall four to victory at Henley in the Visitors’ and Wyfold’s.  In 1910 he won the Colquhoun Sculls.''

''It is not known for certain if he will try to break the family record across the Channel, but few would doubt his ability to do so, if pluck and stamina were the only things needed.''

''He is optimistic, sunny-tempered, and possesses that valuable trait of never knowing when he is beaten.''

''As captain of the “Hall” Boat Club he is a great success, and absolutely indefatigable in his attempts to teach the principles of Cambridge rowing to youthful aspirants.''

''Strange to say, his brain is as active as his body, and many in his college believe that in his last history examination this summer he will astound the examiners.  He deserved every success, for he is persevering and holds distinctly original views.''

''Let no one think that he excels in one branch of sport only.  While at Rugby he proved himself an astute runner, and ended captain of the Running VIII.  What would the “Hall” tennis team do without “Cygnet,” their leader?  O, those reverse American (services)!''

''During his twenty-one years he has tried most forms of sport.  His quickness at learning is remarkable.''

''Before he went to Cambridge he had never touched an oar, and the fact that he got into the ‘Varsity boat in his second year showed that his rowing career has been meteoric.  Seldom has any oar come forward so quickly.''

''If necessary, he can swim.''

Among the Cambridge crew who lost to G.C. Bourne’s Oxford in 1883 was “Cygnet” Swann’s father, Sydney Swann (1862-1942).  Swann Sr. won the next year (Bourne having left), lost in 1885, and won the Grand with Trinity Hall in 1886-87 and the Stewards’ in 1885 and 1887, with Reginald McKenna in two of those crews.  A versatile athlete, Sydney Swann cycled the perimeter of Syria, rowed the Channel in 1911 in record time (3 hr. 50 min.) and in 1917, at age 55, he cycled, walked, ran, paddled, rowed, and swam six consecutive half-miles in competition with a Lieutenant Muller of the Danish army, both crossing the line in 26 min. 20 sec.  Professionally, Sydney Swann started his career as curate to Plymouth and Sulby, Isle of Man, was a missionary in Japan from 1890-97, and vicar at various livings in England until 1937.  For a period until his death in 1942, he was President of the National Amateur Rowing Association, from which post he peppered the Times with such letters as this from 1937:

''Sir, -- In answer to my letter pleading for the non-exclusion of artisans in best rowing, I have received letters saying:  “Now; what do you want?”''

''My reply is simple.  Rule 4 of the Amateur Rowing Association (i.e., Henley, &amp;c.) runs as follows:--''

:	''No person shall be considered an amateur who has ever been employed in or about boats or in manual labour for money or wages.''

''Now we want the words “or in manual labour” deleted.  We also want Rule 5 dropped altogether.  Rule 5 runs:--''

:''No person shall be considered an amateur who is or has been by trade or employment for wages a mechanic, artisan, or labourer, or engaged in any menial duty.''

''These small changes would satisfy us and bring peace.''

:					''Yours faithfully,'' 
:					''Sidney Swann, President, N.A.R.A.'' 

[[Image:Harvard_Rah_Rah_Rah_postcard_c1910.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard, c. 1910]]Sydney Swann sent his two sons to Rugby and Trinity Hall, where they followed him to the river and the clergy.  Alfred (1893-1961) was C.U.B.C. President and won the Colquhoun Sculls in 1920, became Dean of Hong Kong, and retired as Canon Emeritus of Salisbury Cathedral.  His older brother, Sydney Ernest Swann (1890-1976), won the Colquhoun Sculls in 1910 (as a freshman, having sculled only twenty-nine times before the event!), the Lowe Double Sculls in 1911, and the University Pairs in 1913.{{ref|BSS}}  Like his father, “Cygnet” Swann lost to a Bourne in the Boat Race (1911-12), but won in 1914 as C.U.B.C. President.  At Henley Swann won the Visitors’ and Wyfolds (1910), the Goblets (1913-14, with Alfred), and the Grand (1913).  He was the sole Cambridge man among the Leander crew of 1912, otherwise haling from Magdalen, Oxford, that lost to the Sydney Rowing Club in the Grand but beat them three weeks later at the Stockholm Olympics and went on to beat R.C. Bourne’s New College eight in the final.  “[T]he shout of ‘Well rowed Magdalen’ from the bank brought appropriately indignant protests from Cygnet.”{{ref|Swann1}}  In his last race at Henley, rowed days after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Swann’s Leander eight lost to the Harvard junior varsity in a heat for the 1914 Grand; Harvard then defeated its alumni to become the first American victors in the event.

Trading his oars for vestments, Swann became a Chaplain to the forces for the 1914-18 war.  Returning afterward to Trinity Hall as Chaplain, he helped put Cambridge rowing back on its feet in the early 1920s and rowed for Leander in the 1920 Olympic eight at Antwerp, losing to the U.S.  Swann moved to Nairobi as Archdeacon in 1926-27, to Egypt in the same position in 1928, and returned to England in 1933, where he became Chaplain to the Queen and King George VI and ultimately retired as Canon Emeritus of Bristol Cathedral.  He also resumed his connection to Cambridge and Trinity Hall rowing.  “A stiff orthodoxy on one hand and a limited Fairbairnism on the other have at times tried to deflect the Hall from the sanity of Cygnet’s type of coaching,” wrote his nephew in the 1950 club history, “but always he has brought the Club back to a combination of the best elements in conflicting styles and the elimination of their faults.”{{note|Swann2}}  On his father’s death in 1942 Swann took up the N.A.R.A. presidency and held it until 1956, when the A.R.A., under the chairmanship of Gully Nickalls, son of Guy and nephew of H.G. Gold, removed manual labor as a disqualification for amateur status and the two organizations merged.  “Cygnet has more than one of his father’s characteristics:  including the quality of combining acquired experience with a youthful outlook:  his influence in the College never has been all in rowing, nor his influence in rowing all on style.  People matter to him most.”{{ref|Swann3}}

=== The 1912 Stockholm Olympics:  English Decadence ===
Apart from occasional bright spots such as Leander’s victory, the Stockholm Olympics gave Britain a sharp bite from international competition.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 17, 1912):

''England is having a poor time of it at Stockholm, where the Olympic games are being held, and there is wailing over our “decadence.”  We are reminded that in the past we were supreme in most branches of athletics, and told, very bluntly indeed, that we must try and realise the fact that British athletics have gone to the dogs.  The worst of it is that the actual results of the events themselves confirm the statement -- for beyond one or two notable successes our men have been swamped -- and they are, or are supposed to be, the best we have.''

''The trouble lies in the fact that although they are our best they are not nearly so good as they might be.  There is no getting away from the truth:  they are insufficiently and carelessly trained, whereas our Continental, colonial, and American friends have taken such pains that many events were theirs before Stockholm was even reached.''

''It comes as a shock to find our men reduced to the level of fourth or fifth raters, for most Englishmen still hold the opinion that even if what is British is not necessarily best, it is at least as good as any other.  It is a bitter pill to find that while we have been sitting on the fence contentedly our friends the enemy have been straining every nerve until they are able to out-run, out-jump, and out-general us.''

''Many years ago, when British athletics really were preeminent, the happy state of affairs existed because we were almost alone in the practice of sports of the kind.  Other nations had other ways, and naturally their men were as unbeatable at their own particular pastimes as we were at ours.  Then came the vast conversion to English sports, and our present rivals not only took to them with avidity, but, profiting by our tutelage and experience, commenced where we were content to stand still, and set out to improve upon the best we could show them.  How they have succeeded we now know.''

      <comment>moved [[XQuery/GoogleChart example]] to [[XQuery/Google Chart Sparkline]]: restructure Google Chart Example</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create an easy-to-use specialized chart using a generic charting service such as Google Charts

== Method ==

The [http://code.google.com/apis/chart/ GoogleChart API] creates PNG-format charts from data passed in the URL line.  

One use of the service would be to generate a Tufte [http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR sparkline]. This script uses random data to generate a small sparkline-like graphic. With a bit more work, the additional features such as  minimum, maximum and normal bands should be able to be added. A line chart (cht=lc) includes axes but these can be removed by using an undocumented feature in which the chart type is specified as lfi [http://24ways.org/2007/tracking-christmas-cheer-with-google-charts ]

The script uses function overloading in XQuery which allows two functions to have the same name but different numbers of parameters. The more general function has parameters for the sequence of values and the min and max to be used in scaling the values.  The second function (with the same name) accepts only the values and calculates the min and max from the data before calling the more general function to complete the task.

Does not work, The returned value for the matrix {{6,3,5}, {4,3,7}, {8,9,2}} is -20970 which clearly must be -138

[[Image:Location_greek_ancient.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of regions throughout the Mediterranean under Greek influence around 550 BCE.]]The history of Greece is undoubtedly that of one of the most influential civilizations in the history of mankind. This tiny region at the southern tip of the Balkan peninsula produced or improved upon democracy, the alphabet, philosophy, theater, and the sciences. Even the word ''history'' itself comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''ιστορία''.

The history of Greece begins long before our earliest written records. Archeology has provided us with what little information we have about such civilizations as the [[../Minoan Civilization|Minoans]], [[../Mycenaean Civilization|Mycenaeans]], and the world of the [[../Greek Dark Ages|Greek Dark Ages]]. These civilizations were not even believed to have existed until very recently, when archeologists began to think the epic poetry of Homer's ''Iliad'' might contain more truth than previously thought. During the [[../Classical Greece|Classical Period]], Greek culture was reborn and flourished, and was spread throughout the Mediterranean Sea by the Athenian Empire, as well as other Greek traders, colonists, and conquerors.

[[Image:BattleofIssus333BC-mosaic-detail1.jpg|left|thumb|240px|A mosaic from Pompeii, of Alexander the Great at the Battle of Issus in 333 BCE.]]The Peloponnesian War (431-404 BCE) between Athens and Sparta, and their respective allies, greatly weakened Greece's collective power, and by 336 BCE, nearly every Greek city-state was under the control of Macedon, and for the first time united into a single political unit. Alexander III, the next king of Macedon, took this united Greece and with it conquered the entire known world, spreading Greek culture (called [[../Hellenistic Greece|Hellenism]], or ''ελληνισμος'') from Egypt, through Persia, all the way to India. Upon the death of Alexander the Great (as he would come to be known), the Empire split into fourths. A united Greece was one of the four new kingdoms, which lasted until 168 BCE, when Macedonia was absorbed into the growing Roman Republic. The entirety of Greece came under Roman rule by 146 BCE.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Changing your personality isn't as simple as thinking, &quot;I will be a better person.&quot; The mind is an accumulation of everything experienced and done throughout one's lifetime. You must be consistent and resolute in examining and controlling your thought processes.

===What is the Nature of a Strong Willpower?===
People with determination do not follow their whims, because they know that these thoughts are fleeting. They concentrate on long-term goals, and evaluate the worth of each action in reaching these goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It seems that people are intrinsically inspired to awe by what appears to be a universal aesthetic for natural beauty. Its grand scheme can also work to humble oneself and help one accept the immovable boulders of worries that occupy one's life.

Questions about how a word is used, how it is different from other similar words, how it can be translated, etc.

=== I love you ===
How do you say &quot;I love you&quot; in Japanese? [[User:205.188.116.132|205.188.116.132]] 07:12, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

:We scarcely say :] Well it can be &quot;(Anata wo) Aishite imasu&quot; (formal) or &quot;Aishite ru (yo)&quot; (casual) but pehaps &quot;Daisuki (da (yo))&quot; better suits in cases. --[[User:Marsian|marsian]] 17:31, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

=== no, not yet ===
what's &quot;no, not yet&quot; in Japanese? [[User:63.215.29.239|63.215.29.239]] 12:48, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

:A good Japanese phrase for &quot;not now&quot;, would be: 今駄目 (いま だめ), ''Ima dame''. ''Ima'' (今, いま) means &quot;now&quot; and ''dame'' (駄目, だめ) is &quot;no good&quot;. [[User:Shinjitsu|Shinjitsu]] 13:31, 30 September 2007 (UTC)

=== みつ, よつ, etc ===
On [[Japanese:Lessons:Native Japanese counting]] it is taught that 3 can be みっつ or sometimes み (likewise, よっつ -&gt; よ, むっつ -&gt; む, やっつ -&gt; や).

However, on KANJIDIC I also found the entries (三つ -&gt; みつ, 四つ -&gt; よつ, 六つ -&gt; むつ, 八つ -&gt; やつ). Are they equivalent (meaning, usage, formality, etc) to their doubled consonant variation?

Thanks.

[[User:Agro1986|Agro1986]] 14:00, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

:Quick and inadequate &lt;del&gt;answer&lt;/del&gt; comment (note I don't have any classical Japanese literature knowledge... so if you want something related to classics, sorry in advance):
:At first, beware that at least these days we rarely say ひ ふ み... etc. みつ よつ むつ... also have limited usages. Well... probably they're just used as part of phrases. We never say &quot;ぼくはみつかった&quot; for &quot;ぼくは三つ買った&quot; (I bought it three). If I hear &quot;ぼくはみつかった&quot;, I recognize it as &quot;ぼくは見つかった&quot; (I was found [note: &quot;I was found&quot; is formally: Boku wa mitsuke rareta, but casually and often said as &quot;Boku wa mitsukatta&quot;]). You may wonder whether &quot;ぼくはリンゴをみつかった&quot; is O.K., but we never say that. It doesn't mean a thing, or it's a poem. So, they are not used when you count something (again, at least nowadays).
:Now, all I can do is just to show you some examples so please let me do that. For 三つ みつ, I can think of 三つ子 みつご (triplets). Well, in fact this continues as: 四つ子 よつご, 五つ子 いつつご, 六つ子 むつご, 七つ子 ななつご, 八つ子 やつご. For more than 8, I'm not sure. Another example: 三つ編み みつあみ (braid), 四つ辻 よつつじ (crossroad), 八つ橋 やつはし (kind of cinnamon cookie; [http://images.google.co.jp/images?q=%E5%85%AB%E3%81%A4%E6%A9%8B&amp;hl google image]). So perhaps (not sure) these are used for multiples things? No? Oh, help me Mr. or Ms. Linguist!
:Another (but not direct) evidence that implies these words are rare is my ATOK does not convert みつ to 三つ or よつ to 四つ and so on. HTH. - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 18:56, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

== Grammar and Syntax ==
Questions about how to use Japanese grammar, differences among grammatical constructions, how to translate grammatical constructions to an from Japanese, etc.

=== ha vs no houga ===

Are &quot;osake ha ocha yori warui&quot; ([[Japanese:Lessons:Nounphrase particles]]) and &quot;osake no hou ga ocha yori warui&quot; ([[Japanese/Lesson Comparisons]]) equivalent in meaning?

[[User:202.149.87.250|202.149.87.250]] 17:24, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, they're almost the same. Possible difference (depends on situations) is something like this:
:* for the latter, perhaps there're just two kinds of beverage: osake and ocha. Or, you just imagine these two in your mind.
:* for the former, the situation may be the same, too. However, this time there can be several kinds of beverage other than osake and ocha, and if that is the case, the expression might imply: &quot;when comparing these two, at least this can be said: ocha is better than osake. But please note that I don't say anything about other drinks such as coffee or juice.&quot;
:- [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 06:55, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

: I'm going to change ''warui'' (bad) to ''oishii'' (delicious, to taste good) because I think it makes a better example. I think the meaning of ''warui'' is a little unclear here. It probably means &quot;is bad for you&quot;, not &quot;tastes bad&quot;.
: In ''osake wa ocha yori oishii'', the topic/contrastive marker ''wa'' is used. That means that 
:* ''osake'' is a topic (is either easily understood from context or has previously appeared with ''ha'').
:* ''wa'' may be contrastive, that is, it may be contrasting ''osake'' with other beverages. &quot;Sake tastes better than tea. (*but* other beverages may not)&quot;. Note how this agrees with Marsian's comment that there may be other beverages. 
:* the sentence '''cannot''' be the answer to a question like 
:::おさけ　と　おちゃ　と　どっち　が　おいしい？　(''docchi'' is informal for ''dochira''; ''dochira'' is too polite for informal sentences)
:::&quot;Which one tastes better, sake or tea?&quot; 
: In ''osake no hou ga ocha yori oishii'', the subject marker ''ga'' is used. That means that
:* ''osake'' shouldn't be an established topic (shouldn't appear previously with ''wa''). It may be being mentioned for the first time.
::: ''ocha wa oishii''
::: Tea tastes good.
::: ''osake no hou ga (ocha yori) oishii yo'' (note: ''osake wa ocha yori oishii yo'' is also OK; everyone knows what sake is)
::: Sake tastes better (than tea).
:* the sentence could be the answer to a question like &quot;Which tastes better, sake or tea?&quot; Note how this agrees with Marsian's comment that in this case only the two beverages are being compared.



: In fact, I have a question for Marsian or anyone else. Above I wrote
:: ''ocha wa oishii''
:: ''X no hou ga (ocha yori) oishii yo'' (note: ''X wa ocha yori oishii yo'' is also OK) 
: Is there any situation where ''X wa ocha yori oishii yo'' is wrong for some noun X?
: For example, in English we could say
:: A-san: I'm tall.
:: B-san: '''The''' man that I saw in Japan was taller. (the listener already knows about the man -&gt; は is better? )
: and
:: A-san: I'm tall.
:: B-san: '''A''' man that I saw in Japan was taller. (the listener is hearing about the man for the first time -&gt; のほうが is better? )

::Well, I've never thought of. And even after five-hour thinking (hey, where's your vector analysis, Marsian?!), I'm still not sure what exactly you'd like to know...
::First of all, both can be used for both cases regardless whether or not the listener knows the man. However, I prefer のほうが like 「あの人 の ほうが 高いよ」. I don't like 「あの人 は 君 より 高いよ」 because, as you know, we avoid to say obvious pronouns such as 君より(も). In this case, は cannot be used without 君より(も), although there's another possibility 「あの人 は もっと(ずっと) 高いよ」 but this is slightly different in the meaning.

::BTW, your point, the/a problem is more likely the matter of the last part of the sentence (I don't know the linguistic term), isn't it? For example (rough translation in English is presented just for other readers),
::* A-san「おれ 結構 背 (が) 高い よね？」 &quot;I'm tall, don't you think so?&quot; ([http://ww6.tiki.ne.jp/~marsian/sound/ja-ore_kekkou_se_takai_yone.ogg])
::*# B-san「(い)や、あの人 (は or のほうが) お前 より 高かった じゃん」 &quot;Well, the man was taller, as you know.&quot; - A-san also knows the man. Probably A-san will respond 「あぁ あの人 ね」 &quot;Yeah, he was.&quot; ([http://ww6.tiki.ne.jp/~marsian/sound/ja-anohito_omaeyori_ah_anohitone.ogg])
::*# B-san「(い)や、あの人 (は or のほうが) お前 より 高かった けど な」 &quot;Well, a man was taller...&quot; - A-san may not know the man. If that is the case, probably A-san will ask 「え？ あの人 って？」 &quot;Huh? Who's the man?&quot; ([http://ww6.tiki.ne.jp/~marsian/sound/ja-anohito_omaeyori_e_anohitotte.ogg])
::Note I don't actually say は nor のほうが (in fact, I cannot(needn't) specify which one I'm saying(!), which made it difficult to analyze this matter). As you know, this often occurs in real conversations.
::... Again, I'm afraid I miss the point. - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 17:20, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

== Kanji and Kana Questions ==
Questions about how to write kanji and kana including stroke order, choice of kanji for a given word, which form of writing to use when, etc.

=== Inconsistent kanji stroke writing? ===

Compare

chikara (http://taka.sourceforge.net/current/kanji/J4E4F) vs ku (http://taka.sourceforge.net/current/kanji/J3665)

and

hidari (http://taka.sourceforge.net/current/kanji/J3A38) vs migi (http://taka.sourceforge.net/current/kanji/J3126)

Are those correct? Both pairs have similar shape and I expected them to have similar stroke writing order. Thanks. [[User:Agro1986|Agro1986]] 13:27, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

: The stroke order is right, although many Japanese people write the horizontal strokes first on all of these. Here is a Shogakukan (Japanese textbook publisher) webpage of [http://ed.shogakukan.co.jp/useful/kanji_guide2/kanji_guide2.html easily miswritten kanji from elementary school] with nice little movies. 
:--[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 20:23, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

: My favorite example of this is the stroke order for &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;右&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;みぎ&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt; and &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;左&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;ひだり&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;. I couldn't believe it when I learned these were written differently. We will try to include little things like that in the kanji section of the Wikibook.

=== Mother Stroke ===

&lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;輩&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;やから&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt; contains the radical &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;非&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;あら.ず&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt; and &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;車&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;くるま&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;. That is intuitively obvious.

However, dictionaries (example http://www.nuthatch.com/kanji/demo/6bcd.html) say that &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;母&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;はは&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt; has the &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;毋&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;なかれ&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt; radical in it. How? The shape is obviously different! Thanks. [[User:Agro1986|Agro1986]] 05:13, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

: Radicals are sometimes written differently as part of a character, and sometimes the same radical is written differently in different characters. I think the reasons are mostly historical (orthographic reforms, etc). My dictionary says that the old form of 毎 had 母 on the bottom. Sometimes the radical and the character are quite different. I was surprised to learn that 舎 (pre-WWII form: 舍) can have the radical 舌, and 承 can have the radical 手. You should be aware that some characters have multiple radicals, and that the radical may vary depending on the dictionary.

=== Yowai stroke order ===

This is Taka's version: http://taka.sourceforge.net/current/kanji/J3C65

However, when I view the stroke order from the program Wakan, it disagrees with Taka. Wakan says that the snakey shapes on yowai should be written like the snakey shape here: http://taka.sourceforge.net/current/kanji/J362F

Which one is correct, Taka or Wakan?

- [[User:Agro1986|Agro1986]] 13:58, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

:Hi. I doubt Taka just made a mistake. See, for example, [http://www.a-chi.jp/_2_nen_Flash/2-074.swf], or 弓 on [http://www.sky.sannet.ne.jp/kyoshio/DW/Hitsujun/Hitsujun.htm]. - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 23:42, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

=== Multiple stroke order ===

My friend (which had studied Japanese longer than me) said that some kanji (he mentioned mimi (ear)) can have multiple correct stroke order. Is it true?

Btw I have seen on my brother's Chinese language book that mimi's stroke are written in a different order than taka's (http://taka.sourceforge.net/current/kanji/J3C2A). Since it's a Chinese book my only thought was that Chinese may write the same kanji in a different way.

- [[User:Agro1986|Agro1986]] 13:58, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

:Firstly, though I do not know, according to [[w:ja:筆順]],
::&quot;''中華人民共和国の筆順とは異なっている。''&quot;
:::the stroke orders of Japanese kanjis are different from those of Chinese kanjis
:Secondly, for 耳, I thought that Taka's was right. However, it seems there're two ways of writing: See [http://www.sky.sannet.ne.jp/kyoshio/DW/Hitsujun/Hitsujun.htm this web page (漢字筆順字典)]. There're two for 耳 (the first one is Taka and mine, and perhaps more common), and, surprisingly, three for 馬 and four for 必!
:Quote from the page:
::&quot;''筆順につきましては、1958年に文部省が示した【筆順指導の手びき】が標準になっております。''&quot;
:::Standard for stroke orders is &quot;''Hitsujun shidou no tebiki'' (guideline for stroke order teaching)&quot;, published by the Ministry of Education in 1958.
::&quot;''ただ、この指導書には、文字通り「手引き」であって、「ここに取りあげなかった筆順についても、これを誤りとするものでもなく、また否定しようとするものでもない」と書かれているそうです。（江守賢治著【筆順の解明】日本習字普及協会）''&quot;
:::However, according to a book named &quot;''Hitsujun no kaimei'' (understanding stroke order)&quot;, in the guideline it says that &quot;This is just a guideline and does not intend to negate other stroke orders nor regard them as incorrect.&quot;
:So, in my opinion, perhaps it's not so bad to follow the &quot;standard&quot; stroke order, but you don't have to stick with it. Actually, I myself do write 弱 as Taka's &quot;wrong&quot; stoke so that I can spare time ;) And more, as you know, we're spending less and less time for &quot;writing&quot;, but shifting to &quot;type&quot;, where stroke order doesn't mean a thing.

:Nevertheless, I'd like to reccomend you to search with &quot;筆順&quot; if you're interested in stroke orders. For example, the two websites above ([http://www.a-chi.jp/] and [http://www.sky.sannet.ne.jp/kyoshio/DW/Hitsujun/Hitsujun.htm]) were direct results of googling([http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%E7%AD%86%E9%A0%86&amp;btnG=Google+Search search result]).

=== Missing Reading ===

The kanji 明 &quot;akarui&quot; (bright) and 日 &quot;hi&quot; (day) can be combined to make the word 明日 (&quot;ashita&quot; or &quot;asu&quot;) which means tomorrow. My guess is that the 明 is read as &quot;a&quot; and 日 as &quot;shita&quot; or &quot;su&quot;. However I am surprised to know that &quot;shita&quot; and &quot;su&quot; is not a reading of 日. It's the same with the kanji &quot;tai&quot; (big) and &quot;hito&quot; (person) that, when combined, reads as &quot;otona&quot; (the kanji hito doesn't have &quot;na&quot; or &quot;tona&quot; as one of its reading on the dictionaries).

So, are the readings missing from the dictionaries or am I missing something :)?

- [[User:Agro1986|Agro1986]] 13:58, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

:These are examples of [[wikipedia:ja:熟字訓 | 熟字訓 ]] (jukujikun), or &quot;compound kun readings&quot;. Jukujikun readings are kun readings that apply to the particular ''combination'' of characters (jukuji), rather than being the sum of the readings of individual characters. In other words, 大人 is &quot;otona&quot;, but the reading applies to the whole word rather than being derived from the readings for 大 and 人. That's why you can't find these readings for the individual characters. Note that some jukujikun are joyo kanji readings (&quot;approved&quot; readings) and some aren't (like &quot;ashita&quot;). Jukujikun readings seem to come up a lot in important time expressions:

::一昨日 - おととい　the day before yesterday
::昨日 - きのう　yesterday
::今日 - きょう　today
::明日 - あす or あした　tomorrow
::明後日 - あさって　the day after tomorrow
::今朝 　けさ　this morning
:-[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 03:56, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

::I didn't know the word 熟字訓... ;) I'm not sure if it's jukujikun but 二十日(hatsuka, 20th in a month) or 二十歳(hatachi, 20 years old) is also prominent, and what a small Japanese child might not be able to read.
::BTW, though I don't know how exactly you non-Japanese type the words, but if you can use any Japanese-IME (er, [[Japanese/Computing in Japanese]] is helpful?), verification is quite easy. Just type it. Both &quot;ashita&quot; and &quot;asu&quot; (plus pressing &quot;spacebar&quot;) give 明日. More, you can try &quot;asuka&quot; for 明日香.
::In fact, some of us (including me) sometimes forget kanjis since they are too dependent on IMEs. &quot;Ototoi... er... kinou is 昨日, it's clear, but, ototoi...? er... ok, I'll type it with my cell phone...(yes, you can write kana + kanji with japanese cell phone)&quot; - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 23:42, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

I can't write English without typing it in to a spell checker! [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 22:44, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

I'm not sure 'kesa' is Jukujitai. The word 今日 is read 'kyou' nowadays, but it used to be read 'kefu', and 'sa' seems like a shortening of 'asa' (similar to the word '裸足' (hadashi), which seems like a combination of 'hadaka' (naked) and 'ashi' (foot). --ܫܘܢܪܐ

=== 始 vs 初 ===

:Lurker 4.2 at 17:58, 23 February 2006 (PST?)
::I think it is more likely a mistake, but two different kanji used for ''hajimemashite'' in the first part of the introduction (Konnichiwa/Formal salutations). First, in the Phrases section, the kanji 始 is used. Later, in Grammatical Construction, 初 is used instead. Which is correct? If both are correct, why can one word be written with two different characters? -- Lurker 4.2
::: Ok, you will find both, but 初めまして is preferred, especially among younger speakers ([http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~qm4h-iim/k031002.htm graph of usage by age group]). The two characters have similar meanings; 始 means ''begin'' while 初 means ''for the first time''. 
:::It's not that uncommon for there to be more than one acceptable way to write a Japanese word, especially native Japanese words. Keep in mind that at some point in the past, Chinese characters were [[w:Japanese_writing_system|pressed into service]] to represent native Japanese words. So the Chinese character for horse 馬 is now the Japanese kanji for ''uma'' (horse). For more difficult words, who's to say that only one Chinese character is a good match? In fact, in some cases the characters are actually used to add meaning- the same basic native Japanese word is written with different characters depending on the nuance. かえる (''kaeru'', to change) is a good example of this:
::::変える change (the nature or character of one thing)
::::換える convert (something into something entirely different), go from one thing to another

== Culture and History ==
Questions about the Japanese mindset, how Japanese react to different situations, how Japanese history affects modern life, etc.

== Miscellaneous ==

=== Pronunciation ===
I have a Japanese aunt. She speaks English well, with a very strong Japanese accent. She once talked to my mom one day about getting her license. Mom thought she said &quot;rice ends&quot;. So, my aunt explained that the Japanese often confuse L with R since they don't have the former. Do the Japanese really have no L? --[[User:68.73.146.102|68.73.146.102]] 20:51, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

:(please be aware I'm NO linguist) Hmm, I don't know if we do not have L, but it's true we do not need to distinguish R and L. It's simply unnecessary. Although in romaji, the characters are written as &quot;Ra, Ri, Ru, Re, Ro&quot; (see [[Japanese/Kana]] and others for more) but even if you pronouce them as &quot;La, Li, Lu, Le, Lo&quot;, no one will mind it, or, they even might not notice the differences. For example, a camel is ラクダ (rakuda) in Japanese, but I believe you can safely pronounce it as &quot;Lakuda&quot; and everybody'll understand what you're talking about. In fact, I doubt in this case it's more like Lakuda than Rakuda... but you know, I don't know if ''I'' can tell the differences, so... ;) - [[User:Marsian|marsian]] 12:41, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

::The Japanese sound written with &quot;R&quot; is actually neither the English R sound nor the English L sound, so asking which sound is &quot;missing&quot; is somewhat misleading. 

::From the wikipedia article on [[w:Japanese_phonology|Japanese pronunciation]]:

:::* {{IPA|/r/}} (transcribed {{IPA|ɺ̠}} above) is a [[w:lateral consonant|lateral]] [[w:Apical consonant|apical]] postalveolar flap. It is similar to the Korean ''r''. To an English speaker's ears, its pronunciation lies somewhere between a flapped ''r'' {{IPA|/ɾ/}} (as in American English ''be'''tt'''er'' and ''la'''dd'''er''), an ''l'', and a ''d'', sounding most like ''d'' before {{IPA|/i/}}, and most like ''l'' before {{IPA|/o/}}.

::In other words, if you say &quot;Eddie&quot; quickly, you'll almost be saying ''eri'' (collar).
::As Marsian points out above, most Japanese speakers can't distinguish the English R sound from the English L sound (although with a little practice they definitely can pronounce them more than adequately). If you are speaking Japanese and aren't sure how to make the Japanese sound, you can get away with an English L sound.

=== n followed by k ===
In the second lesson of the introductory course on Japanese ([[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Konnichiwa/Pronunciation]]), the moraic ''n'' (without the apostrophe) is said to come only before ''m'', ''b'', or ''p''. However, it does not leave clear how to pronounce the ''nk'' in words like ''benkei''. Is this another case of the moraic n or is it pronounced diffrently?

:Well... I do not know grammar. It's not my part. I just rec for you {{audio|Ja-benkei.ogg|Ja-benkei.ogg}}(sorry a bit loud maybe). --[[User:Marsian|marsian]] 17:31, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

:Actually, I think the text just says that moraic n sounds like ''m'' before ''m'', ''b'', or ''p''. The moraic n certainly comes before other consonants. Before ''k'' and ''g'', it sounds like the English ''ng'' in ''sing''. But this is the way ''n'' is pronounced before ''k'' in English too. If you don't believe me, try saying ''sink'' without pronouncing the ''k''. --[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 10:41, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

=== How is -ei pronounced in japanese? ===
I don't know who posed this question, but:

When in the middle of the word, 'ei' is usually pronounced as -ee- (long vowel e, not like English double e, but more like 'eeh'), for example: ''beikoku'' (USA), ''keiko'' (practise), ''seinen'' (youth, young man, adult age), ''meishi'' (business card), ''keitai'' (cell phone), ''eiga'' (movie). When it comes at the end of a word, it can be pronounced the same way (for example: ''gakusei'' (student), although I've also heard this as '-ei'), but in some cases it is more like the -ei as in the English 'vein', especially for short words like for example: ''rei'' (zero), ''tokei'' (watch, clock).

Sukiyaki is a kind of shabu-shabu ( a Japanese dish) but it is a bit sweeter
==Ingredients==

* Thin slices of beef
* 1 napa cabbage
* Green onions
* Firm tofus
* Shiitake mushrooms
* Spinach
* Shirataki noodles

===Sauce===
* Soy sauce
* Sake
* Sugar
* Water

==Procedure==
# Wash the vegetables.
# Cut the vegetables to large pieces.
# Put the mushrooms inside the warm water for 15 minutes.
# Thaw the beef (if they are frozen.)
# Mix the sauce inside a small bowl.
# Heat the (electric) skillet; set the heat to low.
# Lubricate &amp; coat the skillet with a little bit of oil.
# Put a few slices of beef into the skillet.
# Cook the beef slices until they turn brown.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Black Hole in the universe.jpg|right|thumb|What lies at the shadowed centre of the mysterious objects?]]
Black holes are objects of mystery, and recent studies have revealed that they may be even stranger than once thought. The core of the black hole is termed the &quot;naked singularity&quot;. It is a gravitational singularity that is predicted to be, infinite in density. Such an object's mere existence completely defies the laws of physics as we know them, but it is logical to assume that the center of the black hole should be infinitely compacted. However, such an object would be forever cloaked by the event horizon of its host black hole, so observation is most probably impossible.

Some have gone so far as to say that this cloaking is a deliberate result of a kind of &quot;cosmic censorship&quot; that prevents the naked singularity, as radically as it defies the laws of physics, from being released from beyond the event horizon. What exactly would result from the exposure of the enigmatic core remains highly speculative (as does, the entire subject matter).

Potential for human use of the naked singularity is also something that has been discussed; the observation and study of a body with infinite density would undoubtedly prove highly revealing to astronomers, and may shed light on black holes and other aspects of physics and astronomy.

Wikimedia Commons is a free image repository run by the Wikimedia Foundation. You can use any image there as if it existed on Wikibooks using the same [[m:Help:Images|markup]]. They have many [[commons:Maps_of_Myanmar|maps]] that are totally free to use, which don't require you to upload them here. I suggest you use images from Commons instead of searching the internet to find images that you can use, since most images on the internet are not free to use.

{{recipesummary|Potato recipes|4|10 min|3|Image=[[Image:Potato_stew.jpg|300px]]}}

Stewing is a great way to take care of left over [[Cookbook:potato|potatoes]]. Potato stew goes well with [[Cookbook:sausage|sausages]], [[Cookbook:meatballs|meatballs]], or [[Cookbook:smoking|smoked]], [[Cookbook:salting|salted]] or [[Cookbook:Gravlax|gravad]] fish.

== Ingredients ==
* 10 leftover boiled [[Cookbook:potato|potatoes]]
* 30 ml of [[Cookbook:Wheat|wheat]] [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 4 dl of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], preferably with high fat content (about 3%)
* 20 ml of [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:pepper|white pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Dill|Dill]]

== Procedure ==
Peel and dice the cold, already boiled, potatoes; make the cubes about 1-2 cm across. Mix the flour with the milk in a saucepan. Be careful to get a smooth mix without lumps; it may help to add just a little bit of milk at the time until a smooth thick substance forms, then add the rest of the milk. Add the butter. For a low-fat alternative, omit the butter. Omitting the butter works perfectly fine but the stew will lose some of its smoothness and luster. Bring the sauce to a boil, add the potatoes and boil gently for 5 min. Add salt, pepper and dill to taste.

=== With raw potatoes ===
Dice the potatoes; make the cubes about 1 cm across. Put the diced potatoes in a saucepan an add milk until it almost covers the potatoes. ''Gently'' boil until the potatoes are soft, about 10 min, stirring occasionally. If the stew is too thin, add some [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]] to the potatoes and boil for a few more minutes. Finally add the dill.

== Variations ==
The dill can be substituted for [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]] or [[Cookbook:chive|chive]].
Add one or two table spoons (15 ml) of [[Cookbook:Dijon_Mustard|Dijon mustard]] to touch up the flavor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a search form that uses a single input text field and submits a search request to a search service on a remote web server.

== Discussion ==
We are all familiar with the simple front end to search engines like Google that display a simple search field.  There are two simple features we will demonstrate in the first version.  1) The input cursor will be positioned in the search field when the form loads.  When you press the &quot;Enter&quot; key the search will automatically be executed.

We will also discuss a way to have a single form display both simple search and complex search functions.

== Method ==
We will first create a simple search input field and give it an id of &quot;search-field&quot;.  We will also add an action to the input that will fire off the submission when the Enter key is pressed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:input ref=&quot;q&quot; id=&quot;search-field&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:label&gt;Search string:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
   &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:send submission=&quot;search&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/xf:action&gt;
&lt;/xf:input&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, '''q''' is a reference to the query string we will be sending to the remote server.

From the prior example we learned that you can have the cursor automatically positioned in the search field when the form loads by adding the following action added to your model:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:model&gt;
  ...
  &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;xforms-ready&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:setfocus control=&quot;search-field&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/xf:action&gt;
...
&lt;/xf:model&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Screen Image ==
[[Image:xforms-google-search-form.jpg|center|frame|Sample Google Search Form]]

== Link to XForms Application ==

[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/07-submitting-data/45-search/search.xhtml Load XForms Application]

== Sample Program ==
In this example we will create a simple front end to Google's search engine.  The format of the REST API for the Google search engine is the following:

&lt;code&gt;
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=XForms
&lt;/code&gt;

In this REST query the parameters are:
* hl = language (en for English)
* q = search query string

We can create an instance that has these parameters in our model:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
   &lt;data&gt;
      &lt;hl&gt;en&lt;/hl&gt;
      &lt;q&gt;&lt;/q&gt;
   &lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/xf:instance&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Full Program Listing ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
    xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
    xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot; 
    xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
    xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot; &gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Google Search Example&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;  
         body {font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif}        
        &lt;/style&gt;
        &lt;xf:model&gt;
            &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot; id =&quot;search-params&quot;&gt;
                &lt;data&gt;
                    &lt;hl&gt;en&lt;/hl&gt;
                    &lt;q&gt;&lt;/q&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
            &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
        &lt;!-- Send the search parameters to the Google search engine and replace this entire form with the results --&gt;
            &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;search-google&quot; method=&quot;get&quot; 
            action=&quot;http://www.google.com/search&quot; replace=&quot;all&quot;
            separator=&quot;&amp;amp;&quot;/&gt;

        &lt;!-- put the cursor in the first field when the form becomes ready --&gt;
            &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;xforms-ready&quot;&gt;
                &lt;xf:setfocus control=&quot;search-field&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/xf:action&gt;
        &lt;/xf:model&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Google Search Example&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;instance('search-params')/q&quot; id=&quot;search-field&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Search string:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
            &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
                &lt;xf:send submission=&quot;search-google&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/xf:action&gt;
        &lt;/xf:input&gt;
        &lt;xf:submit submission=&quot;search-google&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Search&lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:submit&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==

You can also send over a dozen other parameters to the Google search service.  For example if you want to restrict
the search results to a specific web site or sub-site you can just add an additional &quot;site&quot; parameter that restricts search results to that site.  For example the following URL will restrict the search results to pages on this wikibook:

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=xforms+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fen.wikibooks.org%2Fwiki%2FXForms

Note that because forward slashes are part of the search query they are replaced with a '''%2F''' string.

The [http://www.opensearch.org OpenSearch] XML standard may also be of interest.
This standard allows any search service to specify the parameters to a search engine and how the data is returned to
a search client.

== Talk page like discussion in the book ==
Is the book supposed to look like a discussion between people? I don't say it's bad, it could help in the learning process, I don't know. [[Special:Contributions/143.233.245.73|143.233.245.73]] ([[User talk:143.233.245.73|talk]]) 19:22, 27 February 2008 (UTC)

I agree, it shouldn't read like a person-to-person conversation. A third-person point of view should be taken. Also, it should be modified to read less like it's written for a young child. Much of what is there can also be compressed to read more smoothly. [[User:Richalex2010|Richalex2010]] ([[User talk:Richalex2010|talk]]) 17:56, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

You guys think this is good now? [[User:VenomousNinja|~VNinja]][[User talk:VenomousNinja|~]] 20:47, 2 July 2008 (UTC)

== Edit Hiatus ==

Hey.
Sorry I haven't edited this in a while. I have an excuse, but I won't waste either of our times typing it so you can read it.
Anyway... My &quot;Edit Hiatus&quot; may possibly last another few days, but then I'll be back on top of things, okay? [[User:VenomousNinja|~VNinja]][[User talk:VenomousNinja|~]] 12:52, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

Yea, I've pretty much forgotten about this book. Sorry. [[User:VenomousNinja|~VNinja]][[User talk:VenomousNinja|~]] 11:52, 5 October 2009 (UTC)</text>

==What is new page patrol?==
New page patrol means watching the [[Special:Newpages|new page feed]] to find pages which are vandalism, nonsense, spam, misnamed, don't fit within project scope, are duplicates, etc.  In the past this has been done entirely manually, which meant lots of work was duplicated.  A new software feature allows us to make sure efforts don't overlap.

==What's the new software feature?==
[[Image:Patrol1.PNG|thumb|400px|At [[Special:Newpages]] you can see all new pages. The combo box indicated by the purple arrow allows you to search by namespace. The ''Hide'' link in the green rectangle allows previously-patrolled pages to be hidden to reduce duplication of efforts. The red arrow shows an unpatrolled page on a yellow background. Let's patrol that page.]]
[[Image:Patrol2.PNG|thumb|400px|The red rectangle indicates the ''mark as patrolled'' link at the bottom right corner of the page. This will mark the revision we are viewing as patrolled when it is clicked after reviewing the page.]]
[[Image:Patrol3.PNG|thumb|400px|After marking the page as patrolled, you can either return to [[Special:Newpages]] by clicking the link indicated by the blue arrow. If the page needs to be fixed or tagged, you can simply click the ''edit'' tab from this view (indicated by the green rectangle (the ''move'' tab is also available).]]
[[Image:Patrol4.PNG|thumb|400px|At [[Special:Log/Patrol]], you can see all recent patrols. You can search using the fields in the red rectangle. The entry indicated by the green arrow is the one just completed. The green rectangle indicates a link to the revision we marked as patrolled. The entry indicated with the purple arrow is an automatically-patrolled page. [[WB:ADMIN|admins]] and [[WB:BOT|bots]] have their page creations automatically patrolled, as indicated by ''(automatic)'' in the purple rectangle.]]
New page patrol has long been a maintenance task Wikibookians performed, but a new software feature that was enabled recently makes division of labour easier. Until the feature was enabled, there was no way to tell which pages on [[Special:Newpages]] had already been looked at by another user. This feature allows users with the ''[[WB:ADMIN|sysop]]'', ''[[WB:BOT|bot]]'', and ''patroller'' rights to mark pages as patrolled. Patrolled pages appear on a white background on [[Special:Newpages]]; unpatrolled pages appear highlighted in yellow. You can hide already-patrolled pages, and you can sort by namespace (the &quot;all&quot; option is now fixed too).

==How do I mark a page as patrolled?==
To mark a page as patrolled, you must open it from the link provided on [[Special:Newpages]]. Towards the bottom right corner of the page, a &quot;mark this page as patrolled&quot; link appears. Click it to patrol the page. You can now click the link to go back to [[Special:Newpages]] to continue patrolling, or you can click the edit tab to edit the page if needed. ''It's best to mark a page as patrolled, then go back and tag it/fix it/whatever.''

Admins, bots and patrollers have all pages they create automatically marked as patrolled.

==What do I need to know to do new page patrol?==
You need to read and understand the following policies: [[WB:WIW|inclusion policy]], [[WB:DP|deletion policy]], [[WB:NP|naming policy]].
You must also understand how to use the following templates properly:
*{{tlx|delete|''reason''}}
*{{tlx|cleanup|''reason''}}
*{{tlx|copyvio|''source''}} and {{tlxs|nothanks|''Module''|&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
*{{tlx|query}} and  {{tlxs|query notice|''Module''|&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
*{{tlx|transwiki|''WikiWiki''}}
*{{tlx|rename|''Book Name''}}
*{{tlx|dupe|''module''}}
*{{tlxs|test|&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
*{{tlx|rfd}} and {{tlxs|rfd warning|''Book''|&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
If you're also going to patrol [[Special:Newimages|new images]], you'll also need to use:

==What should I mark as patrolled?==
;Mark as patrolled
:All pages that meet the requirements in our [[WB:WIW|inclusion]] and [[WB:NP|naming]] policies
:All pages that ''don't'' meet those requirements, but have been tagged or otherwise dealt with
:Remember to mark pages as patrolled, ''then'' go back and tag them or fix them or whatever (this ensures that you don't forget to go back to patrol the page, but also makes sure that it's marked as taken care of as soon as you start - there won't be duplication of efforts).
;Don't mark as patrolled
:Anything you want a 2nd opinion on
:Patrol only these namespaces: Main, Wikibooks, Cookbook, Wikijunior. Watch for strange stuff in the other namespaces, but you don't have to patrol them.

==How do I get patroller rights?==
:''Main page: [[Wikibooks:User rights]]''
Once you've read and understand this page, and the policies and templates linked from it, list your request on [[WB:RFP]], where an admin will process it. You should do some new page patrolling ''without'' the right so other new page patrollers can see your work. This lets us gauge whether you know what you're doing before letting you mark pages as patrolled because once you have the right, nobody is likely to check your work. Remember that patrolled pages can be hidden, and patrollers rarely examine previously-patrolled pages.

*''AJAX Patrolling:'' allows faster patrolling of new pages by making the [mark as patrolled] AJAX. Enable this on the ''Gadgets'' tab of ''[[Special:Preferences|my preferences]]''.

*:'''[[MediaWiki:Gadget-twinklespeedy.js|Twinkle Speedy]]''': [[Special:ListUsers/sysop|Administrators]] and [[Special:ListUsers/patroller|patrollers]] may use to help make [[WB:NPP|new page patrolling]] and related tasks easier using the familiar [[w:WP:TW|Twinkle]] interface. The script cannot be used unless you have the sysop or patrol rights; the script will fail in [[w:Internet Explorer|Internet Explorer]], has been tested in [[w:Firefox|Firefox]], and may work in [[w:Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[w:Camino|Camino]], or [[w:Safari (web browser)|Safari]]. As with [[w:WP:TW|the original Twinkle script]], ''all edits made are your responsibility regardless of bugs in the script''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Server-side scripts look almost the same as client-side scripts, but they will typically use the bbhostgrep utility to pick out hosts in the bb-hosts file that have a special tag defined, and then send one status message for each of those hosts. Like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/sh

BBHTAG=foo           # What we put in bb-hosts to trigger this test
COLUMN=$BBHTAG	# Name of the column, often same as tag in bb-hosts

$BBHOME/bin/bbhostgrep $BBHTAG | while read L
do
   set $L	# To get one line of output from bbhostgrep

   HOSTIP=&quot;$1&quot;
   MACHINEDOTS=&quot;$2&quot;
   MACHINE=`echo $2 | $SED -e's/\./,/g'`

   COLOR=green
   MSG=&quot;$BBHTAG status for host $MACHINEDOTS&quot;

   #... do the test, perhaps modify COLOR and MSG

   $BB $BBDISP &quot;status $MACHINE.$COLUMN $COLOR `date`

   ${MSG}
   &quot;
done
 
exit 0
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that for server side tests, you need to loop over the list of hosts found in the bb-hosts file, and send one status message for each host. Other than that, it is just like the client-side tests.

This script is saved in ~/hobbit/server/ext/my_script.sh, and you add its description in ~hobbit/server/etc/hobbitlaunch.cfg:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
[foo]
   ENVFILE $BBTHOME/etc/hobbitserver.cfg
   CMD $BB/ext/my_script.sh
   LOGFILE $BB/logs/myscript.log
   INTERVAL 5m
&lt;/source&gt;

The service can now be added to the bb-hosts file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
127.0.0.1 my_server # foo
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this book we introduce seven Distance Education Cases chosen from seven different countries around the world. The countries include South Africa, Thailand, Korea, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Turkey and Malaysia. We mainly focus on Megauniversities as in 5 of the countries. The other two cases (Myanmar and Malaysia) discussed are not yet Megauniversities but hopefully will be in the near future. We hope you will edit our cases and add some more megauniversities and other distance education institutions later.

==Introduction==

  &lt;p&gt;Anadolu University is one of the national universities in Turkey which locates in Eskişehir. The university has established in November 6, 1958 and started distance education service in 1982.  They house 12 faculties, 7 schools, 4 vocational schools, 9 institutes (4 graduate schools, 5 institutes) and 28 research centers and units and hold with approximately 1,075,200 students. Distance Education System of Anadolu University has 3 faculties with 1,050, 000 students. 40 % of students who attend their education are those who attend Anadolu University, Now Anadolu University is considered one of the ten mega-universities of the world which provide the distance education system.&lt;/p&gt;

==Turkey Profile==
&lt;p&gt;'''General Background'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Survey by OECD (2005), there are 72,064,000 people in Turkey. As ethnic composition, Turkish dominates mainly. In the South-East region, many Kurdish live there and there is also Armenian Greek and Jew, even these numbers are small. Turkey is a predominantly Muslim country (Sunnah). As other religions, Jewish religion, Greek orthodox Church and Armenia orthodox Church are raised.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In spite of an Islamic country, Turkey tries to corporate with European countries and set the goal to be a signatory of EU. Now, Turkey is an accession country of EU, and a signatory of NATO, OECD, OSCE.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;GDP in the country is now 7710.832 and GDP Growth is 7.3802 % in 2005(from OECD Survey). Turkey keeps economic growth however, still the labor environment is not fully developed. For example, employment rate for men 68.183% and that for women is 23.6941% (OECD, 2005). As you can see from this data, the gender difference is still serious problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The information from OECD site [http://stats.oecd.org/wbos/viewhtml.aspx?queryname=334&amp;querytype=view&amp;lang=en]and the Ministry of Japanese Foreign Affairs(Japanese sites)[http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/area/turkey/data.html]) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;'''Education'''&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Infrastructure of Education is not fully developed even primary school level. Since 1997, establishment of the Basic Education Law, enrollment figures for Primary school are increasing (1,000,000 btw 1991-1996), however the rate is not changed due to the increasing of population itself (10% still, not enroll for primary education). As to the secondary education level, the situation is more serious. In addition, the access for education is differ among gender, social-economic status and locations (70 % who could not enroll primary education is female) Especially, the east and southeast area on which poor people concentrate, the access to education is limited.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with regards to the tertialy education, in academic year 2001-2002, there were 775,132 new enrollment for full-time bachelor’s students, at the same time there were 623,465 new enrollment for Distance education (The Council of Higher Education, 2003). The ratio of the total number of students in tertialy education to age 18-21 population is only 33 % (The Council of Higher Education, 2003).In tertialy education, the demand is significantly over the supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of education is not assured. In general, educational level in Turkey is worse than other EU nations (for example only 26 % of 15-years in Turkey have level 3 on OECD’s 6 level proficiency scale for program-solving skills—-in EU,it is 60%). The quality of education is actually incumbent upon where students live. Experienced teachers are not available enough in remote areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For becoming a signatory of EU, the education reform is urged. For example, raising complementation rate of primary school and assuring quality of Education like, developing Modern Curriculum so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;Br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, with overlooking the history of distance education in Anadolu University, it is concludes that 1) Anadolu continues to peruse the flexibleness in education 2) Anadolu actively tries to integrate new technology into the existing system 3) Anadolu is influenced by educational demands of national ministries and develops the programs with them.&lt;/p&gt;

===Organization===
&lt;p&gt; Anadolu University possesses 2 campuses in Eskişehir and 81 bureaus throughout 83 provinces in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
Anadolu University Distance Education System has 3 facilities, Faculty of Economics, Business Administration and Open Education.

*&lt;p&gt;Online Master Problems in Hospitality management and teaching developmentally disabled children.&lt;/p&gt;

===Student Demography===
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are 1,050, 000 Distance Education students. According to Simon et al (2003), the vast majority of the students enrolled in distance education system are working adults with full- or part-time jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Even though Anadolu University offers the WEP for other nations in West Europe, it is guessed that international students are relatively few. From the survey by The Council of Higher Education (2003), the total number of higher education students in 2001 is 1,568,384 and among those, only 16,328 students are international ones. It means that only 1.04 % of students in Turkey are from outsides country. Since current data is not available yet, the exact thing could not be said, but now 2008, it is expected that students from International are slightly increasing in Anadolu University because 1) the impact of becoming an accession country enhances the circulation of students, 2) Online degree programs are provided with institutions outside Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

===Courses===
'''Instruction Deliverly'''
 &lt;p&gt;''Textbook''&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Anadolu University actively incorporates new technology into the Distance Education System, the Textbook is a core media to bring instructions to  students. Anadolu has the special teams for textbook developments which are composed by contents experts, editors, instructional designers, TV editors, art directors, language experts and measurement and evaluation experts. After the reformation of the Distance Education System and courses in 1999, textbooks have been also reformed to accord with TV and online programs and new teams were organized. Now, they have 281 different textbooks for distance education courses which has been developed by these experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;''TV and Radio programs''&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV and Radio Programs are broadcasted respectively on TRT4 and on TRT Radio 1. These programs have been developed with help by educational technology and technical experts, and now have reached to the number of 5200 for TV and 400 for radio which were produced.
TV programs are broadcasted 24 weeks per year, 37 hours per week.&lt;/p&gt;

'''Surpport Service'''

&lt;p&gt;''Video Conference System''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is used for collaborating with other organizations and for students’ counseling. By now, Anadolu University collaborated with Ahmet Yesevi International Turk-Kazak University, Open University in UK, CNED France, NIME in Japan, Germany (Colonge) and Istanbul (Aksaray). These video conferences are facilitated via terrestrial line and satellite.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;''Academic Counseling Services''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students are given chance to interact with other students and instructors. They can gain academic advises from instructors. These services are available in 10 countries in evenings and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;''E-learning services''&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Students are given the right to access e-contents for free and able to gain those options –e-books, e-television, e-exam, e-drill and practices, and e-audio books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;''Exam preparations service''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1999, taped TV and Live TV programs have been produced and provided for students to prepare the final examinations. Each format is broadcasted for one week. Students also have chances to ask the question as to programs by phone. Calling an 800 number which is free is available as an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;''Virtual Classroom''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, a virtual class room for undergraduate program in English language teaching has been started to create an interactive leaning environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;''&quot;News from our university”''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 10 minutes broadcasting programs for making the relationship between students and the university. Information about events on the campus, the university, courses and programs are provided. This service is implemented though the academic year and the program will be updated every other week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;'''Analysis of Distance Education System in Anadolu University; from a theoretical aspect'''&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It is said that from the aspect of course production, the theory “Industrialized Educational System” by Peters (1967) well describe the Distance Sysytem of Anadolu University. It was easily expected that Anadolu University, Turkey in general had started Distance Education System with limited technology at that time. Even Peters claimed industrialized theory in 1967, this theory could be well applied in 1982, starting year, of Anadolu University. Infrastructures were not well-developed at that time and text were main instructional delivery. In addition, the aim of establishment was bringing education for the increasing number of prospective students. Thus, these backgrounds have accelerated to produce the mass instruction with keeping a certain level of quality by instructional design system. Now, technological availability enables to use more sophisticated mediums such as Internet, however text is still main core materials, thus Peters’ theory is still applied. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The current courses provided by Anadolu also apply to “Guided Didactic Conversation” by Holmberg (1995). Anadolu University clarifies “student’s center, making much of interactivity”. It seems like to apply those theories which focus on “Interaction and communication” by such as Moore (2005). However 1) their interactivity is limited as an optional service (for example, not used as a main curriculum), 2) interactivity technology are used a limited way (for example, internet, computers are used as publishing contents, teleconferencing system is used to bringing instruction for outside institutions). From these aspects, these limited interactivities could not be fully matched to the theories related to “Interaction and communication”, rather, their enhanced ideology “students-center” “enhancing rich support services” with old type medium “text”, “TV”, are applied to the theory by Homberg, which make much of discourse , interactivity with contents.&lt;/p&gt;

==The Purpose of Distance Education==

   &lt;p&gt; Anadolu University which has started the distance educational services since 1982, first started for providing an alternative chance for higher education. The Distance Education Service of Anadolu University has begun to fill the gap between increasing demands for higher education and the shortage of supply. Their purpose of distance education was to solve educational problem in Turkey and raise educational levels of Turkish citizen. This vision is passed down to now and will be passed in the future. Thus, the distance education system of Anadolu University targets to those people who could not continue their educations by the traditional way.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Now, their purpose of Distance education is expanding as facing the life-long learning society. The Council of Higher Education in Turkey shows the clear direction and vision for higher education and distance education. It defines Distance Education as providing all people with chances to keep learning through the lifetime. Behind this vision of life-long learning society, one can see the contemplation of Turkey--- for being the member country of EU. It appears that Turkey is now making efforts to go along with EU, in the ideological level.&lt;p/&gt; 
Since the Council of Higher education governs all of the national universities, Anadolu University, with no exception, pose their Distance Education System along this line. Anadolu University raise the Distance Education as the means for providing all people with educational chances----for self-development, self-actualization, vocational developments throughout the lifetime.

==The Impact of Distance Education==
===The Impact on Education in Turkey===

   &lt;p&gt;Anadolu University declares the clear visions and its roles as a higher educational institution. These visions and roles are strictly in correspondence with the vision declared by The Council of Higher Education which governs all of the national universities in Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt; As in the previous sections, only 33 % of youths recieve higher education. In addtion, those who can earn a higher education might be regionally decided. The map on the top of this chapter plots the number of universities along the region. From this plotting, one can soon find out that higher education institutions are disproportionably located in west part of the country where are a quite more wealth parts in Turkey. People living in geographically disadvantaged places are in general in low social economic status. Thus, economical reasons, when provided chances to enrollment, they could not continue their learning without working for money. Thus, with respects to providing those people with educational chance, distance education system which is free from time and space constrains is strongly needed.

   &lt;p&gt; Among courses offered by Distance Education System in Anadolu University, courses for teacher’ preparation is significantly important. After establishing the Basic Education Law (Law No. 4360), it is the national goal to enhance the access to primly education, updating curriculum and teachers training. As seen in the report by the World Bank (2007), the disproportional availability of skilled teachers is serious problems in Turkey primaly and second Education. Anadolu University has opened courses for the purpose of teacher training in response to this national demand. Distance Education System, which covers throughout nations with 73 bureaus and advanced technology, provides many teachers in disadvantaged regions with opportunities to pursue higher knowledge and skills. Anadolu University also opened many courses at the past time for Turkey Army, Polices and Teachers in response to demands by Ministries. Thus, Anadolu University has the significant role of Education in Turkey, both for citizens and the nation.
&lt;/p&gt; 

   &lt;p&gt;Even though other universities also provide some distance educational programs, Anadolu university is posed as the center of Distance Education and is expected to lead distance and open education filed.Anadolu University is only an university which has fully autonomy to implement the distance education and collaboration with other universities. As to other universities, in general, the Council of Higher Education decides the course exchanges between 2 institutions. On the other hand, Anadolu University is assigned as the providers of any courses as the form of distance education and other institutions are freely to negotiate with Anadolu to utilize the courses provided by Anadolu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;Br&gt;(For more details, visit Ministry of National Education in Turkey[http://www.meb.gov.tr/english/indexeng.htm],The Counsil of Higher Education in Turkey [http://www.yok.gov.tr/english/index_en.htm]and The World Bank-country report-Turkey[http://www.worldbank.org.tr/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/TURKEYEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20848223~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:361712,00.html])

===The Impact on Distance Education Field===

 &lt;p&gt;Now, Anadolu leads the distance education filed in the Western Europe and Middle East Area as higher education institution and research organization. They publish the referee journal “TOJDE” (The Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education) for the purpose of enhancing the implementation of Distance Education among Middle East area and communications among institutions in the area through the research. The impact on the world level is a quite not sure, but it is said that Anadolu University takes an initiative for Distance Education in Middle East Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;(For more details, visit the TOJDE sites, [http://tojde.anadolu.edu.tr/]. You can read some articles.)

===Areas of Improvement===

&lt;p&gt;'''Completion rate'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most recent figures in year 2000, 34% of students earned degrees in 2 years programs and 23 % in 4 years programs with the minimum terms (MacWilliams, 2000). This figure shows lots of distance learners face the difficulty to go though their programs. In 2006, just fewer than 50 % completed 2 years programs, whereas only 25 % completed 4 years bachelor programs (Aydin et al, 2006 qtd by Akbulut et al, 2007). Thus, as to 2 years programs, the situation has improved; however, still in 4 years bachelor programs, no improvement can be seen. In addition, earlier drop-out rate is a quite high. About 45 % students will drop out in the first 2 years (Aydin et al, 2006 qtd by Akbulut et al, 2007). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The background of this issue is that most of the students work as full or part-time, and time management is a quite difficult. What is more, “the distance” between other learners and instructors causes the feeling of isolation and students gradually loose their motivation. Even though, Anadolu university provides 58 academic counseling centers throughout the nation (MacWilliam, 2000), it seems like not working well. Further supports, especially earlier support is needed to prevent from earlier drop-out.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Since only 8 % can access in Internet in their daily life (MacWilliam, 2000), just-in-time feedbacks or emotional supports are difficult in the current situations. Providing more supports centers or rising the level of living in citizens is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;'''Quality assurance'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues about quality assurance are raised in 2 levels: one is the quality assurance for students’ learning outcomes; the other is the quality assurance for Anadolu University, itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achievements are mainly evaluated by multiple questions (MacWilliam, 2000; Akbulut et al, 2007). The reliability of assessments is of doubt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality assurance of Anadolu, itself is not enough. Given Anadolu accounts for the disproportionably high distance learners-99% in Turkey, Anadolu is of monopoly in Distance Education filed. The lack of competitor in general keeps the monopoly from further development. There is no standard assessment system of higher education, of course of Distance Education in Turkey. The quality of enrollment figures is also of problem. Because legally required for open acceptance, Anadolu faces difficulty in upgrading its standard (MacWilliam, 2000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues related to quality assurance actually results in the distrust toward Distance degrees. Anadolu do not indicate that degrees were eared by distance education, apparently reflecting employers’’ distastes for distance degrees (MackWilliam, 2000). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;'''Take an initiative for faculty development'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staff upgrading is one of the priorities Anadolu have to embark on. Akbulut et al (2007) claimed from their survey for instructors, they found that relatively few instructors involve in in-service training even though most of instructors have motivation to upgrade their instructions. Aydin(2003) pointed out that in Turkey in general, there are no tradition of professional development for university teaching (qtd by Akbulut et al, 2007). It is prospected that technological advancement and diversification of student’s demography and needs are accelerated in future in Distance Education. For meeting these initial demands of professional development, the system of professional development has to be developed. It appears that a faculty or a division is required to take an initiative as organizing instructors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt; '''The role as a research institution'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Latchem (2007) suggested, in Asian Distance Education field, there are lack of the culture for research. Anadolu university, even publishing an original journal and holding symposiums, it appears that the research culture is not well mature. Further development is also needed as a research institution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Egypt has a history almost older than any other civilization on Earth, a history that stretches back many thousands of years. Evidence of human existence around the Nile dates back to at least the Paleolithic era, over 12,000 years ago. Civilization there started to develop when small tribes of hunter-gatherers and fisherman settled there, and a culture began to form. From there, the population living by the Nile thrived, as the yearly flooding of the nile brought incredibly rich soil for farming, and by 6000 BC, advanced agricultural practices had developed, as did large-scale building construction. Three thousand years later, Egypt was united from many petty rulers and established  as a kingdom. Traditionally this feat is attributed to King Menes, also known as Narmer, though the process was apparently long drawn out. Menes is said to have been the first king in a lineage of dynasties that would rule Egypt for the following three thousand years. During this time of unification under a sovereign ruler, Egypt's thriving increased exponentially, and a deeper culture formed; Egyptian religion, art practices, language, customs, and quality of living became richer and more advanced. They developed heiroglyphics, a more complex pantheon of gods, and extensive class system of living, with peasants, merchants, priests, and nobles, among other groups.By the time of the eighteenth dynasty, around 1500 BC, Egypt had risen to become an international power, solidifying its power on a regional scale, and conquering many enemy neighboring countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|right|thumb|400px|A view of the pyramids at Giza.]]The '''Egyptian pyramids''' are ancient pyramid-shaped masonry structures located in Egypt.

There are over 100 pyramids in Egypt. Most were built as tombs for the country's Pharaoh and his consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.

The earliest known Egyptian pyramid is the Pyramid of Djoser, which was built during the third dynasty. This pyramid and its surrounding complex were designed by the architect Imhotep, and is generally considered to be the world's oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry.

The best known Egyptian pyramid are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo, especially the Great Pyramid (also called the Great Pyramid of Giza, Pyramid of Khufu or Pyramid of Cheops), it is the largest Egyptian pyramid and is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Egypt was a popular tourist destination from the 1st century AD onward. The mysterious monuments, long considered the oldest in the world, were considered romantic and stunning by writers as various as the 2nd century AD novelist Apuleius and the English 17th century AD poet John Keats.  Napoleon toured the ruins in 1802 AD and used the vista of the pyramids to inspire his troops.  In 1821, Jean-Louis Champollion cracked the hieroglyphic code using the Rosetta Stone, a black basalt monument with texts in hieroglyphic and hieratic Egyptian, and Greek.  In 1922, Howard Carter discovered and recorded the contents of the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun.  The study of ancient Egypt remains popular among amateurs and professionals today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lack of several critical material resources, particularly iron and straight timber, caused Egypt to import these items using wealth from its natural resources of gold, and control of the Africa-Asia trade routes.  Regular conflicts with the Hittite Empire and the Assyrians for control of the Levant (modern-day Syria, Lebannon, Israel, Palestine, and Jordan) sapped Egypt's military resources.  Over time, Egypt became weakened both within and without.  It succumbed to invasion by the Kushites in the 7th century BCE, and then fell to the Second Babylonian Empire in the 6th century BCE. The Persians added Egypt to their empire in the 5th century BCE, Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in the 3rd century BCE, and then [[Ancient History/Biographical Dictionary#Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar]] and Octavian Augustus Caesar annexed Egypt for the Roman Empire in the 1st century BCE.  It would not achieve independence from outside forces until the 7th century CE.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Test Bench Design=
The purpose of a good test bench is to create an accurate, automated, and controlled environment to test a digital logic design in. Increased accuracy in a test bench allows the nuances of the design functionality to be verified, tested, and debugged with the help and visibility of a simulator. Automation in a test bench allows design changes to be tested quickly and easily and provides the facilities for easy regression testing to help obtain design confidence. The control provided by a test bench allows the testing of particular corner cases that are hard to create in a lab setting and allows the concentration of testing a particular part of a design.

The main disadvantage of test bench testing is speed. Simulating digital logic designs often requires the use of complicated hardware models for microcontrollers and communication interfaces. These situations often come up in high bandwidth applications (video).  Since test bench design can often take as long (or longer) than the design itself, the ability to scale your test data and test bench to test part of a design are often necessary evils depending on the schedule and budgeting constraints of a project.

==&quot;Ideal&quot; Testbenches==
The figure below shows a block diagram of an “ideal” test bench (if one was designing with unlimited budget, time, and has perfect specifications for the design).

[[File:PLD Testbench Overview.png||800px|thumb|none|Ideal testbench block diagram]]

In this design, the “testbench” itself is merely a module without any external interfaces that instantiates the many modules that make up the modules that do the actual testing. The wrapper testbench and all the testing modules that make up the test bench (everything except the design to be tested) are often collectively referred to as a testbench. Often instantiated in a test bench wrapper is the design to be tested, external interface models, test data generators, signal verification modules, and a control module that controls the external interface modules and reports information to the user.

Ideally, the only interfaces to the design under test are the external interface models. This allows the design to be controlled and communicated with as it would be when implemented on an actual chip on a circuit card. Although cumbersome sometimes, this allows interface and control issues in a design to be identified and corrected earlier in the design process and with the help of a simulator for debugging.

== [[Introduction to Physical Science|Class project]] ==

Hi there. We're always glad to see class projects at Wikibooks. To help us help you, please take a few moments to add this project to [[Wikibooks:List of class projects]], and review [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]] if you haven't already done so. The guidelines are a great resource for students as well, if they ever come across something they need help with, that's a page that will either help, or point them to another page to get help. As well, you and your students are always welcome to ask the community at [[WB:HELP]], and I'm generally quickly available on my talk page. Happy editing! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:12, 13 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi - I am Joshua Pearce, a physics professor at Clarion University of Pennsylvania. I strongly beleive in the open nature of information and think that wikibooks and sites are going to lead a beneficial intellectual revolution for humankind. 

This semester I am experimenting with the [[Introduction_to_Physical_Science]] or IPS wikibook in my physical science courses. We will be using the wikibook to generate and practice solving basic physical science questions.

I contribute primarily to [http://www.appropedia.org Appropedia], the site for collaborative solutions in sustainability, poverty reduction and international development. See my detailed and reasonably well updated [http://www.appropedia.org/User:J.M.Pearce profile] there.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to catch a deselection event when you navigate away from a page.

== Sample Code ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;
   xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Demo of Deselection Event&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
            @namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
            body {font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;}
        /* style each individual tab */
        #tab-bar xf|trigger {
        color: black;
        border: 3px outset gray; 
        border-bottom: none;
        font-weight: bold;
        margin-right: 5px;
        padding: 0.2em;
        /* round the top corners - works only with FireFox */
        -moz-border-radius: .5em .5em 0em 0em;
        }
        &lt;/style&gt;
        &lt;xf:model id=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
                &lt;data/&gt;                                
            &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
        &lt;/xf:model&gt;
        
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Deselection Events Demo&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The deselection event will generate a message each time a new tab is selected.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div id=&quot;tab-bar&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:trigger appearance=&quot;minimal&quot;&gt;

            &lt;xf:trigger appearance=&quot;minimal&quot;&gt;
                &lt;xf:label&gt;Metadata for Image Tab&lt;/xf:label&gt;
                &lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;metadata-tab&quot; ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/xf:trigger&gt;

                &lt;xf:toggle case=&quot;rights-tab&quot; ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Cutaneous Melanoma: Randomized Trials'''&lt;/big&gt;


In process of crosslinking from [[Radiation_Oncology/Melanoma|Cutaneous Melanoma]] chapter

==Prevention==
'''''Sunscreen:'''''
*'''Australia; 2011''' (1992-6) PMID 21135266  -- &quot;Reduced Melanoma After Regular Sunscreen Use: Randomized Trial Follow-Up&quot; (Green AC, J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jan 20;29(3):257-63.)
**1621 pts (ages 25-75) randomized to daily vs discretionary use of sunscreen application to head and arms in combination with beta carotene or placebo supplements. Followed through 2006. 
**11 new primary melanomas in the daily sunscreen group vs 22 in the discretionary group (HR=0.50). Reduction in invasive melanomas (3 vs 11) was substantial compared with preinvasive melanomas.
**Conclusion: Melanoma may be preventable by regular sunscreen use in adults.

==Surgical Margins==
*'''UK Melanoma Study Group''' (1993-2001) -- surgical margin 1 cm vs. 3 cm
**Randomized. 900 patients, high risk melanoma, thickness &gt;=2.0 mm, trunk or limbs. Excluded palms and soles. Arm 1) 1 cm excision margin vs. Arm 2) 3 cm excision margin. ELND or SLND or adjuvant therapy not allowed.
**'''2004''' PMID 14973217  &amp;mdash; &quot;Excision margins in high-risk malignant melanoma.&quot; (Thomas JM, N Engl J Med. 2004 Feb 19;350(8):757-66.) Median F/U 5 years
***Outcome: local recurrence 1 cm 3.3% vs. 3 cm 2.9% (NS), in-transit/nodal recurrence 32% vs. 28%. No difference in DSS or OS. Median OS after locoregional recurrence 28 months vs. 18 months (p=0.05) 
***Conclusion: Higher locoregional recurrence rate with 1 cm margins in high risk melanomas, but no difference on survival

*'''Intergroup Melanoma Surgical Trial''' (1983-89) -- surgical margin 2 cm vs 4 cm
**Randomized. 468 patients intermediate thickness (1.0-4.0 mm) melanoma, on trunk or proximal extremity. Arm 1) 2cm surgical margin vs Arm 2) 4 cm surgical margin. Secondary randomization to observation vs ELND (see below). Also, nonrandomized 272 patients with distal extremity or H&amp;N enrolled prospectively to 2 cm excision (Group B)
**'''2001''' PMID 11258773 (Free full text) &amp;mdash; &quot;Long-term results of a prospective surgical trial comparing 2 cm vs. 4 cm excision margins for 740 patients with 1-4 mm melanomas.&quot; (Balch CM et al. Ann Surg Oncol. 2001 Mar;8(2):101-8.) Median F/U 10 years
***Outcome: surgical margin 2 cm 0.4% vs. 4cm 0.9% (NS), anytime failure 2.1% vs. 2.6% (NS). 10-year DSS 70% vs. 77% (NS). LR profoundly affected by presence of ulceration (RR approx 6)
***LR impact: LR strongly associated with survival. 5-yr OS of 9% for pts with LR as first relapse (n=13), 11% for any LR (n=28), vs 5-yr OS 86% if no LR. Higher LR for head/neck 9.4%, vs 5.3% dist ext, 3.1% trunk, 1.1% prox ext. Patient who had LR all died of melanoma within 10 years.
***Conclusion: 2 cm margins are safe for intermediate thickness melanomas 

*'''Swedish Melanoma Study Group''' (1982-1990) -- surgical margin 2 cm vs 5 cm
**Randomized. 769 patients, intermediate thickness (0.9 - 2.0 cm). Excluded H&amp;N, distal extremities, vulva. Arm 1) resection margin 2 cm vs. Arm 2) resection margin 5 cm
**'''1996''' PMID 8646678 -- &quot;Resection margins of 2 versus 5 cm for cutaneous malignant melanoma with a tumor thickness of 0.8 to 2.0 mm: randomized study by the Swedish Melanoma Study Group.&quot; (Ringborg U, Cancer. 1996 May 1;77(9):1809-14.) Median F/U 5.8 years
***Outcome: Local recurrence 2 cm 0.8% vs. 5 cm 1.0% (NS) No difference in DFS, DSS, or OS
***Conclusion: Recommend excision margin of 2 cm

*'''France/UK''' (1981-2000) -- surgical margin 2 cm vs. 5 cm 
**Randomized. 337 patients, melanoma &lt;=2.0 cm. Excluded age &gt;70, toe/nail/finger, and acral melanoma. Arm 1) 2 cm excision vs. Arm 2) 5 cm excision. Second randomization for adjuvant isoprinosine
**'''2003''' PMID 12673721 -- &quot;Surgical margins in cutaneous melanoma (2 cm versus 5 cm for lesions measuring less than 2.1-mm thick).&quot; (Khayat D, Cancer. 2003 Apr 15;97(8):1941-6.) Median F/U 16 years
***Outcome: Local recurrence 2 cm 0.6% vs. 5 cm 1.8 cm (NS). Median TTR 3.5 years. 10-year DFS 85% vs. 83% (NS). No difference for second randomization.
***Conclusion: Surgical margin of 2 cm sufficient for melanoma &lt;=2 mm

*'''WHO Melanoma Programme Trial #10''' (1980-?) -- surgical margin 1 cm vs 3 cm
**Randomized. 612 patients with clinical Stage I melanoma, thickness &lt;=2 mm. Facial or digital melanoma excluded. Arm 1) 1 cm surgical margin vs. Arm 2) 3 cm surgical margin
**'''1991''' PMID 2009058 -- &quot;Narrow excision (1-cm margin). A safe procedure for thin cutaneous melanoma.&quot; (Veronesi U, Arch Surg. 1991 Apr;126(4):438-41.). Mean F/U 8 years
***Outcome: Local recurrence 1cm 1.3% vs 3 cm 0% (NS). 8-year OS 1cm 90% vs. 3 cm 90% (NS); DFS 82% vs. 84% (NS). First event most frequently nodal relapse (7%).
***Conclusion: Narrow 1cm excision as effective as wide excision


==Lymph Node Evaluation==
*'''Multicenter Selective Lymphadenecomy Trial (MSLT-I)''' (1994-2002) -- SLNB vs. observation
**Randomized. 1,269 patients. Clinically localized primary cutaneous melanoma, wide local excision, intermediate Breslow thickness (1.2-3.5 mm). Arm 1) SLNB + LND if node positive vs. Arm 2) observation + LND if nodal relapse
**'''2006''' PMID 17005948 -- &quot;Sentinel-node biopsy or nodal observation in melanoma.&quot; (Morton DL, N Engl J Med. 2006 Sep 28;355(13):1307-17.) Median F/U 5 years
***Outcome: 5-year DFS SLNB 78% vs. observation 73% (SS), but this was predominately due to expected nodal relapse in the observation arm. 5-year DSS 87% vs. 87% (NS). LN+ SLNB 16% immediately vs. observation 5-year failure 16% (NS), however, higher LN+ burden in delayed arm SLNB 1.4 vs observation 3.3 (SS) indicating disease progression during observation
***SLN Status: 5-year DSS SLN- 90% vs. SLN+ 72% (SS). If LN+, 5-year DSS SLNB+ 72% vs. observation LN+ 52% (SS). If SLN+, 70% had only that LN+, 28% had 2-3 LN+, and 2% had 4+ LN+
***Conclusion: No overall survival difference. However, staging by SLNB can identify patients with LN+, whose survival is improved by immediate LND

*'''Intergroup Melanoma Surgical Trial''' (1983-1989) -- elective LND vs. observation
**Randomized.  740 patients, Stage I-II melanoma, intermediate Breslow thickness (1.0-4.0 mm). WLE minimum margin 2cm. . Planned subgroup analysis based on previously known risk factors
**'''2000''' PMID 10761786 (Free full text) &amp;mdash; &quot;Long-term results of a multi-institutional randomized trial comparing prognostic factors and surgical results for intermediate thickness melanomas (1.0 to 4.0 mm). Intergroup Melanoma Surgical Trial.&quot; (Balch CM, Ann Surg Oncol. 2000 Mar;7(2):87-97.) Median F/U 10 years
***Outcome: 10-year OS ELND 77% vs. observation 73% (NS). In non-ulcerated subgroup, ELND 84% vs observation 77% (SS). In thinner subgroup (Breslow 1.0-2.0), ELND 86% vs. observation 80% (SS). In extremity subgroup, ELND 84% vs. observation 78% (p=0.05)
***Negative predictors: Breslow thickness, ulceration, age &gt;60
***Conclusion: No benefit overall; however, survival benefit for select patient populations (non-ulcerated, thickness 1.0-2.0, extremity).

*'''WHO Melanoma Trial #14''' (1982-1989) -- immediate LND vs delayed LND
**Randomized. 240 patients. Trunk melanoma, Breslow thickness &gt;=1.5 mm (median 3.3 mm). WLE with 3cm margin. Arm 1) immediate LND vs. Arm 2) delayed LND until clinical metastases
**'''1998''' PMID 9519951 -- &quot;Immediate or delayed dissection of regional nodes in patients with melanoma of the trunk: a randomised trial. WHO Melanoma Programme.&quot; (Cascinelli N, Lancet. 1998 Mar 14;351(9105):793-6.) Mean F/U 11 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS delayed LND 51% vs. immediate LND 62% (NS)
***LN Status: LN+ in delayed LND 37% vs. immediate LND 22%. Median TTF 8 months. Survival of patients with immediate LN+ better than with delayed LN+ (p=0.04)
***Conclusion: No difference. However, immediate LND offers improved survival in patients with LN mets

*'''Mayo Clinic''' (1971-1976) -- immediate LND vs delayed LND
**Randomized, 3 arms. 173 patients, localized malignant melanoma. Arm 1) delayed LND until clinical progression vs Arm 2) delayed LND 3 months after primary surgery vs. Arm 3) immediate LND. H&amp;N and midline lesions excluded. Breslow depth &lt;1.5mm in 57%
**'''1978''' PMID 638981 -- &quot;A prospective randomized study of the efficacy of routine elective lymphadenectomy in management of malignant melanoma. Preliminary results.&quot; (Sim FH, Cancer. 1978 Mar;41(3):948-56.)
***Outcome: 5-year OS delayed LND 63% vs. short delayed LND 56% vs. immediate LND 54% (NS)
***LN Status: positive LN delayed LND 16% vs short delayed LND 9% vs. immediate LND 4%
***Conclusion: Elective LND not beneficial in management of melanoma
**'''1986''' PMID 3747613 -- &quot;Lymphadenectomy in the management of stage I malignant melanoma: a prospective randomized study.&quot; (Sim FH, Mayo Clin Proc. 1986 Sep;61(9):697-705.)
***Outcome: No difference in OS or DMFS
***Prognostic factors: level of invasion, thickness
***Conclusion: No difference

*'''WHO Cooperative Trial''' (1967-1974) -- immediate LND vs delayed LND
**Randomized. 553 patients, Stage I (T1-3N0) melanoma of the extremities (83% lower extremities), Breslow thickness &gt;=1mm in 90%, &gt;=4mm in 31%. Satellite nodules permitted. Tumors &gt;5 cm excluded. Wide local excision with at least 3cm margin. Arm 1) immediate LND vs Arm 2) delayed LND until clinically positive LNs detected. For lower extremity, inguino-illiac LND; for upper extremity, axillary en bloc resection including pectoralis minor
**'''1982''' PMID 7074555 -- &quot;Delayed regional lymph node dissection in stage I melanoma of the skin of the lower extremities.&quot; (Veronesi U, Cancer. 1982 Jun 1;49(11):2420-30.)
***Outcome: 5-year OS immediate LND 68% vs delayed LND 69% (NS); 10-year OS 9% vs. 13% (NS). No subset benefited from immediate LND. 
***LN status: Frequency of LN+ in immediate arm 20% vs. frequency of clinical LN failure in delayed arm 22%. Mean TTF 13 months. No survival difference between patients with initially positive LN and with delayed positive LNs. 5-year OS 46% vs. 41% (NS)
***Conclusion: Delayed LND as effective as immediated dissection in Stage I melanoma of extremities


==Adjuvant Interferon==
*'''DeCOG''' (2001-2004) -- Interferon x1.5 years vs x5 years
**Randomized. 840 patients, resected cutaneous melanoma, minimum thickness 1.5 mm, clinically N0 (SLN in 76%, SLN+ in 18%). Arm 1) IFN alpha2 3MU 3x/week x18 months vs Arm 2) same IFN x60 months
**'''2010''' PMID 20048184 -- &quot;Efficacy of Low-Dose Interferon {alpha}2a 18 Versus 60 Months of Treatment in Patients With Primary Melanoma of &gt;= 1.5 mm Tumor Thickness: Results of a Randomized Phase III DeCOG Trial.&quot; (Hauschild A, J Clin Oncol. 2010 Feb 10;28(5):841-6. Epub 2010 Jan 4.) Median F/U 4.3 years
***Outcome: Relapse-free survival 1.5 years 76% vs 5 years 73% (NS), DMFS 82% vs 80% (NS), OS 86% vs 85% (NS)
***Conclusion: Prolongation of IFN therapy showed no clinical benefit

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction==
[[Image:Bangladesh-CIA_WFB_Map.png‎ |left|200px]][[w:Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] is a country in South Asia. It is bordered by India on all sides except for a small border with Myanmar to the far southeast and by the Bay of Bengal to the south. 


In the late 18th century, British came to dominate this region. East Bengal (today Bangladesh) joined movement for the independence of India with West Pakistan. And India achieved independence in 1947, but East Bengal and West Pakistan (both primarily Muslim) separated from India (largely Hindu) because of the difference of religion and they jointly became the new country of Pakistan. East Bengal became East Pakistan in 1955, but subjected to political and linguistic discrimination as well as economic neglect at the hands of West Pakistan, East Pakistan declared independence in 1971 and was renamed Bangladesh (it means the country of Bengal and official language is Bengali).  


Bangladesh (the population is 150,448,339 [http://www.evd.nl/zoeken/showbouwsteen.asp?bstnum=61522]) is among the most thickly populated countries in the world. The government is a parliamentary democracy which has been suspended under emergency law since 11 January 2007. Geographically the country straddles [[w:Ganges Delta|the Ganges Delta]] and is easily affected by annual monsoon floods and cyclones. Recently the big cyclone attacked southern eastern coast area in 15 November 2007. It was said that the number of casualty was more than 3,000 and about 300,000 people became displaced . 


Despite sustained domestic and international efforts to improve economic prospects, Bangladesh remains one of [[w:Least Dveloped Countries|the Least Developing Counties (LDC)]] in part due to its large population. Its GDP per capita is $2,300. However, World Bank says that Bangladesh has recorded impressive economic and social gains since the 1990s. And it also mentions that the growth performance, coupled with an impressive decline in the population growth rate from 2.5% in the 1980s to 1.7% in 1990-2004, has led to a doubling of annual per capita GDP growth, from 1.6% in the 1980s to 3.3% in 1990-2004.[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/BANGLADESHEXTN/0,,menuPK:295769~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:295760,00.html]

== Bangladesh Open University ==
===History of Distance Education in Bangladesh===
The history of Distance Education in Bangladesh goes back to 1956, when the Education Directorate was assigned with the responsibility for distribution of 200 radio receivers to educational institutions. This led to the creation of an Audio-Visual Cell and the Audio-Visual Education Centre (AVEC in 1962). 
After the independence in 1971, there emerged a need to provide mass education. And in 1978, the School Broadcasting Programme (SBP) launched  under the President Ziaur Rahman. 
In 1983, the project was changed into National Institute of Educational Media and Technology (NIEMT). 
Then in 1985, NIEMT was replaced by the Bangladesh Institute of Distance Education (BIDE) and it offered the Bachelor educational program in distance mode. BIDE’s success motivated policy makers to establish an open university. 
Finally in 1992, the Parliament of Bangladesh decided to establish BOU passing “the Bangladesh Open University Act.


===Purpose of BOU===
The Bangladesh Open University (BOU) is the only university to use Distance Education as a method of delivery. BOU teaching media includes printed course books, study guides, radio and television
broadcasts, audio cassettes and occasional face-to-tace tutorials.BOU main building is located at Gazipur, about 49 kilometers north of Dhaka-the capital city of Bangladesh. It is designed for those who want to acquire new vocational or educational skills by studying at home or at work-places. It especially meets the need for people who are deprived of education in formal schools. 

Because of large population of Bangladesh, educational facilities are inadequate to offer educational access to all people. So, the objectives of BOU are &quot;to create educated and trained work-force by providing access to a wide range of educational and vocational training programs for all levels of people particularly for disadvantaged and rural masses including women who are generally deprived of formal education and training [http://pcf4.dec.uwi.edu/viewpaper.php?id=41&amp;print=1]&quot;. This is mentioned in the Act-1992, No-38, 3(5) [http://www.commonlii.org/bd/legis/num_act/boua1992282/].

The Government of Bangladesh and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) extended the funds for setting up the BOU.

===Programs===
BOU provides two types of programs Formal (21 programs) and Non-formal (19 programs), thorough seven different kinds of schools. 
====Formal Programs====
In Formal programs, there are four levels, i.e. Certificate, Diplomas, Degree and Masters. Students can utilize Regional Resource Centers (RRC), Coordinating Offices (CO) and Tutorial Centers (TC).  There are 12 RRCs, 80 COs and 1000 TCs in 35 areas (2006).
The students have to take two examination, one each semester. The main media which students use in studying is print materials. Also, BOU offers 25 minutes radio programs everyday and 20-25 television programs five days a week.
====Non-Formal Programs====
On the other hands, Non- Formal Programs don’t conduct any examination. They offer educational opportunity to those who cannot read and write. The objectives of Non-Formal Programs is to let people be familiar with modern and sustainable techniques in agriculture, poultry farming, health and nutrition, environment protection etc.

== Impacts of Bangladesh Open University ==
===Impact to educational circumstances in Bangladesh===

*Educational Impact
*# Increased Access to Basic Education and Career-Development Training of rural disadvantaged groups, particularly the dropouts with no access to formal schooling. ADB report says that 60% of the sample students is from rural areas. And as you can see from the table above, most popular programs of BOU are the SSC and HSC programs.
*# Increased general knowledge of the Rural Poor to improve their living conditions

*Social Impact
According to Asian Development Bank (ADB), establishing BOU has contributed to improve the beneficiaries' socioeconomic status. ADB research proved that almost 90% of the sample of BOU graduates who were employed thought their socioeconomic status had improved.

===Areas of Improvement===
&lt;p&gt;'''Quality Assurance'''&lt;/p&gt;
According to ADB, BOU curricula are reported slightly lower than national standard in Bangladesh (qtd by Isram et al, 2006). The relevance of coerces and actual works is also held in much doubt, from the survey for employers. (qtd by Isram et al, 2006). No professional tutors are also problematic, since they are not trained as tutor who takes a role of emotional support.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;'''Modernize instruction'''&lt;/p&gt;
Even though, instruction is available on TV or radio, they are not well developed. In addition, the broadcasting is restricted owing to short period of broadcasting by the government owned TV and radian station. (Isram, 2006). Thus, still the text is a main instructional delivery. BOU bring ICT technology into view, the limitation of costs and infrastructure hold DE back in primitive stage. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;'''Place for face-to-face session'''&lt;/p&gt;
For examination (A test is implemented as face-to-face), for practice session in agriculture, for tutorials, BOU have to rent some spaces from other institutions(Haughey, 2004), which limits schedule. Further arrangements and expansions of learning centers are required.&lt;/p&gt;

== Hand- vs. Power-tools ==
I should probably just mention that most of the content that I add to this book is about working with hand-tools, but that I don't mean to discourage people from adding good words about machinery; it's just not my area of expertise.  I would love to see a page about, say, [[Woodworking/Smoothing|smoothing techniques]] be a comprehensive compendium of ''all'' methods of smoothing, from hand-burred scrapers to high-tech sanders and everything in between&amp;mdash;with parallel information given for the different methods within each of those.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Samwilson|Sam Wilson]] ( &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:0.9em&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Samwilson|Talk]] &amp;bull; [[Special:Contributions/Samwilson|Contribs]]&lt;/span&gt; ) &amp;hellip; 06:22, 6 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction==

One thing that has to be mentioned is that South Africa had been suffered from apartheid since 1948 and had ended in 1994. For about half a century, non-whites were discriminated. People in South Africa were categorized into four; white, black, Indian/Asian and coloured. 

Not all of non-whites were educated equally during this era. Bantu Education was applied in South Africa. In this law, black people needed education only for black society. In other words, they did not have enough inputs to work equally with white people in white societies. After 1996, the new law was declared and according to this, all of people in South Africa have rights to be educated equally in official language or language they choose. Still not all of black people are educated or have literacy. Moreover, not all of educators have enough training for teaching. Non-literacy people or not well trained educators are given trainings through distance education. In the following parts, one of the distance education institutions, University of South Africa, is focused from pedagogical aspects.

== South Africa Profile ==
South Africa became Union of South Africa on May 31, 1910 from former British colonies, and after about half century, in 1961 on the same day, the Republic of South African was declared. 

=== Geography and Population demography ===
The total land size of South Africa is 1,219,912 sq km and 43,997,828 people live there. The capitals are located in three regions depending on roles; Pretoria, Cape Town and Bloemfontein. More than half of population is occupied aged 15 to 64.  86.4 % of population who are over age 15 can read and write. More than 85% of females and males can read and write. Four ethnic groups lived; black African, white, coloured, and Indian/Asians (2001 census). However, majority of population is black African. 11 languages are spoken officially; IsiZulu, IsiXhosa, Afrikaans, Sepedi, English, Setswana, Sesotho, Xitsonga, and other (2001 census). 30% of the population engages in agriculture, 25% in industry and 45% in services. Major industries are: mining (world's largest producer of platinum, gold, chromium), automobile assembly and metal working.

=== Communication system ===
The phone systems are the finest developed in Africa. 4.729 million peoples are the mainline telephone user, 39.66 million are mobile phone users and 5.1 million are internet users. 1.088 million out of 5.1 million are internet hosts. There are 14 AM, 347 FM and 1 shortwave radio broadcast stations, and 554 television broadcast station.

== University of South Africa Profile ==
University of South Africa (hereafter UNISA) is located in Pretoria and has been established in 1873. It is the oldest university and one of the most outstanding universities in South Africa. One third of university students in South Africa are students of UNISA. It provides not only degree courses but also trainings for current educators and Adult Basic Education Training (hereafter ABET) for people who do not have enough literacy. ABET is given in many districts in the country. 

UNISA consist of 5 colleges; College of Law, College of Human Sciences (also, School of Education), College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, College of Economic and Management Sciences and College of Science, Engineering and Technology.  The university offers undergraduate, master and doctor courses. Though there are five schools, UNISA offers variety of courses such as education, animal health, linguistics, MBA and so on. One of the most famous alumni is Nelson Mandela. 

=== Learners Demography ===
Varieties of learners study at UNISA in the entire world. Most of learners are full-/part-time workers. Students’ age is expanded; about 64% of students are between ages 24 to 44, about 8% are over age 45 and about 260 students are over age 64.  55% of learners are women and more than 70% of learners are black, coloured and Indians. Quarter of new learners (1000) has visual disabilities but UNISA support them. 

=== Media and Technology ===
UNISA employs the video conference tutorials. They are provided them at some learning centers which are located in the country, so learners who do not live in such regions have difficulties to access them. However, the video conferences have the same roles with face-to-face tutorials. By providing live tutorials by video reduces the cost.

Learners can register online and have online learning systems. 

=== Course Design and Development ===
Courses are developed by teams of specialists. UNISA employs several course delivery systems such as interactive video conference, online learning, tutors, print based materials, teleconferencing and so on. UNISA employs printed materials mainly but is developing more internet based learning materials as well.

=== Student Supports ===
UNISA is a distance education institution. They emphasize on self-discipline and self-directed learning. For students who have difficulties to motivate themselves, the school provides a fellow students list and forms a study group. Learners are encouraged to contact them. Many options are provided for communicating with lecturer such as by emails, telephone, posting. Also, students’ supports are delivered at learning centers. Following are services that learners can have at the centers; Face-to-face tutorials (weekly or fortnightly), exams, computer lab, peer study groups, counseling and study place.

In order to prevent learners’ dropping out from UNISA or delay their completion of studying, the Division of Tutorial Support Services provides face-to-face tutorials, video conferences, Peer-group support services and counseling support services at learning centers. In tutorials (either face-to-face or video conferences), tutors help learners to understand course materials and course and to motivate.

UNISA produce special studying material for learners with disabilities. Materials are large printed, and sing language interpretations are provided. Trained staff are sent to the learning centers if it is necessary.

Examinations are given to learners at many places located more than 400 hundreds places.

=== Library ===
There are 2.4 million items in the library. These are sent to the branch libraries, if it is necessary, located in many places in the country such as Johannesburg. Learners can borrow items by telephone, email, post and pick them up at the branch libraries. The UNISA library is cooperated with other libraries nationally and internationally. Cooperated libraries share electric recourses.

== Purpose of University of South Africa ==
There are many higher education institutions including distance education ones in South Africa. Distance education is widely used as upgrading workers’, individuals’ skills and training educators or other workers. In developing countries, distance education is often used in order to train teachers who are not well-trained.

=== Learners and Changing in South Africa’s higher education system ===
Reduction of the number of public higher education institutions was proposed in late 1990s. In fact, the number of colleges was trimmed down in 2000 and it means that learners needed to quit school or transfer to another institution. 21 universities turned into 11 institutions, 15 technikons (four-year technical college) turned into five institutions and more than 100 education colleges were reduced into two. Not only learners were affected but faculties and staff were affected. At least 5000 students were shifted to distance education institutions. Some number of students transfered to UNISA. 

=== Learning in District ===
There are people who do not know how to read or write their names. Even some people do not know how to hold pens. UNISA provides trainings to those people who have low literacy. Trainers are volunteers and provide lesson in several district or learning centre in the country such as the Ga-Mothopo District. Not only literacy skills are delivered but teacher’s trainings are. The length of the training is various. 
The data shows that not all of teachers have teacher’s certification in South Africa. In black people’s case, in 1994, half of teachers were licensed, 30% of them were lower licensed and the rest were not licensed. This data shows that some trainings for teachers are necessary. However, UNISA provides such trainings to current teachers in order to deal with needs. Trainings are about English, Mathematics, Science and education of physically and mentally handicapped children. 

=== Division of Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) ===
UNISA supplies courses such as business but also supplies some training that learners can gain skills and apply right after finishing courses. Clinical training, teaching practice, internship, professional practice, experimental training and learning, work-based learning, and supervised learning and practice are provided through WIL. WIL helps learners to enrich their skills for their futures and those skills gained in WIL can be applied to real world. It is offered in learning centers in the country. UNISA is a distance education institution but helps learners in the learning centers or district to gain not only academic skills but also social skills.

== Impact of University of South Africa on the country ==
Since 1996, the Education law made it clear that all of citizens have equal rights to be educated but there is still a gap among people. After 1994, it is believed that all of people in South Africa are equal but a small number of black people are still not educated at all. 
UNISA has a big number of learners and one third of universities students in South Africa are occupied by UNISA. Majority of learners are full-/part-time workers and UNISA's motto is to provide equal quality of education to any people. UNISA’s contribution to the society is highly evaluated. As it is mentioned, UNISA only courses and certifications, diplomas and degrees but provides teacher trainings and Adult Basic Education Training (ABET). 
    
=== ABET ===
ABET provides not only literacy skills but also makes learners realize that education is a process to contribute themselves economically and socially in the society. The ABET Institution in UNISA has started in 1994. By now, UNISA helped more than 300000 learners. This is supported by volunteer educators/trainers and learners are trained all over the country. UNISA does not only provide course to people who have lower literacy but also to educators. The number of learning sites is 6000. Courses are offered for prisoners at the Krugersdrop Prison in Gauteng and also are offered for a group of mentally and physically disabled learners in Qwa Qwa. 

=== Evaluation ===
In 2002, UNISA was authorized by Distance Education and Training Council (hereafter DETC) in the United States. This proves that UNISA’s education quality and contribution to its country and learners. In order to be authorized by DETC, the institutions have to satisfy 12 conditions such as stating clearly defined objects, well-developed learning materials, learners’ supports, financial aids to learners, well-trained faculties and so on. Being authorized by DETC means these 12 conditions are satisfied by the institution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is in error on page http:en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Intermediate_Algebra/slope:

&quot;But first we must find what the Y-Intercept is, to do this we choose one of the points that we are given, and input it into the formula. For this example, I'm going to use the point (4,3):

y(3) = m(1 / 2)x(4) + b
3 = 1 / 2(4) + b
3( + 2) = 2( − 2) + b
5 = B&quot;

[Answer is 1 = B]

This is either a prank or careless error, but extremely confusing to students who find the page.

Then fix it.</text>

      <comment>/* Subjunctive */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vocabulary used in this section:==
*'''Infinitive''':
**It is the original form of a verb.
**It ends in -''ar'', -''er'', or -''ir''. (Verbs with the ending -''ír'' are included in the last group.)
**The example infinitives used in this section are: ''hablar'' (to speak), ''comer'' (to eat), and ''vivir'' (to live).
::These verbs will be used to show the conjugation patterns of the -''ar'', -''er'', and -''ir'' groups, respectively.

*'''Stem''':
**The stem of a verb is the infinitive without its -''ar'', -''er'', or -''ir'' ending.
**In most conjugations, a new ending is attached to the stem (future and conditional tenses attach the ending to the infinitive).
**For instance, in the first person singular of the simple present indicative ''hablar'':

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{habl}\mathrm{ar} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{habl} - ar \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{habl} + o \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{habl}\mathrm{o}&lt;/math&gt;

:This forms, ''hablo'' (the first person singular of the simple present indicative of the verb ''hablar''), which means &quot;I speak&quot;.

==Conjugating==
Every Spanish verb exists in three '''moods''' (''modos'' in Spanish), namely, ''indicative'', ''subjunctive'', and ''imperative''. The ''indicative'' mood (''modo indicativo'' in Spanish) features five tenses (''present'', ''preterite'', ''imperfect'', ''future'' and ''conditional''), while the ''subjunctive'' mood (''modo subjuntivo'' in Spanish) features three, ''preterite'' and ''conditional'' tenses do not exist in the ''subjunctive''. Each of these tenses exists in four separate aspects, namely, ''simple'', ''perfect'', ''continuous'', and ''perfect continuous''. In total, this gives us twenty ''indicative'' tenses and twelve ''subjunctive'' tenses. In each of these tenses, the verb can be conjugated for six different subjects. In the ''imperative'' mood (''modo imperativo'' in Spanish), there exist both affirmative and negative commands, and the verb may be conjugated for five different subjects in each.

Every Spanish verb also has two &quot;non-finite&quot; forms (the ''past participle'' and ''gerund'') that do not conjugate based on subject. This brings our count to 36 tenses (not counting its infinitive), and a total of 214 forms of every single verb in the Spanish language. Luckily for learners, the vast majority of these verbs fit into well-defined and easy-to-learn categories. These verbs are called regular verbs, and our three examples of ''hablar'', ''comer'', and ''vivir'' are all regular verbs.

On the page for each tense, a complete conjugation chart will be shown, featuring full conjugations for regular -''ar'', -''er'', and -''ir'' verbs.

Many important verbs (such as ''haber'', ''tener'', ''estar''; all of which are used in this appendix as auxiliary verbs) are irregular.

''Verb endings''

Verbs come in three endings in Spanish. The conjugations one uses are entirely dependent upon which ending a verb has. There are &quot;-ar&quot; verbs, which usually have very different endings from &lt;i&gt;-er&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;-ir&lt;/i&gt; verbs. &lt;i&gt;-er&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;-ir&lt;/i&gt; verbs often have similar sets of endings.

==Non-finite forms==

===Infinitive===

The '''infinitive''' of a verb is most often used after another conjugated verb like &lt;i&gt;tener&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;querer&lt;/i&gt;. The infinitive may also be used colloquially by Spanish speakers in place of a command, usually when left as a note to oneself to remember to do something. On web pages, one may also see buttons or links that use the infinitive, not the imperative form. The infinitive form contains the verb's '''stem''' followed by the '''ending'''.&lt;br&gt;

'''Commonly used expressions with the infinitive:'''

To use these expressions, '''conjugate the first''' verb appropriately and follow with the infinitive. The first verbs in these expressions can be conjugated in any tense.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Tener que + infinitive&lt;/b&gt; means &quot;to have to&quot; do something.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Tengo que poner la mesa antes de cenar.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have to set the table before dinner.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Querer + infinitive&lt;/b&gt; means &quot;to want to&quot; do something.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Ella quiere aprender inglés.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She wants to learn English.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Acabar de + infinitive&lt;/b&gt; means &quot;to just have&quot; done something.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Acabo de hacer la tarea.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I just did my homework.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Hay que + infinitive&lt;/b&gt; means that something &quot;has to be done&quot;. It is unspecified who has to do it.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Hay que darle comer al perro hoy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The dog needs to be fed today.

===Past participle===

The '''past participle''' is used with the perfect tenses, but can be used on its own as an adjective, most commonly with the verb &quot;estar&quot; (to be).&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Mi perro está perdido.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My dog is lost.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Estoy buscando mi perro perdido.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I'm looking for my lost dog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In this case, the verb &lt;i&gt;perder&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;to lose&lt;/i&gt; and the past participle &lt;i&gt;perdido&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;lost&lt;/i&gt;. Participles are formed using &lt;i&gt;-ado&lt;/i&gt; for &lt;i&gt;-ar&lt;/i&gt; verbs and &lt;i&gt;-ido&lt;/i&gt; for &lt;i&gt;-er&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;-ir&lt;/i&gt; verbs. &lt;br&gt;

hablado&lt;br&gt;
comido&lt;br&gt;
vivido&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

When used as '''adjectives''', past participles come after the noun and are modified by the number and gender of the noun. Particples modifying eminine nouns will now end in &lt;i&gt;-ada&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;-ida&lt;/i&gt;. To pluralize a participle, simply add &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; to the end of the adjective.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Las espinacas están hervidas.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The spinach is boiled.

===Gerund===

The '''gerund''' exists in English as the &lt;i&gt;-ing&lt;/i&gt;  ending and are used in the same way as English, with a few exceptions. These gerunds usually follow a conjugated form of the verb &lt;i&gt;estar&lt;/i&gt; to form the '''present progressive''' tense.&lt;br&gt;

hablando&lt;br&gt;
comiendo&lt;br&gt;
viviendo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Ella está andando por el pueblo.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She is walking through the village.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

These gerunds are also often used with a conjugated form of the verb &lt;i&gt;seguir&lt;/i&gt; to mean to continue doing something or to still be doing something.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Sigo tocando el piano.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I'm still playing the piano.&lt;br&gt;

==Indicative==
The indicative is the most basic mood, used to talk about actions, events, or states that are believed to be facts or true. It is very typical in speech for making factual statements or describing obvious qualities of a person or situation.

===Present===
The present tense is used to talk about actions, events, and states that happen generally in one's life, but is also often used to talk about actions that are happening right now.

&lt;i&gt;Yo monto en bicicleta todos los días.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I ride my bicycle every day.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Nosotros comemos unas banana.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We are eating some bananas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Vivimos en una grande casa cerca del centro.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We live in a large house near downtown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Forming the negative&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Forming the negative is very simple in most tenses, especially the present indicative. Simply place &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; directly before the conjugated verb.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;No escribo en un diario.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I don't write in a diary.

===Preterite===
The '''preterite''' is used to talk about '''one-time events''' that occurred in the past and have already ended. It is absolutely necessary to remember the accents in both writing and speech.

&lt;i&gt;Yo nací en Zaragoza.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I was born in Zaragoza.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Ella conoció su mejor amiga el año pasado.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The teacher helped me yesterday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Forming the negative&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just like in the present tense, simply add &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; directly before the conjugated verb to negate.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;No escribió una novela.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Some things to note:'''
#All ''yo'' forms of regular verbs end in -''o'', all ''tú'' forms in -''s'', ''él'' forms in -''a'' or -''e'', ''nosotros'' in -''mos'', ''vosotros'' in -''is'', and ''ellos'' in -''n''. As Spanish is a pro-drop language, you must get used to determining a verb's subject based on its ending.
#Notice the similarities between the -''ER'' and -''IR'' verbs. While not completely similar, they differ only in the ''nosotros'' and ''vosotros'' forms.
&lt;!--
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''El Presente Simple'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== What is it? ==
As it is in English, the present tense indicates an action that is performed by a person regularly.

: Yo duermo a las 8:00 todos los días.
: ''I sleep at eight everyday.''

== How do we do it? ==
Actually, these sentences are made the same way as they're done in english. We need a subject-verb-complement construction (see the last example), the difficult part may happen when conjugating the verbs. While in English we commonly add an &quot;-s&quot; to verbs conjugated with &quot;he,she,it&quot; personal pronouns, in Spanish there is an specific conjugation for each. Let's check an example using the verb &quot;cocinar&quot; ''(to cook)''.

: Yo cocino = I cook.
: Tú cocinas = You cook. ''(singular-informal)''
: Vos cocinás = You cook. ''(singular-informal)''
: Usted cocina = You cook. ''(singular-formal)''
: Él cocina = He cooks.
: Ella cocina = She cooks.
: Nosotros cocinamos = We cook.
: Vosotros cocináis = You cook. ''(plural-North of Spain)
: Ustedes cocinan = You cook. ''(plural-LatAm)''
: Ellos cocinan = They cook. ''(masculine)''
: Ellas cocinan = They cook. ''(feminine)''

So we can get a present tense sentence by adding a complement:

: '''Ella cocina muy bien la pasta.'''
: ''She cooks pasta very well.''

It means that she may not be cooking pasta right now, but when she does, she's pretty good at it.

== What about conjugations? ==

Perhaps you find them difficult to do, but there is an almost perfect rule to fight it. If you learn a verbs conjugation, its last syllables or letters in infinitive will allow you to compare it with other verbs and conjugate them the same way. Take the '''cocinar''' verb conjugation as an example and compare with other similar verbs:

{| 
! Cocin''ar'' (To cook)  
! Camin''ar'' (To walk)  
! Domin''ar'' (To dominate)  
! Termin''ar'' (To end)  
|-
| Yo coc''in'''o'''''
| Yo cam''in'''o'''''
| Yo dom''in'''o'''''
| Yo term''in'''o'''''
|-
| Tú coc''in'''as''''' &lt;small&gt;(Note the accent, e.g.: [cos'''I'''nas])&lt;/small&gt;
| Tú cam''in'''as'''''
| Tú dom''in'''as'''''
| Tú term''in'''as'''''
|-
| Vos coc''in'''ás''''' &lt;small&gt;(Note the accent shift: [cosin'''A'''s], it's related with the row of &quot;''vosotros''&quot; below)&lt;/small&gt;
| Vos cam''in'''ás'''''
| Vos dom''in'''ás'''''
| Vos term''in'''ás'''''
|-
| Usted coc''in'''a'''''
| Usted cam''in'''a'''''
| Usted dom''in'''a'''''
| Usted term''in'''a'''''
|-
| Él(Ella) coc''in'''a'''''
| Él(Ella) cam''in'''a'''''
| Él(Ella) dom''in'''a'''''
| Él(Ella) term''in'''a'''''
|-
| Nosotros coc''in'''amos'''''
| Nosotros cam''in'''amos'''''
| Nosotros dom''in'''amos'''''
| Nosotros term''in'''amos'''''
|-
| Vosotros coc''in'''áis''''' &lt;small&gt;(Compare with the row of &quot;''vos''&quot; up)&lt;/small&gt;
| Vosotros cam''in'''áis'''''
| Vosotros dom''in'''áis'''''
| Vosotros term''in'''áis'''''
|-
| Ustedes coc''in'''an'''''
| Ustedes cam''in'''an'''''
| Ustedes dom''in'''an'''''
| Ustedes term''in'''an'''''
|-
| Ellos(Ellas) coc''in'''an'''''
| Ellos(Ellas) cam''in'''an'''''
| Ellos(Ellas) dom''in'''an'''''
| Ellos(Ellas) term''in'''an'''''
|}


NOTES: 
* Bold typeface marks the gramatical endings, indeed the letters ''in'' of these verbs belong to the root of the verb, and are marked only to help comparing the endings when you read them aloud.
* &quot;Él&quot; (he) and &quot;ella&quot; (she) and &quot;usted&quot; (formal you, sometimes abreviated &quot;Ud.&quot; or &quot;Vd.&quot;) have always the same conjugation; &quot;vos&quot; is commonly used by many spanish-speakers (Argentina, Central America, West of Colombia), but &quot;tú&quot; is used by mexicans, coast people and islanders in every country; anyway, they mean the same: ''you (singular and informal)''. &quot;Ustedes&quot; (sometimes abreviated &quot;Uds.&quot; or &quot;Vds.&quot;) is mostly used by inland people and &quot;vosotros&quot; widely said in Spain and South America, but both mean the same: ''you (plural)''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

On 5 September 2008, Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University (STOU) will have served the Thai people for 30 years
as an institute of higher learning that employs open and distance education system.
Since the university's founding, the global
trend toward lifelong learning, which depends on the support
of electronic media and modern telecommunications has been recognized. These
developments have created great opportunities for STOU to transmit knowledge to the people. The university has therefore
organized educational programs integrating a wide range of media,
including printed media, radio and television programs, and
electronic media with the aim of building the knowledge - based
society in Thailand.
STOU will dedicate itself to the aim of
elevating Thailand into a knowledge-based society, utilizing the
technology of the global era and serving the people under the
slogan &quot;Anytime, anywhere - everyone can learn with STOU.&quot;

== Thailand's Country Profile ==

[[Image:Thailand1-map.jpg]]

A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th century. Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country that had never been taken over by a European power. In 1932, a bloodless revolution took place, which led the country to a constitutional monarchy. In alliance with Japan during World War II, Thailand became a US ally following the conflict. Thailand is currently facing separatist violence in its southern ethnic Malay-Muslim provinces.



=== Geography and People ===


[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand Tailand]is located in South East Asia, surrounded by Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia and Burma. In the total area of 514,000 sq km, a total of 65,068,149 people are living there. Ethnically, people are divided into 3 groups: Thai(75%), Chinese(14%) and others(11%). Majority of the people are Buddhists while there are Muslim and Christian minorities. Life expectancy at birth is 72.55 years, which is higher than many other East Asian countries. However, 10% of the population is said to live under poverty line, meaning that the gap between the rich and the poor is quite big in Thailand. When it comes to the labor force, 49% of the people engage in agriculture, 14% engage in industry, and the remaining 37% engage in services. 



=== Education ===


Education in Thailand is provided mainly by the government through the Thai Ministry of Education. Education is divided into two major levels with 6 years of elementary/primary school and 6 years of high/secondary school. After 2001, the Ministry changed the system of education, and it is now divided into four levels: the first three years in elementary school is the first level, the second level is the other half, the third level is the first three years in high school, and the last is the other half of high school. After each level, students are required to pass the NET (National Educational Test)to graduate. 

Children are required only to attend six years of elementary school and at least the first three years of high school. However, lots of students in the major cities like to continue their education at university level. For admission to universities, high-school graduates are required to take 2 tests, one of which is O-NET (Ordinary National Educational Test) and the other of which is A-NET (Advanced National Educational Test). The results of these 2 tests as well as the GPA of 4th level of high school are used as criteria to determine admission to universities.  

While education level in Thailand is quite high compared to the one in other South East Asian countries, Thailand has not achieved a 100% [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_rate literacy]rate. 7.4% of the total population is said to be illiterate today. 

[http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Thailand Education in Thailand]


=== Communication ===


The quality of the telephone system in Thailand is high in general, but it is especially high in urban areas like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankok Bangkok]. The fixed telephone line system is provided by both a government-owned and commercial providers. Wireless service is also expanding rapidly and outpacing fixed lines.

Thailand also has 204 AM and 334 FM radio broadcast stations, and has 111 TV broadcast stations. The number of internet users is 8.466 million, which accounts for 13% of the total population.

==Sukhothan Thammathirat Open University==


=== Basic Information ===


Sukhothan Thammathirat Open University was established as a national university by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_charter Royal Charter] in 1978. It was established for the purpose of providing people with educational opportunities at university level.

== Impacts on the Society ==

STOU has brought a tremendous impact on society both at a regional/national and an international level. Its contribution to the expansion of educational opportunities and to the development of distance education was so great that in 1995, STOU was awarded the Award of Excellence by the International Council for Distance Education and the Commonwealth of Learning in the category of the Excellence of Distance Education Management. STOU was the only recipient of the award among institution from 79 countries that were nominated. 

Here are some of the ways that STOU has impacted the local communities in Thailand:

=== Increased access to the education === 

○At STOU, there is a program called &quot;Certificate of Achievement Program&quot; In this program, members of the public are given an opportunity to choose out of 250 courses to study up to 3 courses. Students are given 4 months to study and prepare for the examinations, which are held at provincial study centers throughout the country. Upon successfully passing the exams, students are awarded a certificate of achievement. Furthermore, if students wish to enroll as regular students at STOU, credits earned can be transferred to the BA degree that they choose. This project has been carried out since 1981, and a total of 60725 students had completed the study under this program by 2005.

○STOU provides educational television and radio programs, produced in various formats such as dramas, discussions and interviews. Some programs are produced specifically for STOU students, while others are produced for the general public, covering topics as science and technology, environmental preservation, health care, ares and culture, law, music and current affairs. 

○STOU has organized various religious and cultural activities for STOU students as well as for the general public, intending to preserve rich Thai culture and to strengthen the Thai identity among people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Multimedia is not only prevalent in cinema, television and the internet. Video game developers and producers are introducing new ways for people to interact with their games and game consoles. In the early years of video games, the most interactivity involved hitting a button and the onscreen character would react to the button's command. Today, however, media conglomerations, primarily Sony and Microsoft, are attempting new ways to bridge video games and other forms of media. 

== Microsoft Xbox ==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:xbox3600.jpg|thumb|left|Microsoft's Xbox 360 was launched in 2005]] --&gt;

Launched in the fourth quarter of 2005 around the world, the Xbox 360 is Microsoft's second foray into gaming hardware production.  The console has expanded the internet media capabilities of Microsoft's original Xbox console.

'''Xbox Live'''

Launched in the summer of 2002 on the original Xbox, Xbox Live arguably set the standard for online console gaming.  Players were able to create one profile for Xbox live.  This profile, in turn, could interact with any Xbox Live equipped game.

'''Xbox Live Marketplace'''

In November 2005, Microsoft launched the Xbox Live Marketplace, an ancillary to their online gaming service.  Through this, Xbox owners can download smaller arcade games, view previews of upcoming games and download demos for games still in development. Perhaps the most significant service provided in the Xbox Live Marketplace, however, is the Video Store, allowing gamers with an Xbox 360 to download movies and television shows directly to their computer.  Though Microsoft is not the first company to offer downloadable content for television, they have arguably been the most successful and appear to be in a prime position to establish market domination. By bundling video downloads with games, it appears Microsoft is trying to create one central home theater peripheral by using games as the bridge.  Microsoft's two biggest competitors in the gaming market, Nintendo and Sony, have both offered their own online services. Sony's, the PlayStation Network, currently offers many of the same online functions as the Xbox, while the Nintendo is currently limited to gaming information. The 2008 Consumer Electronics Show has released new features from Sony that will be a new point of interactivity for gamers.

'''Xbox &amp; Windows Media Center'''

Xbox is breaking the mold by becoming the first game console to allow you to connect your pc to your gaming system. Using the Windows Media Center Extender technology built into your Xbox 360, you can connect it to your PC through your home network and enjoy all of the digital entertainment stored on your PC on the big screen from the comfort of your couch. You can easily play you’re your favorite music, view photos as a slide show, watch DVDs, download movies, and even watch and record TV shows. Xbox transforms you TV room into a digital media room all with the touch a remote.

== Playstation 3 ==

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:PS3.jpg]] --&gt;

The PlayStation 3 is Sony's fourth home market console.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:SonyHome.jpg]] --&gt;
'''Sony's Home'''

Still in prototype form, Home is a giant, free, massively multiplayer online community similar to the PC game Second Life. Offered as a free application exclusive to the PlayStation 3, Home allows users to create an online avatar and roam around a virtual world created by Sony. These worlds can include your PS3 and other PS3's. You can create your own home with furniture, rooms and electronics. You can also visit your friend's homes inside their PS3. It appears Home also features an online mall features shops like JCPenny, Gamestop, and American Eagle. This software is expected to be released sometime in 2008.

'''Folding @ Home'''

A neat and &quot;educational&quot; free software program for the PS3 is folding @ home. What this little bit of code does is simulate proteins folding. In a nutshell, folding is when a protein atom changes its form. Evolution is another way of describing the process. The software was created for the Stanford Institute to help study folding. They are taking the data from the PS3 owners and attempting to find cures for many diseases. A disease is formed when a protein folds incorrectly and they hope to simulate correct and incorrect folding to find out how diseases are formed and can be cured. This software is also offered free to PC users. However the PS3 can run the software approximately 20-30 times faster than a PC.

== Playstation Portable ==

[[File:Psp.svg]]

The Sony PSP or PlayStation Portable is the only handheld competition to Nintendo's DS system. The PSP boasts graphics slightly stronger than the current PS2. But the game play and graphics are not the focus of this article. The thing I want to address is the VOiP and output to televisions from the PSP. First of all, Sony and Skype set an agreement to work together to create a VOiP network for PSP and PC users. VOiP or Voice Over Internet Protocol allows Skype users to take advantage of a free software program that allows PC to PC calls. With the new PSP, VOiP PSP users can make calls from PSP to PSP or PSP to PC for free. The software is free and only requires a firmware update from Sony. The only thing people have to purchase is a headset, but this is subject to change. Sony might charge a small fee for the Skype software to download into the PSP, but so far, this is still speculative. As of January 2008, the Skype firmware should be released for free. To use the Skype program on your computer go to Skype.com and sign up for their services. 

The second part of this article is the new ability for PSP slim owners to output UMD movies onto a television. The new PSP slim allows users to take their games, music and movies and play them on their personal TV at home. You have to purchase some component cables for around $20, depending on the location, but now people can play their games and movies, even on the road, on a full size TV. This is a nice function if you forget your DVD player or are in a hotel with nothing better to watch.


One of the newest games for the PSP takes cell-shaded art and music and melts them together to create Patapon. This game is a very basic game. You are in charge of a small tribe of funny looking people who have been oppressed by big bad guys and you are there to help them defeat their enemies. Where the meat of this game lies is within the gameplay. You pound out beats on the square, circle, triangle and X button to create a beat that the soldiers will respond to. Based on what beats you let out depends on their attacks and movement. This game doesn't require quick shooting and reloading skills. It just takes a good sense of rhythm and beats per measure, In a sense it is teaching non-musical people how to play a drum beat. It can be an underlying way of teaching people more about the science of music through games.

== Nintendo DS ==

The Nintendo DS has their best hand-held console on the market featuring local wi-fi multiplayer and online gameplay. The Nintendo company has their own version of Xbox live called NFC. The NFC of Nintendo Wi-fi Connection is a free online video game community through Nintendo. The players have to use friend codes that are linked with either your Nintendo DS or Nintendo Wii. The games on the current market require players to have friend codes in order to communicate over headsets. All the online games allow online gameplay, but communication is limited only to friends. Future games will allow players to talk to complete strangers during an online match. The Nintendo Wii has no availability for players to talk to each other currently. No future releases feature interactive features for 2008, yet.

'''Random Nintendo DS Facts'''

1. The Nintendo President Satoru Iwata thought it a smart move to launch the DS system in the US a week before it was launched in Japan.

2. The primary cost of the system was relatively cheap considering the technology built in.

== Nintendo Wii ==


The Nintendo Wii has taken interactivity to a whole new level. Games for the Wii have stopped focusing on button mashing and forces players to be active. Games using swords, fists and weapons can be activated by waving the WiiMote. The WiiMote and Nunchuk have motion sensors inside the controller and can sense even the slightest change in balance of the controller. A new game coming out in 2008 called Wii Fit uses a &quot;Balance Board&quot; for the game. Players must use the board for Yoga positions, balance positions, dance steps and many other features. Wii Fit also uses the WiiMote and has the player jog in place to simulate a race. The length of the race can range from feet to miles, but the approximate calories lost and similar stats are taken throughout the game. 

Another feature the Wii has is the ability to send and receive emails to and from the Wii console. People, not necessarily just gamers, can send a full email to a Wii console as long as the Wii is connected to the internet, and sending emails from the Wii is also possible. This is not a new feature for a moblie game console, but the Wii is the first to do it effectively and smoothly. One other small feature is that when Wii-mail is sent there is a very specific identifier on the email.

'''Random Wii Facts'''

1. The Wii calendar shows dates from the year 2000 to the year 2035.

2. The Wii photo channel supports JPGs up to 8192×8192

3. The effect of direct sunlight and different light sources can make the WiiMote operation less responsive.

4. Classic Nintendo controllers can be used on SOME virtual console games.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Myanmar has borders with  Laos and Thailand in the east, China in the north, and Bangladesh and India in the west. It covers a total area of 678,500 km2 and has a long coastline of about 2,300 kilometers in the west and south along the Bay of Bengal.  the land is Mountainous and half of the country if covered by forests. The lower half of the country is basically flat with several valleys and some hills. The northern part on the other hand is has several mountain ranges starting with the eastern outliers of the Himalayan mountain range and paralleled by two other mountain ranges.   

Myanmar's population is estimated to be around 53 million in 2006 and has fourteen states which inhabit 135 ethnic groups. The female and male population are almost equal. About one third of the population is under 15 years. Over 60 percent of the population is engaged in agriculture as its economy is largely undeveloped. Only about 10 percent is working in the industrial sector, another 10 percent in various productive sectors, about 5 percent in the services sector and around 10 percent in the trade sector its main products being valuable stones and also opium.

Myanmar was founded in the 11th century by king Anawrahta in Bagan. Its empire included parts of Thailand and present Myanmar and lasted for two centuries. During the 16th century the second Myanmar empire was founded by king Bayinnaung. In 1885 Myanmar became a British colony. During the second world War Myanmar was occupied by the Japanese for three years but finally became a sovereign independent state on the 4th January 1948. Its independence was followed by many political struggles that would continue until today including the 1988 uprising resulting in 3000 deaths and the house arrest of Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi daughter of assassinated independence hero Bogyoke Aung San. For more information please look for other sources.

Myanmar offers free and compulsory primary education which student should take for five years. Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) of primary in 2005 is 113% and Net Enrollment Rate (NER) of primary in 2005 is 99%. Although Universal Primary Education (UPE) seems to be achieved in Myanmar, survival rate to grade 5 in 2004 is 70%. It means many students drop out from school  partly because rote learning is emphasized in primary schools. 
Adult literacy rate (more than 15 years old) in 2000 is 91.7% (Male→93.9%, Female→86.4%).

== Distance Education in Myanmar ==

Most of the data regarding education in Myanmar is difficult to verify. The government has a tight grip on the information leaving the country and the information coming into the country. Foreign aid is largely restricted because of the prevailing political climate limiting the use of international assistance regarding the development and implementation of ICT. Recently, the government has formed a Myanmar e-National Task Force to promote ICT, which is in accordance with e-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Framework Agreement. To promote the private sector ICT development the government has formed the Myanmar Information and Technology Park in 2001[http://www.mict-park.com.mn link title].

Although ICT access and use is low in Myanmar (telephone density is one of the lowest in the world with estimates varying from 0.6% to 0.8% and an estimated total number of 50.000 PCs in the country) Distance education started in the 1970s. There were many people who couldn't afford education and as a consequence the government established the first distance education programs. Communication went through the use of email and was therefore called 'mail' education. The first courses were made for teachers at the Institute of Education. Anno 2008 there are two universities that provide distance education programs. The southern part of the country is being served by the Yangon University of Distance Education, while the Mandalay University of Distance Education provides programs for the Northern half of the country. The tools used in their programs are radio lessons, cassettes, TV programs and lessons through e-education learning centres (Bangkok, 2005).

The Ministry of Education has set up multi media classrooms in at least 400 schools, including primary, middle and high school. The new multimedia classrooms include print and electronic media, computers and language laboratories. Further initiative include the use of satellite communication and an electronic data broadcasting system that will be able to communicate information to the over 500 e-education learning centres that offer language training and undergraduate studies. Although several E-learning centres, e-resource centres and computer training centres have also been set up at several institutes of higher education, it is not clear whether overlap exists in the multimedia, e-education and e-learning centre initiatives [http://www.com.washington.edu/ict4d/upload/20060126_174100.pdf link title]

To meet the needs of local communities the government is using Community Learning Centres (CLC's) to provide non-formal education which includes various levels of literacy training. Tools used by the CLC's are video, puppet shows and various printed materials.

To provide the public with better opportunities two New Century Resource Centers (NCRCs) have been established in the North and the South. These NCRCs include computer training rooms, language laboratories, e-learning centres and e-education resource facilities. Courses offered at the centres include computerised accounting, Windows 2000, software engineering, network engineering, hardware engineering, a postgraduate diploma in multimedia arts and a diploma in information technologies. Educational tools used are video, audiotapes and compact discs.

== Two main universities ==

At the moment there are two main Universities offering programs in distance education. These are Yangon University of Distance Education and Mandalay University of Distance Education. Distance education courses were offered for the first time during the academic year 1973/1974. In the academic year 1981/1982 various correspondence courses were offered for the first time at Yangon University. At the beginning of each academic year, course books were given out to all registered students, and every student was required to complete 16 assignments for each course for the respective academic year. The assignments were sent to the students by mail according to the academic calendar and the students returned them back after completing the tasks. These were then marked by the respective teaching staff often with additional remarks and mailed back to the students. Towards the end of the academic year, the students were required to attend certain intensive classroom instructions for about two weeks at their respective institutions, after which they had to sit for the examinations. The available subjects were Arts, Science, Law and Economics. In 1992 the government established the ''University of Distance Education in Yangon'' (UDE) with the motto &quot;No Education That Far&quot; (rough translation). It now has around 400.000 undergraduate and masters students. Mandalay University started offering distance education courses during the academic year 1978/1979. From the year 1991 lectures were also broadcasted using Myanmar Athan (MTRD).

[[Image:Yangon University.jpg]]


The '''objectives''' of the University of Distance Education are:

1)   to make higher education accessible to all students at minimal cost and without having to leave their homes or jobs.

2)   to offer courses of higher education to all within the country including those residing in border areas.

3)   to ensure a high standard of tertiary education to be at par with courses offered at other institutions.

4)   to produce through a higher education program, qualified citizens who will be able to serve better in the interest of the state and to equip them with the ability to carry out effectively all tasks given them by the state.

The overall objective is to bring about improvement in the quality, efficiency and equity of the Myanmar education system, especially with the introduction of UDE to promote human resource development and to strengthen its contribution towards the social and economic development. In particular, it is aimed at promoting and strengthening educational facilities required for sustainable accessibility and improvement in the field of distance education.

According to the South East Asian ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) 'at present two-hour radio lessons are being broadcast everyday and six TV lessons lasting (15) minutes each are also being broadcast weekly. Radio and TV lesson broadcasts are usually repeated as the academic year nears its end and the final examinations approach. Lectures and print based materials are prepared by the staff members of the respective departments of the UDE. Since the UDE now has its own recording studio, faculty members are now in a position to produce radio lessons more efficiently without wasting commuting time.  At present TV lessons are being recorded at the television studio of Myanmar Education Research Bureau, which is also under the Ministry of Education. Radio and TV lessons are eventually transmitted and televised by Myanmar Radio and Television Department (MRTD).  At present the UDE is trying its utmost to establish a TV Studio on campus in a few months time.  Such an endeavor will certainly boost the quality as well as the quantity of TV lesson-production of UDE.'

In 2000 there were 19 possible subject to choose from including Myanmar, English, History, Geography, Philosophy, Psychology, Oriental Study, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Botany, Zoology, Economics, Law, Myanmar studies, Publis Policy, Home Economics, Creative Writing and Business Management. The main focus in all of the courses is on the  specific textbooks, study guides and model questions and answers. In most case they are linked to for example radio lessons and television programs.

== Impact of distance education ==

Although various positive initiatives are mentioned by the government, the actual implementation and its impact remain to be seen. The information shared by the Junta is highly subjective and its truthfulness is therefore highly questionable and difficult to verify. According to local sources most distance education programs are hardly effective at all. Due to the restrictions on Internet use, imposed by the government, students are not able to browse the Internet freely. Furthermore, these restrictions also lead to a limited amount of Internet access points. Especially outside the cities. Altogether this makes it difficult to give an up to date analysis of the situation in Myanmar. Programs in distance education that have no political content or relevance will probably benefit most of the learning centres that are in use. One can think of the programs in Botany, Mathematics and Zoology. For the other programs, the contents studied by the learners or the content provided by the institution will be quite limited. This raises vital issue about distance education and also education in general, namely the political environment in which programs are set up. The political environment serious limits the educational possibilities for potential learners. If Myanmar wishes to catch up with its neighbours there has to be an open educational environment in which a free and unlimited exchange of ideas is processed, implemented and evaluated.

== Areas for improvement ==

=== UDE ===

The UDE has a Department of Research and Developmentis (DRD) which is especially concerned with the improvement of distance teaching and student learning through course design, evaluation and research and introduction of new technology. The DRD maintains an appropriate knowledge base, 'which it seeks to extend and promote to identify educational issues with important future implications that will serve as a guide for possible educational planning commensurate with National Development Plan (SEUMEO).' It recognizs the importance of continuous staff training to equip them with the necessary amount of research menthodology and stimulates them to update research design regularly. According to SEUMEO, every academi year there are new research studies, inquiries into the effectiveness of student learning with the use of different media. Based on the results reviews and changes are carried out.

=== Lack of infrastructure ===

Myanmar ranks as one of the lowest among the ASEAN countries regarding e-infrastructure, e-society, e-commerce and e-government (ASEAN readiness Assessment, 2001). For this reason it is called an 'emerging' readiness country.

=== Lack of financial resources for ICT education ===

According to the UNDP 2003 Human Development Index it ranks 131st out of 175 countries, making it one of the least developed countries in the world. With a GDP of about $1,027, which is slightly inflated due to the wealth of a small group of people, its financial resources are scarce. Furthermore, the country has been cut of from aid by donor countries because of dissatisfaction with its government's progress on its road to democracy. The money it does is largely spent on the military. to give an example, public spending on the military is about five times as high as spending on education.

=== Limited access to and awareness of ICT ===

The UNDP human Development Indicators (2003) shows that there are less than 10.000 Internet user. Considering its 53.000.000 inhabitants this is an extremely low ratio. The main reason for this are the government's restrictions on Internet use. Instead of using the World Wide Web (WWW), reportedly the government only allows access to the Myanmar Wide Web (MWW), which functions a a national Intranet. Also its is said that the government monitors email traffic and checks websites content. Only the websites that have been approved by the government are accessible and therefore available for educational purposes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, my name is '''Megan'''. I am a sophomore Radiologic Technology major at Clarion University.This is my last semester actually at Clarion University, instead I will be studying at a hosital affiliated with the school. I work at a nursing home in Greensburg. I like to hang out with my friends, watch movies, and play softball.

I took physics in high school and strongly disliked it because I had a really hard time with the material. I'm hoping this class will change my opinion on the subject. I also hope to get an A in this class.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi!  My name is Nicole, and I am an MMAJ major here at Clarion University.  I am a second semester Junior.  I've never taken a Physics class before, and I am not very good at math, so I'm not sure what to expect from this class, but I'd really like to do well and hopefully learn something new.

I'm pretty interested in being a healthy person, so learning about energy will be interesting to me.  I think it's important to understand how to be energy efficient without creating a lot of waste product that will ruin the environment.  I'm not sure how much of that we'll be learning, but it's what interests me.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi!  My name is Ashley Silloway.  I am attending Clarion University of Pennsylvania, where I am currently a sophomore, majoring in Radiological Sciences.  

This semester I am enrolled in a Basic Physics and Astronomy course, in which we are creating an online textbook called Introduction_to_Physical_Science[[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Physical_Science]].  We will use this online textbook not only for the course, but also to create our own questions and answers.  I believe this material will help me greatly in understanding the concepts covered during lectures.

During high school, I shyed away from taking any physics classes.  I'm interested in what this semester will bring me, and I hope to learn a lot from this course.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

In this example of AJAX in its [[w:AHAH|AHAH]] form, an incremental search of the chemical elements is implemented.  This is also an example of the use of matching with a regular expression.

The raw data is taken from a file [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/ajax/periodicTable.xml ]provided by [http://www.cafeconleche.org Elliotte Rusty Harold].  

==  Execution ==
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/ajax/periodicTable.xq Search the Elements]

== The main page ==

The main page is a simple HTML file. The div element with id &lt;i&gt;list&lt;/i&gt; is where the generated contents will be placed.  The  JavaScript function &lt;i&gt;getList()&lt;/i&gt; is called when any of several interface events occur. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html
        doctype-public=-//W3C//DTD&amp;#160;HTML&amp;#160;4.01&amp;#160;Transitional//EN
        doctype-system=http://www.w3.org/TR/loose.dtd&quot;;

&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; &gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Chemical Elements&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;script language=&quot;javascript&quot; src=&quot;ajaxelement.js&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
       td {{background-color: #efe; font-size:14px;}}
       th {{background-color: #ded; text-align: right; font-variant:small-caps;padding:3px; font-size:12px;}}
       &lt;/style&gt; 
   &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Chemical Elements&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;table class=&quot;page&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;&lt;form onSubmit=&quot;getList(); return false&quot;&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Element Name &lt;/label&gt; 
                     &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; size=&quot;5&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; id=&quot;name&quot; title=&quot;e.g. Silver&quot;
                                   onkeyup=&quot;getList();&quot; onfocus=&quot;getList();&quot; /&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td id=&quot;list&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== The JavaScript ==

The JavaScript implements the simple functionality of calling the server-side script &lt;i&gt;getElement.xq&lt;/i&gt; with the string entered in the search box, and in the callback, pasting the returned XHTML into the div.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;

function updateList() {
  if (http.readyState == 4) {
      var divlist = document.getElementById('list');
      divlist.innerHTML = http.responseText;
      isWorking = false;
  }
}

function getList() {
  if (!isWorking &amp;&amp; http) {
    var name = document.getElementById(&quot;name&quot;).value;
    http.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;getElement.xq?name=&quot; + name);
    http.onreadystatechange = updateList;  
          // this sets the call-back function to be invoked when a response from the HTTP request is returned
    isWorking = true;
    http.send(null);
  }
}

function getHTTPObject() {
  var xmlhttp;
  /*@cc_on
  @if (@_jscript_version &gt;= 5)
    try {
      xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject(&quot;Msxml2.XMLHTTP&quot;);
    } catch (e) {
      try {
        xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject(&quot;Microsoft.XMLHTTP&quot;);
      } catch (E) {
        xmlhttp = false;
      }
    }
  @else
  xmlhttp = false;
  @end @*/
  if (!xmlhttp &amp;&amp; typeof XMLHttpRequest != 'undefined') {
    try {
      xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
      xmlhttp.overrideMimeType(&quot;text/xml&quot;); 
    } catch (e) {
      xmlhttp = false;
    }
  }
  return xmlhttp;
}

var http = getHTTPObject(); //  create the HTTP Object
var isWorking = false;

&lt;/source&gt;

== The server-side search ==

This script is called by the &lt;i&gt;getlist()&lt;/i&gt;  function when a partial atom name has been entered.  The string is converted to a simple regular expression and used in the eXist free text matching function to retrieve matching atoms. The response depends on the number of matches found: 

* if only one match, return a table of details
* if more than one match, return with a list of matches 
* if none return &quot;no matches&quot;
     
A function turns the ATOM node into a table,mapping each child node to a row with the node name as the legend.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:atom-to-table($element ) {
   &lt;table class=&quot;element&quot;&gt;
      {for $node in $element/*
      let $label := replace(name($node),&quot;_&quot;,&quot; &quot;) 
      return 
            &lt;tr&gt;
                 &lt;th&gt;{$label}&lt;/th&gt; 
                 &lt;td&gt;
                   { $node/text()   }
                   &lt;/td&gt;
             &lt;/tr&gt;       
        }
    &lt;/table&gt;
 };
  
let $name := request:get-parameter(&quot;name&quot;,())
return
  if ($name != &quot;&quot;)
  then
      let $search := concat('^',$name)  (: anchor the term to the start of the string :)
      let $elements := doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/ajax/periodicTable.xml&quot;)/PERIODIC_TABLE
      let $matches := $elements/ATOM[matches(NAME,$search,&quot;i&quot;)]
      return 
         if (count($matches) = 0)
         then 
            &lt;span&gt;No matches&lt;/span&gt;
         else 
         if (count($matches) =1)
          then 
             local:atom-to-table($matches)
         else 
         (: multiple matches :)
             &lt;table class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
               &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Symbol&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Atomic Weight&lt;/th&gt;
               &lt;/tr&gt;
               {for $match in $matches
                order by $match/NAME
                return 
                 &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;th&gt;{string($match/NAME)}&lt;/th&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;{string($match/SYMBOL)}&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;{string($match/ATOMIC_WEIGHT)} &lt;/td&gt;
                 &lt;/tr&gt;
              }
            &lt;/table&gt;
  else ()
&lt;/source&gt;

Starting from November 2007, AROS got it`s 64-bit port. It lacks software and drivers support, but have  some new features AROS never had - some kind of memory protection and 

==x86_64 Native Environment==
AROS x86_64 is targeted towards new PC systems, with both AMD and Intel processors. Also you can try this port in QEMU emulator, using it`s 64-bit mode. Please note that PCI cards and other stuff from x86 can be used, so this page mostly devoted to CPU/Chipsets/Laptops support.

Well at the moment I cant even test this again since it crashes in the bootloader -: 
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
Is all that is displayed, and then the machine reboots. 

Check   VESA  code  carefully.  Something  could  be  damaged  during bootstrap refactor. Could  not  test VESA code because i'm testing on Mac, EFI doesn't provide PC BIOS API in native mode. And,  if  this  appeared recently, check how the embedded 16-bit code
links.  Jason  played  with  %rule_link_binary,  perhaps  this  is the reason. And, you can work around this by running in VGA or native display mode.

The beginning of acpi.resource. For now it just attempts to locate RSDP.   When   scanning   EBDA  it  gurus  because of page fault. Even when running inside SuperState()/UserState(). These functions by themselves work, tests confirm this. Additionally, processor.resource successfully queries CPU speed. 

'Present' flag in MMU tables affects supervisor too, it was set to '0'. However  currently  i diverted into switching to Multiboot V2. In EFI environment  you  need  a  pointer  to  EFI  system  table in order to retrieve  RSDP. There's neither EBDA nor BIOS image provided (scanning fails). BTW i committed my WIP code (there's not much there, just RSDP locator). 


Studied AMD's manual, 64-bit mode is  extremely simple, i just have a descriptor with privilege level in CS and that's all. May be i have something wrong in MMU tables ? You  can  examine the code, it's up to date, i don't have uncommitted parts except acpi.resource skeleton. One which reads the info that kernel resource currently has.  Im fighting with intels ACPI code atm to try and get it to build and link into the resource. I was going to remove this code from kernel.resource.

The idea was:
* acpi.resource RTF_COLDSTART Pri=125 - parse ACPI tables.
* processor.resource  launches other CPUs. It has own boot code for them. This code calls InitCode(RTF_SINGLETASK). 
* kernel.resource detects secondary CPUs and interrupts InitCode().

What it gives:
* Independency on modules' private data.
* Modularity, as a consequence.
* When  secondary CPUs start up, we already have working kernel and even exec environment.



Like only using the version of thisTask stored in TLS in the scheduling code (so that separate cores see their own correct version),  adding task execution time using the apic local timer (based on how sam440 does it..)  and tried to tidy up the APIC/IPI code a little, but I cant check how well it works currently. 

acpi.resource   is   initialized   at  SINGLETASK  level.  After  all SINGLETASK residents are done, InitCode() returns into boot code. This allows to perform additional setup, whatever is needed. Multitask  starts  up  in  exec.library, which is the first COLDSTART
resident. Additionally,  SINGLETASK  is called with supervisor privileges, this gets rid of additional clutter.
This  is  very close to original AmigaOS boot sequence. And allows to completely separate hardware-controlling components from kernel. 

Additionally, processor.resource successfully queries CPU speed. Studied AMD's manual, 64-bit mode is  extremely simple, i just have a descriptor with privilege level in CS and that's all. May be i have something wrong in MMU tables ? You  can  examine the code, it's up to date, i don't have uncommitted parts except acpi.resource skeleton. 
Additionally processor.resource would have to call the CPU detection code on each core to gather information. However can such code be executed before kernel.resource? IMHO it should be done where it is (in kernel resource) because it interacts directly with the system resources that kernel resource controls.  Trying to move it all out is just going to add code duplication/unecessary bloat. 
Always envisioned that kernel.resource sets up cores and then has a function that allows executing code on specific core. Such function is used by processor.resource to run core capabilities detection code.

==Why I wrote this book==

As a biologist, I have found that an understanding of the Greek and Latin word roots is invaluable. It makes scientific names much less mysterious, and aids in the understanding of Scientific subjects. I find, however, that it is harder and harder to find books on these subjects, and students are not encouraged to learn the classical languages.

For this reason, I decided to make a simple book of roots and exercises to aid the students in my introductory Biology classes. I encourage anyone who has a good knowledge of classical languages to correct me if I go astray, because I learned my roots largely by context and the dictionary, although I did take a class in this subject. ( The text is referenced on the contents page).

I hope that this will make Science less scary for students.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Internet World,

My name's Matt, I'm a student at Clarion University in Professor Pearce Physical Science class.
I'm a business major with a little bit of an interesnt in physics. I've never done anything with wiki before this, so I hope everything goes smoothly.  This should be a pretty interesting journey.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Internet World,

My name is Matt, I am a student of Professor Pearce at Clarion University.

I am a business major at the university with a small interest in the field of physics.  The fact that physics is all around us really makes me appreciate the subjest.  I am really looking forward to learning more about it this semester.

This is my first adventure into the World of Wiki, and what an adventure it should be.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Understanding Scientific Terms}}
==Lesson 1 - Roots, prefixes, and suffixes==

===How technical words are made===

The main part of a word is the word '''root'''.
This is a Greek or Latin word or combining form that has a meaning.

Roots can be combined with other roots to make more complex words such as the word ''electrocardiogram''.
Many word roots actually begin and/or end with consonants. In order to make the word sound better a vowel is placed between the two words to make them easier to say.

:'''Tel'''  : Is a word root that means ''far''.
:'''gram''' : Is something that is written. A letter. A recording.

putting them together makes 

:'''tel/gram'''

but we add a vowel between the two ( In this case the letter ''e'') to make the word '''telegram'''.


:'''tel/e/gram''' - A written record sent from afar. 



In fact many words have a preferred letter that is used as a combining form. 

When this is so, the letter is placed beside the root after a slash (/) to tell you how to combine it.


Try the following exercise:

TERMS TO KNOW

:'''tel/e''' : Greek, meaning far or far off.
:'''-phone''' : Greek, meaning sound or voice. ( also '''phon/o''') 


{{Latin/Exercise|Write the word|
#What is the correct way to write the word meaning a sound heard from  far off?
# What means a record of a sound?
|
# telephone
# phonogram
}}

====prefixes and suffixes====

'''Prefixes''' and '''suffixes''' may also be added to a words to modify its meaning. 
In fact the term ''prefix'' is made this way.

:'''fix''' : Is a word root from Latin ''fixus'' which means to fasten.
:'''pre''' : Is a prefix from the Latin ''Prae'' before or front.

Therefore prefix means to fasten to the front of a word.

Suffixes follow a word.

:'''o/logy''' is a suffix that means The study of.
: '''Bio'''   is a word root that means Life.

{{Latin/Exercise|Define the word|
# What does '''Biology''' mean?
# What is '''Phonology'''?
|
# The study of Life.
# The study of Sound( or Speech ).

Physics was not something that I took in high school so when I got to college and found out that it was required for my major I really wasn't sure what to expect.  I am looking forward in learning more about Physics that way I can pass it on to my students in the future.</text>

Hello my name is Tara. I am a sophmore at Clarion University.  I am interested in fishing, hunting and riding four wheelers.  I am a very out going and drivin person.  I believe you take life as it comes with the good bumps and the bad ones.  Life is to short not to have fun.  I am a Psychology major and love every second of it.  Someday I plan on counseling younger children.  I want to make a difference in the world. With that said it leads me to Physical Science, I am not a science person, but in taking a science I can use that to my advantage. Science to me is all about making a difference. I just need to figure out how to tie Psychology and Science into one.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Appendix 4: Fast translation rules ==

Many English words can easily be &quot;converted&quot; into english.

Many words in English ending with &quot;tion&quot; (like ration) take the ending &quot;sjon&quot; in Norwegian (like rasjon).&lt;BR&gt;
Many words in English ending with &quot;ical&quot; (like practical) take the ending &quot;isk&quot; in Norwegian (like praktisk).&lt;BR&gt;
Many words in English ending with &quot;cated&quot; (like provocated) take the ending &quot;sert&quot; in Norwegian (like provosert).&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Words with the letter &quot;C&quot; pronounced as &quot;K&quot; are usually spelled with &quot;K&quot; in Norwegian.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Julie. I'm a freshman Spanish Education major.  

Physical sciece is interesting to me becuase it involves so many things around us in our day to day lives.  For instance, problems like the one on the quiz dealing with the theft detection device in a store.  I would never have thought about the physics behind how those machines work.  This subject interests me because it deals with things that we can apply to our lives and hopefully use some day.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, my name is Sarah Greer and I am a second semester Sophomore here at Clarion University.  I am enrolled in Physical Science Physics 112 and I am excited to learn what this course has to offer.  I'm not the biggest &quot;fan&quot; of science, but then again I've never really had much experience with it (especially physics).  I hope to learn more about our environment, how to do some experiments, and just more about physics in general!  I think it's very important for our generation to get involved and make people realize science can be very rewarding.</text>

==Bugs==
*[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Reddi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1157138]
*Sometimes doesn't delete (parameter not being passed properly?) but cannot reproduce
*Deleting talk pages &lt;s&gt;sometimes&lt;/s&gt; hangs
*after deleting, link takes us to the wrong page - its not urlencoded
*match delete options to [[MediaWiki:Deletereason-dropdown|these]] and [[MediaWiki:Filedelete-reason-dropdown|these]]
*Why doesn't unlinking backlinks work?
*Generic speedy deletion asks for a reason twice -- check which one is actually being used.

==Feature requests==
*if user talk is redlink, welcome first
*on vfd, create section w/ nom
&lt;!--**opens page, but doesn't change text, nor save
**strangely calls this part of code not on vfd
These comments no longer relevant? What version did I say that about?--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hello everyone!''' 

My name is Shelley. I live in a small town near Pittsburgh called North Apollo. I went to Apollo-Ridge High School, and now attend Clarion University. I come from a big family. My dad has eight brothers and sisters, and my mother has six. I love outdoors activities such as, camping, hiking, being on the beach, or just sitting outside enjoying the fresh air. 

What interests me about Physical Science is that you can basically apply it to anything. You can apply it to your interest, your friends interest, or others. It seems to be a fun way to learn putting your favorite things into a educational setting.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hello My Name Is HEATHER MORRELL! ==

I am a sophmore Library Science Major/ Political Science Minor. I also grew up on a dairy farm in Northwest PA. I still spend every moment possible there, milking cows and taking care of the calves. This is our farm website...feel free to check it out!

[http://www.holsteinworld.com/morrell]

I am also an active 4-H leader and founded a new program for Crawford County last year called 'Rope2Ring Dairy Day'

I have learned that in life you need to know more than just how to read and write (darnit!) so I hope to learn enough to make a small impact in my life so that I can pass that on to my students in the future.</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or login in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Adobe Flash platform (formerly part of Macromedia until acquired by Adobe in 2005) was initially known as Shockwave Flash and is often called simply Flash. Flash refers to both the Adobe Flash Player and to the Adobe Flash authoring software. The Flash Player is a client application or plug-in available in most common web browsers. There are also versions of the Flash Player for mobile phones and other devices.
Since its introduction in 1996, Flash technology has become a popular method for adding animation and interactivity to web pages. Flash is commonly used to create animated advertisements, various web page components, to integrate video into web pages, and more recently, to develop Internet applications.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Market Share&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
According to a Millward Brown survey, conducted June 2007, Adobe claims Flash reaches 99.3% of desktop Internet users.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flash Video Technology&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
Flash is increasingly used as a way to display video on web pages. Flash video technology is used as the basis for many popular video sites, including YouTube and Google Video. One major flaw with multimedia embedded through Flash, however, is the considerable performance penalty placed on playback hardware as compared with other video playback systems such as Apple’s QuickTime or Windows Media Video. Many files that drop frames and skip audio when embedded within Flash may play without any issues using other formats on the same hardware. However the next version of the Flash player will include MPEG-4 support which could significantly increase video performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Mojavi Installation Steps.'''
1. download mojavi files.
2. extract those files in directory(i extracted all files to d:\\web\mojavi).
3. open the dir you extract files in
you will see
Folders
(i).svg (ii) lib (iii) opt and (iv)webapp
Files
(i) index.php
(ii) mojavi-all-classes.php

'''the actual installation starts now.'''
1. go to webapp folder
2. find and open config.php
3. set BASE_DIR  to d:/web/mojavi/
4. set MOJAVI_FILES to $BASE_DIR . 'mojavi-all-classes.php'
5. set OPT_DIR as $BASE_DIR . 'opt/'
6 and set LOG_DIR to your log dir as above.
7. know comment 'die' statement in your (mojavi folder in my case) index.php

&lt;big&gt;'''important:'''&lt;/big&gt;
you will still encounter a problem because the application has not been developed.

== re:[[Papermaking]] ==

This book is looking fantastic! I like the formatting, it's all very nice! I doubt it would take you years to finish, you seem to be on a good pace with the first three chapters. Although, maybe I just don't know how busy you are in real life. I wouldn't move it to your user space, especially not if the book may be in development for a long time. For ease, you could write a note on the front page alerting editors that it is a translation-in-progress from NL.wikibooks, and maybe other  translators could help with it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:04, 13 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

=Budapest Gambit=
The move 2...e5 introduces the Budapest Gambit and is an energetic gambit. At first glance it seems to lose a pawn, however the pawn if taken is normally returned so that White avoids tactical issues. The resulting positions can lead to White having a slender advantage of having the bishop pair.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hi''', My name is Ashley Swartzlander. I am majoring in Secondary Education English/Spanish. I am currently a second semester sophomore at Clarion University. Physical Science: Physics &amp; Astronomy is the first physics class I am taking since I was in High School. I am not very good at Math so i do not know what to expect from this class. I am hoping to do well in this class and also prove that English Majors are capable of solving Math problems. This is also my first time making a wiki so I am excited to learn something new and I am looking forward to expanding my education in the field of Physical Science.

Something fun and interesting about myself is that on my weekends I spend time at Dirt tracks. My family race Big Block Modifieds at the different tracks around the state and also sometimes out of state. Also my family owns a race shop out in Grove City. So most of my spare time is spent with or around Race Cars</text>

I was born and raised in Pittsburgh and I absolutly love it. This course was required for my major, that is the main reason I am taking it, but it also seems interesting. I took a physics class in high school and I really liked it, so I am sure I will enjoy this class.</text>

I was born and raised in Clarion but hope to get out after I graduate. I enjoy spending time outdoors and with friends in my free time.

Hi! And welcome to ZOe' page for Physical Science 112!
I am hopeing I can get an &quot;A&quot; for this class~~

What interest me about physical science?
The grea thing I like about physical  science is that it is secience they we can apply to real-life living, we see it everyday and we live with it, like how elevator work, or how to use less power to lift up really heavy things. And I love to watch mythbuster in the discovery channel~ I think it is a great show~~</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Levels ==

I'd like to suggest that we change the level designations for this guideline to something more broad. Assigning age groups isn't always the best approach. If we remove the grade-based levels to some other wording like beginner or intermediate I think more books can use this (not everything here is explicitly academic. I would consider using this for the Muggles' Guide if we could get larger groups in as well, such as &quot;children to adults&quot;. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:50, 15 January 2008 (UTC)

:I like that proposal. I guess i'm so wrapped up in my own academics that I forget that it isn't the only way to break down materials. There are probably 4 major groups that I would like to differentiate between:
:#Children who can't read, or are just learning to read. These are things like picture books or story books. &quot;Pre-Reader&quot; is still a non-academic designation, but i would be open to other suggestions
:#People who read at a basic level (&quot;Beginner&quot;?) These books would be light on vocabulary, simple sentence structures, etc. I don't want to call this group &quot;Novice&quot;, as a personal preference. 
:#People who are reading at a &quot;normal&quot; adult reading level (&quot;Intermediate&quot;?). These books don't have to go out of their way to be simplified, but should make efforts to be easily accessible.
:#People who are professionals or are highly educated in one domain. These people can sift through jargon and acronyms, and can dig through very dense, dry, academic work (&quot;advanced&quot;, or &quot;professional&quot;?)
:It would be fairly easy to change these categorizations, once we decide what precisely to change them to. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:13, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

::I'm supportive of Pre-Reader -&gt; Beginner -&gt; Intermediate -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Professional myself. I feel that Advanced and Professional should be separate. For instance, when I was a college student I was Advanced in some engineering topics but still learning them. My instructors were Professional. Also, let's throw in &quot;All Ages&quot;. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:19, 18 January 2008 (UTC)

:::That's fair. We keep the same number of categories, so conversion is as simple as category renaming.

== Levels are too Limiting ==
Noticing &quot;[[A Little C Primer]]&quot; was put in the [[:Category:Beginner Reading Level|Beginner]] level, it seems to me painfully obvious that the current system may benefit from some reworking.

As far as &quot;reading levels&quot; are concerned, the currently used levels are more than sensible, for Reading Levels. The problem seems to be that writers confuse them with content difficulty level.

A C Primer is &quot;beginner&quot; C/S reading, but i hardly can immagine your average 8-year old can digest that.

At the moment, only the two most &quot;high level&quot; categories make any sense for any sort of higher academic matierial (any programming, any science etc), not allowing for different levels of comlexity within the subject.

Maybe there could be a separate difficulty specifier for the subject's difficulty...

A C Primer should be a Beginner Text for an Advanced Reading-capable person.

:Yes, but these are ''reading levels'' -- we also have [[Template:Prerequisite]] to better describe the audience. If you have other descriptors to suggest, we can consider them. Perhaps age is one such descriptor.
:But your analysis is correct - there are books which are easy to read but difficult to understand (as in your example of a C primer). That's not a fault with this system. It's not a fault at all. Those books exist, and should be described as such.
:Though I suggested age as another descriptor, I'd be reluctant to actually implement that because age is notoriously difficult to work with in this area. In young children there is too much variability, and among adults there is not enough to make it useful. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:29, 23 November 2008 (UTC)

:: I've made some changes to try to clarify what this page is about so this sort of confusion is hopefully reduced. I've focused on mentioning different reading skills that are mastered, starting with not having learned to read at all yet, and from there for each skill level mentioning things like having mastered the ability to work out the meaning of most unfamiliar words just by the content of their usage. I think that helps clarify the intent of this page and makes clear that this page is not about a person's ability to understand a subject based on what they have learned previously about the subject. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:40, 30 November 2008 (UTC)

== Reading level for non-native speakers ==

Should a new level be created, or should it be an addition to beginner? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 11:13, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

: A non-native speaker is much like native speaker in that there skill levels can vary.
:* A non-native speaker that knows no words yet, or needs assistance to understand words might be called a pre-reader.
:* A non-native speaker that knows some words and language structure, and only needs assistance some of the time might be called a beginner.
:* A non-native speaker that has been able to master an ability to figure out what unfamiliar words mean from their context and usage might be called Intermediate.
:* A non-native speaker that knows some specialized words, often only used in a specific field, might be considered Advance.
:* A non-native speaker that knows most specialized words in a specific field, might be considered to have a professional understanding of the language.
: Do you see what I mean? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:17, 4 June 2010 (UTC)
::I see... perhaps a word or two could be added about non-native speakers to every level. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 09:49, 7 June 2010 (UTC)
::: Well the page doesn't really attempt to differentiate between native and non-native speakers. I'm unsure there is a clear way to differentiate them in any case or a need to. Whether someone considers themselves a native or a non-native speaker is a personal choice/opinion. What I said about non-native speakers is also true of native speakers, and the page already mentions these things without reference to whether a person is native or non-native. The reading levels aren't even based on some age group, just on lack of or skills learned which is age neutral and native/non-native neutral. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:13, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

== New reading level for reference books ==
I propose that we create a new &quot;Introductory&quot; category for beginner reference books that are written with non-technical vocabulary but require an adult's level of comprehension. Books in the category would be introductions to advanced/professional topics, for example the books [[A Little C Primer]] and [[Java Programming]], for which readers would not be expected to have prior knowledge (which makes it a misnomer to categorize the books as Intermediate). The two books are currently categorized as Beginner, but those books clearly don't meet the criteria of being intended for young children and reliant on pictures. The Introductory category would only apply to nonfiction reference works, and it would categorize books that are written at an Intermediate level but require a basic adult comprehension level. I think such a category would solve the unique problem involving the miscategorization of nonfiction works for beginners in a particular subject. This would solve the problem discussed in a [[Wikibooks talk:Reading Levels#Levels are too Limiting|previous section]]. --[[User:Apollo1758|Apollo1758]] ([[User talk:Apollo1758|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Apollo1758|contribs]]) 00:28, 21 June 2012 (UTC)

: This page describes level of fluency in reading a language, such as a fluency in reading the English language. Some people seem to confuse language fluency with topic difficulty. {{tlx|prerequisite}} covers any prior knowledge a person should have in a topic if any. Whether a person has any prior knowledge on a specific topic and how difficult a topic may be to learn is beyond the scope of this page. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:17, 21 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">How can you tell the difference between a media fad and new paradigm shift that might have eternal consequences?  What determines whether we should invest our time and effort or not?

Post the best of your seven &quot;New Paradigm Shifts&quot; in this space.  Follow my example below by indicating your name and information source:

Eland: http://www.red.com/cameras

Digital video cameras are one of the hottest and most competitive products in the market.  Over the years, billions have been spent in research and development by companies like Sony, Panasonic, JVC, Canon and a dozen more.  How on earth did the CEO of Oakley sunglasses come up with a device that seems to have trumped them all?  

The Red One camera shoots a better picture at less cost and seems to have opened the door to thousands of wanna-be's with talent that might be equal to Stephen Speilberg's.  Affordable, phenominal quality video means that every paradigm in the film industry related to finance, distribution and profits has been turned on its head.  Orders are so backlogged for the Red One right now that it will probably take years to understand what the real consequences of it are within the movie industry.

My name is Tracey Read I major in Elementary Ed. this is my Senior year, but i actually have to go one more year next year and then i will be finished!!

My interests of Physical Science is really nothing at this point, I never really had Physical Science so I am excited to see what it is all about. I did hear people talking about Math and I love math so hopefully I like this class.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi All,
            My name is Lindsey Cunko and i am a Junior Elementary Education major. I'm kinda nervous about this class since i never had to take Physics in high school so hopefully it wouln't be to bad and i will learn some new stuff. When i'm not busy with classes and class work i enjoy hanging out with friends, playing saxophone and guitar, and playing sports. My favorite sports teams to watch are the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Pittsburgh Pirates. As far as what interests me about Physical Science i'm not really sure since i have never taken physical science in high school before. So hopefully after taking this class i will be able to learn something that will interest me in this science. I'm looking forward to having a good semester and learning many things in this class.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''This Future Media Class students will write their own text as a WIKIbook.  Informal discussions about this course in Facebook can be used in this WIKI where thoughts are formalized in an on-line text book outlined by teachers. 





'''Guidelines and suggestions for the use of Facebook as a social networking tool and WIKIbooks as an information sharing tool are as follows:'''

1. Every student should communicate in Facebook at least four times per week and more often when class activities require it.

2. Students are encouraged to use the discussion board in Facebook for ongoing topics.  New &quot;Topics&quot; can be at any time and a history of all interactions in Facebook will be used to partially determine a course grade.

3. New chapters can be added to the WIKI, but students are requested to let professors in the relevant discipline (art, music, multimedia, business) know when a section of the book is added .  The editing and contribution of text, photos, URL links, etc. is expected.

4. In order to stay current with the class, students are responsible to read Facebook messages Monday through Friday and on weekends when possible.

5. Students are encouraged to address Facebook comments to specific students and teachers when appropriate.  Occasionally it will be appropriate to message every class member from Facebook.

      <comment>Removing instance of image Thumbnail.jpg (speedily deleted per [[WB:SPEEDY|policy]]);  using [[w:WP:TW|TW]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey everyone I'm Craig.  I am a sophomore here at Clarion.  I'm an elementary education major with a math concentration.  


The thing that I like most about physical science is the astronomy.  I took a semester of astronomy in high school and it was one of my favorites.  I think it's pretty cool to look at things that are so much bigger than you.


&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:thumbnail.jpg]] --&gt;

Physical Science is interesting because it is the basis for how things work in the world.  Everything works because of a physical reaction.  Physical science teaches us the reasonings behind how things work.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I love to go fishing, four-wheeler riding, and just being outdoors. 

I am a junior in college. I am an Early Childhood/Elementary Education major. 

I am a very family oriented person. I love spending my free time with my family. 

Physical science in my opinion is amazing. It is sometimes hard to understand, but all in all it is an amazing subject.

I really hope to learn more about physical science with this course.

I came to this page looking for some good lwjgl or java3d help instead I find something on the distance between 2 2D points, this should be removed in my opinion and replaced with some useful information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Everyone!

My name is Cybill Swab and I am currently a Senior here at Clarion University. I am majoring in Elementary/Special Education with a minor in Political Science. Next semester I will be going on block and am very excited for that experience.

I have put off taking this class to the very end because I have never been good at math and was therefore afraid to take Physics. However, I think Physics might interest me as long as the content does not get to in-depth.</text>

I'm 21 years old and in my third year here at Clarion.  My major is radiologic science. I went to Clarion-Limestone High School and graduated there in 2005. 

I never took a physical science class in high school but i did take plenty of math classes including geometry, algebra, trigonometry, pre-calc and calc.</text>

Family means a lot to me. I am about fifteen minutes from IUP. I went to Purchase Line and played several sports. I was very atheletic, playing volleyball, basketball, softball. I also particapted in cheerleading and karate for eight years. I am a first degree black belt and love to work out. I am an out going girl, who loves to have a good time and hanging out with friends. I will pretty much try anything out and give it a whirl.

'''My interests and dislikes about Physical Science'''
   I am a little nervous about this Physics class, not sure of what to expect. I took a Physics class in high school and it was very interesting to me.  One reason I was very interested into Physics, is becasue I love math. I love trying to figure out the problems. In high school, we performed mini labs and the things that happened was shocking. I was wondering how things like that happened. Although Physics didn't come easy to me all the time. I have trouble relating the math problems to real life situations and figuring out the problems. Defiantely my favorite part about physical science is math.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Strength of Materials/Header}}

When for a particular property a material shows a large scatter in measured data (e.g. strength measurement results of brittle materials, or of threads with important variations in thickness as listed in reference [1]), a characteristic value for, or the weakest link of such a property can be obtained by analyzing the measured data on the basis of three parameter [[w:Waloddi Weibull|Weibull]] [[statistics]].

== Introduction ==

When a material is subject for strength determination, series of strength measurements will show a scatter. When the scatter is low compared with the average value of the series, a minimum strength value &lt;math&gt;f_{min}&lt;/math&gt; may be defined by:

(1) &lt;math&gt; f_{min} = f_a-u.s &lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;f_a&lt;/math&gt; is the average strength, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the standard deviation of the measurement series, and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the factor related to the probability of not failing (e.g. relates to a fail probability of 0.0001)

However, a number of materials, e.g. threads with important variations in thickness, brittle materials as annealed glass, will show a large, or even a very large scatter compared with the average value of the series. And even the scatter of the average values of a number of series of measurements may show such an important scatter compared with the overall average value, that applying expression (1) leads to a nonsensical minimum strength.

In those cases, strength measurements series may be described by [[w:Weibull distribution|two parameter Weibull distributions]] that indicate that the minimum value approaches to zero, or:

(2) &lt;math&gt;F(f;\alpha,\beta)=1-\exp \left[ - \left( \frac{f}{\beta}\right)^\alpha \right]&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the cumulated probability of failing, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; the measured strength value, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; the first or shape parameter, and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; the second or scale parameter.

The minimum applicable strength value &lt;math&gt;f_{min}&lt;/math&gt; can be determined by the following expression:

(3) &lt;math&gt;f_{min} = \beta \left[ \ln \frac{1}{1-F} \right]^\frac{1}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

in which the cumulated probability &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of failing has a low value, e.g. 0.0001.

When the scatter of strength measurements is extremely important, or the minimum strength value is certainly larger than zero, straight application of the two parameter Weibull distribution is of no meaning and should be replaced by a more complex method leading to the use of three parameter Weibull distributions, expressed as:

(4) &lt;math&gt;F(f;\alpha,\beta) = 1 - \exp \left[ -\left( \frac{f-\gamma}{\beta} \right)^\alpha \right]&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the third parameter, or the minimum value of the strength. Or in other words, the weakest link.

It should also be taken into account that the parameters shall be considered as distributions  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal {D}&lt;/math&gt; of random variables with a mean value and a variance:

(5) 1st, or shape parameter:    &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \mathcal{D}( \alpha_m,Var_\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

(6) 2nd, or scale parameter:    &lt;math&gt;\beta = \mathcal{D}( \beta_m,Var_\beta)&lt;/math&gt;

(7) 3rd, or location parameter: &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \mathcal{D}( \gamma_m,Var_\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

== Quantification method ==

In order to quantify the three parameters, and especially the third one, the weakest link, a relative large number of data should be available, grouped in series. Those series have to be obtained from measurement pieces drawn from lots, where each lot should be considered as more or less homogeneous. The estimation of the parameters then may follow the following iterative procedure:

'''''step i''''': Use the three parameter Weibull distribution, however declare the third parameter &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{min} = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Put each series of data into that distribution by means of a best fitted method. This gives for each series the parameters &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. For a best fitting method, see reference [2], and possibly the Wikipedia contribution [[w:Weibull modulus|&quot;Weibull modulus&quot;]].

'''''step ii''''': With those parameters &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, calculate a specific value and range, e.g. the average &lt;math&gt;f_a&lt;/math&gt; value and the range &lt;math&gt;R_{p2-p1}=f_{p2}-f_{p1}&lt;/math&gt; with possibly &lt;math&gt;p1=0.05&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p2=0.95&lt;/math&gt;.

''''' step iii''''': Place all pairs of specific range/specific value, here as example the &lt;math&gt;R_{p2-p1}&lt;/math&gt;/&lt;math&gt;f_a&lt;/math&gt; pairs, into a Cartesian diagram with as abscise the specific range and as ordinate the specific value. The result should be a stretched cloud pointing to the ordinate.

'''''step iv''''': Calculate the trend, or [[w:Statistics|regression line]] and calculate the specific value when the specific range equals to zero. The value obtained, &lt;math&gt;f_{a,R=0}&lt;/math&gt;, is also the average third parameter &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{a,R=0}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''step v''''': Calculate the best estimation of the residual standard deviation &lt;math&gt;s_r&lt;/math&gt;, needed for the estimation of the lower value of the third parameter, the real weakest link &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{min}&lt;/math&gt;, with the expressions:

(8) &lt;math&gt;s_r = \sqrt{K_f \frac{1-r^2}{n-2}}&lt;/math&gt; and (9) &lt;math&gt;K_f = \sum_{i=1}^n f_a^2 - \frac{1}{n} \left(\sum_{i=1}^n f_a\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;K_f&lt;/math&gt; is the square sum of the average &lt;math&gt;f_a&lt;/math&gt; values, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of pairs, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the correlation factor.


'''''step vi''''': Calculate the lower value of the third parameter by means of

(10) &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{min} = \gamma_{a,R=0} - u.s_r&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the eccentricity of the normal distribution, e.g.  &lt;math&gt;u=1.64&lt;/math&gt; for a probability of 0.05.

'''''step vii''''': Replace the used third parameter in '''''step i''''' by the &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{min}&lt;/math&gt; value estimated in '''''step vi'''''. Repeat '''''steps i''''' to '''''vii''''' until the difference between last and fore last value is sufficient small.

== Conditions for representation ==

In order to select a most representative number of strength measurement series of the entire, more or less inhomogeneous population, but ensuring within each lot a most representative homogeneous number of measurement pieces, some conditions should be taken into account.

a)	The number of series should represent a sufficient time interval of production of the concerned material. A population consisting out of up to five series is certainly too small, a population from six to ten series may lead to doubtful results.

b)	The number of measurement pieces per series should be recommended to have at least 10 pieces. The test pieces for one series should be selected randomly from one lot manufactured within a production interval that may be assumed to be as homogeneous as possible.

c)	The measurement pieces per series should be of one size: the measurement pieces of different series should differ in size. 

Examples of possible minimum numbers of measurement series:

'''''Threads''''': From each of e.g. four production intervals or lots, spread over a production period of one month, where each production of threads is as homogeneous as possible, a first series of tensile measurements should consist out of measurement pieces of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, a second series should consist out of measurement pieces of 3 times &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and a third series should consist out of measurement pieces of 10 times &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. So in total 12 series of tensile measurement pieces. 

[[w:Architectural glass|'''''Annealed flat glass''''']]: From each of e.g. four production intervals or lots, spread over a production period of some months, where each production of annealed flat glass is as homogeneous as possible (e.g. series could be taken from one very large sheet of glass), a first series should consist out of measurement pieces of surface &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt;, a second series should consist out of measurement pieces of surface &lt;math&gt;A_2&lt;/math&gt;, and a third series should consist out of measurement pieces of surface &lt;math&gt;A_3&lt;/math&gt;. For various surfaces, refer to the series of international standards [[w:European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] [[w:ISO|ISO]] 1288 (reference [3]). So in total 12 series

== Computer generated example ==

[[Image:Figure_1_Average_value_versus_Range.png|thumb|400px|right|Figure 1]]

An example with computer generated data is given below.

'''''Measurement pieces''''':

- 4 lots, where each lot contains 3348 strength numbers;

- each lot deliver 3 series of measurement pieces, where the pieces contain 121, 25 or 9 strength numbers, in respectively the first, second and third series;

- each series consists out of 12 measurement pieces;

- total 4 x 3 x 12 = 144 measurement pieces;

- strength numbers &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; are randomly distributed following the expression

(11) &lt;math&gt;f_i = 20+4 \mu_0 + \left[\left(40+40 \mu_0 \right) \left(\mu_1+\mu_2 \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable related to lots with values  between 0 end 1, and &lt;math&gt;\mu_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_2&lt;/math&gt; are random variables related to any stress number, also with values between 0 and 1;

'''''Third parameter estimation''''':

The '''''steps i''''' to '''''vii''''' have been performed two times. The result is graphically given in figure 1. The stability of the method has been investigated by repeating the whole process 20 times. The averaged minimum third parameter value &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{min}&lt;/math&gt; was 16.2 by a standard deviation &lt;math&gt;s_{\gamma_{min}}&lt;/math&gt;=2.2.

=== Weibull distribution with parameters subject of random variation ===

The following sections give the information for the development from expressions in the “Introduction” to those in '''''step v''''' and '''''step vi''''' in the “Quantification method”.

From expression (4) the stress &lt;math&gt;f_{F}&lt;/math&gt; belonging to a certain occurrence probability ''F'' is

(i) &lt;math&gt;f_{F} = \gamma + \beta \left( \ln \frac{1}{1-F} \right)^\frac{1}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
 

From expression (i) and expressions (5) to (7) it can be concluded that


'''''&lt;u&gt; at first &lt;/u&gt;''''' the variance of the stress with a determined probability to occur, is

(ii) &lt;math&gt;Var_{F} = Var_{ \gamma} + Var_{ \beta + \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; where + means &quot;combined with&quot;.

When the probability &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt; is selected in such a way that &lt;math&gt; \ln \frac{1}{1-F} = 1&lt;/math&gt;  , then expression (i) will be simplified to

(iii) &lt;math&gt;f_{F} = \gamma + \beta&lt;/math&gt; which can be detailed as


(iv.a)	mean value &lt;math&gt;f_{F;m} = \gamma_{m} + \beta_{m}&lt;/math&gt;  and

(iv.b)	variance &lt;math&gt;Var_F = Var_{\gamma} + Var_{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;


'''''&lt;u&gt; and secondly &lt;/u&gt;''''' the value of the stress &lt;math&gt;f_{F}&lt;/math&gt; with a determined probability &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt; to occur varies linear with the value of the second parameter &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; . When the value of &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; can be reduced to zero, the remaining expression will be

(v)	&lt;math&gt;f_F = \gamma &lt;/math&gt; which can be detailed as


(vi.a)	mean value &lt;math&gt;f_{F;m} = \gamma_m &lt;/math&gt;  and

(vi.b)	variance &lt;math&gt;Var_F = Var_{\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;


=== Properties of the second or scale parameter &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; ===

Failing of an object under stress of inhomogeneous objects such as threads, or brittle materials such as annealed glass, depends on the size &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; of the objects as well as the intensity &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; of those irregularities in or on the object from where failing starts. For instance for threads the size is characterized by the length, the intensity of the irregularities by a.o. variations in thickness. In the case of annealed glass the size is characterized by the surface of the object, the intensity of the irregularities by the presence and depth of flaws on that surface.

This dependency can be expressed as

(vii)  &lt;math&gt; \frac{ \beta_{A_1}}{ \beta_{A_2}} = K \left ( \frac{A_2}{A_1} \right )^ \frac{1}{a} &lt;/math&gt;


so that the expression (6) can be more detailed by


(viii) &lt;math&gt; \beta _{A_1} = \mathcal {D} \left [ K \left ( \frac{A_2}{A_1} \right )^\frac{1}{a} \beta_{A_{2;m}} , K \left ( \frac{A_2}{A_1} \right )^ \frac{1}{a} Var_{A_{2;m}} \right ] = K \left ( \frac{A_2}{A_1} \right )^ \frac{1}{a} \mathcal {D} \left ( \beta_{A_{2;m}} , Var_{A_{2;m}} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;


This expression demonstrates that when the size &lt;math&gt; A_{1} &lt;/math&gt; approaches the infinitive and, or the irregularities are such that &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; approaches zero, the value of the second parameter &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; approaches zero. 


=== Reduction of second parameter &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; to zero ===

For a certain measurement series, the occurrence &lt;math&gt;f_{F_1} &lt;/math&gt; occurring with a probability &lt;math&gt;F_1 &lt;/math&gt;, and the occurrence &lt;math&gt;f_{F_2} &lt;/math&gt; occurring with a probability &lt;math&gt; F_2 &lt;/math&gt;, are


(ix) &lt;math&gt; f_{F_1} = \gamma + \beta \left( \ln \frac {1}{1-F_1} \right)^ \frac {1}{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;  and

(x) &lt;math&gt; f_{F_2} = \gamma + \beta \left( \ln \frac {1}{1-F_2} \right)^ \frac {1}{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;


When stating that the range &lt;math&gt; R_{F_1-F_2} &lt;/math&gt; for that particular measurement series is


(xi) &lt;math&gt; R_{F_1-F_2} = f_{F_1} - f_{F_2} = \beta \left [ \left ( \ln \frac {1}{1-F_1}\right )^ \frac {1}{\alpha} - \left ( \ln \frac {1}{1-F_2}\right )^ \frac {1}{\alpha} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;



then the second parameter &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as


(xii) &lt;math&gt; \beta = \frac {R_{F_1-F_2}}{ \left ( \ln \frac {1}{1-F_1} \right )^ \frac {1}{\alpha} - \left ( \ln \frac {1}{1-F_2}\right )^ \frac {1}{\alpha}} &lt;/math&gt;



When substituting &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; in expression (ix) by expression (xii), the result is that

(xiii)  &lt;math&gt; f_{F_1} = \gamma + \frac {R_{ \left ( F_1-F_2 \right )} \ln \left( \frac {1}{1-F_1} \right ) ^ \frac {1}{\alpha}}{ \left ( \ln \frac {1}{1-F_1}\right )^ \frac {1}{\alpha} - \left ( \ln \frac {1}{1-F_2} \right )^ \frac {1}{\alpha}} &lt;/math&gt;


Further, when taking into account the variability of &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; by using expression (viii), it can be concluded that the occurrence &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; with a probability of &lt;math&gt; F_1 &lt;/math&gt; is


(xiv)  &lt;math&gt; f_{F_1} = \gamma + K \left ( \frac{A_2}{A_1} \right )^ \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac {R_{ \left ( F_1-F_2 \right )} \ln \left( \frac {1}{1-F_1} \right ) ^ \frac {1}{\alpha}}{ \left ( \ln \frac {1}{1-F_1}\right )^ \frac {1}{\alpha} - \left ( \ln \frac {1}{1-F_2} \right )^ \frac {1}{\alpha}} &lt;/math&gt;


This means that when the size &lt;math&gt; A_1 &lt;/math&gt; becomes an infinitive large, or when the intensity of the irregularities are so important that &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; approaches zero, the occurrence equals to the value of the third parameter, or


(xv)  &lt;math&gt; f_{F_1} = \gamma &lt;/math&gt;


to be detailed as

(xvi.a) mean value: &lt;math&gt; f_{F_{1;m}} = \gamma_m &lt;/math&gt;
	 
(xvi.b) and variance: &lt;math&gt; Var_{F_1} = Var_{ \gamma } &lt;/math&gt;


=== Conclusion ===

On the basis of (xiii), the measured values of pairs &lt;math&gt; R_{F_1-F_2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f_{F_1} &lt;/math&gt; can be placed in a Cartesian diagram, which should give a scatter of points where the scatter is determined by the distributions of &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt;.
When the specimens per measurement series do not differ in dimension and, or when the series are drawn from lots with no significant difference in the intensity of irregularities, the scatter will be an undetermined cloud of points. No conclusion can be drawn.
When on the other hand these differences have been respected, the scatter allows to draw a regression line of &lt;math&gt; f_{F_1} &lt;/math&gt; as function of the range &lt;math&gt; R_{F_1-F_2} &lt;/math&gt;, and there where the range &lt;math&gt; R_{F_1-F_2} &lt;/math&gt; equals to zero, to apply expression (xv), and thus the quantification method as exposed above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am a sophmore majoring in Radiology at Clarion University. In my spare time,I enjoy hanging out with my boyfriend. I enjoy watching movies, and on occasion, playing some video games. I love to play softball and volleyball. I also enjoy hunting. 
   My interest on physical science is very minimal. But I hope that this course will help me gain a better understanding of the subjects material.</text>

      <comment>Added to [[Category:Advanced Interactive Media]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Future media presents nearly unlimited potential for creative imagination.  Imagination usually involves moral issues.  What are the implications for immersive, multisensory experiences?  Why are they so powerful and influential and how should they be used and/or policed?

Ethics and morality.  These two words are pervasive in culture due to their vital role in forming culture and society.  As interactive media becomes more pervasive and therefore more essential in our society and its culture, we must look at the ethical and moral questions interactivity raises.  Interactivity is a tool, and as with any other tool man uses, it can be used for good or for bad.  The process of understanding through research and analysis of said research which uses are good and which uses are bad is one that we must take the initiative to pursue.  This chapter of this Wikibook attempts to do so.

The rose, the lily, the dove, the sun- &lt;br&gt;
I once loved them all with ecstatic love.&lt;br&gt;
I love them no more, I love only&lt;br&gt;
the little one, the dainty one, the pure one, the One.&lt;br&gt;
She alone, the well-spring of all love,&lt;br&gt;

Wenn ich in deine Augen seh'&lt;br&gt;
So schwindet all' mein Leid und Weh; &lt;br&gt;   
Doch wenn ich küsse deinen Mund,&lt;br&gt;
So werd' ich ganz und gar gesund&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Wenn ich mich lehn' an deine Brust, &lt;br&gt;
Kommt's über mich wie Himmelslust;&lt;br&gt;
Doch wenn du sprichst: Ich liebe dich,&lt;br&gt;
So muss ich weinen bitterlich.&lt;br&gt;

|  style=&quot;padding-left: 0.5em;&quot; |

If I look into your eyes &lt;br&gt;
all my sorrow and pain disappear;&lt;br&gt;
but If I kiss your mouth,&lt;br&gt;
then I become wholly well.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If I lie upon your breast&lt;br&gt;
a heavenly happiness comes over me;&lt;br&gt;
but If you say: I love you!&lt;br&gt;
then I must weep bitterly.&lt;br&gt;

Im Rhein, im heiligen Strome&lt;br&gt;
Da spiegelt sich in den Well'n,&lt;br&gt;
Mit seinem grossen Dome&lt;br&gt;
Das grosse, heilige Köln.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Im Dom, da steht ein Bildniss&lt;br&gt;
Auf goldenem Leder gemalt.&lt;br&gt;
In meines Lebens Wildniss&lt;br&gt;
Hat's freundlich hineingestrahlt.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Es schweben Blumen und Englein&lt;br&gt;
Um unsre Liebe Frau,&lt;br&gt;
Die Augen, die Lippen, die Wänglein,&lt;br&gt;
Die gleichen der Liebsten genau.&lt;br&gt;

The Rhine, the holy river,&lt;br&gt;
reflects in its waves,&lt;br&gt;
with its great cathedral,&lt;br&gt;
the great holy city of Cologne.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the cathedral there hangs a painting&lt;br&gt;
painted on gilded leather;&lt;br&gt;
in the confusion of my life&lt;br&gt;
it has shone kindly down upon me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Flowers and cherubs float&lt;br&gt;
about Our dear Lady.&lt;br&gt;
Her eyes, her lips, her cheeks&lt;br&gt;
are exactly like those of my love.&lt;br&gt;

Die alten bösen Lieder&lt;br /&gt;
Die Träume schlimm und arg,&lt;br /&gt;
Die laßt uns jetzt begraben,&lt;br /&gt;
Holt einen großen Sarg.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hinein leg ich gar Manches,&lt;br /&gt;
Doch sag ich noch nicht was;&lt;br /&gt;
Der Sarg muß sein noch größer&lt;br /&gt;
Wies Heidelberger Faß.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Und holt eine Totenbahre,&lt;br /&gt;
Von Brettern fest und dick:&lt;br /&gt;
Auch muß sie sein noch länger&lt;br /&gt;
Als wie zu Mainz die Brück.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Und holt mir auch zwölf Riesen,&lt;br /&gt;
Die müssen noch stärker sein&lt;br /&gt;
Als wie der heilige Christoph&lt;br /&gt;
Im Dom zu Köln am Rhein.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Die sollen den Sarg forttragen&lt;br /&gt;
Und senken ins Meer hinab,&lt;br /&gt;
Denn solchem großen Sarge&lt;br /&gt;
Gebührt ein großes Grab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wißt ihr, warum der Sarg wohl&lt;br /&gt;
So groß und schwer mag sein?&lt;br /&gt;
Ich legt auch meine Liebe&lt;br /&gt;
und meinen Schmerz hinein.&lt;br /&gt;

The hateful songs of times past,&lt;br /&gt;
The hateful, brutal dreams,&lt;br /&gt;
Let's now have them buried­&lt;br /&gt;
Fetch up a great coffin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've a lot to put in it - &lt;br /&gt;
Just what, I won't say yet;&lt;br /&gt;
The coffin must be even bigger&lt;br /&gt;
Than the Great Cask of Heidelberg.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And fetch a bier&lt;br /&gt;
Boards that are strong and thick;&lt;br /&gt;
They too must be longer&lt;br /&gt;
Than the river bridge at Mainz.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And fetch me, too, twelve giants;&lt;br /&gt;
Who must be stronger&lt;br /&gt;
Than St. Christopher, the great statue&lt;br /&gt;
At the Cathedral of Cologne on the Rhine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's they that must haul the coffin&lt;br /&gt;
And sink it in the sea;&lt;br /&gt;
For a great coffin like that&lt;br /&gt;
Deserves a great grave.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do you know why the coffin really&lt;br /&gt;
Has to be so huge and heavy?&lt;br /&gt;
Because I sank all my love in it, &lt;br /&gt;
And all of my great grief.&lt;br /&gt;

==Lotte Lehmann's notes on interpretations==
This final song is certainly more suited to a man than to a woman. If you, the woman singer, are to make it credible, you must sing with great power of expression rather than force of tone.

Imagine the situation: you have now passed through every stage of delight, disillusionment, bitterness. You have sought oblivion in nature, in dreams, in fantasies, which have led you away from the world of reality. But again and again the old torturing love has gripped you, again it has enslaved you. Now at last you decide to end this torment once and for all if you are not to be destroyed by it. You must end all that might have bloomed so wonderfully in your hear, if it had not been so cruelly broken at the hands of your beloved. The songs which you have sung in joy and sorrow must be silenced, the dreams which have tormented and comforted you must vanish. 

Begin the song very erect, with great energy, sing broadly and forcefully. (Note the exact value of each note. Every dot is a valuable aid to expression.) in the delivery of this song you must understand how to combine triumph, bitterness, scorn, and even a tough of savage humour. You are now above pain, your fears are conquered, your sighs stilled. you have emptied your heart of every tender and vulnerable feeling. You have become master of yourself. The song, the dreams, the tears have only made you unhappy. Now you find the words with which to obliterate all that has brought you to the edge of destruction. Sing it in a way to 'gebrt ein grosses Grab'.

In the next phrase it is as if you suddenly stand still, as if you suddenly interrupt the grand gesture with which you had, so to speak, conducted the dramatic structure of this scene. You whisper--and something akin to madness sounds through this whispered question--'Wisst ihr, warum der Sarg wohl so gross und schwer mag sein?' Slide the word 'sein' up to the next phrase in a broad sweep: &quot;Ich senkt' auch meine Lieve und meinen Schmerz hinein'. Sing this broadly, painfully, through your tears. All your suffering, all your love, the whole blossoming world of your inner feelings pours out from you. Breathe before 'hinein' with a great and exalted finality. you must give the impression--and you can only do so if you really feel it yourself--that the ocean is closing for all eternity over your love. You have torn away from yourself and have buried all that you once felt. Now you are alone, engulfed in inner and outer emptiness. 

The postlude memory enfolds you. You listen to its melodies as to something long vanished. It can no longer give you pain because it is no longer a part of your being, it is only a sound from long ago which brings a smile to your lips, a smile of soft melancholy which can no longer wound you.

==Aim==
This page is intended to provide a quick-start guide to writing your own MATLAB scripts and functions using SPM as a library. It's based on one of [http://www.sph.umich.edu/~nichols/JohnsGems5.html#Gem1 John's Gems], but will hopefully grow into a more complete introduction. SPM programming can mean simply [[SPM/Batch|writing batch scripts]] to automate common pipelines, writing short helper scripts or functions to accomplish useful tasks (e.g. see the other [http://www.sph.umich.edu/~nichols/JohnsGems5.html Gems], including those for [http://www.sph.umich.edu/~nichols/JohnsGems2.html SPM2] and [http://www.sph.umich.edu/~nichols/JohnsGems.html SPM99]), writing your own [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ext/ SPM extensions], or even modifying your local installation of SPM.

This page unashamedly fails to provide for older versions of SPM or peculiar versions of MATLAB --- it is simply too much work for the developers and keen mailing list contributors to support multiple releases. Having said that, if a function listed below exists in SPM2 or even SPM99, then there is a reasonably good chance that it will behave similarly, but you have been warned that it might not...

==Using SPM from the command line==
===Introduction===
SPM has extensive developer documention in the headers of the source files. To view the documentation of a function either open the corresponding source file or call &lt;code&gt;help function&lt;/code&gt; from the MATLAB command line. Make sure that the SPM folder is in MATLABs search path.
===Reading image headers and data===
* &lt;code&gt;spm_vol&lt;/code&gt; – header information
* &lt;code&gt;spm_read_vols&lt;/code&gt; – for reading entire volumes (see also: &lt;code&gt;spm_vol&lt;/code&gt;)
* &lt;code&gt;spm_slice_vol&lt;/code&gt; – for arbitrary planes
* &lt;code&gt;spm_sample_vol&lt;/code&gt; – any voxels
* &lt;code&gt;spm_get_data&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;spm_sample_vol&lt;/code&gt;) – any voxels from multiple volumes
* &lt;code&gt;spm_bsplins&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;spm_bsplinc&lt;/code&gt;) – NB &lt;code&gt;spm_slice_vol&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;spm_sample_vol&lt;/code&gt; offer polynomial or sinc interpolation; these functions provide b-spline interp as used in &lt;code&gt;spm_reslice&lt;/code&gt;
===Writing data===
* &lt;code&gt;spm_write_vol&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;spm_vol&lt;/code&gt;)
* &lt;code&gt;spm_create_vol&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;spm_write_plane&lt;/code&gt;
=== Reading and writing data with the alternative NIfTI class library===
* &lt;code&gt;nifti&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;@nifti/Contents&lt;/code&gt;,  &lt;code&gt;@nifti/create&lt;/code&gt;)
* &lt;code&gt;file_array&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;@file_array/Contents&lt;/code&gt;)
===Geometry, voxel-world mappings===
* &lt;code&gt;spm_get_space&lt;/code&gt; – get the voxel-world mapping matrix (a rigid or affine transform, in homogeneous coordinates)
* &lt;code&gt;spm_imatrix&lt;/code&gt; – convert above matrix to parametrised form
* &lt;code&gt;spm_matrix&lt;/code&gt; – convert parameter vector to affine matrix
* &lt;code&gt;spm_check_orientations&lt;/code&gt;
===Linear (rigid/affine) registration and reslicing===
* &lt;code&gt;spm_realign&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;spm_coreg&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;spm_reslice&lt;/code&gt;)
* &lt;code&gt;spm_affreg&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;spm_reslice&lt;/code&gt; – needs reference image; see following for reslicing to specified geometry
* &lt;code&gt;reorient&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;resize_img&lt;/code&gt;) – available from [http://www.sph.umich.edu/~nichols/JohnsGems5.html#Gem2 John's Gems] 2 and 3
===Preprocessing, including segmentation and non-linear normalisation===
* &lt;code&gt;spm_preproc&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;spm_config_preproc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;spm_prep2sn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;spm_preproc_write&lt;/code&gt;) – SPM5's unified segmentation and normalisation
* &lt;code&gt;spm_normalise&lt;/code&gt; – the old pre-SPM5 non-unified spatial normalisation
* &lt;code&gt;spm_segment&lt;/code&gt; – the old pre-SPM5 non-unified tissue segmentation
* &lt;code&gt;spm_smooth&lt;/code&gt;
===Processing===
* &lt;code&gt;spm_imcalc&lt;/code&gt; – perform arbitrary calculations on volumes (low level function)
* &lt;code&gt;spm_imcalc_ui&lt;/code&gt; – high level convenience wrapper for &lt;code&gt;spm_imcalc&lt;/code&gt;
===Statistics===
* &lt;code&gt;spm_ancova&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;spm_reml_ancova&lt;/code&gt;) – unused by SPM itself, but often useful for scripting or educational purposes
===Viewing data===
* &lt;code&gt;spm_check_registration&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;spm_image&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;spm_orthviews&lt;/code&gt;) – the ubiquitous three orthogonal views
* &lt;code&gt;slover&lt;/code&gt; – slices through images, overlays of thresholded or raw statistics; see also [http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DisplaySlices slice_overlay]
* &lt;code&gt;spm_mip_ui&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;spm_mip&lt;/code&gt;) – maximum intensity projections or ''glass brain'' images
===Configuration===
* &lt;code&gt;spm_defaults&lt;/code&gt;
===Batch System===
* &lt;code&gt;spm_jobman&lt;/code&gt;

==Illustrative examples==

===Reading and writing a volume (to replace NaNs with zeros)===
A simpler (but more memory-hungry) version of an old [http://www.sph.umich.edu/~nichols/JohnsGems.html#Gem2 Gem]. See the [http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/nichols/entry/zero_nans_in/ SPM8 version of gem] for an example of plane-wise reading and writing.
 fnm = spm_select(1, 'image');
 [pth bnm ext] = spm_fileparts(fnm);
 VI = spm_vol(fnm);
 VO = VI; % copy input info for output image
 VO.fname = fullfile(pth, [bnm '_zn' ext]);
 img = spm_read_vols(VI);
 img(isnan(img)) = 0; % use ~isfinite instead of isnan to replace +/-inf with zero
 spm_write_vol(VO,img);

&lt;big&gt;'''Carotid Artery Radiation Toxicity'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Cavernous Sinus Meningioma==
*'''Mayo Clinic, 2005''' PMID 16029803 -- &quot;Results of stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with imaging defined cavernous sinus meningiomas.&quot; (Pollock BE, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Aug 1;62(5):1427-31.)
**In text authors note they documented 4 cases of internal carotid stenosis (cavernous sinus meningioma n=2, pituitary adenoma n=2) at their institution; however, they don't say how many patients were treated. In this series, there were 49 cavernous sinus meningiomas reported, with mean margin dose 15.9 Gy

*'''Marseille, 2000''' (France)(1992-1998) PMID 11143266 -- &quot;Gamma knife radiosurgery in the management of cavernous sinus meningiomas.&quot; (Roche PH, J Neurosurg. 2000 Dec;93 Suppl 3:68-73.)
**Retrospective. 80 patients, 50 primary and 30 adjuvant. Mean prescription dose 28 Gy, with median peripheral isodose 50%.
**One temporary intracavernous carotid artery occlusion at 3 months. Estimated carotid dose was 36 Gy


==Head &amp; Neck==
===Carotid Artery Blowout Syndrome===
*Complication of aggressive management of H&amp;N cancer
*Typically presents as significant, difficult to control oronasal bleeding
*Predisposing factors: RT, radical surgery and surgical complications (flap necrosis, wound infections, pharyngocutaneous fistula), persistent/recurrent tumor
*Results from destruction or damage to vessel adventitia 
*Most occur in the petrous segment of internal carotid artery, possibly due to associated osteonecrosis after high dose RT
*Mean dose in Taipei series of patients who developed it was 73 Gy (range 54-110)
*Latency varies between &lt;1 year to &gt;20 years
*Management of bleeding can be via endovascular approaches


*'''Taipei'''
**'''2008''' (1997-2006) PMID 18164999 -- &quot;Radiation carotid blowout syndrome in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Angiographic features and endovascular management.&quot; (Luo CB, Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2008 Jan;138(1):86-91.)
***Retrospective. 14 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma with 15 carotid blowout syndromes, initially treated by RT alone. All presented with oronasal bleeding. Location was internal carotid (n=10), external carotid (n=4), or common carotid (n=1)
***RT info: mean dose 73 Gy (54 - 110 Gy); mean latency 33 months (8 - 70 months)
***Management: Endovascular embolization.
**'''2006''' PMID 16538509 -- &quot;Radiation acute carotid blowout syndromes of the ascending pharyngeal and internal carotid arteries in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.&quot; (Luo CB, Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. 2006 Jul;263(7):644-6. Epub 2006 Mar 15.)
***Case report. NPC patient with radiation-induced acute carotid blowout syndrome in cervical internal carotid artery


===Carotid Artery Stenosis===
*After RT, carotid narrowing occurs in ~50% of vessels receiving &gt;40 Gy
*Multiple other studies document accelerated atherosclerotic disease
*Duplex ultrasound screening may be warranted
*Carotid-sparing IMRT feasible for T1-2 glottic cancer, but long-term disease control and carotid outcomes not yet available PMID 19679406


*'''Mayo Clinic; 2005''' (1974-1999) PMID 16169673 -- &quot;A historical prospective cohort study of carotid artery stenosis after radiotherapy for head and neck malignancies.&quot; (Brown PD, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Dec 1;63(5):1361-7. Epub 2005 Sep 19.)
**Retrospective. 44 H&amp;N patients treated with unilater RT. Bilateral carotid duplex ultrasound screening performed
**Outcome: Significant stenosis RT-side 18% vs. contralateral 7% (NS), events increased with time
**Conclusion: Ultrasound carotid artery screening should be considered

*'''Fort Lewis, WA; 2004''' PMID 15135672 -- &quot;Focused high-risk population screening for carotid arterial stenosis after radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.&quot; (Steele SR, Am J Surg. 2004 May;187(5):594-8.)
**Retrospective. 40 patients treated with high dose (&gt;55 Gy, mean 64 Gy) H&amp;N RT. Mean F/U 10 years
**Outcome: Significant carotid artery stenosis 40%; no difference in terms of age, RT dose, tobacco, time from RT, or comorbidities. Unilateral complete occlusion 15%. CVA in 8%
**Conclusion: Prevalence of carotid artery disease is clinicall significant, and warrants aggressive screening

*'''Prince of Wales Hospital; 2001''' (Hong Kong) PMID 11745291 -- &quot;Incidence of carotid stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients after radiotherapy.&quot; (Lam WW, Cancer. 2001 Nov 1;92(9):2357-63.)
**Retrospective. 71 carotid arteries examined with Doppler U/S in nasopharyngeal patients after RT. Compared with control group of 51 newly diagnosed NPC patients
**Outcome: Arterial stenosis RT group 79% vs. pre-RT group 22% (SS); significant stenosis (&gt;50%) only in post-RT group 51%
**Conclusion: RT can cause significant carotid stenosis

*'''Queen Mary Hospital; 1999''' PMID 10587192 -- &quot;Irradiation-induced extracranial carotid stenosis in patients with head and neck malignancies.&quot; (Cheng SW, Am J Surg. 1999 Oct;178(4):323-8.)
**Comparative cross-sectional study. Duplex U/S 240 patients with H&amp;N EBRT. Mean interval 6 years after RT
**Outcome: Significant (&gt;70%) ICA/CCA disease in 12%
**Predictors for significant narrowing: age (&gt;60), cerebrovascular symptoms, RT interval (&gt;5 years), location (nasopharynx or larynx)
**Conclusion: Significant risk of carotid stenosis after RT; recommend routine ultrasound screening

*'''VA Washington DC; 1999''' (1993-1998) PMID 10587388 -- &quot;Accelerated carotid artery disease after high-dose head and neck radiotherapy: is there a role for routine carotid duplex surveillance?&quot; (Carmody BJ, J Vasc Surg. 1999 Dec;30(6):1045-51.)
**Case control. 23 patients with RT and 46 age-matched controls. Mean RT dose 60.6 Gy. Average interval to screening 6.5 years
**Outcome: Advanced carotid disease RT group 22% vs. control 4% (SS); 16/23 RT patients underwent 2nd U/S and had further progression
**Conclusion: High dose RT significant risk factor for accelerated atherosclerosis, may warrant routine ultrasound screening

*'''Seoul; 1994''' PMID 8040432 -- &quot;MRI of carotid angiopathy after therapeutic radiation.&quot; (Chung TS, J Comput Assist Tomogr. 1994 Jul-Aug;18(4):533-8.)
**Retrospective. 16 patients, pre and post RT (&gt;40 Gy) MRI scans reviewed blindly by 2 readers
**Outcome: Interval narrowing of carotid artery lumen (common, internal, or external) seen in 56%; difference in lumen was statistically significant. 3/16 patients had new critical stenosis; 7/16 patients had diffuse obliteration of carotid planes
**Conclusion: Incidence of accelerated atherosclerosis after RT may be greater than expected

==Breast Cancer==
*'''MD Anderson; 2008''' PMID 18000801 -- &quot;Prospective analysis of carotid artery flow in breast cancer patients treated with supraclavicular irradiation 8 or more years previously: no increase in ipsilateral carotid stenosis after radiation noted.&quot; (Woodward WA, Cancer. 2008 Jan 15;112(2):268-73.)
**Retrospective. 46 breast cancer patients, adjuvant RT to SCV. Median dose 50 Gy. Bilateral Doppler ultrasound of carotid artery. Minimum F/U 8 years, median F/U 14.6 years
**Outcome: asymptomatic carotid stenosis 9%, but only 2% (1 patient) irradiated carotid artery only, 2% (1 patient) had bilateral, and 4% (2 patients) had contralateral stenosis. No difference between sides on peak systolic flow
**Conclusion: No evidence of late, clinically relevant carotid artery stenosis</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Osteoradionecrosis'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Nonvital bone in a site of prior radiation therapy
*Can be spontaneous or may develop after even minor trauma, such as denture-related injury, tooth extraction, or ulcers. It is believed that the reparative capacity of radiation-injured bone is exceeded
*Clinical presentation: pain, swelling, trismus, exposed bone, pathologic fracture, malocclusion, oral cutaneous fistula formation
*Grading
**Grade I: exposed alveolar bone
**Grade II: exposed alveolar bone that does not respond to HBO
**Grade III: full-thickness involvement and/or pathologic fracture
*On pathology, inferior alveolar artery (the predominant arterial blood supply to the body of the mandible) and periosteal arteries have significant intimal fibrosis and thrombosis
*Historically, 5-12% incidence but more recent frequency probably ~3%
**Rare in patients who receive &lt;60 Gy
**Risk factors: preradiation or postradiation extraction or surgery, close to tumor, posterior mandible &gt; anterior mandible &gt; posterior maxilla &gt; anterior maxilla, dental disease, dose &gt; 60 Gy, time from preradiation extractions to start of RT &lt; 14 days
*Work-up
**Rule out tumor recurrence, with biopsies as necessary
**Plain film, CT and/or MRI
*Prevention
**Full dental evaluation prior to RT
**Radiation carries: Daily fluoride treatment with 1% neutral sodium fluoride gel in prefabricated trays for 5 minutes each day, for life
*Medical management is supportive. Nutritional support, superficial debridement, oral saline irrigation. ABX only for definite secondary infection
*Use and efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is controversial. If used, typically 30 dives to 2.4 ATM x90 minutes, followed by surgery, and additional 10 dives
*Surgical reconstruction typically involves vascularized free tissue transfers


*'''MD Anderson''' 
**'''1980''' PMID 7410128 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiation necrosis of the mandible: a 10 year study. Part I. Factors influencing the onset of necrosis.&quot; Murray CG et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1980 May;6(5):543-8. 
**'''1980''' PMID 6997243 &quot;Radiation necrosis of the mandible: a 10 year study. Part II. Dental factors; onset, duration and management of necrosis.&quot; Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1980 May;6(5):549-53.


'''''Reviews:'''''
*'''2006''' PMID 16458773 &amp;mdash; &quot;Osteoradionecrosis prevention myths.&quot; Wahl MH et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Mar 1;64(3):661-9.


==Hyperbaric Oxygen==
===Randomized===
*'''French ORN96''' (1997-2001) -- hyperbaric oxygen vs. placebo
**Randomized. ''Stopped early after 2nd interim analysis for lower HBO outcomes.'' 68 patients, history of RT for H&amp;N cancer, with overt mandibular radionecrosis. Severe forms such as mandibular fracture or bony resorption excluded. Arm 1) 30 HBO exposures @ 2.4 ATM x90 min prior to surgery, with additional 10 HBO exposures post-operatively vs. Arm 2) placebo
**'''2004''' PMID 15520052 -- &quot;Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for radionecrosis of the jaw: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial from the ORN96 study group.&quot; (Annane D, J Clin Oncol. 2004 Dec 15;22(24):4893-900. Epub 2004 Nov 1.)
***Outcome: 1-year recovery HBO 19% vs. placebo 32% (NS)
***Conclusion: Patients with mild/moderate mandibular osteoradionecrosis didn't benefit from HBO

*'''University of Miami''' -- hyperbaric oxygen vs. penicillin
**Randomized. High risk patients, history of RT, who required tooth removal. Arm 1) hyperbaric oxygen vs. Arm 2) penicillin
**'''1985''' PMID 3897335 -- &quot;Prevention of osteoradionecrosis: a randomized prospective clinical trial of hyperbaric oxygen versus penicillin.&quot; (Marx RE, J Am Dent Assoc. 1985 Jul;111(1):49-54.)
***Outcome: incidence of ORN: HBO 5% vs. penicillin 30% (SS)
***Conclusion: HBO should be considered a prophylactic measure when post-RT dental care involving trauma to tissue is necessary

===Review===
*'''Liverpool; 2010''' PMID 20347191 -- &quot;Hyperbaric oxygen in the management of late radiation injury to the head and neck. Part I: treatment.&quot; (Shaw RJ, Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2010 Mar 25. [Epub ahead of print])

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Cameron Lee Brown, and I am a sophomore majoring in Secondary Education Social Studies with a minor in history. I enjoy a lot of things varying all the way from sports right down to reading books. As of late I have taken a liking to history books that focus on American history starting from the Revolutionary War right up to the late 1980's.  What interests me most about physics is the concept of inertia. Although I don't fully understand this concept it still fascinates me greatly.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello! My name is Erica Jacquel and I am a Junior Elementary Education/Special Education major at Clarion University of Pennsylvania. I grew up in a suburb of Pittsburgh and graduated with 511 students (and believe it or not, I knew every single one of them!).

I have a twin sister named Erin who is my best friend, and a (not so little) brother, Eddie, who just turned 16. I have always been very close with my family. We have a little black pug named Rocky, a kitten named Cali, and 4 fish: Adam, Eve, Ugly and Weezy.

Up in Clarion, I am a member of the Student Council of Exceptional Children, P.R.O.U.D (People Reaching Out to Understand Disabilities) and currently hold a chair position with the Clarion County Special Olympics board. Special Education is my baby. I love it more than any other subject I have studied in school. With them, there never is a negative vibe. The adults I have worked with are nothing less than a riot. They are just like you or I only they are disabled in some way,shape or form.  I truly believe that God put me here on this Earth to spread his word and use the talents He gave me to bring joy in the lives of these people. I can't wait to get out and teach them!

Physical science has its days with me. Some stuff I find interesting such as technology and some parts of chemisrty. Other parts of physical science such as cutting animals open and math equations bore me to tears. It's really a love/hate relationship we have. I am hoping to lose this by the time this semester ends.</text>

 | Closed as '''keep'''.

I consider this a strategy guide. As many of us know, these are not allowed on Wikibooks. Could it receive consideration? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 13:51, 8 January 2008 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''{{{2|Keep}}}''' - If this is a [[WB:GUIDE|game guide]] then what game is it for? It rather clearly is ''not'' a strategy guide. If it were, it would be specific to a particular game, would include details about the strategy for that game, etc. Instead, this book deals with how to play computer games. It's not a great book, and has some [[WB:OR]] that should be removed, but it's not a game guide. Quoting [[WB:DP]]: &quot;Walk-throughs and strategy guides for video games are not acceptable instructional materials, and do not belong on Wikibooks. ''However, other books about video games, such as scholarly analysis of video games or guides on the design of video games, are allowed here''&quot; (emphasis mine). This falls in the &quot;books about video games, but not a strategy guide&quot; category. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:53, 8 January 2008 (UTC)

:{{del}} Strategy guides can be generalized, that is they do not need to be about a single game or a single family of games. This is a strategy guide (or would be if it weren't a terrible stub) because it  tells how to play &quot;a&quot; game, even if that game is not any one game in particular. The first half of this page is an unfocused mis-mash of first-person ramblings, and the second half is a list of personal &quot;recommendations&quot; for which games to attempt playing. Even if this wasn't a strategy guide, it still suffers from NPOV, a lack of focus, no definition, and no hope of ever really expanding beyond what it currently is. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:19, 9 January 2008 (UTC)
:{{del}} - per Whiteknight for the most part. I don't believe it's a strategy guide and would stay based on WIW, but there are many other problems with the work that Whiteknight noted. This is someone's personal essay on the topic and has little to no potential for improvement in my opinion. It looks like it was copied from somewhere and the editor has only made this one edit and then disappeared. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:28, 9 January 2008 (UTC)
:'''Comment''' This page is a stub, stubs shouldn't be targeted by the NPOV as they don't have enough content even to provide a single point of view (and NPOV is by default a fragile reason for requesting a deletion), but stubs by definition are starting points. I do agree with the description given by Whiteknight that it is a terrible stub but I can't call this a strategy guide or even a stub of one, and even WK isn't sure it is one.
:So it seems that all delete votes rely only on the quality of the stub. If the gameplan was to delete stubs then this one would fit the bill, but as Mike.lifeguard pointed out on the previous VfD the policy is not to delete them, from [[WB:DP#What to keep, what to delete]]: &quot;In general, keep stubs... In general, keep modules that need heavy editing.&quot;.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:36, 9 January 2008 (UTC)
: I already did my bit in extending the stub a little and correcting some of the wording...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:57, 9 January 2008 (UTC)
:{{del}} - per Whiteknight. --- &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 02:53, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
:weak {{keep}}. I was inclined to vote for deletion because it's a poor book but it's new so we should give it chance to expand and the vote for deletion appears to have been called because it offended the 'video game guide' policy.  If the book is improved then it could be quite good but it's too early to say.

:{{keep}}, I agree with Xania and Panic, give it time, we don't know necessarily what the author intended and I think it's improvable [and I also don't think this would qualify as a strategy guide]. If it's not developed further at a later date I'll be more inclined to say delete.

Thanks for posting this interesting example. For self education, I tried to get this actually running with xsltforms. After fixing many many syntax errors caused by the wiki's presentation, I could not locate the external schema. Would it be possible for the original contributor to provide a downloadable copy of the plain text xml sources which includes the referenced schema file named &quot;CreateReport.xform.xsd&quot;?</text>

When the Expecto Patronum spell is cast, the result is an apparent object made of white vapour. This object, the Patronus, often takes the shape of an animal; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s, for instance, is a stag. The animal in question often has some relationship to the person casting it: for instance, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s is a phoenix, which seems to fit him well given his choice of pet, and Harry's takes the shape that his father took as an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]]. Dumbledore has also devised a way of allowing a patronus to carry messages. More information is available at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Expecto Patronum]].

      <comment>/* Cube falls through maze */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">When I hit &quot;P&quot; everything disappears until I hit ESC again, it does not seem to matter if I am in perspective or orthographic mode. I made sure I have a lamp but that did not help.

When I make a cone it keeps linking to the grid and they are considered the same object. Can anyone tell me why they do this?
:ANSWER: You have to create the Cone in Object mode. If you create a mesh while in edit mode, you are just adding another mesh to that object.  The cone needs to be its own object in order to be distinguishable from the grid.


This is just a question: This Engine can be fully programmed? Or we only can use functions that are already in Blender?


I'm stucked with a strange behavior (at least, I find it so). When I start the game, I can see only the big cube (from inside). However, when I render the scene, I can see also the maze and the &quot;hero&quot;. I'm pretty sure that I have selected both layers.
Another strange thing: this only happens if I press PKEY while in perspective mode. In ortographic mode, I can see the maze and the hero.
:ANSWER: This is because you cannot be &quot;inside&quot; an object with orthographic view, whereas in perspective view, you can.  Cameras render in perspective view by default.


I added the sensors and actuators exactly the same as it shows, but for some reason my cone turns when i press A and D, and nothing at all when i press W and S. Also, when i make the cone turn and press W or S it wobbles and starts turning. How can i make it work?
:ANSWER: A and D are supposed to make the character rotate, not strafe. To make them MOVE left and right, and not rotate, change the force from Torque to Force. As for the force controls not working, the cone used in the tutorial's local Y is equivalent to your cone's local Z from the viewing point. Thus, to move forwards and backward, fill in the force settings as you normally would but in the third/right integer box instead of the second/middle integer box. Also here noting that I added the multiple-goal win condition information, but I forgot to sign in first, so it's uncredited. [[User:LokiClock|Loki Clock]] ([[User talk:LokiClock|talk]]) 16:56, 1 February 2008 (UTC)


I copied all the details in the Cone logic picture (sensor=keyboard, etc.) but when I pressed PKEY, the cone just uncontrollably stumble to the ledge in front of (before I even pressed a key) it that pressing a control key will topple it to the abyss, and stop on the ledge. How I can fix this? Any help will be appreciated. [[Special:Contributions/202.153.251.2|202.153.251.2]] ([[User talk:202.153.251.2|talk]]) 22:42, 31 March 2008 (UTC) 
:ANSWER: Solved the problem myself. Move the gravity center to the cone. [[Special:Contributions/202.153.251.2|202.153.251.2]] ([[User talk:202.153.251.2|talk]]) 00:36, 6 April 2008 (UTC)


Whenever i test the scene, the cone bounces off the maze, how do i fix this?

In Blender 2.49 there's no button for Dynamic, it now appears in the drop down list along with Rigid Body. How do I select both, or do I even need to?


== Testing ==

**I had different problem when following this part of the tutorial.  I have done the tutorial several times to make sure I haven't skipped a step.  Anyway when I got to test the maze/game my &quot;cone character&quot; keeps floating off the map.  ****Do you know of any reason this may happen or how to corret it?****

==Barrier==

the barrier cubes keep repelling away from one another, how do I fix this? when I make the radius smaller the bricks sort of merge together.

Also a big problem I had was that the restarting cube wouldn't work for otherlevels, I found that you solve this by changing all materials on all your protagonists to coneMat

:About the barrier cube, do you have the bounds set to box?  If you don't set the bounds, the default shape is sphere, which poses problems for emulating cubes.  About the new levels: I forgot that making a full copy also makes a copy of materials, etc rather than just using the old datablock (i.e. A material named coneMat would, in a full copy, be replaced with one called coneMat.001).  So this is an annoying problem that can be circumvented.  However, the only way I can think of right now is to just make an empty new scene, then select everything and CTRL LKEY and select the new scene.  This will link everything to the other scene, basically duplicating the objects to the next level.  You have to UKEY 2 to make these objects actually on the scene, rather than just linked.  This should work, and materials will be shared between levels.--[[User:Malaz|Malaz]] ([[User talk:Malaz|talk]]) 18:56, 26 March 2008 (UTC)

All the obstacle blocks flew off before I even touched them. It's like someone put a dynamite there. Any help? [[Special:Contributions/202.153.251.2|202.153.251.2]] ([[User talk:202.153.251.2|talk]]) 01:24, 6 April 2008 (UTC)

:When this happens, it means that the objects are intersecting--you made the objects inside each other, or with their boundaries touching.  Your roblem is basically the same as the previous, except to a greater degree.  Your objects may be too large, may not be box-boundaries, or might have been created intersecting.  See the previous answer; it should fix your problems.--[[User:Malaz|Malaz]] ([[User talk:Malaz|talk]]) 15:24, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

== Raised levels ==
You really don't go into how to make those, if you were planning to then that would help because when I try to raise a section that is touching a corner the corner it touches rises in a weird way.

== Levels and multiple goals ==
I was wondering how I would force the player to get one object before the other one...


Just my note about this section:
    * Sensor: Message, goalget
    * Controller: And
    * Actuator: Property, Add, wincon, -1

    * Sensor: Property, Equal, wincon, 0
    * Controller: And
    * Actuator: Scene, Set Scene, Scene.001 (or whatever you named your level 2)

As I understood the tutorial, these would be placed in the cube surrounding the maze. It SHOULD be put in the goal box.



Adding Scene:

Whenever I add a new scene my first scene is all black when I play the game. At first I thought I was messing something up with the logics page (I was attempting the new level part of the tutorial), but just simply adding a scene creates the problem.  What am I doing wrong?

== Mist ==
&lt;s&gt;Erm, I think I'm also having problems with the bit that has been crossed-out in the tutorial... My game engine isn't rendering the background, not to mention the mist, the &quot;use blender materials&quot; option was checked and the Blender version is 2.46. Any help would be appreciated.&lt;/s&gt; [[Special:Contributions/129.67.86.247|129.67.86.247]] ([[User talk:129.67.86.247|talk]]) 16:02, 8 June 2008 (UTC) --Sorry, problem solved... Reminded the importance of ALT Z...

I added the mist and my game has stopped working. I haven't added any new objects, just changed the mist settings and now I can't see anything when I start the game. I am using 2.48a and I have made sure I am in texture mode and perspective mode. Turning the mist off did not help. The only other thing I did was apply a material to the maze.
(update) This actually seems to be a problem with the display, if I close Blender and re-open the file it works again. I have an ATI card

== Maze moving away from camera ==

Whenever i go to test the game the controls work fine but the maze and character keeps moving away from the camera until they disappear
----
If it is going down, it might be because you made the maze an &quot;actor&quot; in the logic, so it is bing pulled down by gravity. --The Fist

== Barrier Fall Through ==

The blocks in my barriers keep falling through the maze. The logic settings are actor, dynamic, rigid body, mass .5, bounds, box, compound (selected by default). I'm in blender version 2.46. For the record, I did not use the exact size settings in the tutorial but they are similar sized. Could this be a problem. Does anyone know how to fix this? Any help would be appreciated.

== CAMERA NOT FOLLOWING ==

The camera does not follow the protagonist when I parent it to the protagonist and follow all of the requirments

Make sure you set the camera to parent of the protagonist(ctrl+P). you can do this by click on the camera then shift+clicking on the prtagonist then pressing (ctrl+P)

i have done those steps but nothing seems to work, any idea why this might be happening?

== Missing Step ==

I'm working in 2.49b, and I found that if I followed the tutorial to the letter, my cone would collide with every edge in the grid that I made the maze out of. To fix this, I just has to turn on Convex Hull Bounds on the maze just like you do on the cone. I wasn't sure if this was a problem with just my version or if I made some mistake along the way, but I figured I'd post it in the discussion in case someone else had the same problem.
Edit: I tested this again, and the cone wouldn't fall in between the maze paths; it would only fall when it went off the edge of the entire object that made up the maze. I fixed this by changing the Bounds from Convex Hull you Triangle Mesh. The tutorial should really have this step, but I could be wrong again. I don't want to add the step in myself without someone else's feedback. [[User:Jdwolfears|Jdwolfears]] ([[User talk:Jdwolfears|talk]]) 21:21, 24 May 2010 (UTC)

And I WAS wrong again. I have the same collision issues that I started with. Maybe someone with a bit more experience can give a better fix? This tutorial should really be updated to work with the most current stable version. [[User:Jdwolfears|Jdwolfears]] ([[User talk:Jdwolfears|talk]]) 15:58, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

== Friction ==

Hi, I've followed every step of this tutorial.
Unfortunately, the movement of the cone are very difficul to make, because he hasn't any friction on the maze.
I don't know how to explain it... When I press &quot;W&quot; the cone go like the maze is made of ice. It takes much spaces to stop, making game frustating.

How can I fix it?

== Shape falls through maze ==

I went through this tutorial as best I could, but when I push &quot;P&quot;, the cube falls through the maze. Could it be because I'm using Blender 2.37?
Any help would be appreciated.--[[User:Thekmc|Thekmc]] ([[User talk:Thekmc|talk]]) 16:41, 27 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Sample XML Schema */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
In learning any modelling language, it is helpful to see sample instances of any formal model. This is equally true when developing an XML Schema. XML Development tools like Oxygen and XML-Spy have tools to generate a random instance of a supplied XML schema, but it is useful to have a web service to do this.  The service can also be used for test data generation.

The following is a test XML Schema file:

== Sample XML Schema ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;
    attributeFormDefault=&quot;unqualified&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Root&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
            &lt;xs:documentation&gt;Any&lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
        &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
        &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
            &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
                &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Any&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Any&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
                        &lt;xs:all&gt;
                           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;AnyA&quot;/&gt;
                            &lt;xs:element name=&quot;AnyB&quot;/&gt;
                           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;AnyC&quot;/&gt;            
                         &lt;/xs:all&gt;                       
                    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
                &lt;/xs:element&gt;
                &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Multiple&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
                        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
                            &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Choice&quot;&gt;
                                &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
                                    &lt;xs:choice&gt;
                                        &lt;xs:element name=&quot;First&quot;&gt;
                                            &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
                                                &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;AttributeInt&quot; type=&quot;xs:integer&quot;/&gt;

                                            &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
                                        &lt;/xs:element&gt;

                                    &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
                                &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
                            &lt;/xs:element&gt;
                            &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Unbounded&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot;/&gt;
                            &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;Ref&quot;/&gt;
                            &lt;xs:element name=&quot;WithRefType&quot; type=&quot;RefType&quot;/&gt;
                            &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Optional&quot; minOccurs=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;

        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;

&lt;/xs:schema&gt;



&lt;/source&gt;

== XQuery to convert Simple XML Schema into an Instance Document ==
We can use a recursive function to convert this XML Schema into an instance document.  Here is an implementation of this function which covers some of the key XML Schema constructs:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace xs = &quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;;
declare function local:process-element($element as node())  {
     typeswitch ($element)
        case  element(xs:complexType)   return 
              for $sub-element in  $element/*
                 return  local:process-element($sub-element)

        case element(xs:annotation) return
                ()
        case element(xs:element)   return
               let $min := ($element/@minOccurs,1)[1]
               let $max := 
                     if ($element/@maxOccurs = &quot;unbounded&quot;) 
                     then 10
                     else ($element/@maxOccurs,1)[1]
               let $count := $min +  round(math:random() * ($max - $min))
               return 
                  if ($count  &gt;0 )
                  then 
                      for $i in 1 to $count
                      return
                         if ($element/@ref)  
                         then 
                              local:process-element(root($element)/xs:schema/xs:element[@name=$element/@ref])
                         else 
                         if (root($element)/xs:schema/xs:complexType[@name=$element/@type]) 
                         then 
                             element {$element/@name} {                           
                                   local:process-element(root($element)/xs:schema/xs:complexType[@name=$element/@type])
                             }
                         else 
                         element {$element/@name} {                      
                             if  ($element/*)
                             then for $sub-element in $element/*
                                     return local:process-element($sub-element)
                             else  local:process-type(($element/@type,&quot;xs:string&quot;)[1])  
                          
                      }
                    else ()
           case element(xs:attribute)   return

           case  element(xs:sequence)   return
                 for $sub-element in $element/*

          default return
                   ()
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This function uses the '''element''' construct to create a new XML instance tree based on the information in the XML Schema file and the '''typeswitch''' construct to select the appropriate processing of a given element type.

== Type Instance Generation ==
Some helper functions are required to generate random instances of (some of ) the standard types.  


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

declare function local:pad($string as xs:string, $char as xs:string, $max as xs:integer) as xs:string {
   concat(string-pad($char,$max - string-length($string)), $string)
};

declare function local:pad2($string) {
   local:pad($string,&quot;0&quot;,2)
};

declare function local:process-type($name )   {
(: just simple types - xs namespace :)
   if ($name = (&quot;xs:string&quot;,&quot;xs:NMTOKEN&quot;,&quot;xs:NCName&quot;))
   then  string-join(
              for $c  in  1 to  math:random() * 12
              return (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;D&quot;)[ceiling(math:random() * 4)]
             , &quot;&quot;)
   else if ($name=&quot;xs:integer&quot;)
   then  round(math:random()*100)
   else if ($name=&quot;xs:decimal&quot;)
   then math:random() * 100 - 50   
   else  if ($name=&quot;xs:boolean&quot;)
   then (&quot;true&quot;,&quot;false&quot;)[ ceiling( math:random() *2)]
   else if ($name=&quot;xs:date&quot;)
   then string-join((1990 + round(math:random() * 20), 
                    local:pad2(ceiling(math:random()*12)) , 
                    local:pad2(ceiling(math:random()*30))),&quot;-&quot;)
   else if ($name=&quot;xs:time&quot;)
   then string-join((local:pad2(floor(math:random() * 24)), 
                     local:pad2(floor(math:random()*60)) , 
                     local:pad2(floor(math:random()*60))),&quot;:&quot;)
   else if ($name=&quot;xs:dateTime&quot;)
   then concat (
          string-join((1990 + round(math:random() * 20), 
                       local:pad2(ceiling(math:random()*12)) , 
                       local:pad2(ceiling(math:random()*30))),&quot;-&quot;),
           &quot;T&quot;,
           string-join((local:pad2(floor(math:random() * 24)),
                        local:pad2(floor(math:random()*60)) , 
                        local:pad2(floor(math:random()*60))),&quot;:&quot;)
           )
   else ()
};


&lt;/source&gt;


==  Script ==
Here is a basic script which applies this function to the example schema.  By default, the root of the generated instance is the first element in the schema or a named element if a root parameter is supplied.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $file := request:get-parameter(&quot;file&quot;,())
let $root := request:get-parameter(&quot;root&quot;,())
let $schema :=  doc($file)
return 
  if ($root)
  then  local:process-element($schema/xs:schema/xs:element[@name=$root])  
  else  local:process-element($schema/xs:schema/xs:element[1])  
 
 
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi!! My name is Nicole Reinersmann.  I am a Senior here at Clarion and I am studying Psychology. I am going to graduate in December =) I hope to go into Family Counseling after I attend grad school.  I am from the Pittsburgh area.  I live in Plum which most of you have never heard of but it is about 20 minutes away from Pittsburgh.  This class was required for my major and  I am kind of nervous about it because I never took Physics in high school and I just do not know what to expect.  It does seem interesting and I hope to get a lot  out of class.</text>

== Modern Standard Arabic/Classical Arabic usage ==

I like the Modern Standard Arabic and I prefer to learn and to use it vs dialects. Can you please advise where standard Arabic used in speech? I hear it in the local community news in Australia and on Al-Jazeera TV. Are there any entertainment programs, movies or cartoons in Fuṣḥa or is it only used in very formal and official situations?
On the dropped endings section: I listened to TV and radio in MSA and noticed that endings are  always (?) dropped, although the speakers speak in MSA. Are the case endings reserved for Qur'an recitals only nowadays? My Arabic is still primitive but I think I could tell that endings are hardly used in the news by reporters.--[[User:Atitarev|Atitarev]] ([[User talk:Atitarev|talk]]) 23:33, 17 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Understanding Scientific Terms}}
==Lesson 0 - Why learn Greek and Latin Word roots?==

Scientific, Engineering and Technical terms are often long, complicated words that can be confusing. But first, let us distinguish those familiar (but often confused) terms: 
* ''Science'', means to study or know (literally to cut open) academically - often in a university research department
* ''Engineering'' means ingenious, that is talented and practical, a blend of science and technology mostly occurring only one time, 'in the field'
* ''Technology'' means to use skilfully - literally to treat or practice knowledge - a process often repeated, often in a laboratory or factory


Many people become anxious and unable to verbalize ('word blind') when they meet new, complicated terms such as '''electromyogram '''. 

'''''Don't Panic! ''''' Instead, ''eat your elephant one spoonful at a time'' - that means: build an understanding of the ''etymology'' or origin  of words, and how to break them into component parts (prefix-root-suffix), &lt;br&gt;Scientific, engineering and technical terms need not be fearful even if you have never seen them before. &lt;br&gt;It is not really necessary to learn classical languages - just remember to check the word in [[:wikt:Main Page| Wictionary]] and try to remember its ''structure''! 

for example ''Electromyogram'' is made up of three word roots.

:''electr/o'': having to do with electricity.
:''my/o''   : muscle
:''-gram'' : a record or result

An ''electromyogram'' is a device that 'writes' a record of the electrical activity of a muscle, but an ''electromyograph''. 
'graphically' shows what is happening. A related word is ''meter'' which simply means 'to measure' (or sometimes as a noun, a length defined by the [[:w:International_Organization_for_Standardization |International Organization for Standardization]] or ISO)

Scientific terms are mostly made of Greek, Latin, or both mixed together, but sometimes borrowed from other languages too. 

An understanding of even a few principles can go a long way in making science classes easier. &lt;br&gt;Some are very common! For example here are some common initial or prefix terms:

* '''pre''' (before - as in prehistoric) and '''post''' after for example, after completing a message, one may finally 'post' (send) it!
*'''hyper''' superior or big as in hypermarket) and '''hypo''' (under or inferior as in hypodermic syringe - which doctors insert under the skin (epidermis is  outer + skin (that is visible)
* '''epi''' (near as in epicentre) and '''a, ap or apo''' (away as in apology - away from logic)


'''''Why?''''' Originally, the '''roots''' of  'Arts and Sciences' developed in ancient Greece and were spread by the Roman empire (during the bronze and iron ages).  

The classical languages (Latin and Greek)  continued to be used until not so long ago, (about the 18th or 19th century). In fact, even in the twentieth century a formal description of a new plant species was required to be written in Latin (probably so that 'experts' could confuse the public and charge more for their services). 

Thus many technical terms were constructed from other words long ago using these classical languages before English became dominant in the second half of the 20th century, and once established, we are stuck with them forever!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi! :)  Im Jessy, and I am currently a sophemore at Clarion University.  I am majoring in CSD (Communication Science Disorders) hoping to be a Speech Language Pathologist.  I took this course because to fill my science requirement, and I didn't expect it to be so much about physics.  I can say that physics in general does not excite me.  I took the class in high school and my teacher was TERRIBLE, so hopefully this time it will be better.  I am open to learning new things and hopefully this class changes my opinion on physics.</text>

[[Image:Gabbyadams1.jpg]]

My name is Gabrielle Adams i'm 20 years old and a Sophmore at Clarion University. I'm originally from New Castle, Pennsylvania which is a small town about 45 minutes north of Pittsburgh. My current major is undecided business, but that will soon change to Computer Science. I have always liked working with computers and right now I am taking classes to help me get more familiar with them. Im a pretty easy going person but I tend to get irritated a lot when I am under stress. I'm an animal lover and think PETA is an amazing organization. I think animal cruelty is a major issue in society that a lot of people seem to ignore. Sometimes I think I like animals better than people. People can be so cruel. I wouldn't really consider myself an athlete but I like to work out and play tennis. One of my favorite things to do is relax and take naps. 
I think this Physical Science course will help me a lot in many ways. I'm a pretty good listener but I'm the type of person that needs to be walked through step by step in order to understand a problem. Math is my weakest subject, but I think practicing will help me through this course. I'm looking forward to learning how to understand the word problems since a lot of math is used. I don't really know that much about Physics so i'm hoping this course will enlighten me and help me learn new things!

=Goals=
My future goals include graduating from college and getting a degree possibly in computer science. I want to find a good job and start a family. I'm hoping to be able to live comfortably and be able to support my family. I also want to make a contribution to different organizations for world hunger and animal rights. I think people take life for granted and don't really realize that we have it so easy when people especially children in other countries have nothing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, my name is Sean and I am a junior at Clarion. I am an Elementary Education major with a concentration in coaching. I am very easily entertained so I have a lot of interests. I am a fairly outgoing person and I love spending time with my family and friends. I have a very close group of friends and next to my family they are definitely the most important thing to me. 
As far as science goes, I have never really been the biggest fan. So far I have had Earth Science and Biology at Clarion. Prior to college, though, my last science course was Physics my junior year of highschool. Out of all science courses, Physics is probably my favorite due to the mathematics aspect of it. I have always been better at math than other subjects. So overall, I wouldn't necessarily say that I would take PH112 if it was not required for my major, but I am definitely not dreading it either.</text>

== In the Beginning ==

Welcome to my initial test book on wikibooks.  I am just learning about this, so I'm playing, hopefully, in my own account.

== What I Hope to Do ==

I am considering using wikibooks as a platform for collaboratively developing an introductory textbook on information systems suitable for graduate students in the field of library and information science.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Amber McMillen.

I'm a junior studying psychology. 

I also have a 4 year old daughter. 

I took this course because I am interested in quantum physics, physics in general, and of course, astronomy. I love to learn how things work (i.e. how our bodies work, how we move through space, how our brain controls everything we do, etc.). I took this class to hopefully gain an understanding of some of these things. 

I would be a student forever if I could so I think it is important to keep learning even after school. Not surprisingly I love to read nonfiction books.

The end.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hola compadres, Yo soy Querida.  I am a non-traditional student, although I fit in pretty well with the &quot;traditional students!&quot;  I am an Elementary Education major, concentration in Social Sciences.  Currently, I am a junior at Clarion University, and more than exicited to graduate in the upcoming year.

I am currently taking Physical Science: Physics and Astronomy.  I had Physics in high school my 12th grade year...didn't do too well in it.  I never was interested much in science, but for some reason I did enjoy the class, more than usual.  The mathematical part of it was difficult for me to grasp, but I enjoyed the lab part of it.  Now I seem to be taking it again, this time it is a required course...so I hope to do the best I can.  That's it for now, ADIOS!!!!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[MediaWiki:Gadget-twinklespeedy.js|Twinkle Speedy]]''', still in [[w:Software release life cycle|beta]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mike.lifeguard/Twinkle Speedy documentation|bugs]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, is a script that [[Special:ListUsers/sysop|administrators]], [[Special:ListUsers/editor|editors]] and [[Special:ListUsers/rollbacker|rolbackers]] may use to help make [[WB:NPP|new page patrolling]] and related tasks easier. This script tags pages, and notifies users as required for many of the most common things you'll need templates for while patrolling using the familiar [[w:WP:TW|Twinkle]] interface. The script cannot be used unless you have the appropriate rights; the script will probably fail in [[w:Internet Explorer|Internet Explorer]], has been tested in [[w:Firefox|Firefox]], and may work in [[w:Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[w:Camino|Camino]], [[w:Google Chrome|Google Chrome]], and [[w:Safari (web browser)|Safari]].
[[Image:Police man Twinkle Head.svg|200px|right|Mr. Twinkly]]
This script allows tagging for [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deletion]], [[WB:DP#Votes for deletion|VFD]], [[WB:COPYVIO|copyvio]], [[WB:NLD|no license info]], [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Image namespace#Cleanup|NowCommons]], and more. As well, the script will leave a message on the user's talk page when a standard template message exists.

'''As with [[w:WP:TW|the original Twinkle script]], ''all edits made are your responsibility regardless of bugs in the script''.''' If that scares you, then wait until there are no more bugs. If you or the script make mistakes, clean them up; it's not the end of the world. But if you're recklessly making a big mess, and I see it, you'll probably have your access to this script [[Special:Blockip|removed]] by [[User:Mike.lifeguard|me]]. Also, the tooltips are not policy - you're responsible for knowing what [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Wikibooks policies and guidelines]] are, and following them.

==What does the script do?==
Allows you to speedily tag for &lt;s&gt;deletion&lt;/s&gt; ''many things'' (below), and notify users on their talk page as required.

This script is considered mostly stable, but still in development. It will likely be [[w:Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]] in perpetuity. Bug reports and feature requests can be listed [[User talk:Mike.lifeguard/Twinkle Speedy documentation|here]].

===Installation===
{{info|The easiest way to install this script is through [[Special:Preferences|''my preferences'']] (''Gadgets'' tab) - check off the box for Twinkle Speedy and click ''save''.}}
;Beta Version (mostly stable)
:This will become a Gadgets option at some point in the future when bugs are gone and expansion of functionality is complete. For now, you may add the following lines to your [[Special:Mypage/monobook.js|monobook.js]] to use the semi-stable version:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
import_script('MediaWiki:Gadget-morebits.js');
import_script('MediaWiki:Gadget-twinklespeedy.js');
&lt;/source&gt;

===Tag-only, don't delete===
[[Image:Twinkle1.png|thumb|400px|The red rectangle indicates the three main settings. The first is ''Tag only, don't delete'' which is checked by default to keep admins from deleting. The script will fail if non-admins try to use the script with this box unchecked. The second is ''Orphan backlinks'', which is unchecked by default. This is currently buggy, and shouldn't be used. The third option is ''Notify if possible'', which is checked by default. This will leave the appropriate template message on the relevant user's talk page. If there is no template message for the option you've selected, this will have no effect. When tagging many pages or images of a single user, please uncheck this to avoid flooding their talk page. The green rectangle indicates options available for all pages. The purple arrow indicates an option available only in the userspace.]]
Admins should be careful to note whether the ''&quot;tag page only, don't delete&quot;'' box is checked, as the options do different things based on this. You will get incorrect behaviour if you're not paying attention. The box is checked by default so you won't delete pages by accident. You'll have to remove the safety if you want to use the big gun.

Note that not all of these options apply to [[Wikibooks:New page patrol|new page patrol]], but are included here for convenience.

===Notifying/warning users===
Please be careful with this checkbox. When enabled, it will notify users when appropriate. If you're tagging many pages or images by the same user, please disable it after the first one so that they're not inundated with template messages. Instead leave them a note that &quot;this applies to all your uploads.&quot; You can only notify the user for these cases; all other cases must be done manually.

====Templates used====
If you have never seen or used these templates, please familiarize yourself with policy, and read the templates in their entirety before using them.

Users will be notified when using the following options: 
*{{tlx|vfd}} &amp;rarr; {{tlxs|Vfd warning|''Page''|&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
*{{tlx|query}} &amp;rarr; {{tlxs|Query notice|''Page''|&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
*{{tlx|copyvio}} &amp;rarr; {{tlxs|Nothanks|''Page''|&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
*{{tlxs|nld}} &amp;rarr; {{tlxs|Image copyright|''Image''|&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
*{{tlxs|nfur}} &amp;rarr; {{tlxs|Image fairuse|''Image''|&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
*{{tlxs|bfu}} &amp;rarr; {{tlxs|Image badfairuse|''Image''|&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
*{{tlx|split}}
*{{tlx|cleanup-nc}}
*{{tlx|transwiki|''WikiWiki''}}

===Orphan backlinks===
:''This feature is currently buggy; I advise you not to use it for now''
This allows you to unlink the page from other pages in the main namespace. The script will orphan backlinks when on the following options:
*Nonsense, spam or vandalism pages
*Copyright violations (text or images)
*Foreign language content
*Pages with no content
*Corrupt images
*Images with no license information (these images shouldn't be used until this info is provided)
*Fair use images with no rationale (these images shouldn't be used until this info is provided)
*Images with a bad license (these images shouldn't be used until this info is provided)

==Tagging and deleting==
Admins are reminded that each radio button does a different thing based on whether the ''Tag-only'' box is checked or not. In essence, the ''Tag-only'' is for the beginning of a process, and disabling it (to enable deletion) is for the end of a process. For [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deletion]], where the start and end are the same if you're an admin (just delete it) then you're welcome to go ahead with ''Tag-only'' off and delete.

===Image options===

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Jeremy Womer and I am a junior at Clarion University. I am an elementary education major with a minor in coaching. 

Baseball is my major interest.  I am interested in how thingis in sports are done according to science.  THis is where physical science comes into play.  There is physical science in everything in baseball.  This is from swing a bat and connecting with the ball, to running the bases and sliding in safely. Physical science is all around us in the world and I find it interesting to be able to understand this everyday events.

Being a baseball player and a student of the game I am able to make my performance better after understanding the concepts behind what i am actually doing.  

I myself am also a future educator and this is an area that i will have to be able to present to my students.  I find that most students find physical science interesting when it is presented in a way that can be related to their everyday lives.  When things that are being taught can have a practical use, students are more likely to have an interest and learn the material better.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:malaysia11.gif]] --&gt;

[[w:Malaysia|Malaysia]] is situated in the Southeastern Asia, peninsula bordering Thailand and northern one-third of the island of Borneo, bordering Indonesia, Brunei, and the South China 
Sea, south of Vietnam. Malaysia is knows as a multiethnic society: among a total population of 24,821,286, 67.5% are comprised of Malay and indigenous, 23.7% Chinese, 7.1% Indian and 7.8 others. Also, Malaysia is a multilingual society where Malaysia, English, Chinese, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Panjabi, Thai and many other minority languages are spoken. 
Open distance education in Malaysia has been rapidly developed because of the government attempt in establishing information-rich society and a knowledge-based economy in recent years. Thanks to the advancement of networking technologies, ODE courses and programs have continued to grow in local higher education centers. 
Distance education in Malaysia started off with correspondence schools Private institutions like Stanford College, Raffles College, Malaysian Correspondence College, Adabi College and Federal College offered correspondence courses. Some of these continue to operate up to now.

==Malaysia's country profile==

===Education===
In Malaysia, basic education consists of at least nine years:
six years primary (ages 7-12) and three years lower secondary (ages 13-15). Then there are two years upper secondary (ages 16-17) and two years post-secondary (ages 17-18) before continuing at tertiary level. There are three types of primary schools: the national schools using Malay, the national-type Chinese schools using Chinese language, and the national-type Tamil school using Tamil language as the medium of instruction. For all secondary to tertiary education, the language of instruction is Malay. 

In upper secondary education, the students are classified into academic, technical or vocational schools. At the post-secondary level, students have several options; they can choose to enter matriculation or sixth form classes, enter teacher training colleges, apply for certificate/diploma programs in polytechnics/universities, or they may join the workforce (Saleh, 1998: 46). 

Today the Malaysian education system is a successful one, responding to the demands for equity among the different ethnic groups as well as the needs of a rapidly developing economy.

==Distance Education in Malaysia==

Open and distanc learning consists of a flexible learning phrase in which the learner is in charge of his or her own learning and development. It not only tries to remove barriers that prevent attendance, but it also suggests a learner-centered philosophy.
One reason for the advancement of open and distance education in Malaysia is the perceived inequality in opportunities for higher eduation between working adults and full-time university students.When the National University of Science Malaysia (USM) was set up in 1969, it was conferred the unique distiction of offering courses for part-time students, besides peroviding courses for regular on-campus students. When USM pioneered distance education in the country in 1971, few Malaysians took advantage of this mode of learning.


Today, after 36 years, interest in distance learning has grown and its use has expanded in Malaysia. To establish socio-economical credibility, programmes offered through the distance education mode are similar to those available in the formal public university education system. However, course delivery, is tailored to suit the demands of the home-based learner.


In 1999, a new private university, Open University Malaysia (OUM), was established to co-ordinate the open and distance learning programmes of all 11 local public universities in the country.

Such developments are partly in recognition of the need to provide greater opportunity for more adult students to pursue programmes of study leading to the award of an appropriate qualification of their choice. Using the growth rate of student enrolment in Malaysia as an indication, educational growth inspired by distance education has been significant (Dhanarajan, 1990).

==School Profile of Open University Malaysia (OUM)==

[[w:Open University Malaysia|Open University Malaysia]] (OU Malaysia) was established in August 2000 under the Private Higher Education Act 1996. OUM is the largest Open and Distance Learning institution in Malaysia with over 50,000 students. By 2010, the Open University of Malaysia (OUM) intends to achieve the status of a mega university with an enrolment of more than 100,000 students. 

OUM are currently offering all degree programmes via the hybrid and blended mode, respectively. Each icorporates the use of eLearning. Learners study from home and attend tutorials at learning centers in over 36 locations throughout the nation. 
Fore more details, visit [http://www.oum.edu.my/portal/index.php?op=view&amp;m=12&amp;page=69]


In addition, a growing number of public and private universities throughout the nation are employing eLearning methodologies either to offer academic programmes via distance or to support their full-time on-campus learnes (OUM, 2004). Currently, there are 11 public universities, 4 university colleges, 18 private universities and over 600 private colleges in the country. With the increase in the demand for higher education, many institutions in Malaysia have planned for eLerning.

OUM is set to create opportunities for Malaysians to fulfill their academic aspirations through our “education for all” concept, backed by the 11 public universities in the country.

OUM’s idea is to be a leader and innovator in open learning as follows:

:* To be the leading contributor in democratizing education 

:* To develop quality education through multi mode learning technologies 

:* To develop and enhance learning experiences toward the development of a knowledge-based society 

The learning methodology consists of self-managed learning, online learning, and face-to-face interaction. 

OUM now has 53 Learning Centers throughout Malaysia. The Learning Centers are managed by team of administrators. OUM’s Learning Centers are fully equipped with tutorial rooms, computer laboratories, library and Internet facilities as part of the learning environment infrastructure. 


===Objective of OUM===
The main objective for the establishment of OUM is to democratize education, by which education should be made accessible and available to all.They are offering a second chance to people from various jobs to pursue an academic qualification.

:* To be the leading contributor in democratising education 

:* To develop quality education through multimode learning technologies 

:* To develop and enhance learning experiences towards the development of a knowledge-based society 



===Methodology &amp; Use of Media===
Malaysia has a good communication infrastructure for distance education in terms of print materials, radio and television broadcasts, telephone, postal services and telecommunications. 

Regarding teaching and learning, the OUM utilises the blended approach that combines printed learning materials as the main learning resource supplemented by face-to-face interactions at regional centres and online learning through specially designed the Learning Management System (self-managed learning).

The three key areas of OUM: 

:*Learning Management System (myLMS, myMail, myProfile, myLibrary, and Learner Conexxions) 

:* Open &amp; Distance Learning Pedagogy Centre 

:* Centre for Quality Management and Research &amp; Innovation 

An online LMS called myLMS is a supplementary mechanism. As a virtual classroom, learners are using myLMS. They can download reading resources and involve in a synchronous (chat) and asynchronous forum. As the asynchronous forum, crucial discussion topics are posed and discussed in a MUST discussion forum. As another way of online technology, E-testing is used to improve effectiveness and efficiency in ODL (Jung, 2005). 

For more details, visit[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_University_Malaysia#e-Learning_Methodology_and_Tools]

==Impacts of OUM==

The distance mode provides opportunity to all those who are unable to pursue their higher education through traditional system by widening access to higher education. It is argued that the distance educational system has an upper hand to traditional education system because it allows educationists to reach a wider student audience, meet the needs of students who are unable to attend classes, link students from different social, cultural and experiential background, allow self-paced learning, provide innovative and flexible cost-effective education and provide learning materials that are self-explanatory, user friendly and appropriate for target group. 

Education plays a crucial role in developing human capital and becomes a critical success factor in shifting the economy towards a k-based economy. Education increases the knowledge, skills and competencies of individual workers, allowing them to accomplish particular tasks better and to adapt more easily to changing job requirements. 

Since OUM has an enrollment exceeding 50,000, OUM serves as a very important opportunity to increase knowledge among the Malaysian workforce. OUM has not only been worth for the local population but also for attracting foreign students whose fees boost the economy. OUM also provides the ideas of hope that the country can achieve its goal of democratizing higher education, making it accessible to the majority of the people.

==Areas for Improvement==
Higher Education Institutions in Malaysia are still at an infancy stage in the planning and implementing of eLearning. These include institutional support, course development, teaching/learning, course structure, student support, faculty support, evaluation and assessment. 

1) A lack of a strategic plan for learning.

Planning of ICT for teaching and learning, course development, course structure and assessment is yet to be firmed. Some of the plans are still in the mind of the person responsible for managing the eLearning.


2)eLearning is sporadic. 

Initially in some Higher Education Institutions, the approach was to convert the face-to-face lecture materials to digital content, where the lecturers suddenly found themselves forced to be involved in the writing of lecture notes to be digitized for online access without the help of experienced instructional designers. Most of the materials were merely information which can be considered as content. Instructional Design for eLearning is still new in the country. 


2)eLearning leadership is new.

In most cases eLearning responsibility is given to the IT experts who are responsible t set up the infrastructure and to purchase or build and LMS. Education experts are often not consulted at the initial decision making stage. Thus, the approach to eLearning tends to be techbnocentric.


3)Lack of skills and experience among faculty members to use eLearning.

Involvements of academic staff in the development of eLearning vary from one institution to another. Developing courses by lecturers for on-line delivery is still an option in most insitutions. Lectures are often reluctant to embark on the development project themselves, due to time constraints and lack of expertise in courseware authoring (Raja Maznah, 200a).

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am an Junior at Clarion University[http://www.clarion.edu/]. I am going for my BFA in art, with a concentration in painting.


This semester I am enrolled in a Basic Physics and Astronomy course. In this course we are creating an online textbook called Introduction to Physical Science[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Physical_Science]. We will use this online textbook for the course and in creating our own questions and answers.

I have never previously taken a physics class before, this will be the first. I hope to learn a lot about it.</text>

===About Wikiversity===
Wikiversity is a [[w:en:Wiki|wiki-based]] [[m:Learning_community|learning community]]. Over at Wikiversity, you can utilize online courses and also create courses yourself. See  [[Wikiversity:Learning|how Wikiversity supports learning]].

Different [[Wikiversity:Vision|entry point]]s and [[Wikiversity:Alternative_Theory|rough theory]], as well as [[Wikiversity:Forms:Circle|example forms]] are also available.

===Discussing the Wikiversity===
For previous discussions see the [[m:Wikiversity|Meta page]] on Wikiversity. Since there is now a formal [[m:Wikiversity/Modified project proposal|proposal]] to set up Wikiversity as a [[m:Proposals_for_new_projects#Wikiversity proposal|new Wikimedia project]], try to keep discussions of Wikiversity's scope and goals centralized at Meta. In the future we might utilize a #wikiversity [[Internet_Relay_Chat|IRC channel]] as well. If you're interested, you could add your name to the [[Wikiversity:participants|participants list]], and see who else is involved.

===Wikiversity Core Courses===
One way of [[meta:Moving_Wikiversity_forward|moving Wikiversity forward]] is to create a set of core service courses that will meet the needs of existing Wikimedia projects. Since Wikibooks does not want to host Wikiversity, the [[wikicities:education:Wikiversity#Wikiversity_Core_Courses_Initiative|Wikiversity Core Courses]] are being developed at the education wikicity. Hopefully, there will be an actual  Wikiversity project with its own domain name in the near future.

===Experimental Learning Processes===
Join or create a debate and/or summarize its salient features at http://wikireason.net/wiki/Forum_Entrance.  Please note this is an external site with its own community, social norms, and legal requirements.  Please be  prudent and wise in paraphrasing, citing, and archival of results locally.  Content license requirements may conflict occasionally.  Alternatively, methods learned there may be useful within the context of some local learning process or free materials development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Read the [[Programming: BASIC: Beginning BASIC: Variables and Data Types|Variables and Data Types]] article before reading this one.

User Input is one of the most important aspects of programming concepts. Every program should have some sort of user interaction, from getting a character's name for a game to asking for a password to log into a database. This article will teach the basics of user input in the BASIC Programming Language. Please note that the following code may vary from compiler to compiler. (FreeBASIC Users: Do not use line numbers).

== Code ==
'''Example 1 (qBasic)'''
&lt;SOURCE lang=&quot;qbasic&quot;&gt;CLS
10 PRINT &quot;what is your name?&quot;
20 INPUT &quot;...(Enter Your Name)...&quot;, a$
30 PRINT
40 PRINT &quot;hello, &quot;; a$; &quot;, I am your computer, nice to meet you.&quot;
60 END&lt;/SOURCE&gt;

'''Example 2 (freeBasic)'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;freeBasic&quot;&gt;
10 Dim userInput As String
20 Input &quot;What is your name?&quot;, userInput
30 Print
40 Print &quot;Hello, &quot; ; userInput ; &quot;! I am your computer, nice to meet you.&quot;
50 Sleep
60 End
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;!--What does the comma do? --&gt;

== Explanation ==
'''Output'''
 What is your name?
 ...(Enter Your Name)...
 
 Hello, yourName, I am your computer, nice to meet you.

'''10:''' ''Dim userInput'' declares the variable ''userInput''. ''As String'' tells the compiler that ''userInput'' is a string (A collection of pure text, can include numbers and symbols, but is considered text).
&lt;br /&gt;
'''20:''' ''Input &quot;What is your name?&quot;'' prompts the user for their name. '' userInput'' OR '' a$'' tells the compiler to store the answer in the variable in ''userInput'' or ''a$''.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''30:''' Makes a blank line
&lt;br /&gt;
'''40:''' A normal ''Print'' statement, '';'' tells the compiler not to skip to the next line.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''50:''' ''Sleep'' makes the program wait for the user to press a key.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''60:''' The ending to all BASIC programs, signifies a termination of the program.

Over the course of the next month I will be reorganizing, perfecting everything and bringing it some synchronization. Some of these updates include changing all examples to one variant of Basic, as of now there is DarkBASIC qBASIC and freeBASIC examples floating around (I will be converting them all to freeBASIC, since it is free and commonly used).''

I have possibility to help you, but since im only 12 years old and im talking Estonian, it may be hard. I think, I have MEDIUM rank in Basic, I use Liberty Basic myself. I'm trying to create my own operationsystem(OS) into Windows, and it's only 5% built. About helping, needful?</text>

''Currently updating a forgotten project started by a source no longer working on it. Revamping everything to the same style and to FreeBasic. Will be working on for another month or so.''

== About Me ==
Heyas ^.^
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am Klemintine, or Klem.. Either works. I enjoy writing, programming, and talking in my free time and would die without my friends x.X

There is no greater joy in the world for me than helping others =] Except maybe the surprised comments that I get when they find out I am barely fourteen, Lol.

So yeah, I love to talk, ''(Golly gee, This is boring, I have to write about 5 'About Mes' a day -sighs-)''. So if you are ever bored just go down to my Contact area and just give me call (by Call I mean IM or eMail) &gt;.&lt;

I have been programming since the age of eight.. actually I will make a timeline so I don't have to type this all out ''Teehee''.

&lt;br /&gt;'''Age 8:''' Got into programming after deciding that I didn't like that fact that I had no idea what the computer was doing inside when I pressed a button. My uncle showed me Visual Basic which I gave up on after one week because I didn't like the drag and drop factor (And I had no idea what was happening that made the button when I dropped it on the screen.). I moved onto C++.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Age 9:''' I know the basics of C++ and programming concepts. I try out my hand on HTML 4.0 (xhtml was new/unpopular/nonexistent). I liked it. I stayed after school everyday making websites. I didn't like the formating and all the capitals and the incorrectly nested elements (I am a perfectionist, even at the age of nine). About a few months later xhtml became popular/in-existance and it was everything I thought HTML 4.0 should have been.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Age 10:''' What is this.. this wonderful program? Animations.. Programming.. Flash! Macromedia was my superhero, they made my favorite program. Flash MX 2004, it was love. (Actually Shigeru Miyamoto is my idol) I learned Actionscript 2.0 and stuck with Flash up until today, and still with it. After Flash 8 came out, I considered my self a RIA Web Developer.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Age 11:''' Made websites still, but went back to learn more about Desktop Programming and Game Programming Concepts. Learned Object-Oriented-Programming and was like &quot;OMG.. PROGRAMMING IS GOING TO BE MY BEST FRIEND! OOP IS FUN!&quot;.. well not really.. but, yeah xP
&lt;br /&gt;'''Age 12:''' Dude, teh PHP is awesome. I love PHP now.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Age 13:''' Game programming with Flash. PHP Studies continue. Hired to write tutorials.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Age 14:''' I am writing a programming concepts book that will be self published and also made into a PDF and will be offering online classes that go along with the book.

Hey, thanks for your repsonse. I fixed the page to be part of the BASIC book. An easy way to make things follow the naming convention from now on is instead of making your wikilinks from the table of content like &lt;nowiki&gt; [[this]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;, you can make them like &lt;nowiki&gt; [[/this/]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;, which makes a subpage from your current page with a title of &quot;this&quot;. The syntax used in the beginner section of the book, though, is more flexible for choosing names of the subpages (since you can change how the link appears without changing the name of the subpage). It's all a matter of preference. Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 14:30, 28 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

Historically, most of the early CPUs were built by attaching integrated circuits (ICs) to circuit boards and wiring them up.

Nowadays, it's much faster to design and implement a new CPU in a [[Microprocessor Design/FPGA| FPGA]] -- the result will probably run faster and use less power than anything spread out over multiple ICs.

However, some people still design and build CPUs the old-fashioned way.
Such a CPU is sometimes called a &quot;home brew CPU&quot; or a &quot;home built CPU&quot;.

Some people feel that physically constructing a CPU in this way, since it allows students to probe the inner workings of the CPU, it helps them &quot;Touch the magic&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;Touch the magic. By this I meant to gain a deeper understanding of how computers work&quot; -- Bill Buzbee
[http://www.homebrewcpu.com/]
&lt;/ref&gt;, helps them learn and understand the underlying electronics and hardware.

== Overview ==
[[Image:YUNTEN.gif|right|250px|thumb| An example of a homebrew PC, click to view larger version]]

{{Wikipedia | mnemonics}} {{Wikipedia | discrete logic}}
A homebrew CPU is a central processing unit constructed using a number of simple integrated circuits, usually from the [[Digital Circuits/7400 Series|7400 Series]]. When planning such a CPU, the designer must not only consider the hardware of the device but also the instructions the CPU will have, how they will operate, the bit patterns for each one, and their mnemonics. Before the existence of computer based circuit simulation many commercial processors from manufacturers such as Motorola were first constructed and tested using discrete logic.
Those commercial processors include
the Motorola 6800,&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;To evaluate the 6800 architecture while the chip was being designed, Jeff's team built an equivalent circuit using 451 small scale TTL ICs on five 10 by 10 inch (25 by 25 cm) circuit boards. Later they reduced this to 114 ICs on one board by using ROMs and MSI logic devices.&quot; -- [[w:Motorola_6800#Development_team]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
the Motorola 6809,{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}
and
the Hewlett-Packard PA-RISC TS1.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;The first implementation was
the TS1, a central processing unit built from discrete transistor-transistor logic (74F TTL) devices.&quot;
-- [[w:PA-RISC]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no limit exists on data bus sizes when constructing such a CPU, the number of components required to complete a design increases exponentially as bus size gets wider. Common physical data bus sizes are 1-bit, 4-bits, 8-bits, and 16-bits, although incomplete design documents exist for a 40-bit CPU.

A microcoded CPU may be able to present a significantly different instruction set to the application programmer than seems to be directly supported by the hardware used to implement it.
For example, the 68000 presented a 32-bit instruction set to the application programmer -- a 32-bit &quot;add&quot; was a single instruction -- even though internally it was implemented with 16-bit ALUs.

For example, [[w:serial computer]]s, even though they do calculations one bit per clock cycle, present a instruction set that deals with much wider words -- often 12 bits (PDP-14), 24 bits (D-17B), or even wider -- 39 bits (Elliott 803).


'''Notable Homebrew CPUs'''

The Magic-1 is a CPU with an 8-bit data bus and 16-bit address bus running at about &lt;s&gt;3.75MHz&lt;/s&gt; 4.09 Mhz.
[http://www.homebrewcpu.com/]

The Mark I FORTH also has a 8-bit data bus and 16-bit address bus, but runs at 1MHz.
[http://www.holmea.demon.co.uk/Mk1/Architecture.htm]

The V1648CPU is a CPU with a 16-bit data bus and 48-bit address bus that is currently being designed.
[http://ixeelectronics.com/Development/Chipset/CPU_Goals.html]

APOLLO181 is a homemade didactic 4-bit processor made of TTL logics and bipolar memories, based upon the Bugbook® I and II chips, in particular on the 74181 (by Gianluca.G, Italy, May 2012).

=== chips ===

==== bus ====

Practically all CPU designs include several 3-state buses -- an &quot;address bus&quot;, a &quot;data bus&quot;, and various internal buses.

A 3-state bus is functionally the same as a multiplexer.
However, there is no physical part you can point to and say &quot;that is the multiplexer&quot; in a 3-state bus; it's a pattern of activity shared among many parts.
The only reason to use a 3-state bus is when it requires fewer chips or fewer, shorter wires, compared to an equivalent multiplexer arrangement.
When you want to select between very few pieces of data that are close together, and most of that data is stored on a chip that only has 2-state outputs, it may require fewer chips and less wiring to use actual multiplexer chips.
When you want to select between many pieces of data (one of many registers, or one of many memory chips, etc.), or many of the chips holding that data already have 3-state outputs, it usually requires fewer chips to use a 3-state bus (even counting the &quot;extra&quot; 3-state buffer between the bus and each thing that doesn't already have 3-state outputs).

A typical register file connected to a 3-state 16-bit bus on a TTL CPU includes:
* octal 2-state output registers (such as 74x273), 2 chips per 16-bit register
* octal 3-state non-inverting buffers (such as 74x241), 2 chips per 16-bit register per bus
* a demultiplexer with N inputs (driven by microcode) and 2^N output wires that select the 3-state buffers of one of up to 2^N possible things that can drive the bus, 1 chip per bus.

Later we discuss a other shortcuts that may require fewer chips.

==== 74181 ====
Like many historically important commercial computers, many home-brew CPUs use some version of the 74181, the first complete ALU on a single chip.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;The 74181 is a bit slice arithmetic logic unit (ALU)... The first complete ALU on a single chip ... Many computer CPUs and subsystems were based on the '181, including ... the ... PDP-11 - Most popular minicomputer of all time&quot; --
[[Wikipedia:74181]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
(Versions of the 74181 include the 74F181, the 40181{{fact}}, the 74AS181, the 72LS181, the 74HCT181, etc.).
The 74181 is a 4-bit wide ALU can perform all the traditional add / subtract / decrement operations with or without carry, as well as AND / NAND, OR / NOR, XOR, and shift.

A typical home-brew CPU uses 4 of these 74181 chips to build an ALU that can handle 16 bits at once.
The simplest home-brew CPUs have only one ALU, which at different times is used to increment the program counter, do arithmetic on data, do logic operations on data, and calculate addresses from base+offset.

Some people who build TTL CPUs attempt to &quot;save chips&quot; by building that one ALU of less than the largest word size (which is often 16 bits in TTL computers).
For example, the earliest Data General Nova computers used a single 74181 and processed all data 4 bits at a time.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: Data General Nova#Processor design]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Unfortunately, this adds complexity elsewhere, and may actually increase the total number of chips needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;stewart&quot; &gt;
[http://cpuville.com/Main_2.htm &quot;My Home-Built TTL Computer Processor (CPU)&quot;] by Donn Stewart
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;The basic algorithm executed by the instruction execution unit is most easily expressed if a memory address fits exactly in a word.&quot; --
[http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/arch/risc/ &quot;The Ultimate RISC&quot;]
by Douglas W. Jones 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;it just really sucks if the largest datum you can manipulate is smaller than your address size. This means that the accumulator needs to be the same size as the PC -- 16-bits.&quot; -- 
[http://david.carybros.com/html/computer_architecture.html &quot;Computer Architecture&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest 16-bit TTL ALU wires the carry-out of each 74181 chip to the carry-in of the next,
creating a ripple-carry adder.

Historically, some version of the look ahead carry generator 74182 was used to speed up &quot;add&quot; and &quot;subtract&quot; to be about the same speed as the other ALU operations.

Historically, some people who built TTL CPUs put two or more independent ALU blocks in a single CPU -- a general-purpose ALU for data calculations, a PC incrementer, an index register incrementer/decrementer, a base+offset address adder, etc.

We discuss ripple-carry adders, look-ahead carry generators, and their effects on other parts of a CPU at
[[Microprocessor Design/Add and Subtract Blocks]].

==== alternatives to 74181 ====
Some people find that '181 chips are becoming hard to find.

Quite a few people building &quot;TTL CPUs&quot; use GAL chips (which can be erased and reprogrammed).
&lt;ref&gt;
Andrew Holme.
[http://www.holmea.demon.co.uk/Mk2/Architecture.htm &quot;Mark 2 FORTH Computer&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
A single GAL20V8 chip can replace a 74181 chip.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://sites.google.com/site/libby8dev/ga GALU - A Gate Array Logic based ALU IC.]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Often another GAL chip can replace 2 or 3 other TTL chips.

Other people building &quot;TTL CPUs&quot; find it more magical to build a programmable machine entirely out of discrete non-programmable chips.
Are there any reasonable alternatives to the '181 for building an ALU out of discrete chips?
The Magic-1 uses 74F381s and a 74F382 ALUs;&lt;ref&gt;
Bill Buzbee.
[http://www.homebrewcpu.com/microarchitecture.htm &quot;Magic-1 Microarchitecture&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;
is there any variant of the '381 and '382 chips that are any easier to find than a '181?
... the 74HC283, 74HCT283, MC14008 chips only add; they don't do AND, NAND, etc. ...

One could build the entire CPU -- including the ALU -- out of sufficient quantities of the 74153 multiplexer.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

One designer &quot;built-from-scratch&quot; a 4-bit ALU that does add, subtract, increment, decrement, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;xor&quot;, etc. -- roughly equivalent to the 4-bit 74181 -- out of about 14 simple TTL chips: 2-input XOR, AND, OR gates.&lt;ref&gt;
Rodney Moffitt.
[http://rod.info/MicroProgram Micro Programmed Arithmetic Processor].
55 TTL chips.
The core 4-bit adder/subtracter has about 7 SSI chips.
The ALU has about 7 additional SSI chips of logic around that core to support &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;xor&quot;, &quot;increment&quot;, &quot;decrement&quot;.
An instruction register and a micro-programmed sequencer around the ALU
handle (4-bit) &quot;multiply&quot; and &quot;divide&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another designer has posted a 8-bit ALU design that has more functionality than two 74181 chips
-- the 74181 can't shift right --
built from 14 complex TTL chips:
two 74283 4-bit adders, some 4:1 mux, and some 2:1 mux.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The designers of the LM3000 CPU posted an ALU design that has less functionality than the 74181.
The 8 bit &quot;ALU&quot; in the LM3000 can't actually do any logical operations, only &quot;add&quot; and &quot;subtract&quot;,
built from two 74LS283 4-bit adders and a few other chips.
Apparently those &quot;logical&quot; operations aren't really necessary.&lt;ref&gt;

==== solderless breadboard approach ====
Solderless breadboards are perhaps the fastest way to build experimental prototypes that involve lots of changes.

For about a decade, every student taking the 6.004 class at MIT was part of a team -- each team had one semester to design and build a simple 8 bit CPU out of 7400 series integrated circuits.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
These CPUs were built out of TTL chips plugged into several solderless breadboards connected with lots of 22 AWG (0.33 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) solid copper wires.&lt;ref&gt;

== Design Tips ==

There are many ways to categorize CPUs.
Each &quot;way to categorize&quot; represents a design question, and the various categories of that way represent various possible answers to that question that needs to be decided before the CPU implementation can be completed.

One way to categorize CPU that has a large impact on implementation is: &quot;How many memory cycles will I hold one instruction before fetching the next instruction?&quot;
* 0: load-instruction on every memory cycle (Harvard architecture)
* 1: At most 1 memory cycle between each load-instruction memory cycle ( load-store architecture )
* more: some instructions have 2 or more memory cycles between load-instruction memory cycles (memory-memory architecture)

Another way to categorize CPUs is &quot;Will my control lines be controlled by a flexible microprogramming, a fixed control store, or by hard-wired control decoder that directly decodes the instruction?&quot;

The load-store and memory-memory architectures require a &quot;instruction register&quot; (IR).
At the end of every instruction (and after coming out of reset), the next instruction is fetched from memory[PC] and stored into the instruction register, and from then on the information in the instruction register (directly or indirectly) controls everything that goes on in the CPU until the next instruction is stored in the instruction register.

For homebrew CPUs, the 2 most popular architectures are{{fact}}:
* direct-decode Harvard architecture
* flexible microprogramming that supports the possibility of memory-memory architecture.

Another way to categorize CPUs is &quot;How many sub-states are in a complete clock cycle?&quot;

Many textbooks imply that a CPU has only one clock signal --
a bunch of D flip-flops each hold 1 bit of the current state of the CPU, and
those flip-flops drive that state out their &quot;Q&quot; output.
Those flip-flops always hold their internal state constant, except
at the instant of the rising edge of the one and only clock,
where each flip-flop briefly &quot;glances&quot; at their &quot;D&quot; input and latches the new bit,
and shortly afterwards (when the new bit is different from the old bit)
changes the &quot;Q&quot; output to the new bit.

Single clock signals are nice in theory.
Alas, in practice we can never get the clock signal to every flip-flop precisely simultaneously --
there is always some clock skew (differences in propagation delay).
One way to avoid these timing issues is with a series of different clock signals.&lt;ref&gt;
Bill Buzbee.
[http://www.homebrewcpu.com/microarchitecture.htm#Clocks Magic-1 Homebrew CPU: Clocks]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Another way is to use enough power&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=3276&amp;p=14 &quot;Intel's Atom Architecture: The Journey Begins&quot;]
by Anand Lal Shimpi, 2008.
In a large microprocessor, the power used to drive the clock signal can be over 30% of the total power used by the entire chip.
&lt;/ref&gt;
and carefully design a [[w: clock distribution network]]
(perhaps in the form of an [[w: H tree]])
with [[w: timing analysis]]
to reduce the clock skew to negligible amounts.

Relay computers are forced to use at least 2 different clock signals, because of the &quot;contact bounce&quot; problem.

Many chips have a single &quot;clock input&quot; pin, giving the illusion that they use a single clock signal -- but internally a &quot;clock generator&quot; circuit converts that single external clock to the multiple clock signals used by the chip.

Many historically and commercially important CPUs have many sub-states in a complete clock cycle, with two or more &quot;non-overlapping clock signals&quot;.
Most MOS ICs used dual clock signals (a two-phase clock) in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia:Two-phase_clock#cite_ref-MC6870_0-0]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== shortcuts ===
Building a CPU from individual chips and wires takes a person a long time.
So many people take various shortcuts to reduce the amount of stuff that needs to be connected, and the amount of wiring they need to do.
* 3-state bus rather than 2-state bus often requires fewer and shorter connections.
* Rather than general-purpose registers that can be used (at different times) to drive the data bus (during STORE) or the address bus (during indexed LOAD), sometimes it requires less hardware to have separate address registers and data registers and other special-purpose registers.
* If the software guy insists on general-purpose registers that can be used (at different times) to drive the data bus (during STORE) or the address bus (during indexed LOAD), it may require less hardware to emulate them: have all programmer-visible registers drive only one internal microarchitectural bus, and (at different times) load the microarchitectural registers MAR and MDR  from that internal bus, and later drive the external address bus from MAR and the external data bus from MDR. This sacrifices a little speed and requires more microcode to make it easier to build.
* Rather than 32-bit or 64-bit address and data registers, it usually requires less hardware to have 8-bit data registers (occasionally combining 2 of them to get a 16-bit address register).
* If the software guy insists on 16-bit or 32-bit or 64-bit data registers and ALU operations, it may require less hardware to emulate them: use multiple narrow micro-architectural registers to store each programmer-visible register, and feed 1 or 4 or 8 or 16 bits at a time through a narrow bus to the ALU to get the partial result each cycle, or to sub-sections of the wide MAR or MDR. This sacrifices a little speed (and adds complexity elsewhere) to make the bus easier to build. (See: 68000, as mentioned above)
* Rather than many registers, it usually requires less hardware to have fewer registers.
* If the software guy insists on many registers, it may require less hardware to emulate some of them (like some proposed MMIX implementations) or perhaps all of them (like some PDP computers): use reserved locations in RAM to store most or all programmer-visible registers, and load them as needed. This sacrifices speed to make the CPU easier to build. Alas, it seems impossible to eliminate all registers -- even if you put all programmer-visible registers in RAM, it seems that you still need a few micro-architectural registers: IR (instruction register), MAR (memory address register), MDR (memory data register), and ... what else?
* Harvard architecture usually requires less hardware than Princeton architecture. This is one of the few ways to make the CPU simpler to build *and* go faster.

=== Harvard architecture ===
{{wikipedia|Harvard architecture}}
The simplest kinds of CPU control logic use the Harvard architecture, rather than Princeton architecture.
However, Harvard architecture requires 2 separate storage units -- the program memory and the data memory.
Some Harvard architecture machines, such as &quot;Mark's TTL microprocessor&quot;, don't even have an instruction register -- in those machines, the address in the program counter is always applied to the program memory, and the data coming out of the program memory directly controls everything that goes on in the CPU until the program counter changes.
Alas, Harvard architecture makes storing new programs into the program memory a bit tricky.

      <comment>/* Subroutines */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Functions and Subroutines are lines of code that you use more than once. The purpose of functions and subroutines is to save time and space by just ''calling'' a function/subroutine. There is hardly a difference between the two, except that a function ''returns'' a value, where a subroutine just repeats lines of code (A function is not '''always''' used more than once).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An example of a function, say you are making a program that calculates sales tax. The function would ask for a subtotal, take that number and multiply it by 1.07 (If sales tax is 7%, the 1 is because you are adding onto the subtotal to make a total, not finding the sales tax itself). The function would take the new total and give it back to the program.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A subroutine would be code that is reused, like a shop in a game. Every time the user goes to the shop, the program will go back to the Shops Subroutine, and if the user bought an item, it would call a &quot;Buy Item&quot; function.

== Parameters ==
Parameters are used in functions and subroutines. They pass data to be used with the function/parameter. For use with our two examples:

 Function Parameters) The Subtotal passed to the function is a parameter.

 Subroutine Parameters) The player's amount of gold could be sent to the subroutine so the shop&lt;br /&gt;knows how much money the player can spend.

There are two different ways to send parameters, by the value or by reference. By Value means that the function can not actually ''change'' the data outside of the function, but can use it's data to manipulate other data that is returned. By Value is like making a carbon copy of a paper, and editing the carbon copy. By Reference sends the actual argument (parameter) to the function/subroutine, which is like editing the original copy of the paper. By Value is wrote as '''ByVal''' and By Reference is wrote as '''ByRef'''.

== Functions ==
''Ignore the line numbers, they are used for explaining the code.''
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Example 1 (FreeBASIC)'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;freeBasic&quot;&gt;
1. Declare Function salesTax(ByVal subTotal As Double) As Double
2. Dim SubTotal2 As Double
3. Dim Total2 As Double
4. SubTotal2 = 10.00
5. Total2 = salesTax(SubTotal2)
6. Print &quot;Subtotal:&quot; ; SubTotal2
7. Print &quot;Total:&quot; ; Total2
8. Sleep
9. End
10.
11. Function salesTax(ByVal subTotal As Double) As Double
12.   Dim Total As Double
13.   Total = subTotal*1.07
14.   return Total
15. End Function
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;'''1.''' This line is the functions ''prototype''. Functions must be declared as a prototype before they are used, and must be defined after the ''end''(of the program) statement. Function means that the following is related to functions. salesTax is the function ''identifier'' or it's name, and in parentheses are the ''parameters'' (If you have more than one parameter, separate them with a comma). After the parentheses tells what Data Type the function returns. ''Double'' is a Data Type that signifies a number with decimals (00.00).
&lt;br /&gt;'''2.''' Create the SubTotal2 variable (Parameters can not be the same as existing identifiers).
&lt;br /&gt;'''3.''' Create the Total2 variable. 
&lt;br /&gt;'''4.''' Define SubTotal2 with the value 10.00 (Change this to get new outputs)
&lt;br /&gt;'''5.''' Define Total2 by passing SubTotal2 as an argument(parameter) to the function salesTax (The value of Total2 will be what the function ''returns'').
&lt;br /&gt;'''6.''' Display the subtotal.
&lt;br /&gt;'''7.''' Display the total.
&lt;br /&gt;'''8.''' Wait for the user to press enter (So you can read the output with out it flashing away in a second).
&lt;br /&gt;'''9.''' End the program (In a sense. You can't interact with the user past the End point)
&lt;br /&gt;'''10.''' Blank Line, easier to read the code.
&lt;br /&gt;'''11.''' This is where you ''define'' the function, earlier you ''declared'' the function. 
&lt;br /&gt;'''12.''' Create the variable Total (This variable can only be used in the function, because it was defined in the function. This is called the variable ''scope'').
&lt;br /&gt;'''13.''' You do not need to declare subTotal, because it was defined as a parameter, this math finds the total with sales tax and assigns it to the variable Total.
&lt;br /&gt;'''14.''' This is what '''line 5''' receives, the function shoots out the variable Total.
&lt;br /&gt;'''15.''' Ends the function definition.

GOSUB ... RETURN Statement
Purpose:

To branch to, and return from, a subroutine.
Syntax:

GOSUB line number
.
.
.
RETURN [line number]

Comments:

line number is the first line number of the subroutine.

A subroutine may be called any number of times in a program, and a subroutine may be called from within another subroutine. Such nesting of subroutines is limited only by available memory.

A RETURN statement in a subroutine causes GW-BASIC to return to the statement following the most recent GOSUB statement. A subroutine can contain more than one RETURN statement, should logic dictate a RETURN at different points in the subroutine.

Subroutines can appear anywhere in the program, but must be readily distinguishable from the main program.

To prevent inadvertent entry, precede the subroutine by a STOP, END, or GOTO statement to direct program control around the subroutine.
Examples:

10 GOSUB 40
20 PRINT &quot;BACK FROM SUBROUTINE&quot;
30 END
40 PRINT &quot;SUBROUTINE&quot;;
50 PRINT &quot; IN&quot;;
60 PRINT &quot; PROGRESS&quot;
70 RETURN
RUN
 SUBROUTINE IN PROGRESS
 BACK FROM SUBROUTINE

The END statement in line 30 prevents re-execution of the subroutine.

== Conclusion ==

[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]
Subroutines do not return any values, while functions return values.
Subroutines are also allowed to change values of the parameters while functions are supposed to maintain.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Human error protection ==

I've moved the following text from the article here. I've compacted and incorporated the ideas behind it in the sections on [[Minimizing hard disk drive failure and data loss#Revision control|revision control]] and on [[Minimizing hard disk drive failure and data loss#Managing backups and revisions|managing backups and revisions]]. I think it is important that the article stays compact, and that information available in Wikipedia is not duplicated here.

:It is all too easy to accidentally a file, or to accidentally delete parts of a file.

:Many system administrators set up a file server that archives earlier versions of useful files.

:The user at his computer (perhaps using a [[w:revision control|revision control]] GUI like [[w:TortoiseSVN|TortoiseSVN]] or a periodic cron program on the file server (perhaps using something like the &quot;backup&quot; option of [[w:Unison (file synchronizer)|Unison]] installed on the user's computer) periodically copies the latest version from the user's computer to the file server.

:Most such systems skip any files that have not changed, and compress the changes of files that have changed, such that storing 100 versions of a file folder, each version slightly different from the next, takes only a little more storage than storing only 1 version of that file folder.

:The key to preventing data loss is that the file server itself is set up in such a way that normal users (or any virus running on the user's machine) can't accidentally (or deliberately) delete or change files on the file server.

:Some system administrators set things up so obsolete versions are eventually purged. For example, a system administrator might make sure that today's version will still be accessible a month from now, by setting up a cron job that periodically scans the archive, keeping at least 1 version more than a month old, and automatically purging any versions older than that.

:(Don't delete *every* version more than a month old; that's a common backup mistake. For example, the banner graphic file referenced by every page on a company's website -- often that file that hasn't changed in years. If I accidentally damage it, and then that damaged version gets saved in the archive, I'm going to be upset if I can't revert to &quot;yesterday's version&quot; because the system automatically purged that &quot;obsolete 2-year-old version&quot;).

== Condensation control ==

The '[[Minimizing_hard_disk_drive_failure_and_data_loss#Condensation_control|Condensation control]]' section says condensation occurs when something is moved from a cold to a warm place, so from outdoors to indoors. But isn't that the other way around? Cold air holds less water, so it condensates. So the condensation occurs not when you bring a computer back in, but earlier, when you bring it out. I am fairly sure of this, but not sufficiently so to change the article.&lt;br&gt;
Oh, hold on, if the computer has been outside for some time and is then brought inside, the cold metal will cool the air and cause condensation. Just like when you blow against a cold window.&lt;br&gt;
So it can be one of two effects, or both, depending on the circumstances. Right? [[User:DirkvdM|DirkvdM]] ([[User talk:DirkvdM|talk]]) 07:48, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks for bringing up the concern. The information I previously entered in the article was roughly obtained from another web article, the link to which I unfortunately cannot currently recall.

:I'm certain that condensation will occur  in the latter case when the computer is brought inside. About this, as per the [[Wikipedia:Condensation#Condensation of water in nature|Wikipedia article on condensation]], water vapor will only condense onto another surface when the temperature of that surface is cooler than the temperature of the water vapor.

:About your point &quot;cold air hold less water&quot;, the [[Wikipedia:Dew point#Traditional False Explanation|Wikipedia article on dew point]] states that  the claim &quot;cold air cannot hold as much water as warm air&quot; is only superficially true. It seems that the physics involved is complex, and at this time I really don't know what to make of this event of taking the computer outside. It is by no means certain that condensation will happen, or that it'll damage the hard drive even if it does happen. One easy way to answer the question may be to run several limited experiments. I will update this post if I learn anything new and concrete with regards to this matter. Until then, I will by no means be taking my laptop outside in the winter without it being in its case.

== Temperature control ==

There are 2 sections in this book that talk about the effects of temperature on hard drives:
[[minimizing hard disk drive failure and data loss#Adequate cooling]] and [[minimizing hard disk drive failure and data loss#Temperature monitoring]].
One section implies that cooling is good for hard drives.
The other section says that cold drives have a higher failure rate than hot drives, implying that cooling is bad for hard drives.

Could we somehow merge those sections together into one section -- perhaps &quot;controlling the temperature of hard drives&quot;?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 03:54, 2 November 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks for your feedback. I have now done a preliminary merge of the two sections into a single large section on [[Minimizing hard disk drive failure and data loss#Temperature control|temperature control]].
:The details, as mentioned in the article, are important and shouldn't be overlooked. By and large, cooling is indeed important, as mentioned in the first part. I'm not so sure that the second part implies that cooling is bad; instead it prescribes having finer control, beyond the simple notion of hot versus cool.
:I would welcome any further comments you may have. --[[User:Antibogon|Antibogon]] ([[User talk:Antibogon|talk]]) 02:32, 7 November 2008 (UTC)

:: Good job merging the sections.
:: It seems obvious that &quot;cooling is indeed important&quot;. However, is there any evidence for this? Usually when we make measurements, the results are about what we expected. However, occasionally we are surprised by counter-intuitive results. Do we reject and ignore all measurements that don't match our preconceived biases? The Google measurements show that, the further the average temperatures is below 38 C, the higher the failure rate. What other implication can I draw other than &quot;cooling below an average temperature of 38 C is bad&quot; ? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 08:30, 23 March 2009 (UTC)

:::Doesn't heat increase friction and wear and tear? We know the mean temperatures, yes, but do we know anything about the actual distributions of temperatures in the Google study, or are we simply assuming they were gaussian? Is the Google study the only study in this regard? I find it safe to assume that there have been studies with conflicting results in the past. Do we know what kind (makes and models) of drives Google used?
:::Based on the Google study, I personally find it safe to draw the conservative conclusion that I probably wouldn't want my drive running at less than 30C. I think air-based cooling is essential because without it the drives could easily be running in the mid 40s, and there's no way that internal air alone will bring the temperature below 30. --[[User:Antibogon|Antibogon]] ([[User talk:Antibogon|talk]]) 02:21, 24 March 2009 (UTC)

:::: Yes, ''in theory'' I expected that heat would bad for hard drives. But ''in practice'', the Google study says ''&quot;In our study, we did not find much correlation between failure rate and either elevated temperature or utilization. It is the most surprising result of our study.&quot;''
:::: I'm looking on the graph on this page, &quot;[[Minimizing hard disk drive failure and data loss]]&quot;. It shows the actual distribution of the mean temperatures of the hard drives studied. Or are you talking about the distribution of temperatures (over time) for any one hard drive? I can assure you I do not assume that was gaussian.
:::: If there have been *any* other studies, I don't care whether their results are conflicting or not, *please* add a reference to those studies to this book.
:::: I agree that, based on the Google study, I don't want my drives running at less than 30 C.
:::: I agree that, ''in theory'', it seems unlikely that air cooling will bring the temperature below 30 C. However, I see that same graph shows that over half of Google's hard drives had an average temperature below 30 C. Are you assuming that Google cools their hard drives using some kind of liquid cooling? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 04:49, 30 March 2009 (UTC)
:::::Google using liquid cooling? Entirely possibly, but I wouldn't bet on it - they're more likely to use air-cooled blade servers.
:::::However, a lot of this may be a moot point. The computer needs to be cooled anyways, and most standard cooling systems are not going to get your HD into the lower ranges you're referring to. This of course depends on the hardware, but I'm not sure it's worth spending lots of time discussing in the text. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:27, 20 November 2009 (UTC)

== Generalizing Google's results ==
Generalizing the results of the Google study to all HDDs would imply the assumption that the distribution of SMART values of HDDs used in the Google study and the distribution of SMART values of HDDs in general is the same. This assumption however is not entirely true, because:
*Google's HDDs probably have a very high uptime, whereas desktop HDDs probably don't.
*Google's HDDs had temperature distributions that are possibly different from those of HDDs in other places, including many data centers.
*Google used those HDDs in the study that didn't have infant mortality.
*There are probably big differences in reliability of the HDDs of different manufacturers.
Having said this, as is obvious, the results would translate better to data centers that use mixed drives. --[[User:Antibogon|Antibogon]] ([[User talk:Antibogon|talk]]) 00:31, 29 March 2009 (UTC)

By &quot;not true&quot;, are you saying that you have data that shows that other hard drives definitely do act differently than Google's HDDs?
Or are you merely speculating that that they *might* act differently?

* Yes, Google's HDDs are turned on and spinning essentially all the time.
* Yes, the temperature swings of Google's HDDs are probably very different desktop HDDs and even more different from laptop HDDs.
* Yes, the Google study notes that different manufacturers had different &quot;age-related results&quot;.
However,
* I assume that Google's data centers the same temperature distribution as other data centers. (Do you have any reason to think differently?)
* The Google study specifically says that, even though it does not include infant mortality that occurs during the burn-in stress test, &quot;''our data should be consistent with what a regular end-user should see, since most equipment manufacturers put their systems through similar tests before shipment.''&quot;
*  The Google study reports that ''&quot;None of our SMART data results change significantly when normalized by drive model. The only exception is seek error rate, which is dependent on one specific drive manufacturer, ...&quot;''

Therefore, since Google specifically says that the SMART data results are the same for every manufacturer, it seems reasonable to me to assume that the results of the Google study are valid for all data centers.
Including data centers that use all-one-manufacturer as well as data centers that use mixed drives.
I would be very surprised if a data center's HDDs act differently than Google's HDDs.

Since I know of no contradictory information, it seems reasonable to me to assume that their results are also valid for desktop HDDs and laptop HDDs.
Although I would be less surprised to learn that those HDDs act differently than Google's HDDs.

== delta T ==

Neither the Google paper or other papers about this subject give attention to delta T, as opposed to absolute T, which is reported in the study.  That delta T is a larger factor in drive failure is supported directly bu Google's study, in that lower temperature was associated with failure.

A machine, whether desktop PC or SAN (ambient temperature is not relevant) can be viewed as an enclosed system, where a volume of its surrounding air comprises the out-most surface of the system.  By itself, this may not create an important thermal layer its presence may not come into effect.

A fact that is well-established by work in other areas shows that mechanical failure is the primary cause of failure in any electrical or electronic device.  Consider a lightbulb as an example.  Consumer data reported on boxes often rates a lamp in terms of hours.  If you dig into engineering data you will find life-cycle data about the same lamp, to be measured in on-off cycles, not in hours of operation.  The association between on-off cycles and change in temperature (delta T) should be straight forward -- the lamp is at higher T while powered and lower T while not powered.  Thus, delta T increases in number as the lamp is turned from off to on, back to off, and is repeated over many cycles.  In a lamp, metal that is part of the filament is ionized when power is turned on, as a function of the heat that is generated while electrons pass through it.  When power is removed the energy level of the ionized atoms falls and most of the ionized metal returns to the filament.  THe remaining metal is deposited on the inside of the glass lamp as residue.  

While the lamp operates, and while it is off, its temperature is in steady-state.  (While air currents may cause the lamp to change temperature slightly, from moment to moment, the change in temperature is negligible compared to the change in temperature that results during either power-up or power-down).  Therefore, the length of time the lamp is in one state or the other is not a contributor to the build-up of residue.  (Build-up of residue is directly related to loss of metal, from the filmanent, which is directly related to failure).

Semiconductor devices experience a similar life in that the n-p and p-n junctions within them, suffer as a result when the device changes temperatute.  A semiconductor device is more likely to suffer from the loss of material than a tungsten lamp, so operation in an over-heated state is more likely to effect the semiconductor device.  But operated within their specifications, the junctions will succomb to degradation in a manner similar to the filament of a tungsten bulb.  As a result, the number of power cycles is a greater predictor of failure than is the time in operation.

The Google study reports on steady state condititions -- a logical use of data produced by SMART.  Whether or not the Google data supports what I've written isn't likely to be obvious by reviewing the report itself, but it may be visible in the daw data used to by Google to support the report.  As a matter of physics, or as a study of data collected by various manufacturing sectors, change in temperature a well-known contributor to failure and it is overlooked in the Google paper.  However, examination of the temperature curve show greater area under the curve to the left, than to the right, where the center is taken as ambient for a given drive.  This range correlates with the power-up and power-down cycles.  

The characteristics of any system can include thermal conductivity.  Thermal conductivity can  be considered constant over certain, limited, temperature ranges.  Exactly here the range causes this predictable parameter to fail in Google's study is uncertain but one thing does remain certain.  It will fail, at least, in an area of temperature to the right of the center.  

I've provided this for consideration by those who wish for a practical solution to drive-related problem, because it is empirically true and because most reports (all reports I've looked at) fall short of analyzing the effect of delta T.  This is a shortcoming of the given report because the ubiquity of evidence about the effect of delta T is not hidden.  If this is considered as removable information from Wikipedia, because no citations are offered, so be it.  If one wishes to find relevant sources for it, they can be found.  I hope it is useful to someone other than myself. [[User:Kernel.package|Kernel.package]] ([[User talk:Kernel.package|talk]]) 18:53, 20 October 2009 (UTC)

Personally I'm of the opinion that it should not be split at this time.

== Advertising ==

Should a WikiMedia project really be promoting any particular (especially proprietary &amp; commercial) software? I realise the benefit of giving examples, but in such cases Free (Libre/‘open source’) Software should be mentioned which removes the dubious nature of proprietary and/or commercial suggestions. As [http://blog.jimmywales.com/index.php/archives/2004/10/21/free-knowledge-requires-free-software-and-free-file-formats/ Jimmy Wales said, Free knowledge requires Free software, standards, and formats]. — [[User:Lee Carre|Lee Carré]] ([[User talk:Lee Carre|talk]]) 14:45, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
:Please specify the names of the software in question. I think mentioning freely usable proprietary software is fine, assuming there is no comparable open source alternative available.

This recipe makes dough for a 1.5kg loaf of bread. It is intended for a bread machine but can also be made by hand.

==Ingredients==
* 250ml room temperature (approx 21 [[Cookbook:C|°C]]) real ale (not lager)
* 3 Tbsp (45ml) sunflower oil
* 2 Tbsp (30ml) malt extract
* 1 Tsp (5ml) table salt
* 150g very strong white flour
* 150g country grain wholemeal flour
* 70g soft grain white flour
* 70g strong wholemeal flour
* 2 Tsp (5ml) easy bake yeast

== Procedure - Bread Machine ==

# Add ingredients to a bread machine in the order listed, select appropriate white loaf setting (according to manufacturers instructions), and press start. 
# Remove when cycle is complete. Cool and enjoy.

== Procedure - Hand Baking ==
# Mix the ingredients above into a dough, and knead on an unfloured surface until an smooth elastic dough is formed.
# Put into a greased baking tin or on a greased baking tray, cover with a dry towel and rest for approximately 1 hour.
# Place into a preheated oven at 180[[Cookbook:C|°C]] and bake for 20-40 minutes (baking times will change depending on altitude.)

[[Category:Vegan recipes|{{PAGENAME}}]]

== Variations ==
# Use 1.5 Tbsp (22.5ml) Demerara Sugar instead of Malt Extract if you can't get hold of any.
# Reduce each flour measurement by 10g and add 40g loose Polenta to add a different texture to the bread.
# Substitute bread flour for hard flour and/or pastry flour for soft flour.</text>

== '''GRUB Installation''' ==

Installation of GRUB is a two step process. The first step is to install or build GRUB in a host OS environment, and for this we will use Linux. The second step is to install and configure GRUB as the boot loader for your system. 

'''Compile GRUB Source Code'''

The first step is the usual: download the source archive, untar it, configure and make install.
Assuming you have found a source mirror (see [http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub.html the GRUB home page] to find one) and downloaded the source distribution into a suitable working directory, continue with:

 tar -xzvf grub-0.97.tar.gz
 cd grub-0.97
 ./configure
 make
 make install

This should create the executables: grub, grub-install and mbchk; install support files in /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/, and install the GNU information manual and man pages. For the second step of installation, we will first build and work with a GRUB bootable CD.

'''Preparing a GRUB Bootable CD'''

Follow the steps and build your GRUB Bootable CD

 mkdir iso
 mkdir -p iso/boot/grub
 cp /usr/lib/grub/i386pc/stage2_eltorito iso/boot/grub
 mkisofs -R -b boot/grub/stage2_eltorito -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -o grub.iso iso

'''Install GRUB on MBR'''

Reboot your system with “GRUB Installation CD”, after load stage1 you find a grub shell.
Run the following command to find which partition of your system, Linux is installed.

 grub&gt;find /boot/grub/stage1

Suppose your Linux Distribution is installed on your first Primary partition, then the output is
 (hd0,1)
then you install the GRUB on your Hard Disk Master Boot Record (MBR). The steps are as following.

 grub&gt;root (hd0,1)
 grub&gt;setup (hd0)
 grub&gt;quit

The GRUB Install process is now complete.
Reboot your system.

      <comment>/* Advanced Audio/Video Settings */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm looking for tech assistance on a Motorola DVR, model DCT6416III.  The HDMI port is not enabled and it seems that I cannot get support from my cable company in addressing this issue.
I can access the diagnostics and view the setting that indicates HDMI not enabled but not sure how to change the setting.

Thanks
Frank

== Advanced Audio/Video Settings ==

There is now an Advanced Audio/Video Settings sub-menu (at least on (some) DCX models).
Dolby Volume  Off/On
Video Sharpness   1 2 3 4 5

The defaults are Off and 3.

What is the advise on setting these?</text>

Where &lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt; is the title of your book. Click &quot;'''Save page'''&quot; to create the template. This will substitute in all the necessary code and text. 

=== Options ===

You can customize the CSS style of the template by adding a second argument:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{subst:User:Whiteknight/Simple Header|&lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt;|&lt;&lt;STYLE&gt;&gt;}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

If you add this style parameter, it will override all the default styles from the template. The default style, which you may want to duplicate in whole or in part, is:

 width: 90%; clear: all; padding: 5px; margin: 5px auto;

== Using This Template ==

To use this template in your book, use regular template syntax to include it at the bottom of every page. This template takes no arguments. 

== Notes ==

== Overview ==

'''''Marcus Belby''''', a student in Ravenclaw house at Hogwarts of approximately [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s age, is the nephew of Damocles Belby, the wizard who invented [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wolfsbane Potion|Wolfsbane Potion]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]] invites Marcus, along with a number of other people that he judges to be the potential movers and shakers of the Wizarding world, to lunch with him on the Hogwarts Express. When he learns that Marcus is estranged from his famous uncle, Slughorn effectively dismisses him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

Belby is brought into the story, as far as we can see, only to cast a light on Slughorn and some specifics of his social climbing. We see that Slughorn is willing to cultivate Belby as long as he has hopes of making a connection with Belby's still living famous uncle. As Damocles is estranged from Marcus' side of the Belby family, he does not represent a useful connection. We suspect that this particular shallowness in Slughorn's character is one of the things that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] dislikes, and one of the reasons Harry avoids the Slug Club.

The tiny Mediterranean country known officially as the Hellenic Republic has had a fascinating history stretching back through the ages. This nation, known commonly as Greece, is widely considered the birthplace of Western civilization, and thus, its long and complex history continues to exert influence worldwide.

==== Chain of Responsibility ====
Chain of Responsibility pattern has the intent to avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chains the receiving objects and passes the requests along the chain until an object handles it.

==== Command ====
Command pattern is an Object behavioral pattern that decouples sender and receiver by encapsulating a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undo-able operations. It can also be thought as an object oriented equivalent of call back method. 

Call Back:
It is a function that is registered to be called at later point of time based on user actions.

&lt;/source&gt;

==== Interpreter ====
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

==== Iterator ====
The 'iterator' design pattern is used liberally within the STL for traversal of various containers. The full understanding of this will liberate a developer to create highly reusable and easily understandable{{Citation needed|actually, often cited as adding complexity}} data containers.

The basic idea of the iterator is that it permits the traversal of a container (like a pointer moving across an array). However, to get to the next element of a container, you need not know anything about how the container is constructed. This is the iterators job. By simply using the member functions provided by the iterator, you can move, in the intended order of the container, from the first element to the last element.

Let us start by considering a traditional single dimensional array with a pointer moving from the start to the end. This example assumes knowledge of pointer arithmetic.
Note that the use of &quot;it&quot; or &quot;itr,&quot; henceforth, is a short version of &quot;iterator.&quot;

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 const int ARRAY_LEN = 42;
 int *myArray = new int[ARRAY_LEN];
 // Set the iterator to point to the first memory location of the array
 int *arrayItr = myArray;
 // Move through each element of the array, setting it equal to its position in the array
 for(int i = 0; i &lt; ARRAY_LEN; ++i)
 {
    // set the value of the current location in the array
    *arrayItr = i;
    // by incrementing the pointer, we move it to the next position in the array.
    // This is easy for a contiguous memory container, since pointer arithmetic 
    // handles the traversal.
    ++arrayItr;
 }
 // Do not be messy, clean up after yourself
 delete[] myArray;
&lt;/source&gt;

This code works very quickly for arrays, but how would we traverse a linked list, when the memory is not contiguous?
Consider the implementation of a rudimentary linked list as follows:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 class IteratorCannotMoveToNext{}; // Error class
 class MyIntLList
 {
 public:
     // The Node class represents a single element in the linked list. 
     // The node has a next node and a previous node, so that the user 
     // may move from one position to the next, or step back a single 
     // position. Notice that the traversal of a linked list is O(N), 
     // as is searching, since the list is not ordered.
     class Node
     {
     public:
         Node():mNextNode(0),mPrevNode(0),mValue(0){}
         Node *mNextNode;
         Node *mPrevNode;
         int mValue;
     };
     MyIntLList():mSize(0) 
     {}
     ~MyIntLList()
     {
         while(!Empty())
             pop_front();
     } // See expansion for further implementation;
     int Size() const {return mSize;}
     // Add this value to the end of the list
     void push_back(int value)
     {
         Node *newNode = new Node;
         newNode-&gt;mValue = value;
         newNode-&gt;mPrevNode = mTail;
         mTail-&gt;mNextNode = newNode;
         mTail = newNode;
         ++mSize;
     }
     // Remove the value from the beginning of the list
     void pop_front()
     {
         if(Empty())
             return;
         Node *tmpnode = mHead;
         mHead = mHead-&gt;mNextNode;
         delete tmpnode;
         --mSize;
     }
     bool Empty()
     {return mSize == 0;}
 
     // This is where the iterator definition will go, 
     // but lets finish the definition of the list, first
 
 private:
     Node *mHead;
     Node *mTail;
     int mSize;
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

This linked list has non-contiguous memory, and is therefore not a candidate for pointer arithmetic. And we do not want to expose the internals of the list to other developers, forcing them to learn them, and keeping us from changing it.

This is where the iterator comes in. The common interface makes learning the usage of the container easier, and hides the traversal logic from other developers.

Let us examine the code for the iterator, itself.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
     /*
      *  The iterator class knows the internals of the linked list, so that it 
      *  may move from one element to the next. In this implementation, I have 
      *  chosen the classic traversal method of overloading the increment 
      *  operators. More thorough implementations of a bi-directional linked 
      *  list would include decrement operators so that the iterator may move 
      *  in the opposite direction.
      */
     class Iterator
     {
     public:
         Iterator(Node *position):mCurrNode(position){}
         // Prefix increment
         const Iterator &amp;operator++()
         {
             if(mCurrNode == 0 || mCurrNode-&gt;mNextNode == 0)
                 throw IteratorCannotMoveToNext();e
             mCurrNode = mCurrNode-&gt;mNextNode;
             return *this;
         }
         // Postfix increment
         Iterator operator++(int)
         {
             Iterator tempItr = *this;
             ++(*this);
             return tempItr;
         }
         // Dereferencing operator returns the current node, which should then 
         // be dereferenced for the int. TODO: Check syntax for overloading 
         // dereferencing operator
         Node * operator*()
         {return mCurrNode;}
         // TODO: implement arrow operator and clean up example usage following
     private:
         Node *mCurrNode;
     };
     // The following two functions make it possible to create 
     // iterators for an instance of this class.
     // First position for iterators should be the first element in the container.
     Iterator Begin(){return Iterator(mHead);}
     // Final position for iterators should be one past the last element in the container.
     Iterator End(){return Iterator(0);}
&lt;/source&gt;

With this implementation, it is now possible, without knowledge of the size of the container or how its data is organized, to move through each element in order, manipulating or simply accessing the data. This is done through the accessors in the MyIntLList class, Begin() and End().

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 // Create a list
 MyIntLList myList;
 // Add some items to the list
 for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)
     myList.push_back(i);
 // Move through the list, adding 42 to each item.
 for(MyIntLList::Iterator it = myList.Begin(); it != myList.End(); ++it)
     (*it)-&gt;mValue += 42;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Mediator ====
Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from  referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

==== Memento ====
Without violating encapsulation the Memento Pattern will capture and externalize an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later. Though the [[w:Design Patterns|Gang of Four]] uses friend as a way to implement this pattern it is not the best design{{Citation needed}}.  It can also be implemented using [[w:Opaque pointer|PIMPL (pointer to implementation or opaque pointer)]].  Best Use case is 'Undo-Redo' in an editor. 

The Originator (the object to be saved) creates a snap-shot of itself as a Memento object, and passes that reference to the Caretaker object.  The Caretaker object keeps the Memento until such a time as the Originator may want to revert to a previous state as recorded in the Memento object.

See [http://perldoc.perl.org/Memoize.html memoize] for an ''old-school'' example of this pattern.

==== Observer ====
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

; Problem : In one place or many places in the application we need to be aware about a system event or an application state change. We'd like to have a standard way of subscribing to listening for system events and a standard way of notifying the interested parties. The notification should be automated after an interested party subscribed to the system event or application state change. There also should be a way to unsubscribe.

; Forces : Observers and observables probably should be represented by objects. The observer objects will be notified by the observable objects.

; Solution :  After subscribing the listening objects will be notified by a way of method call.

==== State ====
The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear as having changed its class.

==== Strategy ====
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients who use it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class StrategyInterface
{
    public:
        virtual void execute() const = 0;
};

class ConcreteStrategyA: public StrategyInterface
{
    public:
        virtual void execute() const
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Called ConcreteStrategyA execute method&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
};

class ConcreteStrategyB: public StrategyInterface
{
    public:
        virtual void execute() const
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Called ConcreteStrategyB execute method&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
};

class ConcreteStrategyC: public StrategyInterface
{
    public:
        virtual void execute() const
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Called ConcreteStrategyC execute method&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
};

class Context
{
    private:
        StrategyInterface * strategy_;

    public:
        explicit Context(StrategyInterface *strategy):strategy_(strategy)
        {
        }

        void set_strategy(StrategyInterface *strategy)
        {
            strategy_ = strategy;
        }

        void execute() const
        {
            strategy_-&gt;execute();
        }
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    ConcreteStrategyA concreteStrategyA;
    ConcreteStrategyB concreteStrategyB;
    ConcreteStrategyC concreteStrategyC;

    Context contextA(&amp;concreteStrategyA);
    Context contextB(&amp;concreteStrategyB);
    Context contextC(&amp;concreteStrategyC);

    contextA.execute(); // output: &quot;Called ConcreteStrategyA execute method&quot;
    contextB.execute(); // output: &quot;Called ConcreteStrategyB execute method&quot;
    contextC.execute(); // output: &quot;Called ConcreteStrategyC execute method&quot;
    
    contextA.set_strategy(&amp;concreteStrategyB);
    contextA.execute(); // output: &quot;Called ConcreteStrategyB execute method&quot;
    contextA.set_strategy(&amp;concreteStrategyC);
    contextA.execute(); // output: &quot;Called ConcreteStrategyC execute method&quot;

    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Template Method ====
By defining a skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses, the Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of that algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

==== Visitor ====
The Visitor Pattern will represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure by letting you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

==== Model-View-Controller (MVC) ====
A pattern often used by applications that need the ability to maintain multiple views of the same data. The model-view-controller pattern was until recently{{Citation needed}} a very common pattern especially for graphic user interlace programming, it splits the code in 3 pieces. The model, the view, and the controller. 

The Model is the actual data representation (for example, Array vs Linked List) or other objects representing a database. The View is an interface to reading the model or a fat client GUI. The Controller provides the interface of changing or modifying the data, and then selecting the &quot;Next Best View&quot; (NBV). 

Newcomers will probably see this &quot;MVC&quot; model as wasteful, mainly because you are working with many extra objects at runtime, when it seems like one giant object will do. But the secret to the MVC pattern is not writing the code, but in maintaining it, and allowing people to modify the code without changing much else. Also, keep in mind, that different developers have different strengths and weaknesses, so team building around MVC is easier. Imagine a View Team that is responsible for great views, a Model Team that knows a lot about data, and a Controller Team that see the big picture of application flow, handing requests, working with the model, and selecting the most appropriate next view for that client.

{{TODO|Erm, someone please come up with a better example than the following... I can not think of any
* Perhaps a banking program for customer access to their accounts: A web UI on a traditional browser vs mobile app? And then handling checking/savings accounts vs loan vs line-of-credit accounts?  fwiw}}

For example: A naive central database can be organized using only a &quot;model&quot;, for example, a straight array. However, later on, it may be more applicable to use a linked list. All array accesses will have to be remade into their respective Linked List form (for example, you would change myarray[5] into mylist.at(5) or whatever is equivalent in the language you use).

Well, if we followed the MVC pattern, the central database would be accessed using some sort of a function, for example, myarray.at(5). If we change the model from an array to a linked list, all we have to do is change the view with the model, and the whole program is changed. Keep the interface the same but change the underpinnings of it. This would allow us to make optimizations more freely and quickly than before.

One of the great advantages of the Model-View-Controller Pattern is obviously the ability to reuse the application's logic (which is implemented in the model) when implementing a different view. A good example is found in web development, where a common task is to implement an external API inside of an existing piece of software. If the MVC pattern has cleanly been followed, this only requires modification to the controller, which can have the ability to render different types of views dependent on the content type requested by the user agent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Structural Patterns ===

==== Adapter ====
Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. '''Adapter''' lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

==== Bridge ====
The Bridge Pattern is used to separate out the interface from its implementation. Doing this gives the flexibility so that both can vary independently.

The following example will output:
&lt;pre&gt;
API1.circle at 1:2 7.5
API2.circle at 5:7 27.5
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

/* Implementor*/
class DrawingAPI {
  public:
   virtual void drawCircle(double x, double y, double radius) = 0;
   virtual ~DrawingAPI() {}
};

/* Concrete ImplementorA*/
class DrawingAPI1 : public DrawingAPI {
  public:
   void drawCircle(double x, double y, double radius) {
      cout &lt;&lt; &quot;API1.circle at &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; ':' &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; radius &lt;&lt; endl;
   }
};

/* Concrete ImplementorB*/
class DrawingAPI2 : public DrawingAPI {
public:
   void drawCircle(double x, double y, double radius) {
      cout &lt;&lt; &quot;API2.circle at &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; ':' &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt;  radius &lt;&lt; endl;
   }
};

/* Abstraction*/
class Shape {
  public:
   virtual ~Shape() {}
   virtual void draw() = 0;
   virtual void resizeByPercentage(double pct) = 0;
};

/* Refined Abstraction*/
class CircleShape : public Shape {
  public:
   CircleShape(double x, double y,double radius, DrawingAPI *drawingAPI) :
	   m_x(x), m_y(y), m_radius(radius), m_drawingAPI(drawingAPI)
   {}
   void draw() {
      m_drawingAPI-&gt;drawCircle(m_x, m_y, m_radius);
   }
   void resizeByPercentage(double pct) {
      m_radius *= pct;
   }
  private:
   double m_x, m_y, m_radius;
   DrawingAPI *m_drawingAPI;
};

int main(void) {
   CircleShape circle1(1,2,3,new DrawingAPI1());
   CircleShape circle2(5,7,11,new DrawingAPI2());
   circle1.resizeByPercentage(2.5);
   circle2.resizeByPercentage(2.5);
   circle1.draw();
   circle2.draw();
   return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Composite ====
Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. The Composite pattern can represent both the conditions. In this pattern, one can develop tree structures for representing part-whole hierarchies.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt; // std::cout
#include &lt;memory&gt; // std::auto_ptr
#include &lt;algorithm&gt; // std::for_each
#include &lt;functional&gt; // std::mem_fun
using namespace std;

  }
};

  const auto_ptr&lt;Ellipse&gt; ellipse3(new Ellipse());
  const auto_ptr&lt;Ellipse&gt; ellipse4(new Ellipse());

===== Decorator =====
The decorator pattern helps to attach additional behavior or responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. This is also called “Wrapper”. If your application does some kind of filtering, then Decorator might be good pattern to consider for the job

==== Facade ====
The Facade Pattern hides the complexities of the system by providing an interface to the client from where the client can access the system on an unified interface. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. For instance making one class method perform a complex process by calling several other classes.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
/*Facade is one of the easiest patterns I think... And this is very simple example. 

Imagine you set up a smart house where everything is on remote. So to turn the lights on you push lights on button - And same for TV,
AC, Alarm, Music, etc...

When you leave a house you would need to push a 100 buttons to make sure everything is off and are good to go which could be little 
annoying if you are lazy like me 
so I defined a Facade for leaving and coming back. (Facade functions represent buttons...) So when I come and leave I just make one 
call and it takes care of everything...

     //Rather than calling 100 different on and off functions thanks to facade I only have 2 functions...
     hf.goToWork();
     hf.comeHome();
   }

==== Flyweight ====

The pattern for saving memory (basically) by sharing properties of objects. Imagine a huge amount of similar objects which all have most of their properties the same.  It's natural to move these properties out of these objects to some external data structure and provide each object with the link to that data structure.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

#define NUMBER_OF_SAME_TYPE_CHARS 3;

/* Actual flyweight objects class (declaration) */
class FlyweightCharacter;

/*
	FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder is a class holding the properties which are shared by
	many objects. So instead of keeping these properties in those objects we keep them externally, making
	objects flyweight. See more details in the comments of main function.
*/
class FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder {
	FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder() {}
	~FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder() {}
public:
	static std::vector&lt;float&gt; fontSizes; // lets imagine that sizes be may of floating point type
	static std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; fontNames; // font name may be of variable length (lets take 6 bytes is average)

	static void setFontsAndNames();
	static FlyweightCharacter createFlyweightCharacter(unsigned short fontSizeIndex,
		unsigned short fontNameIndex,
		unsigned short positionInStream);
};

std::vector&lt;float&gt; FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder::fontSizes(3);
std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder::fontNames(3);
void FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder::setFontsAndNames() {
	fontSizes[0] = 1.0;
	fontSizes[1] = 1.5;
	fontSizes[2] = 2.0;

	fontNames[0] = &quot;first_font&quot;;
	fontNames[1] = &quot;second_font&quot;;
	fontNames[2] = &quot;third_font&quot;;
}

class FlyweightCharacter {
	unsigned short fontSizeIndex; // index instead of actual font size
	unsigned short fontNameIndex; // index instead of font name

	unsigned positionInStream;

public:

	FlyweightCharacter(unsigned short fontSizeIndex, unsigned short fontNameIndex, unsigned short positionInStream):
		fontSizeIndex(fontSizeIndex), fontNameIndex(fontNameIndex), positionInStream(positionInStream) {}
	void print() {
		std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Font Size: &quot; &lt;&lt; FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder::fontSizes[fontSizeIndex]
			&lt;&lt; &quot;, font Name: &quot; &lt;&lt; FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder::fontNames[fontNameIndex]
			&lt;&lt; &quot;, character stream position: &quot; &lt;&lt; positionInStream &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	}
	~FlyweightCharacter() {}
};

FlyweightCharacter FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder::createFlyweightCharacter(unsigned short fontSizeIndex, unsigned short fontNameIndex, unsigned short positionInStream) {
	FlyweightCharacter fc(fontSizeIndex, fontNameIndex, positionInStream);

	return fc;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
	std::vector&lt;FlyweightCharacter&gt; chars;

	FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder::setFontsAndNames();
	unsigned short limit = NUMBER_OF_SAME_TYPE_CHARS;

	for (unsigned short i = 0; i &lt; limit; i++) {
		chars.push_back(FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder::createFlyweightCharacter(0, 0, i));
		chars.push_back(FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder::createFlyweightCharacter(1, 1, i + 1 * limit));
		chars.push_back(FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder::createFlyweightCharacter(2, 2, i + 2 * limit));
	}
	/*
		Each char stores links to it's fontName and fontSize so what we get is:

		each object instead of allocating 6 bytes (convention above) for string
		and 4 bytes for float allocates 2 bytes for fontNameIndex and fontSizeIndex.

		That means for each char we save 6 + 4 - 2 - 2 = 6 bytes.
		Now imagine we have NUMBER_OF_SAME_TYPE_CHARS = 1000 i.e. with our code
		we will have 3 groups of chars whith 1000 chars in each group which will save us

		3 * 1000 * 6 - (3 * 6 + 3 * 4) = 17970 saved bytes.

		3 * 6 + 3 * 4 is a number of bytes allocated by FlyweightCharacterAbstractBuilder.

		So the idea of the pattern is to move properties shared by many objects to some
		external container. The objects in that case don't store the data themselves they
		store only links to the data which saves memory and make the objects lighter.
		The data size of properties stored externally may be significant which will save REALLY
		huge ammount of memory and will make each object super light in comparisson to it's counterpart.
		That's where the name of the pattern comes from: flyweight (i.e. very light).
	*/
	for (unsigned short i = 0; i &lt; chars.size(); i++) {
		chars[i].print();
	}

	std::cin.get(); return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Proxy ====
The Proxy Pattern will provide an object a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.  It is used when you need to represent a complex object with a simpler one. If creation of an object is expensive, it can be postponed until the very need arises and meanwhile a simpler object can serve as a placeholder. This placeholder object is called the “Proxy” for the complex object.

==== Curiously Recurring Template ====
This technique is known more widely as a mixin. Mixins are described in the literature to be a powerful tool for expressing abstractions{{Citation needed}}.

==== Interface-based Programming (IBP) ====
Interface-based programming is closely related with Modular Programming and Object-Oriented Programming, it defines the application as a collection of inter-coupled modules (interconnected and which plug into each other via interface). Modules can be unplugged, replaced, or upgraded, without the need of compromising the contents of other modules. 

The total system complexity is greatly reduced. Interface Based Programming adds more to  modular Programming in that it insists that Interfaces are to be added to these modules. The entire system is thus viewed as Components and the interfaces that helps them to co-act.

Interface-based Programming increases the ''modularity'' of the application and hence its maintainability at a later development cycles, especially when each module must be developed by different teams. It is a well-known methodology that has been around for a long time and it is a core technology behind frameworks such as CORBA.

This is particularly convenient when third parties develop additional components for the established system. They just have to develop components that satisfy the interface specified by the parent application vendor. 

Thus the publisher of the interfaces assures that he will not change the interface and the subscriber agrees to implement the interface as whole without any deviation.
An interface is therefore said to be a ''Contractual agreement'' and the [[w:programming paradigm|programming paradigm]] based on this is termed as &quot;interface based programming&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Creational Patterns ===
In [[w:software engineering|software engineering]], '''creational design patterns''' are [[w:design pattern (computer science)|design patterns]] that deal with [[w:object lifetime|object creation]] mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation. 

In this section of the book we assume that the reader has enough familiarity with functions, global variables, stack vs. heap, classes, pointers, and static member functions as introduced before. 

As we will see there are several creational design patterns, and all will deal with a specific implementation task, that will create a higher level of abstraction to the code base, we will now cover each one.

==== Builder ====
The Builder Creational Pattern is used to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different objects representations.

; Problem : We want to construct a complex object, however we do not want to have a complex constructor member or one that would need many arguments.

; Solution : Define an intermediate object whose member functions define the desired object part by part before the object is available to the client.  Builder Pattern lets us defer the construction of the object until all the options for creation have been specified.

==== Factory ====
'''Definition''': A utility class that creates an instance of a class from a family of derived classes

===== Abstract Factory =====
'''Definition''': A utility class that creates an instance of several families of classes. It can also return
a factory for a certain group.


The Factory Design Pattern is useful in a situation that requires the creation of many different types of objects, all derived from a common base type. The Factory Method defines a method for creating the objects, which subclasses can then override to specify the derived type that will be created. Thus, at run time, the Factory Method can be passed a description of a desired object (e.g., a string read from user input) and return a base class pointer to a new instance of that object. The pattern works best when a well-designed interface is used for the base class, so there is no need to cast the returned object.

; Problem : We want to decide at run time what object is to be created based on some configuration or application parameter. When we write the code, we do not know what class should be instantiated.  

; Solution : Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

In the following example, a factory method is used to create laptop or desktop computer objects at run time.

Let's start by defining &lt;code&gt;Computer&lt;/code&gt;, which is an abstract base class (interface) and its derived classes: &lt;code&gt;Laptop&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Desktop&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 class Computer
 {
 public:
     virtual void Run() = 0;
     virtual void Stop() = 0;
 };
 class Laptop: public Computer
 {
 public:
     virtual void Run(){mHibernating = false;}
     virtual void Stop(){mHibernating = true;}
 private:
     bool mHibernating; // Whether or not the machine is hibernating
 };
 class Desktop: public Computer
 {
 public:
     virtual void Run(){mOn = true;}
     virtual void Stop(){mOn = false;}
 private:
     bool mOn; // Whether or not the machine has been turned on
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

The actual &lt;code&gt;ComputerFactory&lt;/code&gt; class returns a &lt;code&gt;Computer&lt;/code&gt;, given a real world description of the object.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 class ComputerFactory
 {
 public:
     static Computer *NewComputer(const std::string &amp;description)
     {
         if(description == &quot;laptop&quot;)
             return new Laptop;
         if(description == &quot;desktop&quot;)
             return new Desktop;
         return NULL;
     }
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's analyze the benefits of this design. First, there is a compilation benefit. If we move the interface &lt;code&gt;Computer&lt;/code&gt; into a separate header file with the factory, we can then move the implementation of the &lt;code&gt;NewComputer()&lt;/code&gt; function into a separate implementation file. Now the implementation file for &lt;code&gt;NewComputer()&lt;/code&gt; is the only one that requires knowledge of the derived classes. Thus, if a change is made to any derived class of &lt;code&gt;Computer&lt;/code&gt;, or a new &lt;code&gt;Computer&lt;/code&gt; subtype is added, the implementation file for &lt;code&gt;NewComputer()&lt;/code&gt; is the only file that needs to be recompiled. Everyone who uses the factory will only care about the interface, which should remain consistent throughout the life of the application.

Also, if there is a need to add a class, and the user is requesting objects through a user interface, no code calling the factory may be required to change to support the additional computer type. The code using the factory would simply pass on the new string to the factory, and allow the factory to handle the new types entirely.

Imagine programming a video game, where you would like to add new types of enemies in the future, each of which has different AI functions and can update differently. By using a factory method, the controller of the program can call to the factory to create the enemies, without any dependency or knowledge of the actual types of enemies. Now, future developers can create new enemies, with new AI controls and new drawing member functions, add it to the factory, and create a level which calls the factory, asking for the enemies by name. Combine this method with an [[XML]] description of levels, and developers could create new levels without having to recompile their program. All this, thanks to the separation of creation of objects from the usage of objects.

Another example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdexcept&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;

class Pizza {
public:
    virtual int getPrice() const = 0;
};
 
class HamAndMushroomPizza : public Pizza {
public:
    virtual int getPrice() const { return 850; }
};
 
class DeluxePizza : public Pizza {
public:
    virtual int getPrice() const { return 1050; }
};
 
class HawaiianPizza : public Pizza {
public:
    virtual int getPrice() const { return 1150; }
};
 
class PizzaFactory {
public:
    enum PizzaType {
         HamMushroom,
         Deluxe,
         Hawaiian
    };
 
    static Pizza* createPizza(PizzaType pizzaType) {
        switch (pizzaType) {
            case HamMushroom:
                return new HamAndMushroomPizza();
            case Deluxe:
                return new DeluxePizza();
            case Hawaiian:
                return new HawaiianPizza();
        }
        throw &quot;invalid pizza type.&quot;;
    }
};
 
/*
 * Create all available pizzas and print their prices
 */
void pizza_information( PizzaFactory::PizzaType pizzatype )
{
	Pizza* pizza = PizzaFactory::createPizza(pizzatype);
	std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Price of &quot; &lt;&lt; pizzatype &lt;&lt; &quot; is &quot; &lt;&lt; pizza-&gt;getPrice() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	delete pizza;
}

int main ()
{
	pizza_information( PizzaFactory::HamMushroom );
	pizza_information( PizzaFactory::Deluxe );
	pizza_information( PizzaFactory::Hawaiian );
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Prototype ====
A prototype pattern is used in software development when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects. This pattern is used, for example, when the inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way (e.g., using the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword) is prohibitively expensive for a given application.

'''Implementation''': Declare an abstract base class that specifies a pure virtual &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; method. Any class that needs a &quot;polymorphic constructor&quot; capability derives itself from the abstract base class, and implements the &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; operation.

Here the client code first invokes the factory method. This factory method, depending on the parameter, finds out the concrete class.  On this concrete class, the &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; method is called and the object is returned by the factory method.

* This is sample code which is a sample implementation of Prototype method. We have the detailed description of all the components here.
** &lt;code&gt;Record&lt;/code&gt; class, which is a pure virtual class that has a pure virtual method &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt;.
** &lt;code&gt;CarRecord&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;BikeRecord&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PersonRecord&lt;/code&gt; as concrete implementation of a &lt;code&gt;Record&lt;/code&gt; class.
** An {{C++ Programming/kw|enum}} RECORD_TYPE_en as one to one mapping of each concrete implementation of &lt;code&gt;Record&lt;/code&gt; class.
** &lt;code&gt;RecordFactory&lt;/code&gt; class that has a &lt;code&gt;Factory&lt;/code&gt; method &lt;code&gt;CreateRecord(…)&lt;/code&gt;. This method requires an {{C++ Programming/kw|enum}} RECORD_TYPE_en as parameter and depending on this parameter it returns the concrete implementation of &lt;code&gt;Record&lt;/code&gt; class.

&lt;/source&gt;

Another example:

To implement the pattern, declare an abstract base class that specifies a pure virtual &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; member function. Any class that needs a &quot;polymorphic constructor&quot; capability derives itself from the abstract base class, and implements the &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; operation.

The client, instead of writing code that invokes the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; operator on a hard-wired class name, calls the &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; member function on the prototype, calls a factory member function with a parameter designating the particular concrete derived class desired, or invokes the &lt;code&gt;clone()&lt;/code&gt; member function through some mechanism provided by another design pattern.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 class CPrototypeMonster
 {
 protected:            
     CString           _name;
 public:
     CPrototypeMonster();
     CPrototypeMonster( const CPrototypeMonster&amp; copy );
     virtual ~CPrototypeMonster();
 
     virtual CPrototypeMonster*    Clone() const=0; // This forces every derived class to provide an overload for this function.
     void        Name( CString name );
     CString    Name() const;
 };

 class CGreenMonster : public CPrototypeMonster
 {
 protected: 
     int         _numberOfArms;
     double      _slimeAvailable;
 public:
     CGreenMonster();
     CGreenMonster( const CGreenMonster&amp; copy );
     ~CGreenMonster();
 
     virtual CPrototypeMonster*    Clone() const;
     void  NumberOfArms( int numberOfArms );
     void  SlimeAvailable( double slimeAvailable );
 
     int         NumberOfArms() const;
     double      SlimeAvailable() const;
 };

 class CPurpleMonster : public CPrototypeMonster
 {
 protected:
     int         _intensityOfBadBreath;
     double      _lengthOfWhiplikeAntenna;
 public:
     CPurpleMonster();
     CPurpleMonster( const CPurpleMonster&amp; copy );
     ~CPurpleMonster();
 
     virtual CPrototypeMonster*    Clone() const;
 
     void  IntensityOfBadBreath( int intensityOfBadBreath );
     void  LengthOfWhiplikeAntenna( double lengthOfWhiplikeAntenna );
 
     int       IntensityOfBadBreath() const;
     double    LengthOfWhiplikeAntenna() const;
 };

 class CBellyMonster : public CPrototypeMonster
 {
 protected:
     double      _roomAvailableInBelly;
 public:
     CBellyMonster();
     CBellyMonster( const CBellyMonster&amp; copy );
     ~CBellyMonster();
 
     virtual CPrototypeMonster*    Clone() const;
 
     void       RoomAvailableInBelly( double roomAvailableInBelly );
     double     RoomAvailableInBelly() const;
 };

 CPrototypeMonster* CGreenMonster::Clone() const
 {
     return new CGreenMonster(*this);
 }

 CPrototypeMonster* CPurpleMonster::Clone() const
 {
     return new CPurpleMonster(*this);
 }

 CPrototypeMonster* CBellyMonster::Clone() const
 {
     return new CBellyMonster(*this);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

A client of one of the concrete monster classes only needs a reference (pointer) to a 
&lt;code&gt;CPrototypeMonster&lt;/code&gt; class object to be able to call the ‘Clone’ function and create copies of that object. The function below demonstrates this concept:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 void DoSomeStuffWithAMonster( const CPrototypeMonster* originalMonster )
 {
     CPrototypeMonster* newMonster = originalMonster-&gt;Clone();
     ASSERT( newMonster );
 
     newMonster-&gt;Name(&quot;MyOwnMonster&quot;);
     // Add code doing all sorts of cool stuff with the monster.
     delete newMonster;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Now originalMonster can be passed as a pointer to CGreenMonster, CPurpleMonster or CBellyMonster.

==== Singleton ====
The term '''Singleton''' refers to an object that can only be instantiated once. This pattern is generally used where a global variable would have otherwise been used. The main advantage of the singleton is that its existence is guaranteed{{Citation needed}}.

{{TODO|This conflicts the below statement about creating the singleton on first use; it is likely inaccurate, whilst the use of a global object variable does guarantee existance since the global is created during loader init phase.  Rewording recommended.}}.

Other advantages of the design pattern include the clarity, from the unique access, that the object used is not on the local stack. Some of the downfalls of the object include that, like a global variable, it can be hard to tell what chunk of code corrupted memory, when a bug is found, since everyone has access to it.

{{TODO|Other pros/cons of the use of singletons.|C++ Programming}}

Let's take a look at how a Singleton differs from other variable types.

Like a global variable, the Singleton exists outside of the scope of any functions. Traditional implementation uses a static member function of the Singleton class, which will create a single instance of the Singleton class on the first call, and forever return that instance. The following code example illustrates the elements of a C++ singleton class, that simply stores a single string.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 class StringSingleton
 {
 public:
     // Some accessor functions for the class, itself
     std::string GetString() const 
     {return mString;}
     void SetString(const std::string &amp;newStr)
     {mString = newStr;}
 
     // The magic function, which allows access to the class from anywhere
     // To get the value of the instance of the class, call:
     //     StringSingleton::Instance().GetString();
     static StringSingleton &amp;Instance()
     {
         // This line only runs once, thus creating the only instance in existence
         static StringSingleton *instance = new StringSingleton;
         // dereferencing the variable here, saves the caller from having to use 
         // the arrow operator, and removes temptation to try and delete the 
         // returned instance.
         return *instance; // always returns the same instance
     }
 
 private: 
     // We need to make some given functions private to finish the definition of the singleton
     StringSingleton(){} // default constructor available only to members or friends of this class
 
     // Note that the next two functions are not given bodies, thus any attempt 
     // to call them implicitly will return as compiler errors. This prevents 
     // accidental copying of the only instance of the class.
     StringSingleton(const StringSingleton &amp;old); // disallow copy constructor
     const StringSingleton &amp;operator=(const StringSingleton &amp;old); //disallow assignment operator
 
     // Note that although this should be allowed, 
     // some compilers may not implement private destructors
     // This prevents others from deleting our one single instance, which was otherwise created on the heap
     ~StringSingleton(){} 
 private: // private data for an instance of this class
     std::string mString;
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

Variations of Singletons:

{{TODO|Discussion of Meyers Singleton and any other variations.|C++ Programming}}

Applications of Singleton Class:

One common use of the singleton design pattern is for application configurations. Configurations may need to be accessible globally, and future expansions to the application configurations may be needed. The subset C's closest alternative would be to create a single global ''&lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;''. This had the lack of clarity as to where this object was instantiated, as well as not guaranteeing the existence of the object. 

Take, for example, the situation of another developer using your singleton inside the constructor of their object. Then, yet another developer decides to create an instance of the second class in the global scope. If you had simply used a global variable, the order of linking would then matter. Since your global will be accessed, possibly before main begins executing, there is no definition as to whether the global is initialized, or the constructor of the second class is called first. This behavior can then change with slight modifications to other areas of code, which would change order of global code execution. Such an error can be very hard to debug. But, with use of the singleton, the first time the object is accessed, the object will also be created. You now have an object which will always exist, in relation to being used, and will never exist if never used.

A second common use of this class is in updating old code to work in a new architecture. Since developers may have used globals liberally, moving them into a single class and making it a singleton, can be an intermediary step to bring the program inline to stronger object oriented structure.

Another example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

/* Place holder for thread synchronization mutex */
class Mutex
{   /* placeholder for code to create, use, and free a mutex */
};

/* Place holder for thread synchronization lock */
class Lock
{   public:
        Lock(Mutex&amp; m) : mutex(m) { /* placeholder code to acquire the mutex */ }
        ~Lock() { /* placeholder code to release the mutex */ }
    private:
        Mutex &amp; mutex;
};

class Singleton
{   public:
        static Singleton* GetInstance();
        int a;
        ~Singleton() { cout &lt;&lt; &quot;In Destructor&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; }

    private:
        Singleton(int _a) : a(_a) { cout &lt;&lt; &quot;In Constructor&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; }
    

        static Mutex mutex;

        // Not defined, to prevent copying
        Singleton(const Singleton&amp; );
        Singleton&amp; operator =(const Singleton&amp; other);
};

Mutex Singleton::mutex;

Singleton* Singleton::GetInstance()
{
    Lock lock(mutex);

    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Get Instance&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;

    // Initialized during first access
    static Singleton inst(1);

    return &amp;inst;
}

int main()
{
    Singleton* singleton = Singleton::GetInstance();
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The value of the singleton: &quot; &lt;&lt; singleton-&gt;a &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|In the above example, the first call to &lt;code&gt;Singleton::GetInstance&lt;/code&gt; will initialize the singleton instance. This example is for illustrative purposes only; for anything but a trivial example program, this code contains errors.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. What is meant by the phrase “gas exchange”?
:''Gas exchange is the addition of oxygen to the blood and the removal of carbon dioxide.
''
2. Where does gas exchange take place?
:Gas exchange takes place in the'' alveoli of the lungs''.

3. What is the process by which oxygen moves from the alveoli into the blood?
:Oxygen moves from the alveoli into the blood by ''diffusion''.

4. Why does this process occur?
:''This process occurs because oxygen is at a much higher concentration in the alveoli than in the blood. Diffusion always occurs from a high to low concentration.
''
5. How does the structure of the alveoli make gas exchange efficient?
:''The thin walls of the alveoli and the capillaries give only a small distance for the oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse across making gas exchange efficient.
''
:6. How is oxygen carried in the blood?
:''Oxygen is carried in the blood combined with haemoglobin in the red blood cells''.

7. List the structures that air passes on its way from the nose to the alveoli:
:''On its way to the alveoli of the lungs air travels through the nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi and bronchioles''.

8. What is the function of the mucous and cilia lining the respiratory passages?
:''The mucus and cilia in the respiratory passages trap dust particles and transport them to the mouth and nose for expulsion.''

9. How do movements of the ribs and diaphragm bring about inspiration?
Circle the correct statement below.

:b) ''The diaphragm flattens and ribs move up and out.''


10. What is the function of the epiglottis?
:''The epiglottis closes the larynx during swallowing so that food cannot enter the trachea.''

11. What controls the rate of breathing?
:''The concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood controls the rate of breathing''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. The two layers that form the skin are the: ''epidermis and dermis''

2. The special protein deposited in epidermal cells to make them waterproof is ''keratin''

3. Skin structures made of keratin include ''scales, beaks, claws, nails, hoofs, hairs and feathers.''

4. Sweat, sebaceous and mammary glands are all ''exocrine glands''. ''Meaning they all have ducts through which they expel their products to the outside.''

5. The pigment deposited in skin cells that protects underlying skin layers from the harmful effects of the sun is ''melanin''.

6. The skin helps cool an animal down when it is active or in a hot environment ''by producing sweat and dilating the  capillaries in the dermis'' 

7. The skin helps prevent heat loss when an animal is in a cold environment by:
:''a) contraction of the hair erector muscles to make the hairs stand up and trap an insulating layer of air.''
:b) ''constriction of the capillaries in the dermis to reduce heat loss through the body surface.''

:On second thought, I've replaced them with inclusions. That way, each version of the same material will have the same edit history. When you click 'edit' on the [[History of Greece/Contents/Mycenaean Civilization]] page, you are sent to [[Ancient History/Greece/Mycenaean Civilization]], and actually are editing there.

      <comment>/* Garbage collection */ fixed again</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Garbage collection ==
Garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector or collector attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory used by objects that will never be accessed or mutated again by the application.

Tracing garbage collectors require some implicit runtime overhead that may be beyond the control of the programmer, and can sometimes lead to performance problems. For example, commonly used Stop-The-World garbage collectors, which pause program execution at arbitrary times, may make garbage collecting languages inappropriate for some embedded systems, high-performance server software, and applications with real-time needs.

A more fundamental issue is that garbage collectors violate locality of reference, since they deliberately go out of their way to find bits of memory that haven't been accessed recently. The performance of modern computer architectures is increasingly tied to caching, which depends on the assumption of locality of reference for its effectiveness. Some garbage collection methods result in better locality of reference than others. Generational garbage collection is relatively cache-friendly, and copying collectors automatically defragment memory helping to keep related data together. Nonetheless, poorly timed garbage collection cycles could have a severe performance impact on some computations, and for this reason many runtime systems provide mechanisms that allow the program to temporarily suspend, delay or activate garbage collection cycles.

Despite these issues, for many practical purposes, allocation/deallocation-intensive algorithms implemented in modern garbage collected languages can actually be faster than their equivalents using explicit memory management (at least without heroic optimizations by an expert programmer). A major reason for this is that the garbage collector allows the runtime system to amortize allocation and deallocation operations in a potentially advantageous fashion. For example, consider the following program in C++:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
 
class A {
  int x;
public:
  A() { x = 0; ++x; }
};
 
int main() {
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000000; ++i) {
   A *a = new A();
   delete a;
 }
 std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;DING!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

One of more widely used libraries that provides this function is [http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/ Hans Boehm's conservative GC].  As we have seen earlier C++ also supports a powerful idiom called [[C++ Programming/RAII|''RAII (resource acquisition is initialization)'']] that can be used to safely and automatically manage resources including memory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. What is the difference between tissue fluid and lymph?  ''Tissue fluid is the fluid that has leaked out of the capillaries into the spaces around the cells of the tissues. Lymph is tissue fluid that has entered the lymphatic system i.e. the difference is largely one of location.''

2. By what route does lymph make its way back to join the blood of the circulatory system?  ''Lymph makes it way back to join the blood in the circulatory system via the lymphatic capillaries, lymphatic vessels, at least one lymph node and the thoracic duct. The lymph then joins the blood in veins that carry it back to the heart.''

3. As the lymphatic system has no heart to push the lymph along what makes it flow? ''As the lymphatic system has no heart to push the lymph along it is pushed along mainly by the contraction of skeletal muscles that lie alongside the lymphatics.''

4. What happens to the lymph as it passes through a lymph node? ''As the lymph passes through a lymph node, bacteria and debris are filtered from it and lymphocytes are added to it.'' 

5. Where is the spleen located in the body? ''The spleen is found in the abdomen alongside and slightly caudal to the stomach.''

6. Where is the thymus located in the body?  The thymus gland is located in the thorax beneath the sternum and just cranial to the heart.''

7. What is the function of lymphocytes?  ''Lymphocytes defend the body from invasion by microorganisms. Some attach to the organisms directly while others produce antibodies that circulate in the blood and attack them.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. Name the four different kinds of teeth
:''The four different kinds of teeth are incisors, canines, premolars and molars.''

2. Give 2 facts about how the teeth of cats and dogs are adapted for a carnivorous diet
:''The teeth of cats and dogs are adapted for a carnivorous diet with small chisel shaped incisors for biting off flesh, sharp canines for holding and killing prey and carnassials for shearing flesh.''

3. What does saliva do to the food?
:''Saliva lubricates food for swallowing and contains an enzyme for breaking down starch''.

4. What is peristalsis?
:''Peristalsis is the waves of smooth muscle contraction that pass down the gut and move the food along''.

5. What happens to the food in the stomach?
:''In the stomach food is churned and mixed and gastric juice that contains enzymes to digest proteins is added. Hydrochloric acid to make the stomach contents acidic for the protein digesting enzymes is also added here''.

6. What is chyme?
:''Chyme is the liquefied and partially digested food that passes down the gut''.

7. Where does the chyme go after leaving the stomach?
:''The chyme enters the small intestine after leaving the stomach.''

8. What are villi and what do they do?
:''Villi are the small finger-like projections from the wall of the small intestine that increase the surface area for the absorption into the blood of the digested nutrients.''

9. What happens in the small intestine?
:''In the small intestine food is digested and resulting nutrients are absorbed into the blood via the villi''.

10. Where is the pancreas and what does it do?
:''The pancreas is situated in the first bend of the duodenum after it leaves the stomach. It produces pancreatic juice that contains enzymes for digesting carbohydrates, fats and proteins.''

11. How does the caecum of rabbits differ from that of cats?
:''In rabbits the caecum is enlarged to form a functional caecum that contains microorganisms for breaking down the cellulose walls of plants. Note that because of the position of the functional caecum at the end of the gut animals like the rabbit eat their faeces to take advantage of the digested nutrients.''

12. How does the liver help control the glucose levels in the blood?
:''The liver helps control the glucose levels in the blood by converting the glucose to glycogen that it stores. This is then released when blood glucose levels are low. The hormone insulin produced by the pancreas controls this process.''

13. Give 2 other functions of the liver
:''Other functions of the liver include the detoxification of toxic substances like alcohol, storing iron and production of bile, proteins, vitamin A and heat''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Static and Dynamic Libraries ===
Libraries come in two forms, either in ''source form'' or in ''compiled/binary form''. Libraries in source-form must first be compiled before they can be included in another project. This will transform the libraries' cpp-files into a lib-file. If a program must be recompiled to run with a new version of a library, but does not need any further changes, the library is said to be ''source compatible''. If a program does not need to be modified and recompiled to use a new version of a library, the library is then classified as being ''binary compatible''.

Advantages of using static binaries:
* Simplification of program distribution (fewer files).
* Code simplification (no version checks as required in dynamic libraries).
* Will only compile the code that is used. 

Disadvantages of using static binaries:
* Waste of resources: Generates larger binaries, since the library is compiled into the executable. Wastes memory as the library cannot be shared (in memory) between processes (depending on the operating system).
* Program will not benefit from bug fixes or extensions in the libraries without being recompiled.

;Binary/Source Compatibility of libraries
A library is said to be '''binary compatible''' if the program that dynamically links to an earlier version of that library, continues to work using another versions of the same library. If a recompilation of the program is needed for it to run with each new version the library is said to be '''source compatible'''.

Producing binary compatible libraries is beneficial for distribution but harder to maintain by the programmer. It is often seen as a better solution to do static linking, if the library is only source compatible, since it will not cause problems to the end-user.  

Binary compatibility saves a lot of trouble and is a signal that the library reached a status of stability. It makes it easier to distribute software for a certain platform. Without ensuring binary compatibility between releases, people will be forced to offer statically linked binaries.

;header-only libraries
Another distinction that is commonly made about libraries are on how they are distributed (regarding structure and use). A library that is contained only on header files is considered header-only library. Often this means that they are simpler and easy to use, however this will not be the ideal solution for complex code, it will not only hamper readability but result in larger compile times. Also depending on the compiler and it's optimizing capabilities (or options) can, due to the resulting inlining, generate larger binaries. This may not be as important in libraries mostly implemented with templates. Header-only libraries will always contain the source code to the implementation, commercial is rare.

2. Match the following descriptions with the choices given in the list below.
:accessory glands | vas deferens or sperm duct | penis | scrotum | fallopian tube | testes | urethra | vagina | uterus | ovary | vulva

:a) The ''penis'' delivers semen to the female vagina.
:b) The sperm are produced in the ''testes''.
:c) The ''vas deferens'' or ''sperm duct'' is the passage for sperm from the epididymis to the penis.
:d) The ''urethra'' carries both sperm and urine down the penis.
:e) ''Accessory glands'' produce secretions that make up most of the semen.
:f) The ''scrotum'' is the bag of skin surrounding the testes.
:g) The foetus develops in the ''uterus''.
:h) The ''vagina'' receives the penis during copulation.
:i) Fertilisation usually occurs in the ''fallopian tube''.
:j) Ova travel along the ''fallopian tube'' to reach the uterus.
:k) The ova are produced in the ''ovary''.
:l) The ''vulva'' is the external opening of the vagina.

3. Which hormone is described in each statement below?
:a) ''Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)'' stimulates the growth of the follicles in the ovary.
:b) ''Luteinising hormone (LH'') converts the empty follicle into the corpus luteum and stimulates  it to produce progesterone.
:c) ''Oestrogen'' is produced by the cells of the follicle.
:d) ''Progesterone'' is produced by the corpus luteum.
:e) ''Oestrogen'' causes the mammary glands to develop.
:f) ''Progesterone'' prepares the lining of the uterus to receive a fertilised ovum.

4. State whether the following statements are true or false. If false write in the correct answer.

a) Fertilisation of the egg occurs in the uterus.

h) Colostrum is the first milk. 
:''True''.
i) Young animals often have to be given calcium supplements because milk contains very little calcium.
:''False.  Milk contains lots of calcium. What it lacks is iron and this often has to be given as a supplement''.

{{:Ancient History/Greece/Introduction}}
[[Image:Epanastasi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Revolutionaries bless the Greek flag.]]The Greek peninsula resisted [[History of Greece/Roman Greece|Roman rule]], until it was organized into the Roman province of Achaea in 27 BCE by Augustus. Throughout history, conquerors have imposed their culture upon the vanquished, but the Roman annexation of Greece was perhaps one of history's most-influential exceptions to this rule. In the words of the Roman poet Horace, &quot;''Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit''&quot; (&quot;Greece took captive her conqueror.&quot;). The Romans adopted nearly every aspect of Greek culture, allowing it to continue to thrive much as it had done for centuries. During this time period, Christianity began to rise, and Greece was one of the first areas of the Roman Empire to be heavily influenced by the new religion.

When Emperor Constantine I moved the capital of the Roman Empire to Constantinople in 330, Greece experienced a revival of its economic power, becoming one of the richest areas of the [[History of Greece/Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Empire]] that was created by the Roman Empire's split in 305. After more than a thousand years of Byzantine rule, the Ottoman Empire in nearby Asia Minor began to rise in power, eventually capturing Constantinople in 1453. By 1460, Greece was under [[History of Greece/Ottoman Greece|Ottoman control]]. As the Ottoman Empire gradually weakened, the Greeks were influenced by the growing nationalist movements throughout Europe during the early nineteenth century. In 1821, they rose up, and gained [[History of Greece/Independent Greece|independence]], leading to the creation of the [[History of Greece/Modern Greece|modern Greek state]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, This site is being created as part of a graduate course in Distance Education. We are planning to finish it on 21st January. We've been receiving comments regarding the style of the book. We fully agree with this and will try to change this. Thank you for your patience. Any tips are welcome because we are still learning and hope to contribute more in the future! thanks
== &lt;u&gt;'''&quot;Welcome!&quot;'''&lt;/u&gt; ==
Looks like this is a class project. If you guys need something, just ask (the [[WB:ADMIN|admins]] are usually around). If you like, you can help us keep track of class projects by registering this one at [[Wikibooks:List of class projects]]. This way, the regulars will know that you're working as a group on this project and we can better help out. A good starting point for anyone involved in this is [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]] - just a quick primer so you know how things are done around here.

Finally, if there's an instructor or group leader, please identify them to us as such. Having a single contact point makes life much easier.

I hope all of you find this as exciting a project as I (and the other folks here) do. My [[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|talk page]] is always available if you need anything, or [[WB:HELP]] is read by the community at large. Happy editing! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:17, 21 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is life? The exact definition even Biologists have trouble explaining! But living things have a life, a length of time to live. Living things need the following:

1) Living things need to take in energy.

2) Living things get rid of waste.

3) Living things grow and develop.

4) Living things respond to their environment.

5) Living things reproduce and pass their traits onto their offspring.

6) Over time, living things evolve (change slowly) in response to their environment.


Life is every system that resists entropy on account of the surrounding environment.

=== Primaries ===
Virginia has an open primary system, meaning that one can vote in both the Democratic and Republican primaries, without having to be a member of either party.

I am not certain that this is a &quot;valid&quot; wikibook and will ask around.  Equally please follow the naming conventions of wikibooks which requires a &quot;/&quot; separator rather than &quot;:&quot;.

== [[How to modify BCD when installing a previous version of Windows onto a computer running Windows Vista]] ==

This doesn't look to me like a textbook. I know we have other software manuals, so I'm waiting for another admin to offer their opinion. As well, it seems you've copied this from another website. We can't accept copyrighted content, even when published on an online forum. Whenever someone writes something, they own copyright to it unless they release it into the public domain or license it. I can find no re-licensing, so this material is a [[WB:COPYVIO|copyright violation]] as well. If I'm wrong about any of this, please let me know on my talk page. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:09, 20 January 2008 (UTC)q</text>

Looking to get a few classified...

* Poison - Talk Dirty to Me (easy?  Difficult solo?)
* Paint It, Black (good lead...)

Pretty much cherry picking from Guitar Hero 3...

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;

this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

:{{keep}} ('''weak'''), the topic is certainly textbook-worthy, and we usually don't delete relevant stubs simply because they are stubs, however this one has been stagnant for a rather long time and has little content aside from the external links (there is one page on actual programming, I can't tell how good it is since I know nothing about Delphi), and I'm not sure what the prospects are of it being expanded.

:{{keep}} I'm with matt. this is a stub, and we don't delete stubs. If we have a problems with the list of links, delete the links. We should have a book about delphi, and maybe we should find  some people who would be interested in contributing to this book, or donating content to this book. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:55, 13 January 2008 (UTC)
:{{keep}} (partial) Boy, is AdRiley ever right. I have never seen a book that could give us a rather poor reputation (save for Pilingual Primer). However, I would keep [[Programming:Delphi/Statements|this page]] because its content ''is'' useful. The links could be an appendix, in my opinion. In shorter terms, adjust the formatting. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 22:39, 13 January 2008 (UTC)
{{comment}} In response to Matt's question on how good the actual page about programming is, the answer is very poor.  It teaches you how to print text to the screen, and that is it.  It is actually a page from this table [[Computer_programming#Common_concepts]] which seems to have been turned into a book of it's own.  I agree with Whiteknight we should have a book about delphi, but at the moment we don't, and we can't go putting placeholders in for all the books that we ''should'' have.  Or if we do they should at least have some sort of structure for people to add to.
I agree we should not delete stubs, but this book has been in this state for a long time.  See some of the talk comments from 2 years ago [[Talk:Programming:Delphi]].  If I delete the external links out of it, which I think we should if this vote fails, then we are left with nothing useful...  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 08:01, 14 January 2008 (UTC)

:'''Keep''' - As everybody has said, this is a stub of a book.  I looked in the history of the &quot;main page&quot; of the book, and I'll have to say that they are all completely relevant in terms of external references that should be used for developing either a Wikipedia article or for obtaining information about the programming language.  There is (or was) a HUGE development community for programming in Delphi, and I could defend each and every one of these links as a very legitimate source of information.  I, for the life of me, don't understand why the concern here about this becoming a link farm... if you use the justification for a link farm meaning something that adds little or no value to the topic and doesn't provide any additional information.  All of the recent edits just show ignorance about the topic and nothing more.... including this VfD.  No doubt that some serious improvement of this into something resembling a book could happen, and it is unfortunate that nobody else has come along to try and clean it up.&lt;p&gt;If there is a silver lining to even bringing this book up for VfD... it at least advertises that the book exists at all, and there is a huge need for somebody to come in and make it work.  I may try to pick up that gauntlet, as I do know a thing or two about this programming language and environment.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 11:38, 16 January 2008 (UTC)
::In all fairness, I certainly didn't ask for the links to be removed wholesale. I said &quot;clean them up&quot; which means leave behind the relevant ones.

I am rather unsure about this but my attention was drawn to it by [[user:Laleena|Laleena]] and I felt the community should comment.
[[User:Tannersf]] had a tendency to create rather large new works (he is apparently inactive now).  However they took the form of what can best be described as a skeleton only.  Most pages in the book have no real content.  It would be a great book if it was being worked on at all.  As it is it is a rather large set of effectively template pages.  I'll not get involved in the discussion &amp; I have no vote.  Some of his other work may bear review - [[Solar System]] is quite similar --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:03, 14 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{Del}} - as Herby notes, no real content. --- &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:28, 14 January 2008 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''{{{2|Delete}}}''' the parts that are &quot;template-style&quot; pages with no content (all of the ones for the specific to a single volcano) but {{keep}} the intro pages. The original idea for this textbook should be scrapped. New vision: this covers the geology/earth science of volcanoes, but nothing about specific, individual volcanoes (that would be a [[WB:NOTWP|macropedia]]). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:40, 14 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{del}} it's about 110 empty pages about volcanos. The original author has abandoned it, and there is no saying that the next author (if it ever attracts a new author) will want to keep all 100 pages as they have been laid out here. Simply having these pages here is going to act as a deterrent to future contributors. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:42, 14 January 2008 (UTC)
**The book on Solar System is even emptier, with almost every single page completely empty aside from section headers, yet your vote differs... could you expound? --- &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:53, 14 January 2008 (UTC)
*{{del}} Don't get me wrong, I simply ''love'' volcanoes (correct spelling in my dictionary), but when you see no actual content (though a reasonable outline) things are wrong. However, I plan on working through a stub on volcanoes in my [[User:Laleena/Workshop|workshop]], perhaps even a textbook. However, I promise to make it substantial. Thanks, [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 01:27, 15 January 2008 (UTC)

Hello, my name is Jeremy McCracken. I have a wide range of interests, but tend to learn a great deal about them. They include:

*Any social studies subject, particularly local history of my area (Akron, Ohio)
*Computer science, particularly history
*Paranormal and hauntings
*Disasters

I'll be writing on some of these in the future.

==To-do==
I'm still working on the [[Parapsychology]] book. It's coming along well, but could still use other people's input (unless, of course, you alter the wording to say that the definition of parapsychology is &quot;a fake science&quot;. People do that on Wikipedia; learn to be neutral.)

Parapsychology IS a fake 'science'. Not a question of neutrality, but of complete lack of evidence!

I saw this quote on wikipedia and liked it:

{{quote|
In the heated conversation going on, one harsh critic said:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;It is not objectively proven to exist, and there is no mechanism known to science by which it can exist.&quot; This actually is true. But his attitude of ridiculing something that has been functionally used by public institutions, and well documented as such, is unprofessional and he should take he pet peeves to some other article. Actually, although people have wierd theories, nobody knows the mechanism for gravity to work. But, the apple still falls with the observed mathmatical predicted speed as developed by Sir Issac Newton.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Remote viewing is not standard science because it can not pass the tests of the scientific method. But working practical use has been made based on the current status of a functioning working theory that has been proved at least statistically significant by those who have funded serious projects that produced working results. This article can state what Remote Viewing is by those who created, used, and supported the term. After all, even if you do not belive it to be true, and this is all some big hoax, including all the documents of the United States Government, it still has a definition in detail that belongs in Wikipedia.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Running a big red virtual marker through it and calling it &quot;horsefeathers&quot; is just childish behaviour and borders on libel against the working careers of professionls who have spent decades working on this and producing documentation. Nobody is saying this is proven science, but nobody should mass delete valuable reference information, or be crude and insulting, because they have a personal vendetta that this all somehow just can not have anything to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Operations research or operational research (OR) is an interdisciplinary branch of mathematics which uses methods like mathematical modeling, statistics, and algorithms to arrive at optimal or good decisions in complex problems which are concerned with optimizing the maxima (profit, faster assembly line, greater crop yield, higher bandwidth, etc) or minima (cost loss, lowering of risk, etc) of some objective function. The eventual intention behind using operations research is to elicit a best possible solution to a problem mathematically, which improves or optimizes the performance of the system.

This book is intended for both mathematics students and also for those interested in the subject from a management point of view.

[[Image:Runny hunny.jpg|thumb|Scones with honey. Jam is also a favoured topping.]]
[[Image:Scones.JPG|thumb|Scones are also commonly served with jam and clotted cream (commonly known as a cream tea).]]

The '''scone''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|British]] snack of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Scotland|Scottish]] origin. A scone is a small quickbread made of [[cookbook:wheat|wheat]], [[cookbook:barley|barley]] or [[cookbook:oatmeal|oatmeal]], usually with [[cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]] as a [[cookbook:Leavening Agent|leavening agent]]. British scones are often lightly sweetened, but may also be savoury. In the U.S., scones are drier and larger, and typically sweet.

British scones closely resemble a North American [[cookbook:biscuit|biscuit]] (many recipes are actually identical) &amp;mdash; itself not to be confused with the English biscuit, which equates to the American ''[[cookbook:cookie|cookie]]''. In the United States, there is a growing tendency to refer to sweet variations as &quot;scones&quot; (perhaps under influence from espresso bars, where they are popular fare), while those eaten as part of savoury meals are known as &quot;biscuits&quot;. American &quot;scones&quot; are often baked to a dry and somewhat crumbly texture, and are typically large and rectangular; more like a cross between a cookie and a muffin than a biscuit. In Canada, both tend to be called &quot;biscuits&quot; or &quot;tea biscuits&quot;.

==Varieties==
British scones frequently include [[cookbook:raisin|raisin]]s, [[cookbook:currant|currant]]s, [[cookbook:cheese|cheese]] or [[cookbook:date|dates]]. In the United States, scones sold by coffee shops often include fillings such as [[cookbook:cranberry|cranberries]], [[cookbook:blueberry|blueberries]], [[cookbook:nut|nut]]s, or even [[cookbook:chocolate chip|chocolate chip]]s. However, most fillings tend to be spices, including [[cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]] and [[cookbook:Poppy Seed|poppy seeds]]. In both Britain and the U.S., mass-produced scones tend to be doughier than home-made scones.

[[Image:Scone varieties.jpg|thumb|left|Clockwise from bottom: Hot buttered tattie scones next to a cheese scone, shiny and flat treacle scones, and a milk scone above a fruit scone.]]
In Scotland and Northern Ireland, savoury varieties of scone include ''soda scones'', also known as soda farls, and [[cookbook:Tattie scone|potato scones]], normally known as tattie scones, which resemble small, thin savoury [[cookbook:pancake|pancake]]s made with potato flour]and resemble the Jewish latke. Potato scones are most commonly served fried in full a Scottish breakfast or an Ulster fry.

The scone is a basic component of the cream tea or Devonshire tea.

The griddle scone is a variety of scone which is [[cookbook:frying|fried]] rather than [[cookbook:baking|baked]]. In some countries one may also encounter savoury varieties of scone which may contain or be topped with combinations of [[cookbook:cheese|cheese]], [[cookbook:onion|onion]], [[cookbook:bacon|bacon]] etc.

Other common terms include dropped scone, or drop scone, after the method of dropping the batter onto the griddle or frying pan to cook it. 

[[Image:Buttermilk-Scones-batch.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A fresh batch of homemade English buttermilk scones.]]

==Preparation==
According to American food guru Alton Brown, scones are prepared according to the &quot;biscuit method&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Alton |title=I'm Just Here for More Food |year=2004 |publisher=Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang |location=New York |id=ISBN 978-1-58479-341-0 |pages=146&amp;mdash;147}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involves &quot;cutting&quot; or &quot;rubbing&quot; the butter or other fat into the dry ingredients before adding the wet ingredients to form the dough. The dough is then shaped, and scones are cut out, placed on a baking sheet, and baked in a hot oven. As mentioned above, drop scones and griddle scones are instead fried on a griddle.

*[http://www.getmecooking.com/recipe/plain-scone Plain scone recipe with photographs per step, from GetMeCooking.com]


==Ingredients==

*2 cups cake flour, more as needed
*1/2 teaspoon salt
*2 teaspoons baking powder
*3 tablespoons sugar
*5 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pieces
*1 egg
*1/2 to 3/4 cup heavy cream, more for brushing

==Procedure==

1.  Heat the oven to 230C/450F. Put the flour, salt, baking powder and 2 tablespoons of the sugar in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles cornmeal.

2. Add the egg and just enough cream to form a slightly sticky dough. If it’s too sticky, add a little flour, but very little; it should still stick a little to your hands.

3. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead once or twice, then press it into a 3/4-inch-thick circle and cut into 2-inch rounds with a biscuit cutter or glass. Put the rounds on an ungreased baking sheet. Gently reshape the leftover dough and cut again. Brush the top of each scone with a bit of cream and sprinkle with a little of the remaining sugar.

4. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the scones are a beautiful golden brown. Serve immediately.

Yield: 8 to 10 scones.

This section is a collection of useful Rails examples.

== important note ==
rails command now start with '''&quot;rails&quot;''' and not ''&quot;script/&quot;''

== Step By Step ==

=== How to Add a New Table ===
&lt;pre&gt;
script/generate model &lt;Name&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Generate the empty model and migration file.

&lt;pre&gt;
vi db/migrate/XXX_create_&lt;Name&gt;.rb
&lt;/pre&gt;
Add columns to the table.

&lt;pre&gt;
rake db:migrate
&lt;/pre&gt;
Migrates the data level - that is - creates the new database table.

&lt;pre&gt;
vi app/models/&lt;Name&gt;.rb
&lt;/pre&gt;
Define the validations, sizes, etc.

&lt;pre&gt;
vi test/unit/&lt;Name&gt;_test.rb
&lt;/pre&gt;
Define the unit tests that exercises the model validations.


If there will be a controller (and views) associated with this Model:
&lt;pre&gt;script/generate controller &lt;Name&gt; &lt;action_one&gt; &lt;action_two&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;
Creates the controller and creates a view for each action.

== Find ==

The find method of ActiveRecord is documented in the [http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M001376 Rails API manual]

&lt;code&gt;pet = Pet.find(pet_id)&lt;/code&gt; Find record by '''id''' (an integer). 
'''Note:''' Returns one object. pet_id should be primary number.

&lt;code&gt;pets = Pet.find(:first, :conditions =&gt; [&quot;owner_id = ?&quot;, owner_id])&lt;/code&gt; - returns the '''first''' matching record. 
[Note: Returns one object.]

&lt;code&gt;pets = Pet.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; [&quot;owner_id = ?&quot;, owner_id])&lt;/code&gt; - find all records with a given '''field value'''.  [Notes: 1. Returns an array of objects. Check for no records found with: &lt;tt&gt;pets.empty?&lt;/tt&gt;. 2.&lt;tt&gt;:conditions =&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; supplies an SQL fragment used with'' &lt;tt&gt;WHERE *&lt;/tt&gt;]

&lt;code&gt;pets = Pet.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; [&quot;owner_id = ? AND name = ?&quot;, owner_id, name])&lt;/code&gt; - find all records matching '''multiple field values'''.  [Note: &lt;tt&gt;OR&lt;/tt&gt; also works.]

&lt;code&gt;pets = Pet.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; [&quot;name LIKE ?&quot;, &quot;Fido%&quot;])&lt;/code&gt; - find all records '''matching a pattern'''.  Wild cards are &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; for zero or more of any character, and &lt;tt&gt;_&lt;/tt&gt; for any single character.  To escape a wild card use &lt;tt&gt;\%&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;\_&lt;/tt&gt;. The reference from [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/string-comparison-functions.html#operator_like MySQL] for LIKE will help. On the [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/regexp.html MySQL Regex website] you will find examples for using REGEX.

&lt;code&gt;pets = Pet.find(:all, :order =&gt; 'name')&lt;/code&gt; - find everything and '''sort result''' by name.

&lt;code&gt;pets = Pet.find(:all, :limit =&gt; 10, :conditions =&gt; [&quot;owner_id = ?&quot;, owner_id])&lt;/code&gt; - returns no more than the number of rows specified by ''':limit'''.

&lt;code&gt;pets = Pet.find(:all, :offset =&gt; 50, :limit =&gt; 10)&lt;/code&gt; - uses '''offset''' to skip the first 50 rows.

== Rake ==

=== Migrations ===

&lt;code&gt;$ rake db:migrate&lt;/code&gt; - migrate to latest level by executing scripts in &lt;tt&gt;&lt;app&gt;/db/migrate&lt;/tt&gt;.  
'''Note:''' Migration scripts are created by &lt;tt&gt;script/generate model &lt;mod-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Testing ===

&lt;code&gt;$ rake&lt;/code&gt; - run all tests.

&lt;code&gt;$ rake test:functionals&lt;/code&gt; - run the functional tests, which test the controllers.

&lt;code&gt;$ rake test:units&lt;/code&gt; - run the unit tests, which test the models.

&lt;code&gt;$ test/functional/&lt;name&gt;_controller_test.rb&lt;/code&gt; - run one functional test.

=== Documentation ===

&lt;code&gt;$ rake doc:app&lt;/code&gt; - generate [http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html Ruby Docs] for the application.  Docs are placed at &lt;tt&gt;&lt;app&gt;/doc/app/index.html&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Clean Up ===

&lt;code&gt;$ rake log:clear&lt;/code&gt; - delete all logs.

&lt;code&gt;$ rake tmp:clear&lt;/code&gt; - delete temporary files.

== Server ==

&lt;code&gt;$ script/server&lt;/code&gt; - start the web server for this app.  By default, the server is running in development mode. By default, it will be accessible at web address: http://localhost:3000/

&lt;code&gt;$ RAILS_ENV=test script/server&lt;/code&gt; - start the web server in Test Mode.

&lt;code&gt;$ script/server -e test&lt;/code&gt; - start the web server in Test Mode.

&lt;code&gt;$ script/server -e production&lt;/code&gt; - start the web server in Production Mode (more caching, etc.).


== Fixing Errors ==

=== can't convert Fixnum to String ===

&lt;code&gt;some_number.to_s&lt;/code&gt; - every Fixnum has method &lt;tt&gt;.to_s&lt;/tt&gt; to convert it to a String.

== Shell Commands ==

Certain useful shell commands that I'm always trying to remember:

&lt;code&gt;grep -r hello .&lt;/code&gt; - run grep, searching for 'hello', on every file in the tree starting with the current directory.

&lt;code&gt;tar -cvzf archive.tgz &lt;targ_directory&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - tar up directory and compress it with gzip.

Hello, reader. You have come to the right place if you wish to learn about volcanoes. An excellent resource on volcanoes is [[w:Volcano|Wikipedia's article on volcanoes]], which will provide interesting information about different kinds of volcanoes. You might be curious what a volcano is. According to [[wikt:Volcano|Wiktionary]], a volcano is &quot;a mountain that contains a magma chamber attached to the mantle of the planet or moon and which periodically erupts forth, usually explosively, with lava and volcanic gases.&quot; There are many volcanoes, both active or dormant and extinct. You will find very few entries in this book pertaining to specific volcanoes, although you can head to Wikipedia for any volcano you wish to know about.

This book covers volcanoes, how they erupt, where you can find them, and other interesting things about volcanoes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to use a web service to create charts.

== Method ==
In this example we will use the Google Chart web service: [http://code.google.com/apis/chart *].  Users are each allowed to generate up to 50,000 charts per day. 

=== Parameters ===

The Google Chart application takes several parameters from the URL.  For a simple Pie Chart these might include:

&lt;pre&gt;
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?
cht=p
&amp;chd=t:10,20,30,40,20
&amp;chl=Amount|Indicator|Code|Date|Text
&amp;chs=400x300
&lt;/pre&gt;

Where:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - is the Chart API's base URL&lt;br/&gt;
The ampersand (&amp;) separates parameters.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;cht=p&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a code for the chart's type. For example p=2D Pie Chart and p3-3D Pie Chart&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;chd=t:10,20,30,40&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the chart's data using t format (t:10,20,30) or s format where (s:) a=1 and z=26&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;chs=400x300&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - is the chart's size in pixels.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;chl&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;=Amount|Indicator|Code|Date|Text are the labels for the Pie Chart.&lt;br/&gt;

Our next step is to put these REST parameters into an XForms instance and hook the instance up to input controls.

=== Pie Chart Parameters in XML instance ===

Here are the parameters for a piechart type, data, label and size information.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:instance id=&quot;chart-params&quot; xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
   &lt;data&gt;
      &lt;cht/&gt;
      &lt;chd/&gt;
      &lt;chl/&gt;
      &lt;chs/&gt;
   &lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/xf:instance&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Chart Submission ===
We will submit our XForms data to the server using the following submission statement.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:submission id=&quot;get-chart&quot;
   method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;http://chart.apis.google.com/chart&quot;  
   separator=&quot;&amp;amp;&quot; ref=&quot;instance('chart-params')&quot; replace=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Binding Rules ===

Here is a sample input form for chart parameters:
[[Image:xforms-generated-google-chart.jpg|center|frame|Input to Chart Generated by Google Charts]]

Here is a sample output chart generated form this application.
[[Image:xforms-generated-google-chart2.png|center|frame|Chart Generate by Google Charts]]

== Sample XForms Application on Google Code == 

[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/12a-graphics/3-google-charts/google-pie-chart.xhtml Execute]

== Sample Program ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

            xf|input, xf|select1 {display:block; margin:5px 0;}
            
            /* this puts the labels in 200px columns and right aligns them */
            xf|input &gt; xf|label, xf|select1 &gt; xf|label
            {text-align:right; padding-right:10px; width:200px; float:left; text-align:right;}

                    &lt;chl&gt;Amount|Indicators|Code|Date|Text&lt;/chl&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
            &lt;/xf:instance&gt;

                separator=&quot;&amp;amp;&quot; ref=&quot;instance('chart-params')&quot; replace=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;!-- put the cursor in the first field when the form becomes ready --&gt;

            &lt;xf:label&gt;Data: (t:5,10,20): &lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:input&gt;
        
        &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;chl&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Labels: (A|B) &lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:input&gt;
        
        &lt;xf:submit submission=&quot;get-chart&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Create Chart&lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:submit&gt;
        
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==

This is actually one of the most simple applications.  Google Charts has five chart types and hundreds of combinations of parameters.
The Chart Types are (cht)

#Line charts
#Bar charts
#Pie charts
#Venn diagrams
#Scatter plots

One way to test these is to generate a variety of charts with some sample XForms.

== about deleting MegaUniversity ==

Hi, I am making wikibook &quot;MegaUniversity&quot; for my university class project, but actually the page is deleted, I do not why?

and in addtion, I mistakenly created 2 URL &quot;MegaUniverstiy&quot; and &quot;Megaunicersity&quot;
Is there any way to delet one (the latter one &quot; Megauniversity&quot;)totally, it means delet title itself.

Since I have to make the front page &quot;MegaUniversity&quot; for my classmate to bridge their links for creating each chapter, I do not wanna delet the page &quot;MegaUniversity&quot;(the former one). I am very sorry, but I am a totally begginer to do this, would you let me know what I should do for not deleting the content??&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:G096016|G096016]] ([[User talk:G096016|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/G096016|contribs]]) 18:20, January 13, 2008.&lt;/small&gt;

I will be watching the development of these pages; as you develop them, if it is clear that they don't fit within [[WB:WIW|project scope]], then I will delete them again, [[WB:SPEEDY|per policy]].

Hi saw your message on the page I started.  Sorry this was a test page to see how the idea of parallel Latin English would work.  The idea is a collaborative project to translate a wide range of source material from Latin (or indeed Greek) into English using parallel text, with notes and references to help beginners and also to get more classical texts into the public domain.  I have a sneaking suspicion that I came to the wrong place &amp; there is something called Wikisource that I should have used.  Let me know.  This was just a test anyway.  [[User:Ockham|Ockham]] ([[User talk:Ockham|talk]]) 07:36, 16 January 2008 (UTC)
:Hi there. Unless the end result is going to be a textbook (this sounds more like a translation) then either Wikisource or Wiktionary would be my bet. There's no rush to move things elsewhere. You should ask an admin for those projects what they think - whether this would be a good fit there. I'm not well-versed in the intricacies of other projects' inclusion policies, so I can't help out too much. Happy editing. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:55, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

==subst==

Hey Mike.  Quick question: what does subst: do on templates?  I haven't been using it and have this feeling that I should have been.  But can't for the life of me find out what it does.  Thanks --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 07:13, 17 January 2008 (UTC)
:subst: will replace the template with the actual wiki markup, instead of doing a call dynamically. This is good for user talk templates in particular because we don't want the message to change later, and we want to reduce server load (which is obviously increased by fetching the template each time a page must be rendered. [[w:Wikipedia:Substitution]] for more. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:32, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

== My user page ==

''Please'' quit testing js on my user talk page. It was very annoying to check my talk page for new messages when there wasn't one, and even worse to find ''you'', of all people, testing js on my talk page like you would in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|Sandbox]].

== One day ==

:''After having my conclusion supported with comments from one admin and non-admin, I went ahead an implemented it.''

That's what I was talking about with &quot;one day&quot; since you asked for confirmation and within one day just went and did it. I apologize if you took offense. I know the conversation took more than a day, I was in it too! If someone opposes something I feel it should at the least be responded to like some of the others were. The user role says &quot;Bureaucrat&quot; but it certainly doesn't mean everything he / she does needs to be bureaucratic. I don't feel my point was even addressed. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:17, 18 January 2008 (UTC)
:I didn't mean that bureaucrats imply bureaucracy, but rather that people want this to be a ''quick'' and easy process for users. Letting admins hand it out and revoke it
:#Ensures that as many eyes as possible will be looking for misuse and/or deliberate abuse and removing the rights; and
:#Ensures that users' requests are handled expediently.
:Please don't take this to mean that the crats are slow or inefficient, but rather that there are only what 4 of you, where we have nearly 30 admins, perhaps half of which are regularly active here. It's an effort to keep workload spread out, which is the entire point of this proposal.
:As for one day after a consensus check, it was two days, and I didn't expect that the shell request would be filled the same day. Nevertheless, people had already expressed their opinions and voiced concerns; the point of that was not a re-hash, but rather a sanity-check on my part. In essence, I asked &quot;Am I misreading people's comments?&quot; and the answer was &quot;No.&quot; Ordinarily I woudn't have bothered with a sanity-check, but this is a rather bigger deal than most things, and it ''is'' true that the discussion was long, and convoluted at times; it was entirely possible I missed an objection, or otherwise failed to gauge accurately what people were saying. I don't think I did.
:As a final word, just because I've been the primary advocate of this doesn't mean it's my job to reply to everyone's comments. Other people's comments, while not explicitly directed at you, were certainly opposing the idea of having this be a bureaucrat task, and I took that to be sufficient comment on what you brought up. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:28, 18 January 2008 (UTC)

== Importing JS from WP ==

I saw some of your work on your javascript.  We used to have a function for importing scripts from wikipedia, but a lot of the JS got refactored and now we don't anymore. However, there is a function &quot;importScriptURI&quot; at [http://en.wikibooks.org/skins-1.5/common/wikibits.js?150] that you might be interested in reading through. That function, or a variant thereof, should be capable of importing scripts from WP for you automatically. 

Copy+paste works well too. Whichever method you want to try should be fine. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:59, 3 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

''(I have copied below the section of the same name from the [[Talk:Circuit Idea/How do We Create Sinusoidal Oscillations?|discussion about LC tank]]) [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 16:43, 20 January 2008 (UTC)''


In every kind of oscillator (including LC and relaxation oscillators), there must be at least 2 different components that &quot;remember&quot; 2 &quot;instantaneous values&quot;: at any point in the oscillaton, there has to be at least the output voltage value, and also something else that remembers if we are going &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;.
:It sounds very philosophical. I need time to assimilate this wisdom:) [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 08:57, 19 January 2008 (UTC)
Since resistors can instantaneously change current (when voltage is instantaneously changed), they are useless for &quot;remembering&quot;.
:I like this thought; I have inserted it into the [[Circuit Idea/How do We Create Sinusoidal Oscillations?#Making a quantity depend on time|story]]. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 08:57, 19 January 2008 (UTC)
Components that can be used for remembering:
* capacitors
* inductors
* positive-feedback amplifiers (flip-flops, [[w:Schmitt trigger]] inverters, etc.)

In a real LC oscillator, there also is ''something else'' that regulates how energy from the power supply is fed into the rest of the circuit -- it &quot;pushes&quot; the rest of the circuit.

Some people use a complicated circuit (op amps, PTR resistors, etc.) that very gently puts in just enough energy to compensate for the parasitic resistance of the LC, making as &quot;pure&quot; a sine wave as possible.
There are a variety of less complicated circuits that are perhaps easier to understand, but generate a waveform that is more distorted from the &quot;ideal&quot; sine wave.

Would it help or make things more confusing to discuss an example &quot;pusher&quot; circuit?

&lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 1: Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

==1.1 Introduction ==
Database systems have become an essential component of every software applications.
Database systems emerged in 1960s and took 10 years to gain widespread usage. More and more organizations began to adopt database technology to manage their corporate data during the mid 1970s

Generalized Update Access Method (GUAM) was a [[w:Hierarchical database model|hierarchical]] database system developed in early 1960s by [[w:Rockwell International|Rockwell International]]. Rockwell developed this software to manage the data usually associated with manufacturing operations. IBM introduced [[w:Information Management System|Information Management System]] (IMS) as a hierarchical database management system soon after that. The 1970s were the dawn of relational database technology. [[w:Edgar F. Codd|Dr. Edgar F. Codd]]'s paper on the [[w:Relational model|relational model\\ revolutionized the thinking on data systems. The industry quickly responded to the superiority of the relational model by adapting their products to that model. During the 1980s, database systems gained a lot of ground and a large percentage of businesses made the transition from file-oriented data systems to database systems.
Some of the leading products like ORACLE, DB2, SQL Server, Informix and Sybase started ruling the database world with their flagship relational database management systems (RDBMS).
 
The relational model matured and became the leading data model in the 1990s. Towards the end of the '90s, [[w:Object database|object-oriented databases]] gained popularity; however, older applications that were already developed using the relational model were reluctant to move to the object-oriented model.

The late 2000s saw the rise of the [[w:NoSQL|NoSQL]] movement, which moved towards more application-specific data models than the relational model. The object-oriented model is one of the alternative data models being used.

Most leading database management systems support the object-oriented model. Many of them offer object-to-relational mapping to achieve object model support. For example, DB2 is Relational, Hierarchical (XML), Object oriented Database Management system.

==1.2 Database==
The word database is in common use. We use the terms database and database management system interchangeably, which is quite wrong most of the time. So we must start with defining what ‘database’ means.

A database is collection of related data designed, built and populated with data for a specific purpose.

A database can be of any size and of varying complexity. For example, a list of names and addresses of employees may consist of few hundred to thousand records varying upon the organization size. Indeed, there are databases that store much more data, for example, the database maintained by the Income Tax Department to keep track of all paid taxes. In India, lets say there are around 1 billion tax payers, and if each taxpayer files with approximately 500 characters of information per form, we would get a database of 10^9 * 500 = 500 Giga bytes (GB) of data. For keeping at least past three years of returns,  we need 1.5 Terabytes(TB) of space. This huge amount of information must be organized and managed so that users can search and update the data as needed.

Databases can also be very complex due to the complex relationships that exist between the different records. A good example of such a database is Indian Railways' reservation system.

==1.3 Database Management Systems==

A database management system (DBMS) is a general-purpose software system that enables users to define, construct, manipulate and share information or data. Additionally it offers data &quot;persistence&quot; over long periods of time. The information being stored is called the database.

The database management system includes the fundamental operations that can be applied to data. Every database management system provides for the following basic operations, collectively referred to by the acronym CRUD:

* C—Create data by inserting it into the database
* R—Read data from the database
* U—Update data already stored in the database
* D—Delete data from the databse

==1.3.1 Benefits of DBMS==
To simply run the CRUD operations does not require a DBMS. In fact, it is possible to use a spreadsheet or even write our own set of programs to simply create and maintain data. However, DBMS software has already solved multiple other problems which are bound to arise during this process, such as:

#       Sharing of data with access control for multiple users
#	Multi-user transaction processing
#       Concurrent processing
#	Redundancy control
#       Query processing and optimization
#       Security
#       Backups and recovery
#	Integrity constraints enforcement
#	Standards enforcement
#	Data abstraction for applications

==1.4 Database System Types==

Database software has evolved to support different type of data models. As we try to represent real-world data requirements in a data model, we come up with different data model over a period of time. It turns out that we can look at data requirements and create data models in a few different ways. They are listed below.

==1.4.1 Hierarchical DBMS==
A hierarchical database is similar in nature to a file system, with a root node and one or more children referencing the parent. This gives very fast data-access path, but high application maintenance.

	Data is organized into a tree like structure, which allows repeating information using parent/child as one to many relationships. Parent can have many children but child has only one parent. This model was widely used in the first main frame database management systems. The most common form of hierarchical model used currently is the LDAP model. This model gained popularity again with the recent XML databases.

An XML database is a data persistence software system that allows data to be imported, accessed and exported in the XML format.
Two major classes of XML database exist:
*	XML-enabled:  These map all XML to a traditional database (such as a relational database), accepting XML as input and rendering XML as output. 
*	Native XML (NXD): The internal model of such databases depends on XML and uses XML documents as the fundamental unit of storage.

==1.4.2 Network DBMS==
	This model is an extension to hierarchical data model in which each record can have multiple parents and multiple child records. In effect, it supports many to many relationships. It provides flexible way to represent objects and their relationships. But before it gains popularity, new model ‘relational model’ was proposed and that replaced network database model as soon as it was proposed.

==1.4.3 Relational DBMS==

The relational model is the basis for any relational database management system(RDBMS). It defines how to create, store and retrieve the data and to make the data logically consistent. A relational model has three core components: a collection of objects or relations, operators that act on the objects or relations, and data integrity methods.

Dr. E. F. Codd, the father of the relational model, stipulated the rules and proposed this model. Data is represented as mathematical n-ary relations, an n-ary relation being a subset of the Cartesian product of n domains. &quot;Relation&quot; is a mathematical term for &quot;table&quot;, and thus &quot;relational&quot; roughly means, &quot;based on tables&quot;. 

The basic principle of the relational model is the Information Principle: all information is represented by data values in relations. In accordance with this Principle, a relational database is a set of relations and the result of every query is presented as a relation.

The basic relational building block is the domain or data type. A tuple is an unordered set of attribute values. An attribute is an ordered pair of attribute name and type name. An attribute value is a specific valid value for the type of the attribute. This can be either a scalar value or a more complex type. A relation is defined as a set of n-tuples. A table in a relational database, alternatively known as a relation, is a two-dimensional structure used to hold related information. A database consists of one or more related tables. Don’t confuse a relation with relationships. A relation is essentially a table, and a relationship is a way to correlate, join, or associate the two tables.

A row in a table is a collection or instance of one thing, such as one employee or one line item on an invoice. A column contains all the information of a single type, and the piece of data at the intersection of a row and a column, a field, is the smallest piece of information that can be retrieved with the database’s query language.
	

The consistency of a relational database is enforced, not by rules built into the applications that use it, but rather by constraints, declared as part of the logical schema and enforced by the DBMS for all applications. The relational model establishes the connections between related data occurrences by means of logical links implemented through foreign keys.

The relational model defines operations such as select, project and join. Although these operations may not be explicit in a particular query language, they provide the foundation on which a query language is built.

SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, supports the database components in virtually every modern relational database system. SQL has been refined and improved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for more than 20 years.

ANSI introduced standard querying language to access relational databases, SQL (Structured Query Language). All database vendors developed SQL Engines on top of their relational engines to interpret and execute these SQL Statements. This lead to standard interfaces to emerge in programming languages as well. ODBC for C and JDBC for JAVA became the de-facto standard to access the SQL engine. 

This book is mainly focused on relational database management systems (RDBMS) as other database systems are built on top of this RDBMS, and they have nothing to gain from the main memory nature of the MMDBs.

==1.4.4 Main Memory DBMS==
In-Memory Database system (IMDB) is a memory-resident relational database that eliminates disk access by storing and manipulating data in main memory. It is also known as main memory database (MMDB) or real-time database (RTDB). Predictability is more than performance in case of real-time databases.

Disk and memory capacities continue to grow much faster than latency and bandwidth improvements. Now, multi-terabyte RAM scans take minutes and terabyte-disk scans take many hours. We shall now keep the whole database in memory and design our data structures and algorithms intelligently and use multi-processors sharing a massive main memory, and intelligently use precious disk bandwidth. The database engines need to overhaul their algorithms to deal with the fact that main memories are huge (billions of pages trillions of bytes).  Main memory database implementation has proved that they can execute queries ten to twenty times faster than traditional approach. The era of main memory databases has finally arrived. In this book we will discuss about this type of database management systems.

==1.4.5 Column or Vertical DBMS==
Storing data in column-wise as ternary relations (key, attribute, value) allows extraordinary compression, often as a bitmap. Querying such bitmaps can reduce query times by orders of magnitude and enable whole new optimization strategies. This is due to the fact that the total disk I/Os it performs to execute as OLAP(Online Analytical Processing) query will come done drastically because of the compaction in data. These types of databases started gaining popularity in OLAP applications because of multi-fold reduction in query execution time.


==1.4.6 Stream Processing DBMS==
Data is increasingly generated by instruments that monitor the environment – telescopes looking at the heavens, patient monitors watching the life-signs of a person in the emergency room, cell-phone and credit-card systems looking for fraud and RFID scanners watching products flow through the supply chain.
In each of these cases, one wants to compare the incoming data with the history of an object. The data structures, query operators, and execution environments for such stream processing systems are qualitatively different from classic DBMS architectures. In essence, the arriving data items each represent a fairly complex query against the existing database. Researchers have been building stream-processing systems, and their stream-processing ideas have started appearing in mainstream products.

==1.4.7 Object Relational DBMS==
An object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) provides a relational database management system that allows developers to integrate a database with their own custom data-types and methods. 
Object Views allow the developer to define an object-oriented structure over an existing relational database table. In this way, existing applications do not need to change immediately, and any new development can use the object-oriented definitions of the table. This makes the transition from a relational to an object-relational database relatively easy, because object definitions can reference existing relational components.
The term object-relational database sometimes also refers to external software products running over traditional DBMSs to provide similar features.

==1.4.8 Distributed DBMS==
Distributed databases bring the advantages of distributed computing to the database management domain. It is a collection of multiple logically interrelated databases distributed over the computer network, and distributed manager software that manages a distributed database. It comprises data replication, data fragmentation, distributed query processing, distributed transaction processing, distributed database recovery, etc.

In this book, focus is given on relational, main memory database system.

==1.5 Database Related Roles and Responsibilities==

For small personal database, such as list of contacts, one person typically defines, constructs and manipulates the database and there is no sharing of data. However huge and complex database requires many persons to define, construct, manipulate, maintain database. There are many roles involved with a database and they are listed below

*	Database Administrator takes care of database itself, DBMS and related software. He is responsible for authorizing access to the database, monitor database usage and for acquiring software and hardware resources as needed. 
*	Database Designers are responsible for identifying the data to be stored in the database and for choosing appropriate structures to represent and store this data. They interact with specialized users and develop ‘views’ of the database that meets their application requirements.
*	System Analysts / Software Engineers who thoroughly understands the functionalities of DBMS so as to implement their applications to meet their complex application requirements. 
*	DBMS Kernel Developers are persons who design and implement the DBMS interfaces and modules as a software package.  . 
*	DBMS Tool Developers include persons who develop tools to access and use DBMS software. Typical packages include database design, performance monitoring, GUI, etc.

This book is mainly focused on persons who perform “DBMS Kernel Developers” role.


==1.6 Programming Interfaces==

Most database systems provide interactive interface where SQL commands can be typed and given as input to database system, which will retrieve and display the resultant records.
For example, in a computer system where MYSQL RDBMS is installed, the command mysql will start the interactive interface. This tool is convenient for schema creation and for occasional adhoc queries. However majority of database interactions in practice are executed though programs. These programs are generally called as database applications. As more than 90% of applications involve database, we shall say all applications are database applications.

There are three ways to access database programmatically
*	Embedded SQL – Embedding SQL Commands in a general purpose programming language. Database statements are embedded into the programming language and are identified by preprocessor with prefix “EXEC SQL”. These pre processors convert these statements into DBMS generated code. ESQL for C/C++ and SQLJ for Java.
*	Native language drivers – standard interface on top of SQL commands. These provide functions to connect to database execute statement, retrieve resultant records, etc. ODBC, JDBC are examples
*	Proprietary language/drivers – PL/SQL, PHP drivers. Mysql Provides PHP driver to access the database.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Volcanoes periodically erupt with volcanic gases, lava, and ash. There is a scale used in judging a volcanic eruption's size, called the Volcanic Explosivity Index, or VEI, scale. A table with some information included is right below.

==Classification==
Scientists measure how powerful volcanic eruptions are using the VEI. It records how much volcanic material is thrown out, how high the eruption goes, and how long it lasts. The scale goes from 0 to 8. A score of 1 is 10 times more powerful than a score of 0; this is a [[w:logarithm|logarithmic]] scale, like [[w:decibel|decibels]] or [[w:Richter scale|the Richter scale]].

Note that there is a discontinuity in the definition of the VEI between indices 1 and 2. The lower border of the volume of ejecta jumps by a factor of 100 from 10,000 to 1,000,000 m³ while the factor is 10 between all higher indices.

A '''volcano''' is an opening, or rupture, in a planet's surface or crust, which allows hot, molten rock, ash, and gases to escape from below the surface. Volcanic activity involving the [[Extrusive (geology)|extrusion]] of rock tends to form mountains or features like mountains over a period of time.

Volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are pulled apart or come together. A mid-oceanic ridge, for example the Mid-Atlantic Ridge&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Mid-Atlantic Ridge|]] and [[w:mid-oceanic ridge|]]&lt;/ref&gt;, has examples of volcanoes caused by &quot;divergent tectonic plates&lt;ref&gt;[[w:divergent boundary|]]&lt;/ref&gt;&quot; pulling apart; the Pacific Ring of Fire has examples of volcanoes caused by &quot;convergent tectonic plates&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[w:convergent boundary|]]&lt;/ref&gt; coming together. By contrast, volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the Earth's crust (called &quot;non-hotspot intraplate volcanism&quot;), such as in the African Rift Valley&lt;ref&gt;The [[w:African Rift Valley|]] is in northeastern Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;, the Wells Gray-Clearwater Volcanic Field and the Rio Grande Rift&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Rio Grande Rift|]]&lt;/ref&gt; in North America and the European Rhine Graben&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Rhine (geology)|]]&lt;/ref&gt; with its Eifel volcanoes. 

Volcanoes can be caused by &quot;mantle plumes&quot;. These so-called &quot;hotspots&quot; , for example at Hawaii, can occur far from plate boundaries. Hotspot volcanoes are also found elsewhere in the solar system, especially on rocky planets and moons.

==3.1 Overview==
Many applications like telecom, process control, airline reservation, stock market, etc. require real time access to data.  In addition to maintaining data consistency, these applications require timely response for the transactions accessing database. Main memory databases, which became feasible recently with the increasing availability of large cheap memory, can provide better performance and consistent throughput than disk based database systems. As the data resides permanently in main memory, it will not involve any disk I/O that affects the throughput. In effect, for disk-based systems, standard deviation for throughput will be huge and real time applications will not be able to benchmark against that unpredictable throughput. This led to the development of new type of database management system called, Main memory database (MMDB) system. It is also called as “In-Memory database (IMDB) management system” and “Real Time Database (RTDB) management systems”.

As the basic underlying assumption changed in this type of database management system, it leads to research and design of each and every component of storage, relational and sql engine of the traditional disk based management system. 

One disk block transfer takes approximately 5 milliseconds whereas main memory access takes 100 nanoseconds. By keeping the whole database in memory, these disk I/Os are converted to memory access, thereby improves the throughput by many-folds. This leads to an interesting question 
“In DRDBs if all the data is cached in buffer pool, then they will perform as good as MMDBs?”
Unfortunately the answer is No. This is because the data structures and access algorithms are designed for disk based system and cannot work well when whole database is completely in memory. 
There are some common misconceptions about main memory databases

Do they support durable transactions?

Yes. Though the complete database is in main memory, backup copy is kept in disk to enable recovery in the event of crash.

Can multiple users concurrently access the database?

Yes. Multiple users and multiple threads shall access the database and are synchronized through latches and locks.

The main memory resident of data have important implications in 
*	Data Representation
*	Data Access Algorithms – Query Processing
*	Recovery
*	Concurrency control

This book will discuss more in detail about the difference between DRDB and MMDB implementations and how MMDB is times faster than DRDB.

Figure 4, depicts a main memory database management system. This has nearly all the components, which are present in disk resident database management system. Implementations of components under SQL Engine, Relational Engine, and Storage Engine differ heavily from the DRDB components. 



Fig 4: MMDB System Architecture

[[Image:MMDBArchitecture.gif]]


In case of MMDB, physical entity that corresponds to database is either shared memory segment or memory mapped file. These Inter Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms allow sharing of memory across processes. There are some JAVA embedded main memory databases that require only multi-thread access. These DBMSs use heap memory as database. For multi process access, we should either go with shared memory IPC or memory mapped IPC mechanism. Usually the control information is stored separately from the data records to avoid data corruption of control information.

==3.2 Memory Segment==
Memory is divided into three main segments.

Control Segment containing lock table, process table, transaction table, undo logs and redo logs. These structures are transient and are required for the operation of the database management system.

Catalog Segment containing meta data about tables, indexes, fields, etc.

User Segment containing records of all the tables and index records of those tables, if any.

==3.3 SQL Engine==
Optimization and execution of the SQL statements change drastically in case of MMDBs. Cost based optimization is mainly based on the number of disk I/Os rather than the CPU cycles. These cost based optimization is the complex system in the whole DBMS. Both cost and rule based optimizers are used in case of DRDBs. But in case of MMDB rule based optimizer would suffice. 

==3.4 Relational Engine==
All the relational operation algorithms change as we do not need to use two pass algorithms for implementing the operations. Moreover in case of DRDBs when we do first pass we copy the data from disk to memory for all the fields. Incase of MMDB, we shall use pointer indirection and avoid data copy and disk I/O.

T-Tree index structures are better in case of space and cpu cycles for MMDB than B-Tree of DRDB.

==3.5 Transaction Engine==
As MMDB transactions no more wait for disk I/O, it will lead to lot of contention issues and deadlocks, which will hamper the throughput. This needs to be avoided and given more importance in case of MMDB than DRDB

==3.6 Storage Engine==
In DRDB, allocations happen based on the disk blocks. But in MMDB, it should happen in memory. This leads to lot of optimization in the allocation algorithms, which shall save space as well as CPU cycles. Database modules works with File Manager module in case of DRDB, whereas it works with OS IPC abstraction layer in case of MMDB.

'''''Changes from 6th edition'''''
*T2a lesions moved to T1. T2b moved to T2. 
*Stage IIB was moved to II and Stage IIA merged with Stage I
*New designation for retropharyngeal lymph nodes (all are N1 nodes)

'''''Notes'''''
*Shift of more advanced N-stages into lower stage groupings &amp;mdash; N1 is stage II instead of III, N2 is III instead of IV
*Retropharyngeal nodes staging has been controversial, since CT is often unable to differentiate them from parapharyngeal involvement of primary tumor. However, MRI appears more sensitive, and patients who are N0 but with positive RLN by MRI have prognosis similar to patients with N1 disase as should probably be classified as such

==Older staging systems==
===AJCC 6th edition (2002)===
'''''Tumor'''''
*T1 - confined to nasopharynx
*T2 - extends to soft tissues
**T2a - extends to oropharynx and/or nasal cavity without parapharyngeal extension 
**T2b - any tumor with parapharyngeal extension (i.e. beyond the pharyngobasilar fascia)
*T3 - involves bony structures and/or paranasal sinuses
*T4 - intracranial extension and/or involvement of cranial nerves, infratemporal fossa, hypopharynx, orbit, or masticator space

'''''Nodes'''''
*N1 - unilateral nodes, 6 cm or less, above the supraclavicular fossa
*N2 - bilateral nodes, 6 cm or less, above the supraclav fossa
*N3a - lymph node greater than 6 cm
*N3b - extension to the supraclav fossa (defined as the triangular region described by Ho, bounded by the superior margin of the sternal head of the clavicle, the superior margin of the lateral end of the clavicle, and the point where the neck meets the shoulder. This includes some of level IV as well as V.)

'''''Overall stage'''''
*I - T1 N0
*IIA - T2a N0
*IIB - T1-T2 N1, T2b N0 (i.e. T2b or N1)
*III - T3 N0-2, or T1-3 N2 (i.e. T3 or N2)
*IVA - T4 N0-2
*IVB - N3
*IVC - M1

'''''Notes'''''
*Division of Stage II into A and B compared to other H&amp;N sites
*Shift of more advanced N-stages into lower stage groupings &amp;mdash; N1 is stage II instead of III, N2 is III instead of IV
*Retropharyngeal nodes staging has been controversial, since CT is often unable to differentiate them from parapharyngeal involvement of primary tumor. However, MRI appears more sensitive, and patients who are N0 but with positive RLN by MRI have prognosis similar to patients with N1 disase as should probably be classified as such

===AJCC 5th edition (1997)=== 
*same as 6th edition


===AJCC 4th edition (1988):===
*T1 - tumor confined to one wall of the nasopharynx
*T2 - two walls or more
*T3 - extension to oropharynx and nasal cavity
*T4 - invades skull base or cranial nerve

*N1 - single ipsilateral node &lt;= 3 cm
*N2a - single ipsilateral node 3-6 cm
*N2b - multiple ipsilateral nodes &lt; 6 cm
*N2c - contralateral or bilateral nodes &lt; 6 cm
*N3 - nodes &gt; 6 cm

Overall stage: 
*I - T1 N0
*II - T2 N0
*III - T3 or N1
*IV - T4 or N2-3 or M1
(similar to other H&amp;N sites in newest staging system)

*''Note:'' downstaging of disease in AJCC 4th edition &amp;mdash; N1 was moved to Stage II and N2 was moved to Stage III. This is an important difference to note when comparing older trials to newer treatment modalities since the definition of &quot;advanced stage&quot; has changed.


===Chinese Staging (1992)===
*T1 - nasopharynx only
*T2 - nasal cavity, oropharynx, soft palate, anterior cervical vertebrae soft tissue, proximal parapharyngeal space
*T3 - distal parapharyngeal space, CN involvement, base of skull, pterygoprocss zone, pterygopalatine fossa
*T4 - multiple CN involvement, paranasal sinus, cavernous sinus, orbit, infratemporal fossa, or C1-C2 vertebra

*N0 - no nodes
*N1 - upper cervical LN &lt;4cm
*N2 - lower cervical LN, or 4-7 cm
*N3 - SCV, or &gt;7cm, or fixed, or skin infiltration

Staging:
*I - T1N0
*II - T2 or N1
*III - T3 or N2
*IVA - T4 or N3
*IVB - M1 


===Ho's Staging (1978)===
*T1 - nasopharynx only
*T2 - extension to nasal fossa, oropharynx, or parapharyngeal region
*T3 - bony involvement, skull base, cranial nerve palsy, orbits, laryngopharynx, or infratemporal fossa

*N0 - no nodes
*N1 - above laryngeal cartilage
*N2 - below laryngeal cartilage but above SCV fossa
*N3 - SCV lymph nodes</text>

      <comment>/* Clinical Presentation */ Jacod's syndrome: changed to CN II-VI; added supporting comment</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Radiation_Oncology:TOC}}


&lt;big&gt;'''Nasopharyngeal Cancer Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*Markedly different geographical prevalence
**Rare in the US: 0.2-0.5 cases per 100,000 people
**Common in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan: 25-50 per 100,000. Accounts for ~5% of all cancers and ~50% of H&amp;N cancers in Taiwan
**Also common in North Africa, the Middle East, and in Inuits  
*Association with salted fish, Ebstein-Barr virus
*Smoking and alcohol don't have a clear association with the disease
*In general, affects a younger population
*Up to 90% present with N+ disease, and ~50% have bilateral N+ disease

==Clinical Presentation==
*Most commonly presents with a neck mass
*Refractory otitis media, epixtaxis, referred ear pain, cranial neuropathy
**Most common cranial nerves affected are VI and V2 by tumor extension through foramen lacerum into cavernous sinus
*Syndromes:
**Jacod's: compression of CN II-VI by extension into cavernous sinus, leading to ophthalmoplegia, blindness, and trigeminal neuralgia &lt;!-- COMMENT: see Companion to Clinical Neurology by William Pryse-Phillips (2003) p.504 -- http://books.google.com/books?id=pMbhu-vXVtAC&amp;pg=PA504&amp;dq=jacod+syndrome&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5JqOUPflBejV0QHC44HQBQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=jacod%20syndrome&amp;f=false --&gt;
**Villaret: compression of CN IX-XII by parapharyngeal nodes, leading to difficulty swallowing (IX), altered taste (IX), unilateral Horner's (X), paralysis of sternocleidomastoid/trapezius (XI), hemiglossal paralysis (XI)
**Vernet's syndrome (jugular foramen syndrome): compression of CN IX-XI by extension into jugular foramen, leading to difficulty swallowing, vocal cord paralysis, and paralysis of sternocleidomastoid/trapezius
**Trotter's triad: unilateral hearing loss, impaired soft palate motility, and mandibular pain

==Anatomy==
*Includes vault, lateral walls, and posterior wall
*Anterior border begins at the end of the nasal cavity, at the posterior choana (where nasal septum disappears). Radiographically this can be seen as the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus. It extends along plane of the airway to the level of free border of the soft palate posteriorly
*Lateral walls consist of the torus tubarius (Eustachian tube opening), pharyngeal recess (Fossa of Rosenmuller) posterior to torus tubarius, and behind these are the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscles, and behind this is the medial pterygoid plate. 
*Superior border is the cribriform plate and sphenoid sinus.  Clivus consists of part of the sphenoid bone (behind the sinus, the tail end of the sella turcica) and part of the occipital bone and forms the posterior border of the nasopharynx. Hard and soft palates (the inferior border) sits about C2.  
*Eustachean tube passes through base of skull between foramen ovale and lacerum to reach nasopharynx
*Inferior border (floor) is the superior surface of the soft palate
*Cranial nerves are important since NPC may commonly extend along them intracranially:
**Cavernous sinus - III, IV, V1 + V2 (not V3), VI - (all pass through superior orbital fissure except V2 is through foramen rotundum)
**Foramen rotundum - V2
**Foramen ovale - V3 - anterolateral to clivus
**Foramen lacerum - lateral to front part of clivus - plugged with cartilage in vivo
**Jugular foramen - IX, X, XI - lateral to foramen magnum
**Hypoglossal canal - XII - lateral to foramen magnum
*Nearby is the tensor veli palatini, levator veli palatini
*Pharyngeal recess (Fossa of Rosenmuller)
**Postulated to be the origin of most NPC cancers
**Posterior to torus tubaris (posterior lip of the medial end of the cartilagenous eustachean tube)
**Herniation of nasopharyngeal mucosa through deficiency between skull base and superior-most fibers of pharyngeal constrictors
**PMID 1876886 ([http://smj.sma.org.sg/3203/3203a9.pdf Full text for pictures]): &gt;50% are deeper than 1 cm (range 2mm - 19mm), and 90% are narrower than 5 mm. It points lateraly ~45% from sagittal plane

==Pathology==
WHO classification:
*Type I: keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma - 20%
*Non-keratinizing carcinoma
**Type II: differentiated keratinizing carcinoma (formerly transitional cell carcinoma)  - 30-40%
**Type III: undifferentiated keratinizing carcinoma (formely lymphoepithelioma) - 40-50%
*Basaloid sqaumous cell carcinoma - recent distinction, appears aggressive with poor survival

==Spread==
*Spreads along walls of nasopharynx with local invasion
**Can spread to cavernous sinus through foramen lacerum (and involve CN III-VI [except V3]).
**Commonly has involvement of jugular foramen and hypoglossal canal (CN IX-XII).  
*65-90% have lymph node involvement at presentation  
**About 50% have bilateral lymph node involvement
**Cervical Level IIb seem to be the first echelon nodes in NPC, closely followed by lateral retropharyngeal LNs
**Retropharyngeal LN involvement is common, but difficult to detect on CT. In CT based studies, RLN were positive in 30-50%, while in MRI based studies this number may be as high as 80%
*Distant mets are less common at initial presentation but in recurrent disease are more common than in other H&amp;N cancers. 
**Mets correlate more with nodal status than T stage. 
**Distant Mets by N stage: N1=10-20%, N2=30-40%, N3=40-70%. 
*Spreads to bones &gt; lungs, liver, and brain.


===Retropharyngeal lymph nodes===
*It is not clear whether these are staged as N0 or N1, with differences among institutions
*Prognosis for RLN+ N0 appears comparable to N1
*RLNs atrophy with age, and are usually obliterated by adulthood. Normal axial diameter in patients &gt;40 year is ~3 mm. Therefore, some studies use minimal axial diameter &gt;=5 mm on MRI as a size criterion for RLN mets
*Most RLN+ are located at C1 level, and incidence decreases steadily from C1 to C3
*It appears that afferent lymphatic vessels of lateral RLN in NPC begin in the parapharyngeal space (T2 tumors); lymphatic drainage of nasal cavity, oropharynx, and pharyngeal wall (and thus lymphatic drainage of T3 and T4 tumors) may be primarily to cervical lymph nodes


*'''Singapore; 2009''' (1992-1994) PMID 19189339 -- &quot;Retropharyngeal nodal metastasis related to higher rate of distant metastasis in patients with N(0) and N(1) nasopharyngeal cancer.&quot; (Tham IW, Head Neck. 2009 Feb 2. [Epub ahead of print])
**Retrospective. 667 patients, NPC, Stage T2-4 N0-1. RLN+ in 47% by CT. Median F/U 8.3 years
**Outcome: Patients with N0 and RLN+ had similar hazard for DM as patients with N1, and worse than patients with N0 and RLN-
**Conclusion: Patients with N0 disease and RLN lymph nodes share similar prognosis as patients with N1 disease

*'''Fudan, China; 2009''' PMID 18538502 -- &quot;Patterns of retropharyngeal node metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.&quot; (Wang XS, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Jan 1;73(1):194-201. Epub 2008 Jun 4.)
**Retrospective. 618 NPC patients. MRI staging. LN+ in 88%; RLN+ alone 6%, cervical LN+ alone 28%, both RLN and cervical LN 66%. Incidence of RLN lower 72% than cervical LN 93%
**Location of RLN: occipital bone 6%, C1 76%, C2 17%, C3 0.5%. Incidence significantly higher with parapharyngeal involvement
**Conclusion: Level IIb LNs seems first-echelon nodes in NPC; incidence of RLN mets decreases steadily in level

*'''Sun Yat-sen, China; 2007''' PMID 17332287 -- &quot;Retropharyngeal lymph node metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: prognostic value and staging categories.&quot; (Ma J, Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Mar 1;13(5):1445-52.)
**Retrospective. 749 patients, NPC. RLN+ in 51% by CT
**Outcome: On multivariate analysis, in N0 patients, RLN+ independent predictor for OS, LRFS and DMFS. No difference in unilateral vs bilateral RLN+. Survival if N0 and RLN+ similar to survival if N+
**Conclusion: RLN mets affect prognosis in N0 patients, and should be classified as N1

==Response to treatment==
Despite rapid response to initial treatment, high incidence of local failure. 


==Treatment Overview==
*Surgery plays only a minimal role due to significant potential morbidity
*Historically, RT alone was used, and resulted in 5-year OS 35-50%
**Early-stage (I-II) outcomes were good, with 5-year RFS 75-95% and OS 70-80%
**However, advanced-stage (III-IV) 5-year RFS was ~50%, and OS only 10-40%
*Early stage disease (Stage I-II) typically continues to be managed with RT alone
*Advanced stage disease (Stage III-IV) is managed with concurrent chemo-RT; it is not clear whether there is any benefit to further adjuvant chemotherapy

==Surgery==
*Due to deep location of nasopharynx, and anatomic proximity to critical structures, radical surgery is typically not used
*Role of surgery is initially for biopsy for histological confirmation
*It may also be used for management of the neck for persistently enlarged lymph nodes
*Finally, there may be role in persistent or recurrent disease</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Radiation_Oncology:TOC}}


&lt;big&gt;'''Nasopharyngeal Cancer - Early Stage'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Early-stage (I-II) outcomes are good with radiation alone
*5-year RFS is 75-95% and OS is 70-80%
*Most historical series use 2D radiation, but several reports with a short follow up show good outcomes with IMRT
*IMRT in particular has significantly better sparing of the objective (stimulated/unstimulated flow) parotid function in a randomized setting
*Dose tends to be 66-72 Gy in 2 Gy/fraction; elective sites receive 50-60 Gy using dose painting

==ChemoRT for Stage II==
*'''Chinese Stage II Trial''' PMID 22056739 -- &quot;Concurrent chemoradiotherapy vs radiotherapy alone in stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma: phase III randomized trial.&quot; ('''Chen QY JNCI 2011''')
**Methods: 230/236 pts with stage II (used Chinese staging) NPC randomized to RT vs chemoRT with weekly cisplatin 30mg/m2 x 7c
***RT: Conventional 2D RT: 68-70Gy/34-35fx to primary, 60-62Gy to node positive neck, 50Gy to node negative neck
***Primary endpoint OS
**Results: Median f/u: 60 months
***ChemoRT improved:
****5 yr OS: 95% vs 86%, HR=0.30, P =0.007
****5 yr PFS: 88% vs 79%, HR 0.45, P=0.017
****5 yr DMFS: 95% vs. 84%, HR = 0.27, P =0.007
***No difference in LRC: 93% vs 91%, P=0.29
***Toxicity: More acute toxicity with chemoRT:64% vs 41% P = 0.001, no difference in late toxicity
**Conclusion: ChemoRT improves survival in stage II NPC

==Radiotherapy alone==
*'''Taiwan; 2005''' (1983-1998) PMID 15936544 -- &quot;Treatment outcomes and late complications of 849 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with radiotherapy alone.&quot; (Yeh SA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005)
**Retrospective. 849 consecutive NPC patients (Stage I 6%, Stage IIA 3%, Stage IIB 35%, Stage III 32%, Stage IVA 19%, Stage IVB 5% by AJCC-5), WHO type I 1%, II 62%, type III 37%. RT median 70 Gy, if BT boost median 74 Gy
**Outcome: 5-year OS 59%, DFS 52%; OS by Stage: I 82%, II 72%, III 55%, IVA 42%, IVB 39%
**Toxicity: xerostomia 90%, hearing impairment 54%, tinnitus 52%, Lhermitte's sign 21%, trismus 12%, temporal necrosis 6%

*RTOG (Marcial et al) - PMID 6993442 (no abstract) &amp;mdash; complete response to local tumor, 96% for T1, 88% for T2, 81% for T3, and 74% for T4. For N+ neck, ranged from 93% to 71%.  5-year survival overall was 40%.

==Altered fractionation==
*'''RTOG 71-03''' (1971-1979)
**Randomized. 121 patients. All Stages. Arm 1) split course RT (30/10, 3 week rest, 30/10) vs. Arm 2) 66/33 or 66/30
**'''1980''' PMID 6993442 -- &quot;Split-course radiation therapy of carcinoma of the nasopharynx: results of a national collaborative clinical trial of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group.&quot; (Marcial VA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1980 Apr;6(4):409-14.)
***5-year outcome: LC 86% vs. 80% (NS), LRC 86% vs. 78% (NS), DFS 40% vs. 30% (NS)
***Late toxicity: comparable, except edema worse with continuous RT (42% vs. 24%)
***Conclusion: No difference between fractionation schedules, less social impact with split course

*Wang et al.  - PMID 2720596 &amp;mdash; Not randomized. Accelerated hyperfractionation (twice a day). Compared to similar stage patients treated with once a day XRT, and 5-year local control for T1-2 was 89% (hyperfract) vs 55%, and 77% vs 45% for T3-4.

==Treatment Technique==
===Use of IMRT===
*'''UCSF experience'''
**'''2000''' PMID 11020568 &amp;mdash; &quot;Three-dimensional intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: the University of California-San Francisco experience.&quot; Sultanem K et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Oct 1;48(3):711-22. 
***65-70 Gy to GTV (including + LN), 60 Gy to CTV, 50-60 Gy to the negative neck. Treated at 1.8 Gy per day to CTV and neck and 2.12-2.25 Gy/day to GTV. CTV consisted of entire nasopharynx, posterior 1/3 of nasal cavity and maxillary sinuses, retropharyngeal LN region, clivus, skull base, pterygoid fossae, parapharyngeal space, inferior sphenoid sinus.
***4-year local PFS was 97%, local-regional PFS 98%, and DM-free rate 66%.  4-year OS 88%
**'''2002''' PMID 12007936 &amp;mdash; &quot;Intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: an update of the UCSF experience.&quot; Lee N et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 May 1;53(1):12-22. 
**'''2004''' Dose constraints PMID 15183492
***First group of pts treated with IMRT for the primary tumor and conventional fields for the lymph nodes. This group retrospectively reviewed to determine dose endpoints to critical normal structures. Second group of pts treated with IMRT to both primary and nodes. Based on dose endpoints defined, new plans were developed for the second group of pts and compared to the original plans.
***Prescription dose 70 Gy at 2.12 Gy/fx (33 fx) to GTV, 59.4 Gy at 1.8 to PTV.

**Randomized. 60 patients with T1-2bN0-1 nasopharynx. Arm 1) IMRT 66 Gy (CTV=GTV + 1cm; at-risk anatomic sites; LN Levels IB-II, LN upper Level V, LN retropharyngeal; PTV=CTV+3mm), lower neck LN+ 66 Gy anterior field, LN- 54-60 Gy + intracavitary BT boostvs. Arm 2) 66 Gy 2D + intracavitary BT boost
**Outcome: observer-rated severe xerostomia IMRT 39% vs. 2D-RT 82% (SS), stimulated parotid flow (SS), unstimulated parotid flow (SS), but no difference in patient-reported feeling of xerostomia
**Conclusion: IMRT superior in preserving objective parotid function, but no difference in patient-reported benefit
**Editorial (PMID 17971579): Observer-rated scoring underestimates patient reports and has low agreement among various observers. Suspect sparing of parotid alone not sufficient. Parotid gland produces saliva without mucins (lubricants, bind water, and provide selective permeability barrier). Mucin-secreting glands (e.g. minor salivary glands, submandibular glands) produce &lt;10% saliva but &gt;50% mucins. May need to spare these glands as well for subjective feeling of benefit

*'''Queen Mary Hospital; 2006''' (Hong Kong)(2000-2004) PMID 17145528 -- &quot;Xerostomia and quality of life after intensity-modulated radiotherapy vs. conventional radiotherapy for early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma: initial report on a randomized controlled clinical trial.&quot; (Pow EH, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Nov 15;66(4):981-91.) 
**Randomized. 51 patients, Stage II (T2N0-1, AJCC 1997). Arm 1) conventional RT 68 Gy, neck 66 Gy vs. Arm 2) IMRT, GTV dose 68-72 Gy, PTV 66-68 Gy. Stimulated whole (SWS) and parotid (SPS) saliva flow evaluated, QoL SF-36, EORTC Core, EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 questionnaires. Minimum F/U 1 years
**1-year outcome: 25% whole flow (SWS) IMRT 50% vs. 2D 5% (SS), 25% parotid flow (SPS) 83% vs. 9% (SS). At 2 months, both group had xerostomia, but IMRT group improved significantly better over time. Also improvements in QoL
**Conclusion: IMRT significantly better than conventional RT for salivary function and QoL


'''Middle ear ventilation tube'''
*'''Hong Kong; 2002''' PMID 12512893 -- &quot;Randomized evaluation of the audiologic outcome of ventilation tube insertion for middle ear effusion in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.&quot; (Ho WK, J Otolaryngol. 2002 Oct;31(5):287-93.)
**Randomized. ? patients. NPC and middle ear effusion. Arm 1) pre-RT ventilation tube insertion vs. Arm 2) observation. Audiologic assessment throughout. F/U 4 years
**Outcome: No difference in hearing changes up to 4 years
**Conclusion: Ventilation tube insertion before RT did not offer hearing benefit

&lt;big&gt;'''Nasopharyngeal Cancer - Advanced Stage'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Chemotherapy with radiation==
*Because Stage III-IV NPC has a fairly poor prognosis with RT alone, multiple efforts were made to add chemotherapy to the regimen
*Induction chemotherapy was evaluated in 5 randomized trials; two showed small benefit for disease-free survival, but none showed an overall survival benefit. As a result, induction chemotherapy is currently not indicated
*Adjuvant chemotherapy was evaluated in 3 randomized trials; there was no benefit
*Phase II RTOG 81-17 demonstrated the feasibility of concurrent cisplatin with RT in advanced H&amp;N cancers; it included 22% NPC. Subsequent Intergroup trial 0099 showed a survival benefit for concurrent cisplatin with RT, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. This was the first trial to do so; however, the RT only arm had an unexpectedly low survival, compared with results from RT alone in Asian (endemic) studies
*Concurrent chemo-RT benefits were confirmed by a randomized trial from Taiwan in an endemic population, which used concurrent cisplatin + 5-FU. However, a re-analysis of the data suggests that concurrent chemo-RT is only beneficial for &quot;low-risk&quot; advanced stage patients. &quot;High-risk&quot; advanced stage patients did not gain any benefit from that chemo regimen, and may require more intense, neoadjuvant, or further adjuvant chemotherapy 
*A Singaporean trial used the INT 0099 regimen, and again demonstrated a survival benefit
*Concurrent chemo-RT is now considered a standard of care in Stage III-IV NPC; given previously different staging, some IIB patients were included in the trials and may benefit from concurrent chemotherapy as well. The INT 0099 regimen is the best characterized; unfortunately, compliance with the regimen is only 60-70%
*Because concurrent chemo-RT results in reasonable local control, but adjuvant chemo has not resulted in good systemic control, efforts are underway to try induction -&gt; concurrent chemo-RT. Several Phase II trials have reported encouraging results in patients with significant N disease


*'''Meta-analysis; 2006''' PMID 16377415 -- &quot;Chemotherapy in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: an individual patient data meta-analysis of eight randomized trials and 1753 patients.&quot; (Baujat B, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Jan 1;64(1):47-56.)
**8 trials, 1753 patients (concurrent: INT 0099, PWH-QEH Hong Kong, QMH Hong Kong, induction: PWH Hong Kong, AOCOA, VUMCA, Hokkaido, adjuvant: Taiwan). Individual updated patient data. Median F/U 6 years
**Outcome: Addition of chemo absolute survival benefit of 6% at 5 years (56% to 62%), absolute EFS benefit of 10% (42% to 52%)
**Significant interaction between timing of chemo and OS; highest benefit from concurrent chemo
**Conclusion: Chemotherapy has small but significant benefit for OS and EFS, seen when administered concomitantly

*'''Meta-analysis; 2002''' - PMID 12040275 &amp;mdash; &quot;Combined chemoradiation versus radiation therapy alone in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: results of a meta-analysis of 1,528 patients from six randomized trials.&quot; (Huncharek M et al. Am J Clin Oncol. 2002 Jun;25(3):219-23.) 
**6 trials, 1528 patients (concurrent: INT 0099; induction: Hong Kong, Guangzhou, AOCOA, VUMCA; adjuvant: Italian). Chemoradiation vs radiation alone in locally advanced patients, either adjuvantly, neoadjuvantly, or concurrently. 
**Outcome: DFS/PFS improved 2 years 37%, 3 years 40%, 4 years 34%. OS improved 2 years 20% (NS), 3 years 19% (NS), 4 years 21% (SS) 
**Conclusion: Addition of chemotherapy improves DFS/PFS and OS  


===Concurrent chemo-RT vs RT alone===

***Conclusion: Confirmation of INT 0099 results; also applicable in endemic NPC

*'''Queen Mary Hospital,''' Hong Kong (1995-2001)
**Randomized, 2x2 design (concurrent chemo vs. none, adjuvant chemo vs. none). Ho's Stage T3 or N2-3 or LN &gt;=4 cm (AJCC 6th II-IV). Arm 1) RT alone vs. Arm 2) concurrent chemo-RT vs. Arm 3) RT + adjuvant chemo vs. Arm 4) concurrent chemo-RT + adjuvant RT. Concurrent chemo was FU prodrug uracil/tegafur, adjuvant chemo was cisplatin/5-FU and vincristine/bleomycin/MTX x3+3 cycles. RT 1995-1997 62.5/25 split course with 1 week break; 1997-2001 68/34 primary and 66/33 neck. If parapharyngeal extension or residual disease, 10 Gy boost

**Randomized. ''Trial stopped early due to significant survival benefit.'' 147 patients. NPC Stage III-IV (Stage IV 91%; but also included few N1 patients, which are IIB today), histology WHO I (25%), WHO II (35%), WHO III (41%). Arm 1) RT 70 Gy alone vs RT 70 Gy with concurrent cisplatin 100 mg/m2 q3 weeks and adjuvant cisplatin + 5-Fu . CT-based treatment planning. Fields: included 2 cm margin on gross disease and included entire base of skull and sphenoid sinus, 2 cm posterior to mastoid process; anteriorly included posterior 1/3 of maxillary sinus and nasal cavity. Dose: 70 Gy to primary. For neck to clavicle, 50 Gy for N0 disease, 66 Gy for nodes &lt;= 2 cm, and 70 Gy for nodes &gt; 2 cm. Cisplatin given every 3 weeks at 100 mg/m2 x 3 cycles.

&lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 4: Storage Engine Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

Storage engine usually takes care of data organization, access methods and transactions in Database Management Systems (DBMS). This is the lowest subsystem in DBMS that interacts with operating system services. Generally, products interact through OS Layer subsystem (wrapper to OS system calls) to ease the porting effort.

Data shall be stored in one of the following components of the computer system
#Memory 
#Secondary Storage - Disk
#Tertiary storage - Tape

These components have data capacities, cost per byte, speed ranging over many orders of magnitude. Devices with smallest capacity offer the fastest access speed and have the highest cost per byte. 

Current Trend:Tertiary storage are now replaced by disks because of its huge capacity and low cost per byte. 
Future Trend: Disks are replaced by main memory because of its increase in capacity and decrease in cost per byte. 

One disk block transfer takes approximately 5 milliseconds whereas main memory access takes 100 nanoseconds. By keeping the whole database in memory, these disk I/Os are converted to memory access, thereby improves the throughput by many-folds.
Memory being a volatile devices losses the data stored in it, when the power goes off. But disk being a non-volatile device keeps the content intact even for long periods when there is a power failure. This makes main memory storage manager difficult to implement.
It uses logging and checkpointing mechanisms to cope up with power failure and make the data stored in main memory persistant.

&lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 5  Database Management'''&lt;/big&gt;

Database is a collection of objects that hold and manipulate data. Every database management system will have a limit on the total number of databases supported. Most of the databases support up to 10K databases per instance. Because of the virtual address space limitation, MMDB may not be able to support 100 databases per instance. Lets assume that database size is set to 100MB, then instance shall support  4 GB/ 100 MB= 40 databases maximum.

Database is a collection of many relational objects such as tables, views, and constraints. A user owns a database; the owners shall give special access to other users.

==Functions of Database Management==
*	Create and delete databases
*	Grant/Revoke privileges to users to access 
*	Grow/Shrink database based on its size
*	Persistency of data 
*	Recovery of database in case of system crash
*	Archive/Restore

==Validation Techniques for stray pointer writes==
This is one of the major concerns in MMDBs during the application development cycle. MMDB expose the actual pointer to data, which may lead the application to do stray pointer write. This will corrupt the data. MMDB should provide a mechanism to detect this and recover the database in the event of corruption.

==Database VS Schema==
In the ANSI SQL-92 standard, a schema is defined as a collection of database objects that are owned by single user and form a single namespace.  A namespace is a set of objects that cannot have duplicate names.  For example, two tables can have same name if and only if they both belong to two different schemas.

==Schema VS User==
There is an implicit relationship between schemas and users. This relationship is so close that, many of the database users are unaware about this. If you create a user, DBMS creates a user and a schema and grants all privileges to the user on the created schema. Some DBMS expect the user to do the above in three different steps.

==Default Database, Schema and User==
Every DBMS will have at least one default database, schema and user with preset password. This is done to ensure that DBMS is ready to soon after the installation.

==Database Security==
In a multi-user database management system, DBMS should provide techniques to enable certain users to access selected portions of a database without gaining access to the rest of the database. This is very important, when a large integrated database is to be used by many different users within the same organization. For example sensitive information such as salary should be kept confidential from most of the other database system users. DBMS accomplishes this by having authorization subsystem that is responsible for ensuring security of portions of database against unauthorized access.
 
Another security issue with databases that work across network shall be handled though data encryption.  Encryption can also be used to provide additional protection for sensitive portions of database as well. The data is encoded using some coding algorithm. An unauthorized user who accesses encoded data will have difficulty in decoding the data. Authorized users will be given the decryption algorithms using which they shall access the data.

==Database Administrator==
Database Administrator is the central authority for managing a database system. The DBA’s responsibility include creating, deleting users, changing user passwords, granting privileges to user on database objects and revoking the privileges in accordance with the policy of the organization.  DBA is responsible for the overall security of the database system.
==Access protection , user accounts and database==

1.  Whenever a person or group of person s need to access a database system, the individual or group must first apply for a user account. The DBA will then create a new account number and password for the user if there is a legitimate need to access the database. 
2.The user must log in to the DBMS by entering account number and password whenever database access is needed.
 3.The DBMS checks that the account number and password are valid; if they are, the user is permitted to use the DBMS and to access the database. Application programs can also be considered as users and can be required to supply passwords.
	 4. It is straightforward to keep track of database users and their accounts and passwords by creating an encrypted table or file with the two fields account number  and password. This table can easily be maintained by the DBMS. Whenever a new account is created, a new record is inserted into the table. When an account is canceled, the corresponding record must be deleted from the table.
	 5. The database system must also keep track of all operations on the database that are applied by a certain user throughout each login session, which consists of the sequence of the database interactions that a user performs from the time of logging in to the time of logging off. When a user logs in, the DBMS can record the user's account number and associate it with the terminal are attributed to the user's account until the user logs off. It is particularly important to keep track of update operations that are applied to the database so that, if the database is tampered with, the DBA can find out which user did the tampering. 
	 6.To keep a record of all updates applied to the database and of the particular user who applied each update, we can modify system log, which includes an entry for each operation applied to the database that may be required for recovery from a transaction
failure or system crash. We can expand the log entries so that they also include the account number of the user and the on line terminal ID that applied each operation recorded in the log. If any tampering with the database is suspected, a database audit is performed, which consists of reviewing the log to examine all accesses and operations applied to the database during a certain time period. When an illegal or unauthorized operation is found, the DBA can determine the account number used to perform this operation. Database audits are particularly important for sensitive databases that are updated by many transactions and users, such as a banking database that is updated by many bank tellers. A database log that is used mainly for security purposes is sometimes called an audit trail.

&lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 7:  Transaction Management'''&lt;/big&gt;

A transaction is basic unit of work that comprises many database operations. Transactions shall either be committed or rolled back. This means it shall decide whether to submit all the changes to DBMS or to neglet all the changes and take the database state to the state when that transaction started. 

==Transaction Stages==
For recovery purposes, DBMS should maintain the state of the transaction. A transaction state changes are given below
*	Transaction Start
*	Database operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT)
*	Commit or Abort

Database operations include read and modifications of data records. The effect of running SELECT statement is read and effect of running INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE is data record modifications.

The commit operation informs the successful end of transaction to the transaction manager. After commit operation, database should be in consistent state and all the updates made by that transaction should be made permanent.

The rollback or abort operation informs the transaction manager that there is an error in one of the operations involved in the transaction and database is in inconsistent state. All the updates made by the transaction must be undone on the database to get it back to the previous consistent state; that is state at which the transaction started.


==Transaction pseudo code for money transfer==

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

Read account1 balance

If read failed GOTO UNDO;

Reduce Rs 100 from account1 balance

If reduce failed GOTO UNDO;

Read account2 balance

If read failed GOTO UNDO;

Add Rs 100 to account2 balance

If add failed GOTO UNDO;

COMMIT;

GOTO FINISH;

UNDO:

	ROLLBACK;

FINISH:

	RETURN;

==Transaction Properties==

Transaction processing guarantees four important properties (referred as ACID properties)

'''&lt;big&gt;Atomicity&lt;/big&gt;''' &amp;mdash; 
Each transaction is treated as all or nothing- it either commits or aborts. If a transaction commits, all its effects remain. If it aborts, all its effects are undone.

'''&lt;big&gt;Consistency&lt;/big&gt;''' &amp;mdash; 
Transactions preserve data consistency; it always takes the database from one consistent state to another consistent state. Intermediate state shall be inconsistent, but commit or rollback operation should again take the database to another new consistent state or to the old consistent state. 

'''&lt;big&gt;Isolation&lt;/big&gt;''' &amp;mdash; 
Transactions should be isolated from one another. Even though all transactions run in parallel, updates made by one transaction should not be visible to other and vice versa until the transaction commits.

'''&lt;big&gt;Durability&lt;/big&gt;''' &amp;mdash; 
Transaction commit should ensure that its updates are present in the database, even if there is a subsequent system crash.


==Correctness Principle==
If a transaction executes in the absence of any other transaction or system error, and it starts with the database in a consistent state, then the database is also in a consistent state when the transaction ends.
This means that if we control simultaneous transactions and system errors, transactions always ensure correctness.The former is controlled by concurrency manager and the later is controlled by logging and recovery manager.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello,

I'm new to this and I'm not really sure how it's done yet.  Regardless, I've been playing the guitar off and on for over 25 years now and I've been reading over the Music Theory books and articles and I feel I can make a positive contribution in respect to writing a book that will be better understood by the novice or even the non-musician.  The current articles seem to me to be extremely technical and complex and I have noticed several comments on the discussion pages that complain that the material requires a background in music theory in order to be understood.  I would like to write a book that is basic, easy to read and understand, and provides a solid foundation that will enable the reader to understand and appreciate the more complex and technical information found in the other Wikibooks and articles.</text>

}}

== Bézier Curves ==
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.67}}

[[File:Blender267InitialBezierCurve.png|right|thumb|300px|It should look like this.]]
*First start a new Blender project, and delete the default cube.
*Press: {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|A}} → Curve → Bezier to create a new curve. Switch to top view {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}} for a clearer look. You may want to zoom in a bit as well. {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} into Edit mode.

The black line with the extra angled lines like centipede legs coming off it is the Bézier curve. The white or orange dots are the ''control points'', with the ones in the middles of the pink handle lines defining the endpoints of the curve segment.

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}} to deselect the selection, so that all the control points turn black, and the lines connecting them turn red. You can {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on any point to select it; however, selecting a curve endpoint selects the entire handle line passing through it.

You can move a selected point in the usual way, with {{B3D:N2P/Do|GKEY}}: note how moving an endpoint causes the curve to bend so it always connects to the endpoint. Moving just a point at the end of a control handle affects the inner part of the curve, making it bend more or less sharply away from the endpoint: try moving one of these points around, and note how the handle gets longer or shorter, and automatically rotates as necessary to remain a single straight line.

Alternatively, you can select an endpoint (which selects the entire control handle, remember) and use {{B3D:N2P/Do|RKEY}} to rotate the handle, and {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}} to make it longer or shorter.

=== Resolution ===
[[File:Blender267CurveDataContextBezier3D.png|right]]
In the Curve Context [[File:Blender267CurveDataContextButton.png]] in the Properties window, further down you will see the Active Spline panel. (This is only visible in Edit mode.) Note the editable field next to the label “Resolution:”, probably showing “U: 12”. That number governs the number of straight-line segments that the curve is converted into for rendering purposes; the more of these, the smoother the result, but it will add a bit to the render time.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''That’s right. As embarrassing as it may sound, Blender cannot actually render curves.''' It has to approximate each curve by a series of straight-line segments before rendering.}}

This resolution setting is also used when converting the curve to a mesh ({{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|CKEY}}).

{{Clear}}
=== Extending Your Curve ===

So far your Bézier curve only has one segment. You can add segments in several different ways:

* {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on an endpoint at either end of the whole curve, and use {{B3D:N2P/Do|EKEY}} to extend a new curve segment connected to the same endpoint. (We won’t say “extrude”, to avoid confusion with a different extrusion function discussed further down.)
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on an endpoint at either end of the whole curve, and {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|LMB}} where the endpoint of the new segment will go; the new segment will immediately be added between the previous endpoint and the new one.
* Select the endpoints of a single curve segment, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|WKEY}} and choose “Subdivide” from the menu. This splits the curve segment into two new connected segments.

Note that if you {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|LMB}} when the selection is not precisely one endpoint of the whole curve, it will add a new handle that is not connected to any part of the existing curve. You can extend from this handle to create a whole set of new curve segments that are still part of the same curve object, even though there are no lines running between this piece of curve and the previous one. You can join two separate pieces of the curve with a new segment by selecting an endpoint of each and pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|FKEY}}.

You can also add new pieces with {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}} in Edit mode.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Curves cannot have branches.''' However, depending on your purposes, you could simulate the appearance of a branch by overlapping the end of one piece on top of another one.}}

=== Removing Points and Segments ===

You can delete any control points by selecting them and using the familiar {{B3D:N2P/Do|DEL}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}}. The menu that pops up asks you if you want to remove the “Selected” points, the “Segment”, or “All”.
* “Selected” removes all points that are part of the same handle(s) as the selected point(s). Removing an endpoint of a curve piece removes the connected segment. Removing an interior endpoint causes the replacement of the curve segments on either side of it with a new one running directly between their remaining endpoints. Thus, the curve piece of which that segment was a part remains a single curve piece afterwards.
* “Segment” removes a segment between two connected endpoints. If neither endpoint was an endpoint of the curve piece, then the remainder of that piece of the curve becomes two disconnected pieces.
* “All” removes ''all'' of the control points, leaving an empty curve object!

=== Handle Types ===

So far, all the handles on your curve have been ''aligned''. This means that adjacent curve segments are guaranteed to join smoothly. If you select a control point and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|VKEY}}, you will get a menu allowing you to set other types for the handle:
* ''Free'' means the two parts of the handle on either side of the endpoint are free to rotate independently, so the two curve segments can now meet at a corner.
* ''Vector'' means the selected part of the handle points at the other endpoint of the same curve segment, and will keep pointing that way even if you move either endpoint. If you set the part of the handle from the other endpoint pointing back this way to “Vector” as well, then the curve segment becomes a straight line. However, as soon as you explicitly move the handle itself, it reverts to being “free”.
* ''Automatic'' is like “aligned”, except Blender will automatically adjust the orientation of the handles as you move the endpoints, to try to keep the curve smooth. Moving either end of the handle will change it back to “aligned” type.

=== 2D Versus 3D ===

At the top of the Shape panel in the Curve Context [[File:Blender267CurveDataContextButton.png]] in the Properties window, you will see buttons labelled “2D” and “3D”. “2D” means the points of the curve are constrained to lie in a single plane, while “3D” means they are free to be located anywhere in 3D space relative to each other. Initially “3D” should be selected.

Try moving one point along the Z axis. Now click the “2D” button, and you should see all the points you moved snap back into the same plane as the rest. Also the “centipede legs” along the curve should have disappeared (their presence indicates a 3D curve). You can alter the orientation of this plane by {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}bing into Object mode and then rotating {{B3D:N2P/Do|RKEY}} the whole curve about any desired axis.

=== Closing, Filling and Extruding ===
Each curve piece can be individually ''closed'', meaning that an extra curve segment is automatically added between the two endpoints of the piece. This is governed by the “Cyclic: U” checkbox in the Active Spline panel in the Curve Context [[File:Blender267CurveDataContextButton.png]]. Each closed piece of a 2D curve is automatically filled to form a flat surface.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''What happens if two filled pieces of a 2D curve cross?''' If you try this, you will see that the overlapping parts are ''subtracted'' from the filled areas, leaving holes. Those familiar with the various options for filling Bézier curves in 2D drawing programs will recognize this as the ''even-odd fill rule''.}}

The curve can also be ''extruded'' into the third dimension, effectively turning it into a ribbon-like shape. Look for the “Extrude:” editable field in the Geometry panel, and put a nonzero value into that to specify the extrude width.

If you extrude a 2D closed curve, the flat surface becomes a solid object, and the result is a ''prism''—a solid shape with a uniform, but arbitrarily complicated, cross-section.

=== Scaling and Tilting ===
Turn your curve into a ribbon by specifying a nonzero Extrude value. Change your view so it is not exactly from the top or bottom, but at some angle. Notice how the ribbon is of constant width and always perpendicular to the plane of your curve.

Select an endpoint, and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|SKEY}}. As you move the mouse, you are changing the ''radius'' of the endpoint from its default 1.0 value, and this causes a corresponding scale factor to be applied to the width of the ribbon at that point. You can see (and also edit) this radius value in the Properties Shelf {{B3D:N2P/Do|NKEY}}, in the Transform panel at the top.

With an endpoint selected, now try {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|TKEY}} ('''Note:''' This only has an effect with 3D curves, not 2D ones). Now as you move the mouse, you are applying a ''tilt angle'', which correspondingly alters the angle of the ribbon at that point. This value is also accessible in the Transform panel in the Properties Shelf.

The scale radius and tilt become particularly useful when you apply a ''bevel shape'' to the curve—then you will start to get much more complicated shapes than simple ribbons.

== NURBS Curves ==
[[File:Blender267NURBSPointTransform.png|right]]
Start a new Blender document, and get rid of the default cube.

This time, do {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|A}} → Curve → Nurbs Curve, and {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} into Edit mode. The result looks a bit similar to a Bézier, except there are no control handles, only the segment endpoints. Instead of dragging handles, you can adjust a weighting assigned to each control point. Bring up the Properties Shelf with {{B3D:N2P/Do|NKEY}} if it is not already visible. If you have a single point selected, in the Transform panel at the top, you should see four editable fields under the heading “Control Point:”, labelled “X:”, “Y:”, “Z:”, and “W:”. The first three are of course the position of the point; the “W” value is like a gravitational field strength that attracts the curve to the point. Try adjusting this, and see how it influences the shape of the curve near that point.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Ignore the “Weight:” field further down.''' That has a different purpose we won’t discuss here.}}

{{Clear}}
You can move endpoints in the usual way, but there are no handles to rotate. All the other options for add and deleting endpoints apply as for Bézier curves: {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|LMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|EKEY}}xtend, {{B3D:N2P/Do|WKEY}}→Subdivide, {{B3D:N2P/Do|DEL}}eting Select/Segment/All. The curve can be 2D/3D, extruded and cyclic, and each endpoint has a {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|S}}cale radius and a {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|TKEY}}ilt angle. In the “Active Spline” panel in Object Properties, there is an additional “Endpoint: U” checkbox which forces the curve to pass through the endpoints (this is ignored if Cyclic is enabled).

{{B3D:N2P/Note|You can mix Bézier and NURBS curve pieces in the same curve object. Just use {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|A}} to start a new piece of the desired type in Edit mode.}}

{{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|A}}→Curve→Nurbs Circle inserts a NURBS curve with eight control points arranged in a square, “Cyclic: U” enabled, and the weights of the corner points adjusted so the curve is an exact circle.

{{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|A}}→Curve→Path inserts a NURBS curve with five control points in a straight line, and the “Endpoint: U” option already checked.

== Which Curves To Use? ==
As mentioned earlier, NURBS curves are heavily used in CAD applications, while Béziers are popular in 2D drawing applications. If you are importing data from these applications, then you won’t have any choice about which one you end up with.

But if you are creating your own curves, then you have a choice. If you have done drawing with Bézier curves a lot, then you should feel at home with them. If you just want simple curves to deform a shape or guide an animation, NURBS curves could very well do the trick—you could even leave the W values at the default, and just add, delete and position points to get a suitable curve.

== Extruding from 2D to 3D==
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.49}}

You may have noticed you can only modify the curve in two dimensions, and now it's time to explore the third dimension! Extruding is where you define a two dimensional 'profile' shape, and it is 'swept' through space to create a volume.


'''Noob note''' Bézier circles are not true circles, they are approximations. For artistic purposes, this may not really matter, but for precision modelling only NURBS circles should be used. This is due to the math used to describe the Bézier and NURBS curves.


=== Make a Simple Face of Bézier Curves===

*'''Make a curve and fill it''': Being sure you are in 2D mode, Use the steps above to create something simple, and fill it in using {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|CKEY}}.
[[Image:Face_Bezier_Curve.png|400px]]

'''Noob note:''' you may find it easier to use Bézier circles, instead of filling discrete curves.

Note that the eyes and mouth of the face above are parts of the same curve object. Blender can only identify holes in a filled curve if the holes are part of the same object as the outer curve. If you had created four separate curves then filling the outer curve would have covered the eyes and mouth. To create a detached section of a curve, be in edit mode and deselect all the points ({{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}}). Then create new points (you will need two or three) with {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}. Alternatively you can create the pieces as separate curve objects and join them later with {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|JKEY}} in object mode. You might prefer the alternative way if you don't want a lot of control handles and &quot;centipede legs&quot; to distract you.

===Extrude the Simple Face===
[[Image:Curve_and_Surface_Box.png|right]]

'''Set the extrude depth''': Click on the Object Data button and find the Geometry panel. (Older versions: find the 'Curve and Surface' box in the Editing tab of the Buttons window.) There is a slider called Extrude. Set the Extrude depth to something other than 0, and probably less than 1.

{{Clear}}


[[Image:Face_Bezier_Curve_Extruded.png|right|300px]]

Behold, your 2d curve has transformed into a neat 3d structure. The great thing is, you can still edit the curve as if it were just 2d, and the changes will update in real time.

{{Clear}}

=== Bevel the Simple Face ===

Now you have an extruded shape, you should start playing around with some of the other curve settings on offer, so here is a description of how the Bevel depth and Bevel resolution sliders work.

Try setting the Bevel depth to a small value, say 0.02. This will cut off all of the sharp edges, and give a bevelled effect all around the shape.

[[Image:Bezier_Face_Bevel.png|400px]]

As you may guess, Bevel resolution decides how many times the algorithm divides up an edge. Higher values than 0 result in smooth curves rather than sharp edges, but dramatically increase the number of vertices in the shape.

Try setting the resolution to 3 or 4, you should see an effect like this:

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rock Construction'''

This construction method can be used to create a long-term home.  The practice differs from creating a brick homes in that the rock is not going to be a standard size and shape.  Care needs to be taken to create the best fit possible especially in the outside facing portion on the wall.  Standard clay mortar can be used and when possible shaping of the stones should be attempted.  This method is anything but fast but is unrivaled in permanence if done correctly.  Even the floor can be of flat stones especially if you have a stream nearby.  If water has run over the stone for any length of time the stone will be very smooth.

Depending on the size of the stone you have available to you methods can vary.  If you have large stone one wall is sufficient.  If the stone is smaller you may need to build and outside and inside wall and as you build them fill them with rounder stones and mortar.  The more the temperature varies from room temperature the thicker the walls need to be.
     
Using large rock can increase the thermal mass of the wall.  However in cold climates the greatest concern would be the ceiling and roof.  This is not an improvised shelter.  While the home can be built for next to nothing, best construction methods will require a good set of tools for working the rock.  You can get away with only one or two hand tools if you would like and this can even be done with no tools but it increases your need for planning and careful selection for stone placement.

A good combination of clay soil and some type of dried grass can make a great mortar.  This may sound like a poor quality home for people living in &quot;modern housing&quot; but don't be fooled.  If built as to keep water away from the home especially these homes can last hundreds of years.  

Structurally, this type of home can be extremely resilient to bad weather and debris hitting the home.  The outside walls on these homes are very thick.  If you have the time this home can be built for almost no out of pocket expense and can be fitted at some expense with any modern convenience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h1&gt;Volcanism&lt;/h1&gt;
There are three (3) major types of lavas formed by volcanoes.  Mafic, Intermediate, and Felsic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Mafic&lt;/B&gt;&lt;U&gt;(Basaltic)&lt;/U&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;%SiO2: &lt; 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;%FeMg: 4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temp: up to 1500C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viscosity: Low&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eruptive Behavior: gentle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribution: divergent plate boundries, hot spots, convergent plate boundries&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Intermediate&lt;/B&gt;&lt;U&gt;(Andesitic)&lt;/U&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;%SiO2: ~60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;%FeMg: ~3%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temp: ~1000C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viscosity: Intermediate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eruptive Behavior: explosive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribution: convergent plate boundries&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Felsic&lt;/B&gt;&lt;U&gt;(Rhyolitic)&lt;/U&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;%SiO2: &gt;70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;%FeMg: 2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temp: 700C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viscosity: High&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eruptive Behavior: explosive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribution: hot spots in continental crusts (Yellowstone National Park)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
An interesting exception to this classification is the carbonitite volcanoes.  These volcanoes
have a significant amount of calcium/magnesium carbonates in their magma. While low in Silica and with a low viscosity, which would place these lavas in the mafic class, they are also low in iron and vary in their magnesium.  The origin of the CO (typically CO3) in these magmas is a geologic puzzle at present.  Is it present in the original magma coming up from the mantle or has it been incorporated by the melting of rocks that the magma has passsed through?  Solving this puzzle is made harder since there is only one volcano known to have carbonitite lava eruptions in recent times, Ol Doinyo Lengai in the East African Rift Valley.  This volcano has a gentle eruptive behavior today but in the past has been explosive.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laetoli fossil footprints of Laetoli], Kenya (showing bipedal hominids existing 3.7 million years ago) are preserved in a carbonitite ashfall.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
An interesting, though very technical, article showing how geologists are using chemistry to
try to determine the origins of carbonitite magmas is at
[http://www.geol.umd.edu/~rudnick/Lee%20etal%20(2000CMP).pdf]

== Overview ==

'''''Gabrielle Delacour''''' is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]]'s sister.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

We first see Gabrielle when she is one of the hostages for the Four Champions in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. Each of the Champions is given one hour to rescue that which is most dear to them from the bottom of the lake. Gabrielle is what is most precious to Fleur. Fleur fails in her attempt to reach Gabrielle, and is so relieved when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] surfaces with her that she runs over and kisses him, and also Ron who had some incidental role in her return.

Gabrielle is present in the audience for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]], though she plays very little part. 

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Gabrielle is mentioned in passing by Fleur as part of her planning for her wedding to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]]. 

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Gabrielle is one of the bridesmaids at the wedding of Fleur Delacour and Bill Weasley. She arrives two days before the ceremony, with Monsieur and Madame (Apolline) Delacour, and follows Fleur around, prattling away at her in French and trying to help out.

== Overview ==
The late '''''Walburga Black''''' is seen only as a portrait on the wall at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], her ancestral home. She is introduced to us by her son, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. Her husband was apparently [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Orion Black|Orion Black]], never seen in the books, but mentioned in passing.

== Role in the Books ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===
We first see Walburga when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]] knocks an umbrella stand over in the hall at Grimmauld Place. The curtains covering Walburga's portrait fly open, and she starts cursing the inhabitants of the house, as being [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mudblood|Mudbloods]] and Blood traitors, among other things. Her screaming wakes up the other portraits in the hall, who join in. Nobody can get her to shut up until Sirius appears from the kitchen and wrenches the curtains over her portrait shut. Sirius then comments that he sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] has met his mother. He later says that he had been trying to remove her portrait from the wall, but she had apparently put it on with a Permanent Sticking Charm.

When we are later introduced to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], Sirius tells us that he has been taking instructions for ten years from the portrait of his mad mother. He also, showing a tapestry of the Ancient and Honorable House of Black, mentions that Walburga had evidently burned a hole in the tapestry anywhere there was mention of someone who was not true to her standards of Blood purity. Sirius points out the holes in the tapestry where his name and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda Black's]] had been, saying that Andromeda had been burned out of the tapestry for daring to marry a Muggle-born, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]]. Apparently Walburga had also used a Permanent Sticking Charm on the tapestry, because they could not remove that either.

We hear her screaming again when Harry is leaving for school.

While she is certainly still present at Christmas, we don't see much of her then.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When Harry first returns to Grimmauld Place with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], the portrait of Walburga starts screaming at them as soon as they enter the hall. Harry, as the owner of the house, is able to shut her up quickly with, apparently, a single spell.

While she no doubt remains present in the hall as long as the Trio are there resident, she is part of the house at that point and the Trio don't particularly pay her any heed.

== Strengths ==

Evidently, Walburga was a strong witch, and very strong-willed. Unfortunately, our only experience is with her &quot;half-mad portrait&quot;, which leaves us very little to judge by. 

== Weaknesses ==

Being a painting, and apparently unwilling or unable to leave her own frame, Walburga can do little apart from scream. Her only way of accomplishing anything is by ordering Kreacher around; in the absence of any commands from the rightful owners of the house (initially Sirius, and later Harry), Kreacher will take Walburga's orders.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Walburga was angry with her son Sirius because of his rejection of the Black family Pureblood values, and his leaving the family home to stay with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter's]] parents at age 16. It was because of this apparent sympathy for Muggles that she disowned Sirius, blasting his name off the tapestry of the Black family tree. It was a similar action on the part of her brother Alphard that got him similarly disowned and removed.

Sirius tells us that she had liked Regulus because he had remained true to the family Pureblood beliefs. It is uncertain whether she approved of his becoming a Death Eater, but it is certain that she did not disapprove. 

== Analysis ==

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# Did Walburga treat Kreacher well, or not? If not, why he talking to, and taking instructions from, her portrait?

== Overview ==

'''''Gibbon''''' (no first name given) is a Death Eater who takes part in the battle at the Hogwarts Astronomy tower.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Gibbon is one of the Death Eaters who takes part in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|Battle under the Astronomy Tower at Hogwarts]]. When we first see him, he is dead; a large, blond Death Eater, who we later learn is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Thorfinn Rowle|Thorfinn Rowle]], had tried to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|kill]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], and Lupin had ducked. The curse had hit Gibbon, who had apparently run up to the top of the Astronomy Tower to conjure the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]], and was then returning to the battle.

== Overview ==

'''''Jugson''''' (no first name given) is a Death Eater who takes part in the battle at the Department of Mysteries.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Jugson is one of the twelve Death Eaters who initially confront [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and his five companions in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Department of Mysteries]]. He is first named when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] is sending parties out to search for Harry and his companions, who have escaped; Jugson is teamed up with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Antonin Dolohov|Antonin Dolohov]]. Jugson and Dolohov meet Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]]; Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|Petrifies]] Jugson, shortly after Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Silencio|Silences]] Dolohov.

Later in the battle, ten Death Eaters face Harry and Neville. We believe two Death Eaters are permanently disabled, one being [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nott|Nott]], and one never named, so we have to assume Jugson is amongst their number, though as Harry doesn't recognize him, he is never named.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==

You want to interactively change Venn Diagram parameters.

== Method ==
Use XForms '''range''' controls to change values in a form.  Use the '''bind''' to concatenate input parameters.
Use the '''incremental''' attribute to allow the user to see the changes as the range controls change.
Sending a '''submit'''  will alter the Venn Diagram REST parameters.

== Overview ==

'''''Frank Bryce''''' is the elderly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] caretaker and gardener of the old Riddle manor in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Little Hangleton|Little Hangleton]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Frank Bryce, a villager from Little Hangleton, had been invalided out of the Great War and had come home, where he had started work for the Riddle family as caretaker and gardener. When the Riddle family, Tom and his parents, had been found dead, he was the natural suspect and had been brought in for questioning; however, when they were unable to find a cause of death, Frank had been released. He had continued to keep the old manor house as best he was able, while it apparently changed ownership several times, and eventually fell vacant, though the village was never entirely sure of him. It was as part of his caretaking duties that, now quite elderly, he happened upon a couple of people who had apparently taken up residence in the house; investigating, he overheard them planning to kill someone, one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], and discussing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]] who they had already, apparently, killed. While he is listening to this, a very large snake passes by; Frank is amazed when the snake evidently reports on his presence to the occupants of the room. The two people in the room, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], then kill Frank.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] later remarks that he believes Frank's death is part of a pattern of deaths and disappearances that marks Voldemort's return to power, though the Ministry do not agree.

In the climactic duel between the now-returned Voldemort and Harry, their two brother wands are forced to duel each other. This results in the appearance of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem effect]], in which Voldemort's wand is forced to disgorge the last few spells it has performed. Frank Bryce is one of the five recent victims of Voldemort's wand whose shades appear as a result.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

Frank Bryce's weaknesses become apparent as we explore his relationship with the village characters. He appears to be very antisocial as a result of the war. This estrangement prevents his correcting the village people's belief that he murdered the Riddles. Though he was proven innocent, people still continue to distrust him. An additional weakness is that he has a stiff leg as a result of the war wound that returned him home. This makes it harder for him to move around, and renders him incapable of chasing the village boys when they tear up the garden or try to damage the big house.

'''''Hepzibah Smith''''' is a very old witch, still vain and convinced of her own beauty, who shows some valuable artifacts to a young [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]].

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In the memories of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house-elf]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hokey|Hokey]], we see Hepzibah primping herself in preparation of a visit by Tom Riddle. Tom, acting as a buyer for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin and Burkes]], is there to make an offer on some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblin]]-made armour, but Hepzibah, charmed by him, shows him her two fondest possessions, a cup originally owned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff]], from whom she claims distant descent, and a locket owned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]]. Tom recognizes the locket as being the one that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|his mother]] had sold to try and support herself. Shortly afterwards, Hepzibah Smith dies, apparently mistakenly poisoned by Hokey.

The efficiency of a field geologist depends of his/her capacity of observation.  The correct observation of a phenomenon contributes to its better understanding and allows a more rational and effective orientation of the investigation.  That is why is so important to master the steps that guarantee a correct observation of any phenomenon.  These steps are:  (1) the perception of the object, (2) the primary observation (first impressions) and (3) the elaboration of a plan for the description of the phenomenon. Here we included the statistical pre elaboration of the data, and a model for the codification of the information during lithogeochemical sampling.</text>

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&quot; ‑ I can't explain how I miss it‑ &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;said the Inspector with expression of nuisance.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;‑ It was invisible because it was buried in the mud. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;If I discovered it, was because I was looking for it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Sherlock Holmes, in &quot;The Silver Star&quot;&lt;/div&gt;


Observation is the basis of all the empiric procedures and is the most elemental form of the scientific knowledge. There isn't any specialty or branch of the sciences where measurements, descriptions or observations in the broad sense of the word, are not carried out. The correct observation of a phenomenon contributes to its better comprehension, also allowing a more rational and effective orientation of the investigation.

A scientific observation not only should supply information about the investigated object, but it must also provoke the formulation of new problems or should reveal new facets of the same problem.

In this paper, we show that observation is an interpretive process and we argue its cyclical character, suggesting the steps to follow during the observation of a phenomenon. We believe it is imperative that the researcher possesses at least an hypothesis or initial idea about of the process under study before beginning its analysis. This way the objective of the observation is reduced to verify the certainty of the hypothesis, on the basis of only a few observations.

Now, the question that needs to be answered is &quot;How can I achieve a correct observation?&quot;</text>

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&quot;-But, ... the height of the murderer... &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;how could you find it out, if we have never seen the man?&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;-Dear Watson, you saw me doing measurements in the room. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;The distance between two footsteps showed me clearly the size of our man...&quot;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Sherlock Holmes, in &quot;Study in Scarlet&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;


Measurement is a quantified observation of a phenomenon and it is one of the more commonly forms employed in investigative work. However, almost never the results of a measurement are informative by itself. Therefore, it is necessary to &quot;refine&quot; them to reach to conclusions based on these data. To &quot;refine&quot; the data we suggest two procedures:

a‑ the search for experimental errors, and

b‑ the synthesis of the information.

The search for experimental errors is based on the determination and subsequent correction of the systematic error and the evaluation of the casual error. To determine the systematic error, we use equation (1).

{{eqn|1}}
:&lt;math&gt;S_{sist} = 10[\frac{1}{n} ' (\log x_i^a \log y_i)]&lt;/math&gt;

Where,

Ssist - is the systematic error of the data

x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - is the basic result (the result of the analysis)

y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - is the control result

n - is the amount of data, which in this type of test should be equal or bigger than 100 pair of events.

If the systematic error oscillates between 0.95 and 1.05 (both values included), we can assume that there isn't any systematic error, so we can calculate directly the casual error. Otherwise, we first eliminate this error by subtracting the systematic error to each basic value in the studied sample.

The casual error is calculated using equation (2).

{{eqn|2}}
:&lt;math&gt;S_c = 10[\frac{1}{n\sqrt{2}}'(log x_{max_i}^a log x_{min_i})]&lt;/math&gt;

For quantitative analysis, Soloviov and Matvieiev (1985) indicate that if the casual error is superior to 1.6, we can't relay on the quality of the data. For qualitative or semi-quantitative analysis, other authors (N.A.S.S.S.R., 1983) propose a limit value of 3. In any case, if the casual error is superior to the established limit, it should be recommended the repetition of the analysis with another methodology or with a more accurate equipment.

The synthesis of the information also consists of two stages:

a- The construction of histograms and polygons of frequencies, and 

b‑ The statistic pre‑elaboration of the measurements. 

The histograms and polygons of frequencies not only permit a graphic and compact representation of the measurements, but they also can give us other characteristics of the sample, such as the existence of outliers values, the value of the modes, the median, the average, etc. (Ostle, 1973; Valls, 1985).

A detailed explanation of the statistic pre‑elaboration of the data remains out of the objective of this paper. Here we will only mention some steps that are common to most of the geological data.

a- Detection and processing of the statistical outliers and of the extreme values of the studied sample, 

b‑ Transformation of the data (optional),

c‑ Determination of the Distribution Law (Kashdan et al., 1979), 

d‑ Determination of the median and the relative and absolute modes, 

e‑ Determination of the mean, the standard deviation, the variability coefficient, and their confidence intervals, and

f‑ The determination of the thresholds.

Though these are not the only possible variables to be calculated, they are sufficient to refine the results, allowing us to present them in a more understandable way. The use of tables and comparative graphics is very recommendable.</text>

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&quot;-Dear Watson -said Holmes approaching to his incredibly detailed and orderly archive&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;- I am sure that we will find a reference to that type of letter in this file...&quot;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Sherlock Holmes, in &quot;The Hound of the Baskerville&quot;&lt;/div&gt;


When most of the variables of the phenomenon under study are well known, and especially when our descriptions have a discreet character, it is very recommendable the use of codified systems for the systematization of the information.

The codification guarantees a uniform observation of the essential parameters of the phenomenon, even when in the process intervene more than one researcher. It also presents the advantage of reducing the subjective factor of the obtained information (Valls, 1990).

The codified information (Kashdan, 1982) is easy to understand, to process, to regroup and study, all of which influences positively in the final quality of the observation and in the rapidity of its interpretation. The codified systems are not difficult to prepare. First we establish the basic parameters that we want to observe or measure at each point, and all possible variables of its results. Don't forget to include always a field under the name &quot;and other&quot; to save any forgetfulness or unexpected result.

Next we order the selected parameters in a logical way and we represent them in card of 3 for 5&quot;, for example. The centre of each card and its back will remain free for &quot;irregular&quot; descriptions (those that are extremely variable or when we don't know all their possible behaviors). We will use the edges of the card to codify the information. As an illustration, Figure 1shows a card created by the author for the codification of the lithogeochemical sampling (Valls, 1990).

'''Figure 1. A codified card for lithogeochemical sampling.'''


Each card is an independent and complete unit of information, where we can reflect all the useful information, from the date and hour of the observation until the results of the measurements and analysis accomplished. The combination of these cards will form the database of our investigation than can be easily exported to any computerized data system.</text>

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&quot;-Mr. Mac, the more practical thing that you could do&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;in all your life is to lock yourself for three months &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;to read during twelve ours a day the annals of the crime&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Sherlock Holmes, in &quot;The Valley of the Terror&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;


The main objective of all this process is to obtain a quality primary documentation, which keeps its informational value even after the publication of the results. When the primary documentation is made correctly, the data can become very useful in the case of a reevaluation of the studied area. 

A good primary documentation will fulfil the conditions listed bellow:

a- UNIFORMITY; represented by the same investigator, the same analytical equipment, the same technology or work technique, etc. The use of

codified cards or any other codification method will be of great help to achieve uniformity, mainly in those occasions when more than one person works in the same place.

b‑ PRECISION; all the statistical treatment, experimental designs, etc., most be accomplished with the same degree of precision. 

c‑ REPRODUCIBILITY; the observations collected in the primary documentation should answer to some description system that will allow its later verification. All the key samples should have a duplicated.

d‑ READABILITY AND EASY ACCESS; the primary documentation should be located in adequate places, duly ordered, to ease their consultation and conservation. The text, unless it is in microfilms, codified or typewritten, should be written with legible letter. It is expected that the primary documentation will be simple and objective, so that its study will be quick and effective.</text>

Given the importance of a correct observation for the verification of an hypothesis and for the development of the scientific ideas, it is necessary to pay attention to the collection and conservation of the primary documentation. 

Before beginning an observation, it is very useful to have an idea or objective defined. This will allow us to verify the accuracy or incongruity of our initial hypothesis, with only some key observations. Also is important to remember that the observation must be selective and interpretive, to become scientific.

Don't &quot;tie&quot; yourself to a hypothesis. It is the hypothesis which must adapt to the facts and not the other way around.

Since observations by themselves are almost never a source of sure and univocal information, it is always advisable to process statistically the obtained results. The calculations proposed in this paper are usually sufficient for the preliminary elaboration of any assemblage of geological measurements. 

The practical application of these recommendations, plus a constant search of improvement based in the comparison and the critic analysis of previous observations (you’re own or someone else's) will soon allow you to improve the quality of your observations.

As for the codification of the information, it is recommended chiefly when the studied system is well known and when the observations are accomplished only at independent points, and we assume that among both points does not exist meaningful differences. If so, we recommend establishing a codification system to save time and to increase the interpretive quality of the observations. We are sure that Sherlock Holmes has done it in that way... if he has been a geologist!!!</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Magorian''''', a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaur]], is one of only four Centaurs named in the books. He is a member of the centaur herd that lives in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] for a favour; he expects that he will be sacked soon, and wants them to do something for him if he gets sent away. As he leads them into the forest, he mentions that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]] working with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] has made for problems with the Centaurs; they are not happy, especially not with Hagrid as he stopped them kicking Firenze to death. After they have met [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Grawp|Grawp]] and are on their way back out of the forest, they are met by about half a dozen centaurs, including Magorian and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bane|Bane]]; Magorian warns Hagrid that he is not welcome in the Forest any more. As the centaurs do not harm foals (meaning Harry and Hermione), however, Hagrid will be allowed to pass today. 

When Harry is trapped in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]'s office along with Hermione, Hermione manages to convince her that Harry was trying to reach [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] to say that the weapon they had been building for him was complete. Umbridge is lured by the promise of this weapon into the Forbidden Forest, where the three of them are challenged by the Centaur herd. While there are many centaurs present, only three are named: Bane, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ronan|Ronan]], and Magorian. It is Magorian who first speaks to the three of them, and who Umbridge attempts to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Incarcerous|bind]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Magorian is apparently one of the centaurs who joins in at the final battle for Hogwarts.

Looks like this is a class project. If you guys need something, just ask (the [[WB:ADMIN|admins]] are usually around). If you like, you can help us keep track of class projects by registering this one at [[Wikibooks:List of class projects]]. This way, the regulars will know that you're working as a group on this project and we can better help out. A good starting point for anyone involved in this is [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]] - just a quick primer so you know how things are done around here.

Finally, if there's an instructor or group leader, please identify them to us as such. Having a single contact point makes life much easier.

I hope all of you find this as exciting a project as I (and the other folks here) do. My [[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|talk page]] is always available if you need anything, or [[WB:HELP]] is read by the community at large. Happy editing! {{{sig|}}}</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Bogrod''''', a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblin]], is one of the counter workers at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

In order to retrieve the cup of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff]], which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] believes has been made into a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], with the assistance of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]], determine to enter Gringotts and break into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]]'s family vault. The Goblin who they encounter at the desk, and who Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|coerces]] into leading them to the vaults, is Bogrod. Under Harry's control, Bogrod receives Clankers, and pilots a cart down to the deepest levels where the Lestrange vault is located. It is Griphook who explains how the Clankers are used: to make noise so that the guardian [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]] will not attack them. It is Bogrod who opens the vault for them, at Harry's command. Once Harry has managed to retrieve the Cup, he coerces Bogrod into opening the door for them once more; then, confronted with a number of Goblins intent on restraining him, he, Ron, and Hermione free the watch-dragon and escape on his back.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Looks good so far. I think [[Volcanoes/Volcanism]] needs to be merged better than just dumped into the book though.

:I wonder if we could simply move Volcanism into the rest of the book or just outright delete it. It is speaking to readers in a very technical way that ''I'' can't understand. It would be best to do one of these, probably:
# We could keep it the way it is, with little editing
:A.Related:Edit it slightly
# We could edit it to make it less technical
# We could merge
# We could delete

Parapsychology is the academic study of certain types of reported phenomena which cannot be explained by current scientific understanding. These paranormal phenomena are often popularly referred to as ''psychic'', but parapsychology also includes phenomena such as reincarnation, which do not fall under this umbrella. Parapsychology as an academic discipline began in 1882 with the founding of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in London, England.

The term '''paranormal''' describes reported phenomena which cannot be explained by current scientific understanding. Parapsychologists do not study all types of paranormal phenomena, and many parapsychologists specialize in a particular area.  Parapsychology does not encompass all paranormal phenomena- examples of excluded ideas include UFOs and cryptozoology. This book seeks to encompass both parapsychological and other paranormal ideologies.

This book uses the word ''phenomenon'' for the purposes of objectivity. Proponents and skeptics may use other terms that more closely fit their point of view.

This book is divided into two main sections:

'''[[Parapsychology/Parapsychology|Parapsychology]]''' {{stage|25%|24 January, 2008}}
:This is the study of unexplained activity centered around people. This includes extra-sensory perception, street light interference, telekinesis, poltergeists etc.

'''[[Parapsychology/Paranormal|Paranormal Activity]]''' {{stage|25%|21 January, 2008}}
:This section addresses the '''paranormal'''- unexplained events which do not seem to revolve around a particular person. It includes apparitions, hauntings, reincarnation, near-death experiences, etc., and the methods of testing environmental changes surrounding these events.

&lt;noinclude&gt;
==Note to contributors==
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This book contains a printable version. Any new chapters that are created in the main sections must be manually added to it in order for it to appear in the print version. Changes made to existing versions will appear automatically.

&lt;li&gt;A part of the print version are these two pages:
*[[/Cover]], a cover page
*[[/Contributors]], which will appear at the end

&lt;li&gt;The ESP chapter of Parapsychology requires special coding to appear in the print version properly. All ESP subpages must have their headings bumped a level lower for the print version, example:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt;==Section==&amp;lt;/noinclude&amp;gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;includeonly&amp;gt;===Section===&amp;lt;/includeonly&amp;gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The actual page paths don't translate well to the reader, so every page has a title manually inserted. These shouldn't appear in the print version. Use this code:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;noinclude&amp;gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Chapter title'''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;----&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;/noinclude&amp;gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Introduction: The concept of 'psi' '''&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

'''Psi''' is a blanket term referring to all parapsychological phenomenon. It is divided into two types:

*'''Psi-Gamma:''' This refers to ''cognition'', e.g., extrasensory perception and remote viewing.
*'''Psi-Kappa:''' This refers to ''action'', e.g., telekinesis and street light interference.

Parapsychology is considered to be on the fringe of standard science, due to its difficulty in testing and measurement. Demonstrations of parapsychological phenomenon can, however, be observed.

==History==
The field was created by Joseph Banks &quot;J.B.&quot; Rhine, a graduate of both Wooster College and Ohio Northern University in Ohio. He attended graduate school at the University of Chicago in the early 1920s, earning a Master's and Ph.D. in botany. He then attended Harvard University to study psychology with psychologist William McDougall. McDougall left for Duke University in 1927, and Rhine went with him. While at Duke, Rhine attended a lecture by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and was amazed. He began experimenting with extrasensory perception through psychological tests, and would later test psychokinesis. He continued his studies at Duke for many years, founding the ''Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man'' in the early 1960s. It was Rhine and McDougall coined the term ''parapsychology''. Today, the FRNM is the Rhine Research Center Institute for Parapsychology, and continues research in parapsychology.

==Other terms==

'''Anomalous operation''' is a term used to describe the use of psi to explain paranormal activity.

'''Paraphysics''' is a term of debated definition. It dates back to the late 19th century; however, many varied definitions have been used, and as a term, it is not widely used. A more modern definition differentiates paraphysics and parapsychology by saying the focus is on physics and psychology respectively. However, such a small part of parapsychology extends into physics that it is not studied as a science.

&lt;center&gt;'''Introduction: Supernatural'''&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

'''Paranormal activity''' describes unexplained activity in nature. Often, this includes the unexplained movement of objects, or unexplainable sensations. People experiencing (or claiming to experience) paranormal activity may see, smell, feel, or hear things that can't be explained by another source, and may be consistent with other aspects of their lives (e.g., someone who had recently lost a relative who was a smoker, may smell smoke reminiscent of that relative).

Critics of the study of the paranormal often cite this correlation as evidence that these occurrences are mentally created. Investigators (often known as &quot;ghost hunters&quot;) have made definite observations, however, such as electromagnetic fluctuations, audio recordings, and images on still photos. As these events can be caused by other means, their value as evidence is debatable.

&lt;center&gt;'''The Argument: Genuine or Negative Proof?'''&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

All aspects of parapsychology are challenged based upon the difficulty of scientific testing. Paranormal activity is often considered to be pseudo-science; that is, not tested through scientific means.

Part of this belief comes from various &quot;successful&quot; tests, that later turned out to be fraudulent. One group of experiments, known as the Soal-Goldney Experiments, were taken as proof that extra-sensory perception existed; it was later revealed that the raw data was manipulated.

Specifically to paranormal activity, scientists cite selection bias, that is, the fact that evidence given always points to a positive existence of the phenomenon, without any testing that may provide a negative. In a general sense, supernatural events cannot be tested, and therefore can neither be proven nor disproven.

There are, however, collectors of physical evidence that deal with paranormal activity, commonly know as ''ghost hunters''. These hunters use a variety of equipment to record abnormalities, see ''[[../Recording|Recording Paranormal Observations]]''. Many of these can be explained by other means (e.g. orbs in still photos can be caused by light reflection), as such, critics consider these not to be conclusive evidence.

&lt;center&gt;'''Recording Paranormal Observations'''&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Various tools are used to obtain hard evidence of paranormal activity. These include:

*'''Still photography''', which may capture odd lines, circles, or marks.
*'''Video cameras''', which may capture odd movement, often in a human form. 
*'''Audio recordings''', which capture odd sounds or voices (see ''Electronic Voice Phenomenon'', below). The audio track of video recordings may also record abnormal activity.
*'''Electromagnetic sensors''': areas believed to contain paranormal activity often have electromagnetic fluctuations.
*'''Temperature measurements''', especially infrared video cameras, may show pockets of extreme temperature differences. In the case of a video camera, spots of different temperatures may appear to be human-shaped.

Sometimes, psychics are employed to communicate with spirits; however, this is not considered to be evidence, as their statements cannot be confirmed. The evidence must be all-inclusive to show that there wasn't alteration of it, for example, an audio recording alone might be done via whispering into a microphone. If, however, the audio taping was also on video, it could be confirmed that it was an open microphone.

==Electronic Voice Phenomenon==
One method that is widely used, and an easy and cheap means of communication, is by searching for voices via an audio recording. This is known as Electronic Voice Phenomenon, or EVP.  Ghost hunters often allow a recorder to record while they ask a perceived ghost questions, hoping to find an answer on the tape. Voices may be quiet, muffled, or otherwise difficult to understand, though numerous recordings of high quality have been made, semi-validating this practice.

EVP is observed through recording some type of background noise- it is believed that voices modulate from this noise. Often, low quality equipment is used, as this equipment introduces background noise. Other methods include using a running electrical appliance (e.g. fans) or a radio or television not tuned to a station. Using a non-tuned television or radio is not a reliable means, as a weak signal on this device could be picked up. There has been an instance, however, of a ''tuned'' radio picking up an EVP- a radio was tuned to a French station, and the words modulated to English.&lt;ref&gt;http://aaevp.com/examples/examples_voice6.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents take several issues with EVP. First, many produced recordings can't be proven to be authentic. Often, to show that there was no tampering, a video recording will be made showing the audio recording/playback taking place, though more intricate forgeries could circumvent this. Also, there is the potential for the sound to be background noise, white noise, or others' voices caught on the recording (supporters often argue that the EVP answers a question asked, therefore, it is too great of a coincidence for an unrelated voice to match). Additionally, many skeptics argue that there is no voice response at all- that the brain is misinterpreting mere noise to be something greater, a phenomenon known as ''Auditory pareidolia''.
&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;!-- don't include in print version as links would be pointless --&gt;

==Examples of captured paranormal activity==
*'''Video:''' [http://ghoststudy.com/monthly/may01/videoghost.html Video] which, assuming it is authentic, captured a human-shape figure moving in a parking garage, appearing and disappearing.
*'''Audio:''' [http://theshadowlands.net/ghostwav.htm Page] with multiple EVP recordings. Again, their authenticity can not be verified, except by those who were present.
*'''Photos:''' [http://www.ghostresearch.org/ghostpics/ Page] showing photos purported to show abnormalities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A computer can be a very useful and valuable thing to have. You can do so much with one if you have to knowledge to use it. This guide is for people who want to learn Ubuntu, a distribution of Linux generally believed to be the easiest and most user friendly of them all. Just to be clear, Linux is a very small piece of software that is very fast and robust. A distribution, or &quot;distro,&quot; is simply an operating system built around the Linux kernel. But why should you choose Ubuntu as your computer's operating system?

* It's fast. This means old computers can run Linux more comfortably than other new operating systems.
* It's safe. As opposed to Windows, which requires virus-protection software, Linux very rarely gets them. It's not like &quot;you don't get them that often,&quot; but rather &quot;if you find one, let me know.&quot;
* It's reliable. Windows will often crash or certain programs might not respond. You don't want your operating system slowing you down. This happens much less in Ubuntu and other distros.
* It's affordable. Some distributions might charge money, but most are completely free and non-commercial. They are created by a large community of developers all around the world, who also quickly find out about problems and create updates for them every so often.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==In the begginning==

I made this page to clarify exactly how curves work in Blender, because I felt it is lacking from other places in this book.
When it is finished, it should make the following tutorial make more sense.

==Bevel Objects==
The section &quot;Bevel Objects&quot; needs more clarification with the aid of some images to illustrate the effect of the bevel object dimensions on different distances of the beveled age.


I couldn't understand what this topic was supposed to do. Could someone explain better and include images? Thanks...]

I couldn't understand this either.  Heck, I don't even have a typable field in 'Curve and Surface'... Help on this section would be extremely useful...]''


:After you finish making the filled shape exit to object mode. 
Then add a curve and rename it to bevel or anything under the Link and Materials tap or just use the given name of the new curve. Then deselect the new curve and select your filled shape. 

:With the filled shape selected type in the name of the new curve that you have just created in the BevOb: box. It is under the Curve and Surface tap at the lower right corner.
Hope that helps :)]''

Noob Edits and Observations: Bevel Objects, as noted, create a torus from the original curve.  That is, they create a 3-dimensional &quot;donut&quot; shape and the shape of the bevel object determines the cross-section of the torus, or &quot;donut.&quot;  The text points this out, but not early enough to give an overview.  Some experiments show that:
1.  Bevel objects exert their first influence from the outermost left side of the figure first.  The left side of the bevel object will determine the outer contour of the solid object.
2.  The placement of the Bevel Object in relation to the original curve does not seem to matter; the Bevel Object can be to the right or left of the original curve.
3.  The next inner curve will be transformed to a torus from its left side with a cross-section that is the mirror image of the bevel object.
4.  For complex figures with many nested curves, it appears this mirroring will alternate with each curve as one goes inward from the outermost curve.[[User:WindsorSpring|WindsorSpring]] ([[User talk:WindsorSpring|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/WindsorSpring|contribs]]) 17:36, 26 January 2011 (UTC)

== More &quot;tutorial like&quot; version==
As I noted on the main page, I am currently working on it to make it more &quot;tutorial like&quot; with more images and easier to use.
If I end up not finishing the project, someone can take over, and then paste it on to the main page when it is complete.

Also, I have no problem with other people slaughtering my text with massive edits or revisions.

I will attempt to merge them, and have the other one deleted [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 21:19, 5 September 2010 (UTC)

== Move from default plane ==
I'd like to know how to move a point out of it's default plane.

be sure you have the both end points selected, then use '''RKEY''' to move it around it's axis's [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 21:23, 5 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''Sandhi'''  is the general name for a number of effects in which sound changes at the boundaries between morphemes (the minimal units of meaning in language, like the '''in-''', '''describe''', and '''able-''' mentioned [[{{BOOKNAME}}/Beginner/Words#Morphology|earlier]]), depending on the sound or grammatical function of neighboring morphemes.  The word '''sandhi''' is from the [[Sanskrit]] संधि, &quot;joining&quot;.

There are two forms of sandhi.  ''Internal sandhi'' is what happens when two morphemes join together and the sounds in those morphemes affect each other in some way. An example of internal sandhi would be the change of /{{CXS|n}}/ to /{{CXS|m}}/ in the word &lt;sympathy&gt; which comes from the Greek roots &lt;syn&gt; and &lt;pathy&gt;.

''External sandhi'' is a change that happens at a word boundary rather than inside a single word. All languages will do this to some extent, but it is often not reflected in that language's writing: &lt;ten books&gt; is usually pronounced as /{{CXS|tEm bUks}}/ in fast speech and features the same /{{CXS|n}}/ to /{{CXS|m}}/ change as with &lt;sympathy&gt;.

The word ‘sandhi’ is a term originally used to refer to a set of Sanskrit phonological processes, such as how certain combinations of vowels happen to change when they meet at morpheme boundaries: &lt;hita&gt; + &lt;upadesha&gt; → &lt;hitopadesha&gt;, ‘friendly instruction’.

== Assimilation ==

So it's all very well to say that sounds change when they meet, but we still need to understand how they change. What kinds of transformations can occur? What patterns are there?

Perhaps the most frequent form of sandhi that languages have is called ''assimilation''. Assimilation happens when two different sounds come together and one of the sounds changes to become more like the other. We've already seen an example of this in the word &lt;sympathy&gt; where the /{{CXS|n}}/ in &lt;syn&gt; changed its place of articulation from dorsal to labial to match the labial consonant /{{CXS|p}}/ at the beginning of &lt;pathy&gt;.

Similarly the word &lt;assimilation&gt; is itself an example of assimilation. It comes from the Latin roots &lt;ad&gt; and &lt;simulo&gt;. The /{{CXS|d}}/ changes its place of articulation to become a fricative and it also changes its voicing to become unvoiced. These are both properties that /{{CXS|s}}/ has, and it so happens that an unvoiced dorsal fricative is /{{CXS|s}}/ meaning that the assimilation is so complete that the /{{CXS|d}}/ is completely swallowed up by the /{{CXS|s}}/ and the only remnant left is a doubled &amp;lt;s&gt; in the written form of the word.

== Lenition ==

Another common form of sandhi is lenition, which means ‘softening’. Lenition usually occurs to consonants when they get surrounded by vowels. If you can remember back to the sonority hierarchy, you might remember that vowels are more sonorous than consonants and you can think of lenition as consonants assimilating to the higher sonority of the vowel that they are now butting up against.

Lenition can be broken down into several more specific processes where certain specific kinds of consonants undergo certain kinds of changes:

*''voicing'', which involves a consonant moving from unvoiced to voiced, as with /{{CXS|k}}/ → /{{CXS|g}}/
*''affrication'', which involves a stop becoming an affricate, as in /{{CXS|t}}/ → /{{CXS|ts}}/
*''spirantization'', which involves a stop or affricate becoming a fricative, as with /{{CXS|ts}}/ → /{{CXS|s}}/, or /{{CXS|b}}/ → /{{CXS|f}}/
*''debuccalization'', which involves moving the place of articulation, usually to the back of the mouth, such as /{{CXS|s}}/ → /{{CXS|h}}/

No matter the specific details, all of these involve taking a consonant lower down on the sonority hierarchy and moving it a little further up.

== Dissimilation ==

== Fortition ==

The opposite of lenition is ''fortition''.  While less common, it does occur; as in the Italian /{{CXS|kasa}}/ ‘house, home’ → [{{CXS|ka:sa}}] but /{{CXS|a kasa}}/ ‘at home’ → [{{CXS|ak:a:sa}}].

==Tone Sandhi==

In tonal language the tones will often interact via a process called ''tone sandhi'', where one of the tones will become another under certain situations, often under the influence of other tones. 

Here a few examples from modern Chinese (mandarin, pinyin writing system) :&lt;br&gt;
When any number of tone 3 syllables directly proceed a tone three syllable the first syllables will change to a tone 2.
*xiang3 mai3 hao3 ma3  -&gt; Sandhi -&gt;  xiang2 mai2 hao2 ma3
In a string of three syllables, where a tone 2 in preceded by either tone 1 or 2, and followed by any tone but the neutral tone, the second syllable will become tone 1.
*san1 nian2 ji2   -&gt; Sandhi -&gt;  san1 nian1 ji2

Another language exhibiting complex tone sandhi is Amoy.
[[image:Amoy_tones.JPG|thumb|right|400px|the tones of the Amoy language and its tone sandhi process]]
Quoted from Wikipedia : Tone sandhi &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Amoy has five tones, which are reduced to two in syllables which end in a stop consonant. (These are numbered 4 and 8 in the diagram above.) Within a phonological word, all syllables but the last one change tone. Among unstopped syllables (that is, those which do not end in a stop), tone 1 becomes 7, tone 7 becomes 3, tone 3 becomes 2, and tone 2 becomes 1. Tone 5 becomes 7 or 3, depending on dialect. Stopped syllables ending in /{{CXS|p}}/, /{{CXS|t}}/, or /{{CXS|k}}/ take the opposite tone (phonetically, a high tone becomes low, and a low tone becomes high), whereas syllables ending in a glottal stop (written h in the diagram above) drop their final consonant to become tones 2 or 3.&quot;

There are many theories that say that a language is simply a product of the culture that speaks it, the same way it's art and food are, so there's no reason to say that yours isn't. However, some linguistic theories claim that language is not influenced much by culture at all.
A few natlangs do seem to be influenced by culture;Japanese is the most famous example. The Japanese have throughout history been very hierarchy-conscious. Their verbs inflect to show deference between speaker and listener. Feel free to use your own judgement in how your language and culture interact.

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/197.156.104.13|197.156.104.13]] ([[User talk:197.156.104.13|talk]]) to last version by Yassinemrabet</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Linear Programming (LP) is a mathematical modelling technique useful for allocation of limited resources such as material, machines etc to several competing activities such as projects, services etc. A typical linear programming problem consists of a linear objective function which is to be maximized or minimized subject to a finite number of linear constraints. (By a linear function we mean a function of the form &lt;math&gt;a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots a_nx_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2\cdots x_n&lt;/math&gt; are all variables.)

The founders of LP are George B. Dantzig, who published the simplex method in 1947, John von Neumann, who developed the theory of the duality in the same year, and Leonid Kantorovich, a Russian mathematician who used similar techniques in economics before Dantzig and won the Nobel prize in 1975 in economics. The linear programming problem was first shown to be solvable in polynomial time by Leonid Khachiyan in 1979, but a larger major theoretical and practical breakthrough in the field came in 1984 when Narendra Karmarkar introduced a new interior point method for solving linear programming problems.

==The Two Variable LP model==
[[File:Linear programming graphical solution.png|thumb|Example of graphical solution to a LP with two variables  &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; ]]
Two variable LP models don't usually exist in practice but their study can provide us with an example as to how a general model can be handled.

We will explain the model by an example. 

Consider a chemical company which produces two salts: X and Y. Suppose an acid and a base are the only two chemicals required by the company to produce these two salts. Further suppose that by past experience the owner of the company has obtained the following data:

To make 1 unit of the salt X, 6 units of the acid and 1 unit of the base is required. To make 1 unit of the salt Y, 4 units of the acid and 2 units of the base are required. At most 24 units of the acid and 6 units of the base are available daily. 1 unit of the salt X gets him a profit of 5 (in whatever currency) and 1 unit of the salt Y gets him a profit of 4. In addition due to a market survey he knows that the daily demand for the salt Y cannot exceed that for X by more then 1 unit, and that the maximum daily demand for the salt Y is 2 units.

The company owner wants the best ''product mix''. That is to say, he wants to know the amount of X and Y he should make daily so that he gets the highest profit.

To formulate the LP model for this problem we first need to identify the ''decision variables''. These are the variables which will represent the entities about which we have to actually make a decision about. In our problem it is clear that the entities are the salts X and Y and so the variables should represent the amount they should be each made. So let,

&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;= Units produced daily of salt X

&lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;= Units produced daily of salt Y

The next step is to decide what should be the objective function for our model. It is clear from the name itself that the objective function represents our objective i.e. maximizing our total profit. Since the total profit is usually the sum of the profits obtained from X and Y it should be equal to &lt;math&gt;5x_1+4x_2&lt;/math&gt;. This is assuming that if 1 unit of X (or Y) gives a profit of 5 (or 4) then &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;) units would give a profit of &lt;math&gt;5x_1&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;4x_2&lt;/math&gt;). Hence if z represents the total daily profit the objective is: 

Maximize z = &lt;math&gt;5x_1+4x_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we consider the constraints that restrict the usage of the acids and the salts. We know that the total amount of acid which we use in the day can't exceed 24. Since &lt;math&gt;6x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4x_2&lt;/math&gt; are reasonably the amounts of the acid used in making the salt X and Y we may conclude that our constraint is:

&lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2\le 24&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for the base:

&lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2\le 6&lt;/math&gt;

Now the market dictates that the excess of the daily production of Y over X which is &lt;math&gt;x_2-x_1&lt;/math&gt; can't exceed 1 which means that:

&lt;math&gt;x_2-x_1\le 1&lt;/math&gt;

Also the maximum daily demand for the salt Y is 2 units so that:

&lt;math&gt;x_2\le 2&lt;/math&gt;

An implicit assumption is that the variables &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; can't assume negative values (Why?). The ''nonnegativity restrictions'', &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; account for this requirement.

The complete model can be now stated as:

Maximize z = &lt;math&gt;5x_1+4x_2&lt;/math&gt;

subject to,

&lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2\le 24&lt;/math&gt;,
 
&lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2\le 6&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_2-x_1\le 1&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_2\le 2&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Any values of &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy all the five constraints constitute a ''feasible solution''. Otherwise the solution is infeasible. For example, the solution &lt;math&gt;x_1=3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2=1&lt;/math&gt; is feasible because on substitution in the constraints none of the inequalities are violated. On the other hand the solution, the solution &lt;math&gt;x_1=4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2=1&lt;/math&gt; is infeasible because it does not satisfy constraint (1), namely 6*4+4*1=28 which is larger then the right hand side (=24).

Our goal is to find the ''optimum solution'', i.e. one which maximizes the objective function besides being feasible. The procedure to do that will be discussed in the succeeding sections.

==Properties of the LP model==

LP models have the following properties:

*'''Proportionality''': The contribution of each decision variable is directly proportional to its value in both the objective function and in the constraints. For example, the contribution of the first decision variable in the first constraint is &lt;math&gt;6x_1&lt;/math&gt;. This is directly proportional to &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; with 6 as the constant of proportionality. Roughly speaking, the [[w:Rule of three (mathematics)|rule of three]] is followed. 

*'''Additivity''':The contribution of all the variables in the objective function and the constraints to be the sum of the individual contributions of each variable. For example, the total profit is &lt;math&gt;5x_1+4x_2&lt;/math&gt; which is the sum of the individual profits &lt;math&gt;5x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4x_2&lt;/math&gt;.

*'''Certainity''':All the objective and constraint coefficients are deterministic, that is all the data about profit, availability and requirements is constant.

== Overview ==

'''''Florean Fortescue''''' owns an ice-cream parlour in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], due to having inflated his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marge Dursley|Aunt Marge]] under provocation, ends up staying in the Leaky Cauldron for the last fortnight of his school vacation. He spends his days in Diagon Alley, where he is able to work on his summer homework in the comfort of Florean Fortescue's ice cream parlour, receiving assistance with his essay, and free sundaes every half hour, from Florean himself.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

It is mentioned in passing that Florean's place is abandoned and Florean himself is missing, though it looks as if he put up a fight. We never see him again.

== Strengths ==

Fortescue has a vast knowledge about medieval Wizardry. He is possibly related to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dexter Fortescue|Dexter Fortescue]], a former Hogwarts Headmaster, indicating he could share a strong academic trait that may run within the family.

== Weaknesses ==
Although apparently highly intelligent and well educated, for unknown reasons, he worked as a common merchant, running an ice cream shop in Diagon Alley, though he appears to have an aptitude for teaching, as seen when he tutored Harry.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==
Harry and Florean have an apparently unequal relationship, as Harry spends every afternoon of the fortnight before school opens in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' receiving free sundaes and academic help; however, Florean likely benefits from having &quot;the boy who lived&quot; seen at his establishment. 

Florean may be a descendant of Dexter Fortescue, a former Hogwarts Headmaster, though it is never mentioned when he served in that post. Dexter Fortescue's talking portrait hanging in Dumbledore's office is seen speaking out on several occasions.

== Analysis ==

In ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', Fortescue helped Harry with his homework essay on medieval witch burnings. His expertise in medieval Wizardry is a possible reason he was targeted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] had apparently looked to ancient magic to aid his resurrection and to understand why baby Harry was able to survive his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing curse]]. Although Voldemort was fully restored to life and power by that point, and apparently believed that he understood what granted Harry the apparent immunity he retained, he may once again be looking to utilize ancient magic for some evil purpose. It is never known, however, exactly why Death Eaters kidnapped Fortescue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Different languages and societies use different names. When in a different society, one can either use one’s existing name, suitably adapted, or adopt a new name native to the society.

==Which to use?==
If one is visiting briefly, or the foreign society has similar names, or one’s existing name is at least pronounceable in the foreign language, there is no need to adapt a new name, but for extended stays or for societies with very different names or [[w:phonology|phonology]], adopting a new name is often useful.

For instance, Japanese and Russian names are pronounceable with reasonable accuracy in English, and American society has many immigrants, so Japanese and Russian visitors and immigrants to the US have little need to adapt a new name, though some choose to.

By contrast, most English names are unpronounceable in (Mandarin) Chinese, and conversely Chinese names are unpronounceable in English (the lack of tones in English significantly distorting them), so many Chinese in the US and English-speakers in China adopt local names.{{fact}}

The use of multiple personal names is widespread in a number of societies; see for instance [[w:Names of Sun Yat-sen|Names of Sun Yat-sen]].

==Existing name==
&quot;Close enough&quot; (different European countries)

Societies with high immigration, such as the US
(but names often changed at [[w:Ellis Island|Ellis Island]])

[[w:Brad Pitt|Brad Pitt]] to Buraddo Pitto (ブラッド ピット)

[[w:cognate|cognate]] (Grigory to Gregory/Greg)

==New name==
In choosing a new name, one can try to be close in ''meaning'' or in ''sound'' to one’s existing name, or can select an entirely new name.

===Close to original===
As an example of retaining meaning, one might adapt English (general European, from Greek) [[wikt:Nicholas|Nicholas]], meaning &quot;victory of the people&quot;, to Japanese Katsu, meaning &quot;victory&quot;.

As an example of a similar sound, one might adapt English (general European, from Greek) [[wikt:Margaret|Margaret]] or &quot;Maggie&quot;, to Japanese &quot;Megumi&quot;.

Beware that trying to hew too closely to the meaning or sound of one’s existing name can yield a name that sounds artificial. For instance, Chinese given names are ordinary words, while very few English given names have recognizable meanings (the original meanings lost with time), so a Chinese person seeking an English name that is also an ordinary word will be choosing from a small and unusual subset of names (largely [http://web.archive.org/20031022224910/hometown.aol.com/elfnames/virtue.html virtue names] such as “Grace”, or flower names such as “Lily”). Similarly, using names that incorporate unusual sounds (that are close to the original language) will yield unusual-sounding names. For instance, initial &quot;Yu&quot; or &quot;Eu&quot; sounds are common in Korean and Japanese names, but quite rare in English (&quot;Eugene&quot; and &quot;Eunice&quot; being the only relatively common examples).

===Entirely new===
In choosing an entirely new name, one has much the same considerations as with [[Naming/How to name a child|naming a child]], with certain differences:
;Identity: as one is naming oneself, one has an idea of one’s own identity, which a baby receiving a name from a parent does not.
;Lack of familiarity: one generally adopts a name when first moving to or joining a society, when one is yet unfamiliar with local names.

Thus one would suggest similar considerations to naming a child, with particular attention to:
;Frequency of name: without an intuition of frequency, one may unwittingly choose a very standard name such as YAMADA Hanako (equivalent of Jane Smith), or a very unusual one, without this being one’s intention.
;Soliciting opinions from native speakers: who will have greater intuition about what sounds pleasing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The death of Shapur II in 379 marked the end of an era. He was followed by his successors whose reigns were extremely short when compared to his. Of these &quot;Middle Sassanids&quot;, Bahram V or Bahramgur has to be the most famous one.

== Ardeshir II 379 - 383 ==

Shapur II died in around 379 and was succeeded b y his son who ascended the throne as Ardeshir II. He was accorded the title of '''Nihoukar''' or '''Benificient'''. 

=== The Armenian Unrest ===

Immediately after his accession the events in Armenia occupied Ardeshir's attention. Arsaces' son Para had been murdered during the reign of Shapur II and the Romans tried to replace him with a certain Varaztad a distant member of the Arsacid family. However, the real power was in the hands of an Armenian nobleman named Moushegh. No sooner had this arrangement been made that Varaztad grew suspicious of Moushegh and executed him at a banquet. This roused the indignation of Moushegh's brother Manuel who rebelled against Varaztad and with the support of Persia deposed him and placed on the Armenian throne, Zermandeuht the widow of the late king Para. In return for his support Persia recognized Manuel as Sparapet or Commander-in-chief of Armenia. 

But this arrangement did not last long. A nobleman named Meroujan spread the rumor that the commandant of the Persian garrison desired to capture Manuel. As a result, Manuel killed ten thousand Persian soldiers stationed in Armenia. But Manuel too died soon afterwards and confusion followed.

== Shapur III 383 - 388 ==

Ardeshir II died in 383 and was succeeded by his brother Shapur III. During his reign peace was concluded between Rome and Persia -- the warring factions in Armenia. According to the terms of the peace, it was decided that there was to b e no war between Rome and Persia for the next thirty-six years. Shapur III died in 388. His death is believed to have been caused by a fatal blow from the fall of a tent-pole.

== Bahram IV (Kirmanshah) 388 - 399 ==

When Shapur III died in 388 he was succeeded by Bahram IV. Some sources regard him as the son while others regard him as the brother of Shapur III. He had served as the Governor of Carmania or Kirman during the reign of Shapur III and hence was given the title '''Kirmanshah'''.

Armenia was a province which had hitherto remained divided between the Roman stooge Arsaces and the Persian sympathizer Khusro. This arrangement lasted six years. But in 390, Khusro switched sides and went over to the Romans, Bahram, alarmed at this development, invaded Armenia and captured Khusro. Rome distanced herself due to the fear of provoking a war with Persia. Khusro was confined to the &quot;Castle of Oblivion&quot; and Varahran-Shapur made king in his place.

The character of Bahram is represented variously by various historians. But most seem to agree with the fact that he was a cruel tyrant who neglected his duties. This neglection of duties irritated his own troops to such an extent that they mutinied and killed him.

== Yazdegerd I 399 - 419 ==

He is perceived to be a man of contrasts. Basically his reign was the most peaceful Persia had ever had. This earned him the epithet &quot;Ramasthras&quot; or &quot;the most quiet&quot;. 

In the early part of his reign, he was entrusted by the Roman Emperor Arcadius with the custody of his son Theodosius. Yazdegerd accepted his new role and performed it with grace and kindness.

Yazdegerd is also remembered for his religious fanaticism. He was a devout Zoroastrian and a sworn enemy of Christianity.

In 413, Varahran-Shapur the king of Armenia passed away and was succeeded by a boy of ten. Khusro, who was a prisoner at the &quot;Castle of Oblivion&quot; was reinstated but barely survived a year on the death. Following the former's death, Yazdegerd placed his own son Shapur on the Armenian throne and he reigned from 414 to 418. In 418, Yazdegerd fell sick and Shapur returned to Persia to put forth his claims to the Persian throne. Yazdegerd did not survive long and died in 419.

== Bahram V (Bahramgur) 419 - 440 ==

As soon as Yazdegerd died, disputes arose regarding succession to the Persian throne. Shapur, the king of Armenia, had traveled all the way to the Persian capital to put forth his claims but in the interim that followed Shapur was killed which made Bahramgur the only contender for the throne.  Bahramgur ascended the throne as Bahram V in 420.

During the reign of Bahram V, there were constant wars between Rome and Persia. 

In 420, Bahram seems to have asked Rome to hand over the Christian fugitives who had fled Persia fearing persecution. But Rome refused resulting in a declaration of war by Persia. To begin with, Rome sent their general Ardaburius with an impressive contingent into Armenia. Ardaburius defeated the Persian commander Narseh and proceeded to plun der the province of Arzanne but on receiving the news that Bahram was meditating upon an invasion of Mesapotamia he quit Arzanne and threw himself upon the fortress of Nisibis. But Ardaburius didnt have enough men to take Nisibis. So, he waited before commencing his siege. 

The siege of Nisibis alarmed Bahram. He took the field in person and aided by an Arab contingent led by Al Amundarus (Moundsir) Bahram advanced upon the town with a strong body of elephants and forced Ardaburius to retreat. 

In 421, Bahramgur invaded the city of Theodosiopolis. He besieged the city for over thirty days but stiff resistance offered by the Armenians forced him to retreat. Finally, by late 421, Bahramgur was forced to conclude peace with the Romans.

The peace with Rome facilitated Bahram to turn his attention to Armenia. Armenia had been without a king since Shapur had left the country in 418. Bahramgur desired that a descendant of the hereditary line of Armenian kings should be placed on the throne. With this intention in mind, he selected an Arsacid named Artases, a son of Varahran-Shapur and made him king giving him the royal title Artaxerxes.

But the newly appointed monarch did not have a favorable personal character. The frustrated nobles petitioned Bahramgur to take over the administration of Armenia. Bahramgur obliged and Armenia was made a satrap of the Persian Empire. 

During the last years of Bahram's reign, the Huns or Hephthalites known to the Persians as the Haithal or Haiathleh invaded North-eastern Persia. They crossed the Elburz into Khorasan and proceeded as far as Rhagai. Bahramgr hesitated and initially offered peace, but later he changed his mind and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Huns killing them in large numbers. The Huns were pursued beyond the river Oxus back into their own territory and massacred in large numbers.

=== Bahramgur in Popular Folklore ===

Bahram V or Bahramgur was the most favorite Persian ruler for later Persian writers and romanticists. A number of legends have grown up around him. According to one legend, he obtained Makran and Sindh from the Emperor of India for the aid he had provided against China. It also says that Persia had no musicians during his time and hence, musicians were sent for from India who became the ancestors of the modern-day Lurs. 

His name has also become immensely popular in lands within the Persian sphere of influence. A fair number of Punjabi legends have Bahramgur as the central character. Byramgore island in the Arabian Sea which forms a part of the Indian Union is actually named after him. 

== Yazdegerd II 440 - 457 ==

Bahram V was succeeded by his son Yazdegerd II in 440 whose first act on assuming power was to declare war on Rome. Leading a strong army of Persian Arabs and Huns, Yazdegerd penetrated deeply into Roman territory but the expedition was cut short by hailstorms. He retreated into Persian territory and this gave the Roman Emperor Theodosius enough time to construct a fortified position at Theodosiopolis. 

Shortly afterwards, Yazdegerd directed his attention at the Huns who were making repeated incursions into Persian territory. He seemed to have personally directed the operations at the battlefront from 443 to 451, crossing the Huns in the last mentioned year and defeating the Huns in their own territory. 

=== Suppression of Armenia ===

Yazdegerd is mentioned as a zealous Zoroastrian and his fanaticism manifested itself in the forceful conversion of Armenia to Zoroastrianism. Initially, he sent his vizier Mihr-Narses to convert the Armenians through coercion but when this failed utterly he reacted by carrying away Christian chiefs and posting them on the eastern border to fight the Huns. In 450, the patriarch Joseph held a congregation in which he declared that Armenians were Christians and will continue to be Christians no matter what may befall them. Yazdegerd reacted by summoning the three kings of Iberia, Armenia and Albania and forced them to accept Zoroastrianism. Vartan, the Sparapet or Commander-in-chief of Armenia converted back to Christianity and with the full support of the patriarch Joseph attacked the Persians with an army in excess of 100,000 men. The revolutionaries even made an attempt to convince the Roman Emperor Marcian to espouse their cause which was unsuccessful. However, the Armenians were divided among themselves and in the battle that was fought they were completely defeated and their leader Vartan killed. The Persian troops carried off the patriarch Joseph and other bishops to Persia where they were executed. 

=== The Invasion of the Huns ===

Soon after the Armenian War came to an end, there was unrest in the East with the Huns once more indulging in aggression and making incursions across the eastern frontier. The Huns attacked Khorasan once more and the Sassanian Emperor had to rush hastily to the defense of the Persian frontier. The Persian monarch was so successful in his operations that he was able to check their advance and drive them back across the frontier but when he ventured to attack them in their own territory he faced defeat and was forced to retreat to the Persian capital.

Yazdegerd died sometime after the ignominious retreat and was succeeded by his son Ormazd.

== Ormazd 457- 459 ==

On the death of Yazdegerd, the younger son of Yazdegerd seized the throne as the heir-apparent Piruz was stationed in distant Sistan. Piruz was forced to flee the country and seek the protection of the Huns as Ormazd tried to consolidate his hold on the nation. The king of the Huns Khushnawaz received him favorably and gave him protection. With the help of one Ram, or Raham, a powerful Persian nobleman, Piruz defeated Ormazd and imprisoned him and ascended the throne.

== Piruz 459 - 483 ==

During the period of civil war in Persia, Vatche, the king of Aghouank, taking advantage of the situation, had proclaimed himself independent. As soon as Piruz ascended the throne, he invaded Aghouank (Albania) and quelled the rebellion. 

=== The Seven Year Famine ===

Historians attribute a seven year period of drought to the reign of Piruz. Sources say that the drought was so severe that there was not a single drop of water in the Tigris or the Euphrates and that wells had dried up. Eventually, the crops failed and hundreds of thousands of human beings perished along with their livestock.  
 
Sources also tell us that Piruz should extreme rigidness and wisdom in dealing with the catastrophe. Gradually, the nation began to recover.

=== Campaign against the Huns ===

Piruz had humiliated an envoy from Khushnawaz, the Khan of the Huns and this provoked the Huns to invade Persia. 

Piruz collected a large army and retaliated  by invading the country of the Huns and forcing them to retreat. But the Persian army got entangled in the mountain fastnesses of the northern country and was completely surrounded by the enemy on all sides. The Huns imposed humiliating terms on the Persians and demanded that Piruz their king prostrate before the Khan of the Huns Khushnawaz. The Persians were also compelled to pay tribute to the Huns.

=== Rebellion in Armenia ===

In 481, Firuz was defeated by the Kushans which encouraged Iberia to revolt. The Persian Governor of Armenia was tranferred to Iberia to quell the rebellion but when he left Armenia rose and declared its independence under Sahag. Sahag was made king and Vahan the Commander-in-chief. The Persian Governor Adar-Vishnasp after defeating the Iberian rebels rushed to Armenia but was defeated. In 482, the Persians sent two armies one under Adar-Narseh into Armenia and the other under Mihran into Iberia. Vahan net Adar-Narseh and defeated him. But Vakthang, the King of Iberia perceiving his vulnerability switched sides over to the Persians against the Armenians. Sahag the king of Armenian was slain and Vahan fled the country.

But while Mihran was on the brink of victory he was recalled by Firuz. The rebellion was never quelled completely.

=== The Second Campaign Against the Huns and Firuz's Death ===

A few years later, Firuz launched a second campaign against the Huns in order to avenge his humiliation. He placed his brother Balas upon the throne as regent and embarked for the northern frontier at the head of 50-100,000 men and 500 war elephants.

He established a position at Balkh and waited for the Huns to make their first move. Khushnawaz responded by sending a small advance guard to provoke the Persian army to attack. His plan  was to draw the Persians into the high mountaineous cliffs of Hun territory where a larger Hephthalite army would be waiting for an ambush. The plan proved to be successful and the Persians were trapped in the mountains of Turkestan and cut down to pieces by an army of Huns hiding behind the tall cliffs waiting for them. The Sassanian Emperor Firuz  was amongst the casualities. Khushnawaz dispatched the body of the slain prince with due respectability into Persian territory where it was buried with all honors.

== Balash ==

Firuz was succeeded by his brother Balash who ruled from 483 to 488. His actual name seems to have been Valkhash which had been Arabized to Palash. Immediately on ascending the throne, He sent an officer named Sufrai against the Huns to the north. Sufrai inflicted a crushing defeat on the Huns and forced them to come to terms.

After his war against the Huns, he signed a peace treaty with Armenia. As per the provision of this treaty

# All existing fire-altars in Armenia should be destroyed and no new ones should be constructed.
# Christians in Armenia should have freedom of worship and conversions to Zoroastrianism should be stopped.
# Land should not be allotted to people who convert to Zoroastrianism
# The Persian King should, in person, administer Armenia and though the aid of Governors or deputies.

== Religious Beliefs under the Middle Sassanids ==


=== Mithraism ===

Mithraism or the '''worship of Mithra''' is a cult which emerged as an offshoot of Magism. '''Mithra''' (The Middle Iranian ''Mehr'' or ''Mihr'') was an old Aryan deity of the proto-Iranian period whose worship diminished during the first millennium B.C. due to the rise of orthodox Zoroastrianism and experienced a revival during the Parthian period. In the early years of the Christian era, the faith reached Greece and Rome through the Cilician pirates who had been captured by Pompey and transported to Rome. 

It was not until the end of the first century that Mithraism reached Rome partly through Roman auxilaries fighting Persian troops in the East and partly through European travelers to the East. However, the origin and growth of Mithraism is mainly attributed to the recruitment of inhabitants of Cappadocia and Commagene to serve in the Roman army. These recruits worshiped Mithra thereby encouraging their Roman compatriots to do the same. These Roman soldiers introduced the worship of Mithra in a large scale throughout Europe. The faith had reached Rome in a few years where Mithra was worshiped as the ''Sol Invictus'' of the Invincible Sun. Its worship was promoted by the Roman Emperors who projected the idea that the Emperor of Rome was the personification of Sol Invictus or the Royal Sun around whom the subjects revolved. The worshipers of Mithra established Mithraeums and the faith was the dominant faith in the Roman  Empire till the rise of Christianity. Germany had the largest number of these so-called Mithraeums. However, the rise of Christianity put an end to the Persian faith once and for all. Meanwhile, in the country of its birth, the worship of Mithra was rapidly superseded by the worship of Ahura Mazda.

Christianity, when it became the dominant faith in the Roman Empire in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD adopted Mithraic symbols and representations. The most common portrayal of the young Mithra with a halo over his head was adopted to represent the baby Jesus Christ. December 25, the feast day of Mithra, was introduced into Christianity as Christmas.

=== Zurvanism ===

Zurvan was a post-Avestan Iranian God who was regarded as the father of both Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyus. He is the personification of '''Infinite Time and Space'''; the Iranian conterpart of the Greek ''Chronos'' who fathered Zeus and was the ancestor of all Greek Gods. His worship might have been introduced during Alexander's Invasion of Persia or after as the concept of Zurvan itself seems to be of Greek origin. However, the worship of Zurvan became a dominant factor only in the early years of the Sassanid era. The Sassanian kings, themselves, are believed to be Zurvanites than Zoroastrians. Nevetheless, Kertir's edict at Behistun includes Zurvanites in its list of heretics. Zurvanism reached the pinnacle of glory during the post-Sassanid period when it spread to Balk and Sogdia. Nevertheless, Zurvanism declined during the 10th century AD and died away in a short while.

        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;instance('data')/link[1 + instance('state')/cycle]/@href&quot; mediatype=&quot;image/*&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==

This program has the Next trigger calls the &quot;cycle-next&quot; named event when it is pressed.  This event, which is defined in the model, updates the cycle and resets it back to one after the slides are done.  After that it instructs the form to recalculate its dependency graph.  This updates the visible image.

Note that the output must have a the mediatype set to be '''image/*''' for the browser to render the link as an image correctly.

The Webots Odor Simulation is a physics plugin for [http://www.cyberbotics.com Webots 5]. Webots is a commercial 3D robotics simulator, and the odor simulation plugin allows to simulate wind and odor, and to use wind and odor sensors on the robots or in the environment.

== Contents ==

&lt;p style=&quot;padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px; background-color: #ccffcc; border: 1px solid #00cc00&quot;&gt;This is a currently ongoing research project. The plugin as well as the documentation are still under development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Download ==

The plugin is currently under development and not available for download. Please contact the [http://swis.epfl.ch/people/thomas/ author] to obtain the latest version of the plugin.

== Installation and Quick Start ==

To use the plugin, you need to have a recent version of [http://www.cyberbotics.com Webots 5 PRO] installed on your computer. If you just want to try the plugin and do not have a Webots license, you can download a [http://www.cyberbotics.com/products/webots/download.html 30 day evaluation version of Webots] for free. Note that the EDU version does not support physics plugins, and is therefore not suitable to run the odor simulation plugin.

With Webots installed, you can launch the simulation as follows:
# Unzip the file ''webots_odor_simulation.zip'' that you obtained from the [http://swis.epfl.ch/people/thomas/ author]. This will create a folder ''Webots''.
# Launch Webots and open the file ''Webots/worlds/odor_test.wbt''.

You should see an arena with a model of the [http://www.k-team.com/kteam/index.php?site=1&amp;rub=22&amp;page=197&amp;version=EN Khepera III robot].

      <text xml:space="preserve">We will now attempt to find an optimal solution to the linear programming model we introduced in the previous section. The method we will employ is known as the ''graphical method'' and can be applied to any problem with two decision variables. It basically consists of two steps: Finding the ''feasible region'' or the ''feasible space'' (which is the region in the plane where all the feasible solutions to the problems lie) and then identifying the optimal solution among all the feasible ones. 

To begin the procedure we first graph the lines

&lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2= 24&lt;/math&gt;,
 
&lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2= 6&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_2-x_1= 1&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_2= 2&lt;/math&gt;,

in the first quadrant. Note that for our purpose &lt;math&gt;x_1=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2=y&lt;/math&gt; on the graph.

[[Image:Plottedlines.jpg]]

We now will shade the feasible region. To do that consider the constraints one by one. The first one is &lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2\le 24&lt;/math&gt;. To determine the region it represents, choose any point which does not pass through the line &lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2= 24&lt;/math&gt; say (0,0). Substitute it in the constraint &lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2\le 24&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;0\le 24&lt;/math&gt;. Since this is true we conclude that (0,0) lies in the region represented by &lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2\le 24&lt;/math&gt;. We conclude that all the points on the side of &lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2= 24&lt;/math&gt; containing (0,0) actually represent &lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2\le 24&lt;/math&gt;. This is suggested by the fact that the line &lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2 = 24&lt;/math&gt; divides the plane in 2 distinct halfs: One of points satisfying the inequality and one of those which don't.

In this way all the inequalities can be shaded. The region which is shaded under all inequalities is the feasible region of the whole problem. Clearly in this region all the constraints of the problem hold. (The non negativity restrictions hold since we are working in the first quadrant.)

[[Image:Feasible region.jpg]]

We are now ready to find out the optimal solutions. To do this graph the line &lt;math&gt;5x_1+4x_2=10&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;z=5x_1+4x_2&lt;/math&gt; represents the objective function so &lt;math&gt;5x_1+4x_2=10&lt;/math&gt; represents the points where the objective function has value 10 (i.e. the total profit is 10). Now plot the line &lt;math&gt;5x_1+4x_2=15&lt;/math&gt; which represents the points where the objective function has value 15. This gives us an idea of the direction of increase in z. The optimal solution occurs at the point X which is the point beyond which any further increase will put z outside the boundaries of the feasible region. The coordiantes of X can be found by solving &lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2= 24&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2= 6&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;x_1=3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2=1.5&lt;/math&gt;. This is the optimal solution to the problem and indicates that the amounts of salts X and Y should be 3 and 1.5 respectively. This will give the maximum profit of 21 which is the ''optimal value''.

[[Image:Optimal solution.jpg]]

A point to note is that the optimal solution in a LP model always occurs at a ''corner point'' of a feasible region. This is true even if the line z=c comes out to be parallel to one of the constraints. Although a mathematical proof of this fact would involve considerable linear algebra we will satisfy ourselves of it by noting that that any objective function in the feasible region would have glided out of the region just after touching one of the corner points.

==A minimization example==

Let us look at a minimization problem. It can occur in actual practice when instead of the profits associated with the salts X and Y we are given the costs of their production. All we have to do is now move the line z=c in the direction of its decrease and we have the optimal solution at the point ((0,0) in our example) where any further decrease will take z outside the feasible region. Another way to solve the problem is to convert the min problem into a max one. To do that simple consider the negative of the objective function.

&lt;center&gt;'''Measurable Environmental Differences'''&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Several measurable changes in the local environment will often accompany less measurable signs of paranormal activity. When these are [[Parapsychology/Paranormal/Recording|recorded]], they are taken as hard evidence of paranormal activity. Often, fluctuations will occur around a place of interest- for example, a haunt believe to be a dead relative may cause readings near their favorite chair, or a portrait of them.

*'''Temperature:''' Areas where a ghost or apparition appears to be may show a significant temperature difference than the surround room, and are known as &quot;hot spots&quot; or &quot;cold spots&quot; accordingly. While these may be felt, a more measurable reading can come from thermometer recordings. Heat-sensitive video recordings can show a shape to these areas; usually they appear as a blob, though the SciFi channel show ''Ghost Hunters'' once recorded a &lt;noinclude&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7C7WlYCZGQ thermal image with a  human form].&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;thermal image with a human form&lt;sup&gt;&amp;dagger;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/includeonly&gt;  &lt;!--  fix for print version  --&gt;

*'''Radiation:''' Similar to the spots of temperature differences, electromagnetic radiation detectors may show fluctuations in magnetic fields. Similarly, small amounts of radioactivity may appear. Setting these aside from typical environmental fluctuations is the tendency to occur in one place (especially a place of special meaning), where there is no apparent outside cause. EM radiation is particularly susceptible to false positives from electrical wiring.

*'''Electronic interference:''' Radios, television sets, or other wireless equipment may behave strangely, appearing to be caused by stray signals. Remote control televisions may change channels, or have a change in volume. Video cameras left to record may turn off or experience audio or video static.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The odor simulation plugin is based the [http://www.springerlink.com/content/u5glep7qt749d5tr/ filament-based atmospheric dispersion model] proposed by Farrell et al. in 2002. That is, odor is simulated as filaments in the air, which represent odor packets of a certain size and concentration. The odor simulation plugin therefore consists of five main components: a wind model, an odor filament propagation model, an odor source model, as well as a wind sensor and an odor sensor model.

== Wind ==

Wind can be simulated in different ways:
* '''Constant wind field''': In the simplest case the wind field is constant. This corresponds to a homogeneous laminar wind flow. Even though this model is not very realistic, it is very handy due to its simplicity and straightforward configuration.
* '''OpenFOAM wind field''' (to be tested): More realistic wind fields can be generated with [http://www.opencfd.co.uk/openfoam OpenFOAM] and then loaded by the odor simulation plugin. This allows to simulate turbulent flows with obstacles. The odor simulation plugin supports loaded a static wind field or a dynamic wind field. Using dynamics wind fields could be slow due to the enormous amount of data that has to be loaded from the disk.
* '''Wind model presented in Farrell's paper''' (to be implemented)

Note that none of the wind fields takes obstacles (i.e. the robots) that you place within [http://www.cyberbotics.com webots] into account.

== Odor Filament Propagation ==

Odor filaments motion is based on two mechanisms:
* Filaments are transported by the wind (large-scale advection).
* To model small-scale movements of the wind, a stochastic process is superimposed. (Details can be found in Farrell's paper.)

Each filament represents a gaussian-shaped cloud of molecules. When filaments age, this could gets wider, but the concentration drops (to keep the number of molecules in a filament constant). The odor concentration at one point is the sum of the concentrations contributed by all filaments.

== Odor Sources ==

The odor simulation plugin supports multiple odor sources to be placed in the environment. Each source can release a different type of chemicals. A source is modeled as a circular area in which filaments appear.

[[Image:Webots odor simulation khepera3.png|right|thumb|300px|Simulated Khepera III robot with an odor and a wind sensor on top.]]

== Odor Sensors ==

Odor sensors are modeled as sensors which return a noisy concentration measurement at one precise point. The noise is gaussian around the actual concentration. In addition, odor sensors can be configured to return a running average of the actual concentration.

== Wind Sensors ==

Wind sensors return a 3d vector of the wind measured at one specific point. The vector is a combination of the wind vector interpolated from the wind field, and gaussian noise. The wind sensor can be configured to return a running average of that value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Using the sensors on a robot (or elsewhere in the environment) requires adding a sensor object onto the robot, and then reading the value of this sensor object in the robot controller. An example of this can be found in the files ''worlds/odor_test.wbt'' (world file) and ''controllers/odor_test/odor_test.cpp'' (robot controller).

== Adding an Odor and a Wind Sensor on the Robot ==

A general sensor in Webots can simply be created by adding a receiver object with a special DEF name onto the robot. The magic DEF names for our sensors are '''SENSOR_ODOR_#''' and '''SENSOR_WIND_#''', where the # has to be replaced by a unique number between 1-16. (For more sensors, the corresponding definition in the odor_physics plugin can be modified.)

E.g. your Khepera III robot number 1 could have the following odor and wind sensors configured in the world file (see ''worlds/odor_test.wbt'' for an example):

&lt;pre&gt;
DEF KHEPERA_III DifferentialWheels {
  ...
  children [
    DEF SENSOR_ODOR_1 Receiver {
      translation 0 0.07 -0.05
      children [
        Shape {
          appearance Appearance {
            material Material {
              diffuseColor 0 1 0
            }
          }
          geometry DEF CYLINDER_ODOR Cylinder {
            height 0.02
            radius 0.01
          }
        }
      ]
      name &quot;sensor_odor&quot;
      boundingObject USE CYLINDER_ODOR
      channel 1
    }
    DEF SENSOR_WIND_1 Receiver {
      translation 0 0.07 0
      children [
        Shape {
          appearance Appearance {
            material Material {
              diffuseColor 0.3 1 1
            }
          }
          geometry DEF CYLINDER_WIND Cylinder {
            height 0.02
            radius 0.02
          }
        }
      ]
      name &quot;sensor_wind&quot;
      boundingObject USE CYLINDER_WIND
      channel 101
    }
    ...
  ]
  ...
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note the ''name'' property which is here set to &quot;sensor_odor&quot; and &quot;sensor_wind&quot; respectively. This name is used by the robot controller to find the sensor.

You may have noticed that the above code does not contain any sensor configuration values (e.g. noise level, type of odor, ...). The properties of the sensors (as well as all other properties of the simulation model) are [[Webots Odor Simulation/Changing Model Parameters|configured directly in the odor simulation plugin]].

== Reading the Sensors ==

In your robot controller, you can read the odor and the wind sensors as follows (see ''controllers/odor_test/odor_test.cpp'' for an example):

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// Wind direction
struct sWind {
	double x;
	double y;
	double z;
};

// Odor sensor
DeviceTag sensor_odor;
// Wind sensor
DeviceTag sensor_wind;

// Initializes the simulation
void reset() {
    sensor_odor = robot_get_device(&quot;sensor_odor&quot;);
    receiver_enable(sensor_odor, CONTROL_STEP);
    sensor_wind = robot_get_device(&quot;sensor_wind&quot;);
    receiver_enable(sensor_wind, CONTROL_STEP);

    ...
}

void read_odor(double *result) {
    while (receiver_get_queue_length(sensor_odor) &gt; 0) {
        assert(receiver_get_data_size(sensor_odor) == sizeof(double));
        *result = *(const double *)receiver_get_data(sensor_odor);
        receiver_next_packet(sensor_odor);
    }
}

void read_wind(struct sWind *result) {
    while (receiver_get_queue_length(sensor_wind) &gt; 0) {
        assert(receiver_get_data_size(sensor_wind) == sizeof(struct sWind));
        *result = *(const struct sWind *)receiver_get_data(sensor_wind);
        receiver_next_packet(sensor_wind);
    }
}

int run(int dt) {
    double odor;
    struct sWind wind;

    read_odor(&amp;odor);
    read_wind(&amp;wind);

    robot_console_printf(&quot;Odor concentration: %f\n&quot;, odor);
    robot_console_printf(&quot;Wind vector: %f %f %f\n&quot;, wind.x, wind.y, wind.z);

    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Similar to the odor and wind sensors, an odor source is simply a normal Webots object with a special DEF name. The magic DEF name here is '''SOURCE_ODOR_#''', where # must be a unique number (1-16), and the object to create is a solid.

Your first source could look like this in your world file (see worlds/odor_test.wbt for an example):

&lt;pre&gt;
DEF SOURCE_ODOR_1 Solid {
  translation 1 0.05 0
  children [
    Shape {
      appearance Appearance {
        material Material {
          diffuseColor 1 1 1
        }
        texture ImageTexture {
          url [
            &quot;textures/strips.png&quot;
          ]
        }
      }
      geometry DEF CYLINDER_SOURCE_ODOR Cylinder {
        height 0.1
        radius 0.1
      }
    }
  ]
  name &quot;source_odor&quot;
  boundingObject USE CYLINDER_SOURCE_ODOR
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Just as for the sensors, the world field does not contain any configuration of the odor source. This is done [[Webots Odor Simulation/Changing Model Parameters|in the odor simulation plugin]]. Hence, changing the shape or the size of the solid does not change the area in which the odor filaments are released.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The odor simulation is implemented as a physics plugin for Webots, and therefore lies inside ''plugins/physics/odor_physics''. This folder contains a multitude of files which implement a piece of the model each. The file which holds the whole simulation together is ''odor_physics.cpp'', more precisely inside the function &quot;webots_physics_init&quot;. All model parameters can be easily be configured there.

The parameter names should be mostly self-explanatory. In addition, there is short documentation in the file implementing that corresponding part of the model. (At some point in the future, a better documentation of these components will appear in this book.)

After changing the model configuration, the plugin needs to be recompiled by typing '''make''' in the folder of the plugin, and the Webots world needs to be reloaded.

== Description ==

This component allows to write the tracking data to a file. The data are all the data contained in the particles. But only the particles linked to a track will be saved. The ID of the track is linked to the ID of the particle. One file named &quot;track_##.txt&quot; is generated for each track, with ## being the ID of the track. The file is compatible with matlab and can be directly loaded.

== Input ==
The tracks resulting of the tracking

== Output ==

One file for each track, containing the data of the tracked object, in a tab separated format.

== Parameters ==

=== Output Directory ===

Name of the directory where the files have to be saved.</text>

Is this material not duplicated [[Italian/Pronunciation|here]]? '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 18:45, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

I think &quot;V&quot; is acutally &quot;Vu&quot; and not &quot;Vi&quot;...


&quot;gli&quot; sounds like &quot;Yes&quot;? I wonder if who wrote the text was able to speak italian, because it is really wrong.</text>

      <comment>Added to [[Category:Advanced Interactive Media]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Students and faculty from the Oral Roberts University interactive multimedia program, in an educational partnership with Creative Animation, Inc., (CAI ) will create an interactive virtual tour of a non-profit arts organization.  This tour (referred to as the Master Project) will be experienced in three ways:
*1. A highly interactive web site.
*2. A mini-documentary distributed on broadcast television and as a portable DVD (similar to attached DVD).
*'''3. A game-like media presentation for K-12 students. ''' Students would experience this element inside a portable, 128-foot surround audio/video cylindrical screen.  Using Nintendo Wii controllers and actors blue-screened into a live video feed, university students would show younger peers how to interact with on-screen multimedia while they explain their roles during creation of the product.  A museum curator/host could be streamed live, from their own location, onto the video screen. The surround A/V cylindrical screen would comprise of 8x16ft panels with one taken up for the entrance and one used for the chroma-key wall. It would accommodate approximately 40 children.

'''The third component of the master project listed above provides the primary opportunity for students in the Advanced Interactive Media Class to participate.'''  Virtual tour media will be created in partnership, while CAI will be responsible for the video disc and TV broadcast.  The website will be coordinated by ORU staff member Kyle Broderick.  ORU faculty, staff and student workers will create the interactive game based on research and development from the past two years (see photo of ORU’s eighty-foot surround video screen created for recruiting during the College Weekend event each semester).

'''Four purposes for the master project would include:''' 
*1. The enhancement of Oklahoma’s image, 
*2. The continued cultivation of an education/business partnership, 
*3. The promotion of an arts organization, and 
*4. Student learning.  An option for students, faculty and staff to attend the international SIGGRAPH convention in Los Angeles would provide a capstone learning experience and exposure to cutting edge ideas to be immediately implemented in this project.

This highly interactive, immersive, multimedia, multi-sensory product will be coordinated by multimedia professor Don Eland, from ORU, and CEO David Keesee, from CAI.  

ORU personnel will include four full-time faculty, up to six work-award students, a class of twelve students in Introductory and Advanced Animation Classes, and a 2 or 3 student engineering senior project team.  Mr. Keesee will lead a team of twenty full time professionals who would devote a portion of their work hours to this project.

'''Listing of all personnel who will participate in the master project:'''
*1. Oral Roberts University faculty and staff:  Don Eland, Kyle Broderick, Jared Buswell, an engineering professor, and others as needed.
*2. Oral Roberts University student workers: Judah Hudson, Melissa Blum, Carolann Merchant.  Multimedia, art, engineering students to be contracted upon grant funding.  
*3. Ten students in the Fall 2008 Advanced 3D and Animation class.
*4. Fourteen students in the Advanced Interactive Media class.
*5. Two engineering students enrolled in senior projects classes.
*6. Creative Animation, Inc. CEO: David Keesee and a staff of 20 professionals.

'''Overview calendar for the master project:'''

The estimated number of weeks for completion is following by each activity.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Weeks 		Activity'''

*2	                Archive media
*1	                Project evaluation four: Self assessment and future planning
*2	                Time buffer for delays
		
*53	Total weeks required
*5	Overlap weeks for simultaneous tasks.
*48	Actual weeks required
*12	Total months required for completion.

'''This product will see public exposure through:'''
*1. Television and a web site (primarily the population of the state of Oklahoma): Approximately 3,579,212
*2. K-12 students in Oklahoma City: An estimation of 400 per school
*3. Students at Oral Roberts University:
**a. Total population affected by improved facilities: Approximately 5,500
**b. Students studying majors directly impacted by computer lab improvements: Approximately 400
**c. Student s directly involved in creative production work: 9 anticipated.

'''Collaborations will be required between:'''
*1. ORU and Creative Animation, Inc. (CAI).
*2. ORU, CAI and an arts organization.
*3. ORU, CAI and ORU student workers.
*4. ORU students and K-12 students.
*5. ORU, CAI, an arts organization and Kirkpatrick Foundation representatives.
*6. CAI and OETA for broadcast of minidocumentary.

Virtual environments are costly to develop and demand high-level technical skills but are more convincing than other kinds of publicity.  Tours can provide one of the most effective ways to address Oklahoma’s image by allowing customers to visit the State’s outstanding features via the web, video disc, or the portable surround video experience.  Systems developed for this project can be duplicated to produce virtual tours of other organizations and/or locations in the future.  ORU and CAI will leverage their multimedia experience to produce a multi-faceted promotional product with great promise for the featured organization.  

'''This project will be evaluated at five intervals:'''
*1. Media analysis and planning	                 Week 20
*2. Testing and debugging 		                 Week 27
*3. K-12 student focus group		                 Week 29
*4. Live presentation student responses	         Week 35
*5. Self Assessment and Future Planning	 Week 47

'''Evaluation will take place using the following methods:'''
*1. Instant on-line feedback forms for those using the web component.
*2. Team debriefings at four stages of development.
*3. A K-12 student focus group for feedback before final editing.
*4. Quick survey cards for K-12 students immediately after live presentations.
*5. Critiques of each component from outside media professionals and faculty members not familiar with the project.

Evaluations forms and procedures will be designed by Don Eland and David Keesee to include both qualitative and quantitative data.  Suggestions for development of evaluation forms will be provided by administrators and staff representing the featured non-profit arts organization, all production team members and representatives from the Kirkpatrick Foundation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A volcano erupts when magma from the underground lave chamber of a volcano gets so much pressure that it has to let up and out, and that's what happens: The magma, now called lava, leaves its chamber and BOOM! the volcano erupts with an explosion! It's a fascinating thing when a volcano erupts. On the other hand, haven't most of us heard of volcanoes like Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Vesuvius, Mt. Pinatubo, etc.? The reason they're natural disasters is because they erupted with enough force to kill many.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Naming a child is an example of the [[w:Principal-agent problem|principal-agent problem]]: the parents pick the name, but the child bears it.

A key discrepancy is between:
* personal meaning (to parents)
* personal meaning (to child)
* social meaning (to others)

A rule of thumb is to choose a name that is ''just'' a name:
* not laden with meaning or strong associations;
* not so unusual as to draw attention to itself;
* not so common as to be generic.
Simply a pleasant and practical label that does not prejudice others.

==Importance==
One should neither overstate nor understate the importance of a name: even the worst, most offensive name needn’t curse its bearer (“Loser” went by “Lou”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything
|author=Steven D. Levitt
|coauthors=Stephen J. Dubner
|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;), nor does the choicest ensure success and happiness, but conversely, it is an integral part of one’s public identity, and warrants care in its choice.

People can and do change their names, both what they go by and their legal name, so naming needn’t be forever, but this is rare, and the vast majority of people in English-speaking countries go by some variant of the name they were given as a child.

==Lesson 6 - The Body, part 1==

The word '''corpus''' means body, substance, or matter as perceived by the senses. You will find it in words like ''corpus luteum'' the yellow body left when an egg leaves a human ovary. We also derive the word ''corpse'' from it. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;


Here are some word roots related to parts of the body.

Certain names are widely frowned upon or disadvantageous, and should be categorically avoided.

Don't use:
* an '''offensive''' name, like &quot;[[w:Hitler|Hitler]]&quot; or &quot;Loser&quot;.
:Similarly, don't use a name that is intended to be offensive but is not commonly understood as such (such as &quot;Loser&quot; in a foreign language).
* an exceedingly [[w:List of unusual personal names|'''unusual''' name]], like &quot;[[w:Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116|Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116]]&quot; or &quot;[[w:Moon Zappa|Moon Unit]]&quot;.
* a name of the opposite '''gender''' (see: [[w:A Boy Named Sue|A Boy Named Sue]])
* an exceedingly '''long''' name, like &quot;Anna Bertha Cecilia Diana Emily Fanny Gertrude Hypatia Inez Jane Kate Louise Maud Nora Ophelia Prudence Quince Rebecca Starkey Teresa Ulysis Venus Winifred Xenophon Yetty Zeno Pepper&quot;

These are either impractical or cause grief, and are generally frowned on.
These guidelines are encoded in law in some countries, such as [[w:German names|Germany]].

Instead of a name of the opposite gender, consider a [[w:unisex name|unisex name]].

Instead of an exceedingly long name, consider using a single or double middle name, or using further names or epithets informally, as [[w:nickname|nicknames]]: one can call a child &quot;chandra ka tukra&quot; (Hindi: piece of the moon) as a [[w:hypocoristic|hypocoristic]] (term of endearment) without incorporating it into a legal name.

Don't use:
* an unusual '''spelling''', like &quot;Ami&quot; rather than &quot;Amy&quot;.
* a '''nickname''' rather than a formal name, like &quot;Charlie&quot; rather than &quot;Charles&quot;.
* just '''initials''', like &quot;J. R.&quot;
These are unnecessary: neither changes how the person is called, and only changes how they come across in writing, in both cases unfavorably. An unusual spelling draws unwanted attention,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kaaj.com/psych/namebk.html : (more specifically...)&lt;/ref&gt; while a nickname conveys childishness and lack of seriousness or professionalism. Think of the name appearing on a college or job application.

Instead, use conventional spelling, formal names, and full names. The child can still go by the nickname or initials, but they have a formal name for formal purposes.

In general, don't use:
;funny names: Like &quot;Kandi Kane&quot;. The joke will grow old. Subtle [[w:wit|wit]] (that is not jarringly obvious) is acceptable, but not encouraged.
;brand names: Like &quot;[[w:Courvoisier|Courvoisier]]&quot;.

===In their favor===
Names chosen so as not to conform to the above guidelines are generally chosen because they feel ''individual'', ''special'', or ''clever'', or to make a statement. If it is legal in one’s jurisdiction to name one’s child as one wishes, one is within one’s (legal) rights to choose such a name, but one should consider different names that share the advantages (of specialness, say) but not the disadvantages.

In the case of ''individual'' names, there are a great variety of existing names in other languages that are unusual without being offensive or perverse, and one can come up with new names that sound idiomatic.

In the case of making a statement through a choice of name, one should consider the morality of using a child as a [[wikt:proxy|proxy]] to make such a statement, and consider that there are alternative ways to make statements other than by names on legal documents.

This section is stated in strong, didactic terms.

This is intentional.

Some names are widely considered burdens (as reflected in law in some countries), and I've written it this way to accurately emphasize consensus. That said, in the interests of maintaining a NPOV (people do choose unusual names, and ones that many people consider burdensome), I've included counterpoints.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cautions==
Certain practices are not categorically frowned upon, but can be problematic and warrant care: they create ''strong associations'', which is often the intention, and inevitably the effect.

==Shared name==
;Repeating the father’s name: This (chiefly American) practice may smack of dynastic pretensions, and can be impersonal: the child is strongly identified with their family and father, not so much as an individual. Two techniques are to repeat the first name but change the middle name or names, as in [[w:Richard J. Daley|Richard J. Daley]] (father) and [[w:Richard M. Daley|Richard M. Daley]] (son), or to repeat the name exactly, and append “Junior” or “III, IV”.
;Celebrity: Naming a child “Mickey” ([[w:Mickey Mouse|Mouse]]) or “Elvis” ([[w:Elvis Presley|Presley]]) evokes a number of spurious associations with their name.
;Holy names: The most prominent form of naming a child after someone is naming them after a god, technically called “[[w:Theophoric name|theophory]]”; similar is naming after prominent holy figures. In some societies this is very common: naming sons after the prophet Muhammad is very common in Muslim societies, while “Jesus” is not uncommon in Spanish-speaking Catholic countries. By contrast, “Jesus” is rarely used as a name in English-speaking societies, and “Mary” was not used until about 1300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2179082/
|title=When Can Muslims Use the Name Mohammed?
|author=Michelle Tsai
|accessdate=2008-06-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naming after a god or religious figure can be seen as the height of respect, or the height of arrogance, and people with theophoric (or otherwise respected) names often go by a different name.
;Name of a friend or a friend’s family member: Using the name of a friend or a member of a friend’s family (a child, or an older relative) can be taken as flattering, or can cause offense, due to the proprietary feelings people have for their names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Dear Knocked Up and Bent Out of Shape
|author=Emily Yoffe
|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2191846/
|accessdate=2008-06-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is nonetheless generally acceptable, and unlikely to cause confusion–if both are present together, one is likely to be called “Big X” and the other “Little X”. Intentionally naming a child the same as a friend’s child of the same age (if both are expected at similar times) is more likely to cause friction and confusion, and should be considered carefully–other than any offense, similar considerations apply as to common names, and if the two children are frequently together, they will likely go by last names or nicknames.

==Meaning==
;Meaning: Names in English generally do not have transparent meanings. Thus the meaning of a name is effectively secret, and is not the social effect. For instance, “Apurva” means “unprecedented”, “unique”,{{fact}} but the social effect among English-speakers is that it is an Indian name. One should not presume that the meaning will come across, and should not place undue weight on it.
;Word names: Conversely, because names that are a normal word are unusual in English, they attract attention, and create strong associations. These are largely flower names or virtue names for women: Rose, Lily, or Grace, Joy.

==Popularity==
;Very common: If one has a very common first name, one will likely be called by one’s family name or middle name, or some nickname, and downplays distinctiveness. This practice (and resulting effects) is less the case today than in the past: in early 19th century England and Wales, over 20% of babies were given the most common first name (John for men, Mary for women),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galbithink.org/names.htm Long-Term Trends in Personal Given Name Frequencies in England and Wales], by Douglas A. Galbi
&lt;/ref&gt; while in the US today just over 1% of babies are given the most common first name.
;Unusual or unique: If one has a name that others have never seen or heard before, whether because it is made up or is simply not common in a given society, it sticks out and will likely need to be spelled, or its pronunciation explained. This causes some hassle and emphasizes individuality or distinctiveness.

==Examine the Initials==
When selecting a name, pay attention to what the child’s initials will be, and make sure that if it spells something, it is innocuous.  “Anna Serena Smith” will have obvious problems with her name throughout her life, as every “clever” cad she meets will tell her what her initials spell.  She will know exactly what her initials spell early in life.  Meanwhile, “Karen Irene Thornton” will suffer no such abuse, for even though her name spells a word, it is an innocuous one.

===Username===
Similarly, one may consider future [[w:username|username]]s, which for First M. Last are often of the form:
* flast
* lastf
* firstl
* fmlast
They may also be truncated, as in:
* firsl
* lasf
These are less obvious than initials, and less used by other people, but occasionally they form recognizable words, and in some contexts others may use one’s username, such as to address email or as a screen name.
If one wishes to be cautious, one may check what a child’s usernames would be; if one wishes to include a hidden word, this is a subtler place to put one than initials.

&lt;center&gt;'''Extrasensory Perception'''&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

'''Extrasensory perception''', or ESP, is the ability to acquire information without observing it with one of the five basic senses. There are multiple ways in which it manifests:

*[[Parapsychology/Parapsychology/ESP/RV|Clairvoyance or Remote Viewing:]] The subject experiences a vision an event that they are not a part of, possibly from a far location.
*[[Parapsychology/Parapsychology/ESP/Cognition|Precognition or Retrocognition:]] The subject not only sees an event that they are not a part of, but one that takes place in a different time. In the event of retrocognition, they experience something from that past that they did not experience when it occurred (which could be before the subject's birth). In precognition, the subject sees into the future, later realizing that they had foreseen the event.
*[[Parapsychology/Parapsychology/ESP/Psychometry|Psychometry:]] The subject obtains information about an individual from an object belonging to that individual.
*[[Parapsychology/Parapsychology/ESP/Telepathy|Telepathy:]] The sending of decipherable messages without the use of the five senses.
*[[Parapsychology/Parapsychology/ESP/OOB|Out of Body (OOB) Experience or Astral Projection:]] The subject mentally leaves their body and experiences event occurring at the current time. This often occurs during sleep or lucid dreaming.
*[[Parapsychology/Parapsychology/ESP/Mediumship|Mediumship:]] The ability to communicate with dead spirits.
*[[Parapsychology/Parapsychology/ESP/Kinesis|Psychokenisis:]] The ability to move objects without touch.

&lt;noinclude&gt;==Criticisms==&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;includeonly&gt;===Criticisms===&lt;/includeonly&gt;
&lt;!-- fix for print version --&gt;
All of these facets of ESP are extremely difficult to prove scientifically. For example, should someone claim that they experienced precognition, they could be accused of making it up on the spot. Obviously, the general public does not write every image that enters their mind, and would have no record of their earlier thoughts. Additionally, some claim that precognition is simply the sudden remembering of formerly repressed memories. Mediumship and psychometry are often attributed to cold reading. In addition, there is no way to conclusively prove that communications through a medium are real- should a supposed medium invent information, it could not be known by others.

==Lesson 5 - Colors ==

Many words incorporate Greek and Latin words for colors. For example, the word for a red blood cell is '''erythrocyte'''. ''Erythro'' is a Greek root meaning '''red'''.  Here are some more color roots that you may encounter.



:'''melan/o '''  : black
:'''nigr/o ''': black
:'''leuc/o '''  : white
:'''alb/a ''': white
:'''erythr/o '''  : red
:'''rub/o '''  : red
:'''rhod/o ''' : rosy / red
:'''xanth/o '''  : yellow
:'''cyan/o '''  : blue-green / blue
:'''glauc/o '''  : grey
:'''chlor/o '''  : green

:'''chrom/o '''  : color</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">When one is discussing a concept, having a ''label'' to use to refer to it facilitates discourse, and identifies it as a specific idea, making the concept more mnemonic and usable, via [[w:chunking (psychology)|chunking]]. See especially [[w:Thought_experiment#Origins_and_use_of_the_term_.22thought_experiment.22|use of the term &quot;thought experiment&quot;]] on the value of naming a concept.

Naming concepts is useful both for technical jargon (within a specific work or field), or in common speech.

==Successful examples==
Examples of names for concepts that have caught on:
*[[w:conspicuous consumption|Conspicuous Consumption]]
*[[w:paradigm shift|Paradigm Shift]]
These were both central ideas of a book.

More recent:
*[[w:tipping point|Tipping Point]]
*[[w:black swan|Black Swan]]
These latter were the titles of books that focused on the concepts.

These are all two-word [[w:noun phrases|noun phrases]]; in some cases they use a more or less unusual word (&quot;conspicuous&quot;, and &quot;paradigm&quot;), in other cases common words.

In all cases, there is a clear idea underlying them: the issue is simply to label it in a memorable and evocative way.

==Unsuccessful examples==
* [[w:noosphere|Noosphere]] / [[w:ideosphere|Ideosphere]] / [[w:infosphere|Infosphere]]
The &quot;world of ideas &amp; information&quot; is a commonly understood concept that does not have a commonly accepted term, despite the above efforts. &quot;Noosphere&quot; is rather alien-sounding, while &quot;infosphere&quot; is too casual-sounding.

==High jargon fields==
Technical fields tend to be higher in jargon, as one uses existing concepts to build higher concepts, hence one needs a way to refer concisely to these concepts.
* Legal jargon
* Mathematics
* Philosophy

==General principles==
===Avoid generic terms===
For instance, in mathematics, &quot;[[w:Normal (mathematics)|normal]]&quot; means a bewildering array of distinct concepts.

===Foreign terms===
Loaned foreign terms can be memorable for their very foreignness: in physics, '''Gedankenexperiment''' is frequently used for [[w:thought experiment|thought experiment]]. One can also [[w:calque|calque]] a phrase (translate it word-for-word).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''Urban Legends and Paranormal Activity'''&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
'''Urban legends''' often circulate around very popular areas of paranormal activity. Many communities have one or more local haunted areas, of which stories abound. Often a legend follows these, which claims to explain the cause for the haunting. For example, there are perhaps thousands of &quot;Crybaby Bridges&quot; across the country, and these are almost always an accompanying tale about a young mother drowning a baby, throwing her baby off of the bridge, etc. Many areas have ghost hitchhikers; there is almost always an explanation involving a car accident death.

One must approach these legends with critical thinking, and in almost every case, a major question is immediately raised: '''If the story is true, how would anyone know?''' Here is a prime example: In Cleveland's Erie Cemetery (across the street from the Indians' Progressive Field) lies chief Joc-O-Sot. According to legend, Joc-O-Sot was part of a Vaudeville troupe that traveled to England. While there, Joc-O-Sot took ill (varying stories list his cause of illness as a previous gunshot wound that became aggravated, or tuberculosis). He wished to return to his native home in Minnesota, but died while passing through Cleveland, and was buried there. He is claimed to haunt the cemetery and the baseball stadium, and it is said that he shattered his headstone out of anger (the headstone is indeed shattered).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deadohio.com/eriestreet.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/oh/newspapers/tidbits/tbs91.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

One should immediately realize that, without the ability to speak to the dead, it would not be possible to know what happened to the headstone. Unless there is historical evidence that Joc-O-Sot was angry prior to his death, knowing that he wouldn't make it to Minnesota, this part of the legend also cannot be proven. What ''is'' known is that there was indeed a chief Joc-O-Sot, who is buried at the cemetery. Historical research could determine whether or not he was a chief, how he died, and whether or not he was part of a Vaudeville troupe. Scientific testing could find evidence of paranormal activity in the area, and possibly point to Joc-O-Sot, should his image appear in photos, through EVP recordings, or unusual measurements in the exact location of his grave. These would not, however, confirm the urban legend.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Khepera III Toolbox is a collection of scripts, programs and code modules for the [http://www.k-team.com/kteam/index.php?site=1&amp;rub=22&amp;page=197&amp;version=EN Khepera III robot].

The toolbox was developed by the [http://disal.epfl.ch Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory (DISAL)] at [http://www.epfl.ch EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland)] and comprises:
* Scripts to conveniently upload and run programs on multiple robots.
* Programs to interact with most robot features (e.g. infrared sensors, motors).
* A development environment (using arm-linux-gcc and make) to easily program and compile programs for the robot.
* A very straightforward API to access sensors and actuators on the robot.
* Install scripts to set up WLAN networking and other things.

The toolbox does not need the libkorebot and provides a faster, safer and easier to use implementation of the same functionality.

      <comment>/* Getting the Latest Revision from SVN */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Download ==

=== Downloading the Package ===

A more or less [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=219298 stable release] of the toolbox is now available on the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/khepera3toolbox/ sourceforge project page]. After downloading the file, uncompress it with
 unzip khepera3toolbox-YYYY-MM-DD.zip
This will create a folder ''khepera3toolbox'' in your current directory with the whole toolbox.

This is the preferred way of getting the toolbox if you intend to just use it, but not make any contributions (programs, modules, bugfixes, ...) by yourself. Whenever we release a new version, you have to download a new ZIP file, and replace the whole ''khepera3toolbox'' with the new version of the toolbox.

=== Getting the Latest Revision from SVN ===

The latest version can be obtained by checking out the following SVN tree:
 svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/khepera3toolbox/code/
This will create a folder ''khepera3toolbox'' in your current directory with the whole toolbox.

This is the preferred way of getting the toolbox if you plan on making contributions (programs, modules, bugfixes, ...) by yourself, or if you want to use the latest version of the toolbox. To update to a new revision, just type
 svn update
inside the ''khepera3toolbox'' folder.

== Installation ==

The toolbox does not need to be copied to a specific place - it stays in a convenient place in your home directory.

However, you need to modify two environment variables. This can either be done manually, by typing the following two lines on your ''bash'' shell:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
export K3_ROOT=/path/to/your/khepera3toolbox
export PATH=$PATH:$K3_ROOT/Scripts
&lt;/source&gt;
or automatically, by adding the above lines to your ~/.bashrc (or ~/.profile) file. Note that if you choose to do it manually, you need to it each time you open a new terminal window. 

To check if you set these variables correctly, type
 k3go -h
This should print a short help text for the [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Scripts|k3go script]] in your terminal window.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scene I==


The play opens with three of our main characters, LEONATO, his daughter HERO and her cousin BEATRICE getting news from a MESSENGER. The information the messenger provides sets up the scene: the prince and his lords are returning from a battle in which they have had great success. Once LEONATO has found out that all is well, and that a young nobleman named CLAUDIO has made a name for himself, the rest of this part of the scene is dominated by BEATRICE. She demonstrates her vivacious wit by making fun of BENEDICK, one of the returning lords who we are told she has an ongoing &quot;merry war&quot; with. The names BEATRICE and BENEDICK correspond - Beatrice means 'she who blesses' and Benedick means 'he who is blessed' which the contemporary audience would have spotted as a sign that the two are destined to be lovers despite her apparent low opinion of him (think modern soaps where characters who display passionate dislike often end up in bed together the next week).


The prince DON PEDRO, his half brother DON JOHN, CLAUDIO and BENEDICK arrive and LEONATO and the prince exchange greetings and pleasantries. They display mutual respect - LEONATO naturally respects his prince and DON PEDRO is grateful to LEONATO for hosting him and his men. This brief exchange is barely over when BEATRICE and BENEDICK start criticising each other and expressing how little they each care for the other. They both have razor sharp wit and use it to insult each other. Such vehement dislike and clever turn of phrase is rather funny, considering they have such strong passion for each other and are the only ones who cannot see it.


All but BENEDICK and CLAUDIO leave. Immediately CLAUDIO asks BENEDICK's opinion of HERO. BENEDICK reels off a list of reasons why HERO is inferior: she is not fair-skinned enough to be desirable and is far too short for his liking (tall women were believed at the time to be more likely to survive childbirth thus make more suitable wives), even BEATRICE is more attractive than HERO in his opinion. BENEDICK goes on to despair that no man can seem to stay a bachelor anymore and vows that he himself will never &quot;turn husband.&quot; CLAUDIO doesn't take him too seriously; he is already deeply in love. DON PEDRO returns and joins their conversation, agreeing with CLAUDIO that HERO is a worthy woman. DON PEDRO even challenges BENEDICK's strong views, saying that he will see him sick with love before too long (predicting what we all know will happen). BENEDICK leaves and DON PEDRO agrees to help CLAUDIO win over HERO and the approval of LEONATO by pretending to be him at the disguise party.

==Scene II==


ANTONIO is telling LEONATO that one of his servants overheard DON PEDRO talking to CLAUDIO about his plans to woo HERO. As we know from having witnessed this scene the servant has got it wrong; DON PEDRO was offering to help CLAUDIO by pretending to be him while talking to HERO and LEONATO - not actually wooing HERO for himself. Unfortunately LEONATO is pleased with this news as marrying his daughter to a prince would be a great honour.

==Scene III==


DON JOHN is miserable: he has been accepted into his brother's good favour but as an illigitimate son he has no claim to power or honour. As such he seeks to deliberately make mischief (he has quite a chip on his shoulder). CONRADE tries to cheer him up with little success, but when BORACHIO enters and and informs him of DON PEDRO's plan to woo HERO for CLAUDIO he perks up, spotting an opportunity to make trouble. When he gets his men to swear their loyalty it is reminiscent of troublesome teenagers promising not to tell on each other before commiting their misdeeds. DON JOHN is entirely selfish, but sees himself as the victim of prejuduce even though in the play the other characters treat him respectfully.

[[w:JBoss Seam|Seam]] is a Java application stack, developed by [[w:JBoss (company)|JBoss]], geared primarily towards the development of web applications.  Its primary purpose is to pull together [[w:JavaServer Faces|JavaServer Faces]] and [[w:Enterprise JavaBean|Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0]] by removing all of the &quot;plumbing&quot; code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To set up Seam, use the following software:

==Software==
* JBoss 4.2.2.GA
* JBoss Seam 2.0.0.GA
* Eclipse Europa for JEE developers
* JDK 1.5.x or above
* Apache Ant 1.6.x (do not use 1.7!)

==Configuration==
===Environment variables===
* Ensure that JAVA_HOME is pointing to the JDK
* Ensure that ANT_HOME is pointing to the Ant directory
* Make sure that &quot;%ANT_HOME%\bin&quot; is in the PATH variable

===Seam===
* Put the location of the JBOSS AS in the build.properties file (has to be absolute)

===Eclipse===
* Set up the JBoss AS Runtime
** Go to Windows --&gt; Preferences --&gt; Server --&gt; Installed Runtimes
** Click Add
** Select JBoss 4.2 Runtime
** Browse for the installation directory
* Set up the server to run off the runtime
** In the JBoss Server View, select New Server
** Select your newly created runtime
* Test the server by starting it up
** If there are problems, check the end of this guide for technical issues on JBoss

===HSQLDB (a.k.a. Hypersonic)===
* The embedded database within JBoss
* I am using it in its default configuration, which means that data will not be retained when the JBoss Application Server is shut down

==Notes==
The above configuration is for Windows XP.  I've set up the same environment on Linux (Kubuntu 7.10) without much difficulty as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve"># In Eclipse, use the wizard to create a new Seam project called &quot;myProject&quot;, make sure to choose &quot;EAR&quot; as the project type, as WAR files do not support EJB3
# Eclipse will create four separate projects
#* myProject
#* myProject-ear
#* myProject-ejb
#* myProject-test
# Of these, only two areas are, for now, of interest to us
#* The &quot;WebContent&quot; folder in the &quot;myProject&quot; project
#** This will contain all your JSF pages, images, CSS files etc.  Basically, everything to do with the UI.
#* The &quot;ejbModule&quot; folder in the &quot;myProject-ejb&quot; project
#** This will contain all your Java classes.  
#** Although there is a SRC directory under the &quot;myProject&quot; folder, you can't use classes there as fully working Seam components
#** Since most of the classes should be regarding business logic or persistance, they should be EJBs anyway
# To help clear some of the clutter set the filter to hide &quot;Libraries from external&quot;
# Turn off the Hibernate logging by opening &quot;persistence.xml&quot; (located in myProject-ejb --&gt; ejbModule --&gt; META-INF) and setting the property &quot;hibernate.show_sql&quot; to &quot;false&quot;.  You don't have to do this, but I find Hibernate to be pretty chatty and the messages usually don't help me much.  You can always turn it back on later if needed.
