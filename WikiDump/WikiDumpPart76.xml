== Optables and Expressions ==

Top-down parsing has some problems. First, it's slow because it may need to try many alternatives before it finds a match. Each time it fails on a match, it needs to return to the previous rule and try again. Another problem is that parse trees can become very large for statements that have lots of little tokens, operator precedence, and many subrules. Consider a simple mathematical expression &quot;1 * 2 + 5&quot; and the following grammar:

 EXPRESSION := TERM ADD_OP TERM
 TERM := (NUMBER MUL_OP NUMBER) | NUMBER
 ADD_OP := '+' | '-'
 MUL_OP := '*' | '/'

Our equation above creates a very complex parse tree:

 EXPRESSION
    TERM
       NUMBER 2
       MUL_OP &quot;*&quot;
       NUMBER 5
    ADD_OP &quot;+&quot;
       TERM
          NUMBER 5

For things like a mathematical expression, we would like to use a bottom-up parser instead of a top-down one. A special type of bottom-up parser, called an '''operator precidence table parser''' is particularly efficient and well-suited for these tasks. To create an operator precedence table, PGE has a special tool called an &lt;code&gt;optable&lt;/code&gt;.

== Creating Optables ==

An optable is created by creating a rule that &lt;code&gt;is optable&lt;/code&gt;. Here is an example:

 rule expression is optable { ... }

The &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; is not an omission, it's part of the rule. If you don't have the &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; three dots, your rule will not work. This is called the ''yada yada yada'' operator, and is used to define a function prototype. PGE will instantiate the function for you, using the options you specify. The keyword &lt;code&gt;is optable&lt;/code&gt; tells the parser to convert to bottom-up mode to parse expressions

== Operator Prototypes ==

In an optable, tokens are specified using the &lt;code&gt;proto&lt;/code&gt; keyword instead of the &lt;code&gt;rule&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;token&lt;/code&gt; keywords. A &lt;code&gt;proto&lt;/code&gt; definition must define several things: The name and type of the operator, the precidence of the operator, and the PIR code that is used to perform the particular operation. Here are some examples:

 proto 'infix:+' is precidence('1') is pirop('add') { ... }
 proto 'prefix:-' is tighter('infix:+') is pirop('neg') { ... }
 proto 'postfix:++' is equal('prefix:-') { ... }

These examples show how to parse three common operators: A &quot;+&quot; between two values, a negative value for a negative number (such as &quot;-123&quot;) and a post-increment operator (&quot;x++&quot;). There are lots of important keywords here, and this isn't even all the keywords you will need to produce a full expression parser. 

==== Operator Types ====

There are four types of operator: '''prefix''', '''postfix''', '''infix''', and '''circumfix'''. Here are some examples:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Type
!Example
!Use
|-
!Prefix
|&lt;code&gt;prefix:-&lt;/code&gt;
| -123
|-
!postfix
|&lt;code&gt;postfix:*&lt;/code&gt;
|x*
|-
!infix
|&lt;code&gt;infix:+&lt;/code&gt;
|x+y
|-
!circumfix
|&lt;code&gt;circumfix:()&lt;/code&gt;
|(x)
|-
!postcircumfix
|&lt;code&gt;postcircumfix:[]&lt;/code&gt;
|x[y]
|-
!ternary
|&lt;code&gt;ternary:? :&lt;/code&gt;
|x?y:z
|}

=== Operator Precedence ===

Bottom-up parsers, as we mentioned before, suffer from a particular problem called shift-reduce conflicts. A shift-reduce conflict occurs when a parser cannot determine whether to shift in a new input token, or reduce the tokens it already has. Here is an example from the C programming language:

 -x + 2 * y

We know, because we've been taught about operator precedence since we were children, that the expression is grouped like this:

 (-x) + (2 * y)

However, a computer doesn't know this unless we tell it what precedence the operators follow. For instance, without knowing the order in which operators act, a parser might group the expression on a first-come, first-served basis like this:

 ((-x) + 2) * y

Or maybe it would shift in all tokens and start reducing from the right:

 -(x + (2 * y)

The point is, we need to create rules to tell the operator precedence parser how to parse these conflicts. Here are the precedence rules that we can specify:

{| class=wikitable
|-
!Code
!Effect
|-
|&lt;code&gt;is precidence('1')&lt;/code&gt;
|Sets a basic precidence level. The number in the quotes is arbitrary. The important part is that this is a constant, and that other operators can be defined in relation to this.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;is equiv('OPERATOR')&lt;/code&gt;
|Here, the word &lt;code&gt;OPERATOR&lt;/code&gt; will be replaced by an existing operator, such as &lt;code&gt;is operator('infix:+')&lt;/code&gt; This shows that one operator has the same precedence as another operator. All operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left-to-right.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;is tighter('OPERATOR')&lt;/code&gt;
|The operator binds tighter than OPERATOR. In the expression &lt;code&gt;-x + y&lt;/code&gt;, we expect the &lt;code&gt;prefix:-&lt;/code&gt; to bind tighter than the &lt;code&gt;infix:+&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;is looser('OPERATOR')&lt;/code&gt;
|Similar to &lt;code&gt;is tighter()&lt;/code&gt;, but the opposite. Shows that the operator binds less tightly than OPERATOR
|}

We didn't show this in the example, but it's also possible to determine whether operators act to the left or to the right. We define this with the &lt;code&gt;is assoc&lt;/code&gt; keyword. The following table summarizes these rules:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Associativity
!Explanation
|-
|&lt;code&gt;is assoc('right')&lt;/code&gt;
|
|-
|&lt;code&gt;is assoc('left')&lt;/code&gt;
|
|-
|&lt;code&gt;is assoc('list')&lt;/code&gt;
|
|-
|&lt;code&gt;is assoc('chain')&lt;/code&gt;
|
|-
|&lt;code&gt;is assoc('none')&lt;/code&gt;
|
|}

== Operator Actions ==

There are three ways to specify how an operator behaves. The first is to associate the operator with a PIR opcode. The second is to associate the operator with a PAST node type. The third and final way to specify the actions of an operator is to create a function. The first two methods can be performed with the &lt;code&gt;is pirop()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;is pasttype()&lt;/code&gt; specifiers, respectively. 

=== &lt;code&gt;is pirop&lt;/code&gt; Operators ===

For simple operations, it doesn't make any sense to create and call a function. This is especially true for simple arithmetic operations which can be performed very quickly using PASM opcodes that Parrot already defines. Use the code &lt;code&gt;is pirop('opname')&lt;/code&gt; to implement an operator as a single opcode.

=== &lt;code&gt;is pasttype&lt;/code&gt; Operators ===

Some operators, such as logical operators, can be best implemented using types of nodes that PAST already provides. Use the &lt;code&gt;is pasttype('TYPE')&lt;/code&gt; form to specify the type of PAST node to use. 

=== Operators as Functions ===

By default, unless you specify an operator as &lt;code&gt;is pirop&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;is pasttype&lt;/code&gt;, the operator will default to being a function. Most operators are therefore defaulted to be functions, which is very good for languages which intend to allow operator overloading.

== Proto Regexes ==

We will use the term &quot;Proto&quot;, &quot;Proto Regex&quot; or &quot;Protoregex&quot; on occasion in this book, and it is used often in the documentation for Perl 6 as well. '''Proto'''s are like rules except they offer something similar to multiple dispatch: You can have multiple rules of the same name that depend on the operands passed to it. By declaring an operator as a proto, you are giving it a name and you are also allowing future additions to be made to the language. This is an imporant feature for languages which utilize operator overloading.

Protos are defined with the &lt;code&gt;proto&lt;/code&gt; keyword. They can be used in either the top-down or bottom-up parser, although because of their most common use as a support mechanism for operator overloading, they are most often used in the bottom-up operator precidence parser. To define a new proto, use the form:

 proto NAME OPTIONS { ... }

In this declaration, the &lt;code&gt;{ ... }&lt;/code&gt; is a literal piece of code: you actually must type the three dots (ellipsis) between the curly brackets. What this does is alerts the parser that this is not an implementation of the rule itself, it is actually just a signature or a forward-declaration for other functions. For instance, we can define a proto MyProto:

 proto MyProto { ... }

And in another file we can define functions to implement this:

 .sub MyProto
    # Insert the parameter list and function logic here
 .sub

 .sub MyProto       # Another MyProto!
    # Insert a different parameter list and different function logic here
 .end

== Parsing Terms ==

'''Terms''' are the values between operators. In the following expression:

 1 + 2 * 3

The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are all terms. Terms are parsed using the ordinary rules, and are loaded into the operator precedence table using the following syntax:

 proto 'term:' is precedence('1') is parsed(&amp;term) { ... }

Of course, you can set the precedence however you see fit, but it's typically best to make terms parse as tightly as possible. The &lt;code&gt;is parsed()&lt;/code&gt; attribute specifies that terms are to be parsed using a rule named &quot;term&quot;. You can define this term using ordinary rule syntax. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; symbol is the sigil that NQP uses to refer to a subroutine. In this case, the subroutine in question is the grammar method that is intended to parse terms (but it can conceivably be anything else). We will learn more about NQP and sigils in the following chapter.

Terms are the way the parser switches back from bottom-up to top-down parsing.

== Expression and Term Methods ==

Once we've created our parser, we need to create methods associated with them to construct the necessary PAST nodes for the parse tree. Lucky for us, these methods are easy to create, and typically the best option is to use a basic template from another language implementation.

Terms are defined like any other rule, and don't require any special syntax. Expressions, however, do require a little bit of special attention.

Egyptian cuisine consists of local culinary traditions such as Ful Medames, Kushari and Molokhia, while sharing similarities with food found throughout the eastern Mediterranean like kebab and falafel.

Most Egyptians perhaps consider Ful Medames, or mashed fava beans, to be the national dish. Ful is also used in making Ta'miyya or Falafel (Arabic: طعمية – فلافل). Bread accompanies most Egyptian meals; local bread is called Eish Masri or Eish Baladi (Egyptian Arabic: عيش).

Ancient Egyptians are known to have used a lot of garlic and onion in their everyday dishes. Fresh mashed garlic with other herbs is used in spicy tomato salad and is also stuffed in boiled or baked aubergines (eggplant). Garlic fried with coriander is added to Mulukhiyya (Arabic: ملوخية), a popular green soup made from finely chopped leaves. Fried onions are added to Kushari (Arabic: كشري), a dish consisting of brown lentils, macaroni, rice, chickpeas and a spicy tomato sauce.

==Cuisine and Culture==

Although Ramadan is a month of fasting in Egypt, it is usually when Egyptians pay a lot of attention to food in variety and richness, since the whole family would gather on the breakfast table just after sunset. There are several special desserts almost exclusive to Ramadan such as Kanafeh and Atayef (Arabic: كنافة وقطايف). In this month, many Egyptians will make a special table for the poor or passers-by, usually in a tent in the street, called Ma'edat Al Rahman (Arabic: مائدة الرحمن) which translates literally as Table of (God) the Gracious (Merciful).

Christians of Egypt, mainly Copts, observe fasting periods according to the Liturgical Calendar that practically extend to more than two-thirds of the year. The diet is mainly vegan. During this fasting, Copts will usually eat vegetables fried in oil as they avoid meat, chicken, dairy products including butter.

==Dishes==

Popular dishes include Kebab and Kofta (Arabic: كباب وكفتة), usually consisting of lamb meat, chops &amp; minced meat on skewers grilled on charcoal.

Egyptians are famous for stuffing spicy rice in vegetables like green pepper, aubergines, courgettes and tomatoes to make Mahshi (Arabic: محشي). Mahshi is generally rolled in grapevine leaves, Mahshi Warraq Enab (Arabic: محشي ورق عنب), or in cabbage leaves, Mahshi Koronb (Arabic: محشي كرنب).

Shawerma (Arabic: شاورمة) is a popular sandwich of shredded meat or chicken, usually rolled in pita bread with Tahina sauce.

Dukkah is a dry mixture of chopped nuts, seeds and Middle Eastern spices and flavors.

===5...d6=== 

Blacks move 5...d6 protects the recently developed knight from being attacked.  A pawn move is thus in order, since both knights are developed to good squares, and the Bishop on c8 now has the option, but not the obligation, to develop to a good square once white makes known his intentions.

Of all the responses for white, Bg5 is perhaps the best, and should be expected from a strong opponent.   It pins the king knight, prepares for queenside castling, and it is the prelude to the Richter-Rauzer Attack (named after Vsevolod Alfredovich Rauser&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessopening?eco=B60&lt;/ref&gt;).

==First Anglo-Dutch War(1652-1654)==

The trading rivalry between the Dutch Republic and England broke out into war in May of 1652. Maarten Tromp, commander of the Dutch Navy, was slow to dip his flag in his salute, an English ship fired warning shots, hitting a Dutch Ship. This led to the Battle of Goodwin Sands and the start of the First Anglo-Dutch War. One Dutch diplomat stated ''&quot;The English are about to attack a mountain of gold; we are about to attack a mountain of iron.&quot;'' The war would be costly for both sides.

At the Battle of Plymouth, the English attempted to destroy the Dutch fleet, however they were beaten back, and pursed by Michiel de Ruyter. It was the beginning of a Dutch legend. Soon after the Battle of Plymouth, the English and Dutch fleets clashed again in the North Sea at the Battle of the Kentish Knock. The English routed the Dutch fleet commanded by Tromp, and mistakingly believing that the Dutch fleet was destroyed, did not pursue.

The English, very confident they had won the war, sent most of their fleet to the Mediterranean. The Dutch then launched a surprise attack on the remaining English Fleet in the North Sea, which gave control of the North Sea and the English Channel back to the Dutch. By spring, the English fleet had returned and defeated the Dutch at the Battle of Portland. Several days later, however, a small portion of each sides' fleets met in the Battle of Leghorn in Italy and the Dutch chased the English out of the Mediterranean. The English fleet won another major victory at the Battle of the Gabbard. The Dutch fleet was too weak to challenge the English and therefore a blockade was put on the Dutch Republic, which crippled the Dutch economy.

The Dutch broke the English blockade at the Battle of Scheveningen, but during the fight Tromp was killed. At this point, both sides were completely exhausted from war and signed the Treaty of Westminster (1654). The treaty failed to resolve the dispute between the two countries, and only set the stage for the next war.

==Second Anglo-Dutch War(1665-1667)==

The issues that started the First-Anglo Dutch War, still remained and were not resolved by the peace treaty. The English still wanted the Dutch trading routes, and to end the world domination of Dutch trade. As tensions increased the English seized the Dutch colony of New Netherland and took many Dutch trading posts on the coast of Africa. The Dutch quickly responded by sending Michiel de Ruyter to recapture their trading posts in Africa. After recapturing the trading posts, he sailed across the Atlantic, where the Dutch Fleet was attacked and forced to withdraw. Shortly after, on March 4, 1665, England declared war on the Dutch Republic.

In June of 1665 the two fleets met in the North Sea. This would result in the Battle of Lowestoft. The English routed the Dutch fleet, destroying 17 Dutch warships at a cost of only one of their own. Even to this day it is the worst defeat in Dutch Naval History. The next conflict between the two sides was a minor encounter in Norwegian Port. At the Battle of Vågen, the English attempted to seize a few Dutch merchant ships. However, the merchant ships were being escorted by war ships and the English attack was driven back.

In June of 1666, the Dutch fleet under the control of De Ruyter, was attacked by the English fleet in the North Sea at the Four Days Battle. It was one of the largest Naval engagements in history, lasting four days (hence the name). After four days of constant engagement, De Ruyter, seeing that he had inflicted considerable damage on the English fleet, ordered his fleet to withdraw. The English lost 10 ships, the Dutch 4.

Later that summer the two fleets would clash again at St. James Day Battle. De Ruyter as once again in control of the Dutch fleet, his goal was to attack the English fleet while it was anchored in the Medway. On his way there, he discovered an English fleet of 89 ships and pursued it. The battle was a clear English Victory, inflicting heavy casualties onto the Dutch, however, De Ruyter was able to withdraw losing only 2 ships, while the results could have been much worse.

The English quickly decided to attack while the Dutch fleet was unable to fight back due to the losses it received in the St. James Day Battle. English Rear-Admiral Robert Holmes, attacked a large fleet of Dutch merchant ships. The English were successful in setting fire to, and destroying, 150 of the merchant ships.

In June of 1667, the Dutch Fleet under De Ruyter, decided to launch a daring attack on the English fleet while it was still docked. De Ruyter ordered an attack on June 10. The Dutch fleet quickly captured the English forts, and defeated the English ships guarding the Medway. On June 13, the whole of the Thames side as far up as London was in a panic — some spread the rumor that the Dutch were launching a full scale invasion of the country. Many citizens fled, taking their possessions with them. On June 14 the Dutch fleet withdrew, but they had sunk 13 English Ships, and captured 2 ships. The HMS Unity and the HMS Royal Charles, pride and normal flagship of the English fleet, while total losses for the Dutch were eight spent fireships and about fifty casualties. The Battle is now called Raid on the Medway, it was a decisive Dutch victory and is considered the Greatest Naval Victory in Dutch History, and the worst Naval Defeat in English. Commenting on the defeat, Samuel Pepys, English Naval Administrator and member of Parliament, said ''&quot;The Devil Shits Dutchmen&quot;''.

After the raid on the Medway, the English fleet was crippled and England was forced to sue for peace. Pepys making another comment about the war, said ''&quot;Thus in all things, in wisdom, courage, force, knowledge of our own streams, and success, the Dutch have the best of us, and do end the war with victory on their side&quot;''. During negotiations, the English offered to return New Netherland if the Dutch would return Suriname (which they had seized in 1667). The Dutch declined. On July 31, 1667 the Treaty of Breda (1667) was signed. The Dutch were now at the zenith of their power.

==Franco-Dutch War(1672-1678) and the Third-Anglo-Dutch War(1672-1674)==

[[Image:Debruijn holland map.gif|thumb|250px|Dutch position in the Summer of 1672, Black is French and their allies territory]]
France led a coalition including Münster and England. Louis XIV was annoyed by the Dutch refusal to cooperate in the destruction and division of the Spanish Netherlands. After making a secret agreement with England in 1672, France invaded the Dutch Republic. Today, 1672 is still remembered as Rampjaar in the Netherlands, which means &quot;year of disasters&quot;. The French soon marched into the Heart of the Dutch Republic, taking Utrecht. To stop the French advance, the Dutch flooded the countryside (Dutch Water Line) which stopped the French advance. At this time, Prince William III of Orange is assumed to have had the leading Dutch politician Johan de Witt deposed and murdered and was acclaimed stadtholder.

On the western front, where the Dutch had been attacked by Munster, the Dutch defeated Munster at the Siege of Groningen. After the Dutch victory the Dutch liberated some territory and drove Munster out of the country.

Meanwhile, the sea war with England was going much better for the Dutch than the land war. The Dutch, lead by De Ruyter, defeated the English and French fleets at the Battle of Solebay and Schooneveld. The French and English then came up with a plan to invade the Republic by Sea. However, after their fleet was defeated at the Battle of Texel, they were unable to land troops. The war was becoming very unpopular at home in England, thus, the English withdrew signing the Treaty of Westminster (1674). In the treaty the Dutch agreed to return New Orange (formerly New Netherland) to England, which they had seized in 1673.

In 1673 Spain joined the war on the side of the Dutch. De Ruyter sailed the Dutch Fleet into the Mediterranean to destroy the French naval supremacy there. The Dutch were victorious in the Battles of Stromboli and Mt. Etna (1676); however, Admiral de Ruyter was mortally wounded in the latter. Respect for De Ruyter extended far beyond the borders of the Republic. When his body was shipped home, the late Lieutenant-Admiral-General was saluted by canon shots fired on the coasts of France, by the direct orders of the French King Louis XIV.

The War was not only in Europe, it extended to Canada. Jurriaen Aernoutsz, a navy captain from Curaçao, captured the French colony of Acadia in 1674. A Dutch fleet attacked, but failed to take Martinique 1674. In May 1676 Dutch Admiral Jacob Blinck took Cayenne and Tobago. The French would soon retake these possessions. In December 1676 French Vice-Admiral Jean d'Estrees retook Cayenne. The French also recaptured Tobago in 1677.
[[Image:BattleOfTexel.jpg|thumb|350px|The Battle of Texel]]
In Europe, the French had begun a slow withdrawal from the Republic. Negotiations began in 1676, and the Treaty of Nijmegen was signed in 1678. The war had been very costly for the Republic, but they had defended their land and kept all of their territory across the world.

==Fourth Anglo-Dutch War(1781-1784)==

Britain declared war before the Dutch could join a group of neutral countries sworn to mutual assistance. The direct cause of the war was the discovery of a secret trade treaty proposed by the city of Amsterdam to the Americans. The Dutch had not at all expected such a severe reaction; they had given the British a perfect pretext to reduce Dutch power even more. This Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780–1784) proved a disaster for the Netherlands, particularly economically.

Dutch naval power had been in decline since 1714. The Dutch navy, now having only twenty ships of the line, was no match for the British navy. Britain had already gained supremacy of the high seas over France long before, in the Seven Years' War. The Dutch fought a minor skirmish with the British at the Battle of Dogger Bank, but had to avoid any other fighting. The Dutch had already hastily embarked on a major shipbuilding project of 84 warships between 1777 and 1789. Due to all kinds of misfortune (storms, collisions, strandings), about a third of the Dutch fleet sank between 1782 and 1784. Coordination with its war allies, France and Spain, was poor. The new ships were not ready in time to prevent Britain from taking effective control of the Dutch colonies and making William V a puppet, only able to rule with Prussian military assistance in the Triple Alliance (1788). The Republic joined a cease fire between Britain and France in January 1783. The signing of the Treaty of Paris (1784) made Negapatnam, in India, a British colony. Ceylon, though taken, was nominally given back. The British gained the right of free trade with part of the Dutch East Indies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want a tool to manage your organization-specific business terms including definitions, acronyms, synonyms, broader/narrower terms, see-also terms, definition sources, approval history, versions, and traceability and mappings to ISO/IEC 11179 data elements.

== Method ==
Create a tool that manages individual business terms using a vocabulary similar to the W3C Simple Knowledge Organization [[w:SKOS|SKOS]] draft standard.  Use one XML file in an eXist collection for each term and have the server assign an ID number as each term is created.  Allow each term to belong to one synonym set.  We will associate each term with broader terms and use XQuery reports to infer narrower terms.

== Design Steps ==
To build the glossary we can create an XML Schema for each term and generate an XForms application to manage the Term data.  We can then hand-edit the generated form to add specific functionality.

== New Instance File ==

== XForms Application ==
This is an XQuery that when run with a parameters of new=true or an id=123 will generate an XForms application.  It will need to be in the same folder as a new-instance.xml and it will need a save.xq and an update.xq to do the work of saving new instances (with the ids assigned) and updating existing instances, respectively.  The update.xq will be responsible for versioning and archiving old values.  The update script can also be responsible for creating log files of who changed what files and when.

Note: I have not fixed this yet to use the new pathnames for the Approval and DataElement containers.

==Dutch-Swedish War==
The Dutch-Swedish War began with the 1658 Swedish invasion of Denmark, during which Copenhagen was put under siege. The Dutch, worried about their trade in the Baltic, sent a fleet of 75 ships to break the siege resulting in the Battle of the Sound. The Danish ships were unable to help their Dutch allies due to unfavorable wind conditions. The Dutch fleet sunk 4 Swedish ships and forced the Swedish to abandon the siege of the city. In 1659, the Dutch, led by Michiel De Ruyter, liberated the other Danish isles under Swedish control, once more guaranteeing the essential supply of grain, wood, and iron from the Baltic region.

The Dutch were drawn into the Scanian War in 1676, when France asked for Swedish help in the Franco-Dutch War (see [[../Anglo-Dutch Wars|''Anglo-Dutch Wars'']]). In reply, the Dutch asked for Danish help. Denmark agreed and launched an invasion of Sweden. 

At the Battle of Bornholm(1676), the Dutch-Danish fleet, half the size of the Swedish fleet, attacked and forced the fleet to retreat. The Dutch admiral Cornelis Tromp, with a squadron of 16 warships pursued the Swedish navy. The Swedish withdrew and tried to make it back to various Swedish ports but Tromp found the Swedish fleet near Öland. 14,000 Dutch-Danish troops were released from the ships and attacked the Swedish fortresses. At sea,the Swedish Navy was once again forced to withdraw. The Dutch and Danish troops soon captured the cities of Helsingborg and Landskrona, while taking other Swedish fortresses in the area within a month. These two battles gave control of the Baltic to the Dutch-Danish Navy. 

After the Franco-Dutch war ended in 1678, the Dutch had a reduced role in the war. A French-dictated peace was negotiated at the Treaty of Fontainebleau on August 23, 1679, stipulating that all territory lost by Sweden be returned. Thus the terms formulated at the Treaty of Roskilde remained in force. It was reaffirmed by the Treaty of Lund, signed by Denmark-Norway and Sweden themselves.

=Sicilian - Taimanov=
This is the initial position at the start of the Taimanov or Taimanov system, developed by Russian GM [[w:Mark Taimanov|Mark Taimanov]]. It can be thought of as a mirror to the position leading to most variations such as the Dragon, with the c6 knight developed rather than the f6 one and the e6 pawn developed rather than the d6 one.

==5-HT3 antagonists==
*Ondansetron (Zofran)
*Granisetron (Kytril)
*Dolasetron (Anzemet)
*Palonosetron (Aloxi) - IV, 0.25 mg


*'''Umea; 1996''' (Sweden) PMID 8879372 -- &quot;A randomised placebo controlled study with ondansetron in patients undergoing fractionated radiotherapy.&quot; (Franzen L, Ann Oncol. 1996 Aug;7(6):587-92.)
**Randomized. 111 patients, abdominal RT, at least 10 fractions. Used [[http://www.eortc.be/home/qol/ExplQLQ-C30.htm EORTC C30]] questionnaire
**Outcome: complete control of emesis ondansetron 67% vs. placebo 45% (SS). Number of emetic episodes on worst day 1.4 vs. 3.1 (SS), also fewer days with emesis for ondansetron. Benefit during week 1-3, not after
**Conclusion: Prophylactic ondansetron effective in preventing N/V in abdominal RT


==NK-1 antagonists==
*Aprepitant (Emend) - PO


*'''Aprepitant Protocol 052'''
**'''2003''' PMID 14559886 -- &quot;The oral neurokinin-1 antagonist aprepitant for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients receiving high-dose cisplatin--the Aprepitant Protocol 052 Study Group.&quot; (Hesketh PJ, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Nov 15;21(22):4112-9.

==Definition==

==Higher Order Derivatives==
Let &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable

Let &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable for all &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the derivative of &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''second derivative''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and is written as &lt;math&gt;f''(a)&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, we can define the '''n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-derivative''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, written as &lt;math&gt;f^{(n)}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

==Theorem(Rolle's Theorem)==
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be continuous on &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; and differentiable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f(a)=f(b)&lt;/math&gt;

Then, there exists &lt;math&gt;c\in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f'(c)=0&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
If &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is constant, then &lt;math&gt;f ' (x)=0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be non-constant

Let &lt;math&gt;c\in [a,b]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(c)=\sup f([a,b])&lt;/math&gt; (this is possible due to the Minimum-maximum theorem)

Without loss of generality, we can assume that &lt;math&gt;f(c)&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt;

Assume if possible &lt;math&gt;f'(c)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\tfrac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and hence, there exists &lt;math&gt;x_1\in [a,b]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x_1)&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt; contradicting the fact that &lt;math&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt; is a maximum.

Similarly, we can show that the assumption &lt;math&gt;f'(c)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; leads to a contradiction&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f'(c)=0&lt;/math&gt;


Rolle's theorem can be generalized as follows:

==Theorem(Mean Value Theorem)==
If &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; are differentiable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; (without both having infinite derivatives at the same point) then there exists &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; within &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}&lt;/math&gt;.

====Proof====
Define the function &lt;math&gt;h:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as 

&lt;math&gt;h(x)=f(x)(g(b)-g(a))-g(x)(f(b)-f(a))&lt;/math&gt; 

Obviously, this function satisfies &lt;math&gt;h(a)=h(b)&lt;/math&gt;, and by Rolle's theorem, there is a &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; within &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;h'(c)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Theorem(Taylor's Theorem)==
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,x]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; 

Let &lt;math&gt;f^{(n-1)}&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable on &lt;math&gt;[a,x]&lt;/math&gt;

Then, there exists &lt;math&gt;c\in (a,x)&lt;/math&gt; such that 

&lt;math&gt;f(x)=f(a)+\tfrac{(x-a)f'(a)}{1!}+\tfrac{(x-a)^2 f''(a)}{2!}+\ldots +\tfrac{(x-a)^{n-1}f^{(n-1)}(a)}{(n-1)!}+\tfrac{(x-a)^nf^n(c)}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
For the proof, we use the technique known as &quot;Telescopic Sum&quot;

Consider the function &lt;math&gt;\phi:[a,x]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, given by,

&lt;math&gt;\phi (y)=f(y)+\tfrac{(x-y)f'(y)}{1!}+\tfrac{(x-y)^2f''(y)}{2!}+\ldots+\tfrac{A(x-y)^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;, where the constant &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is chosen so as to satisfy &lt;math&gt;\phi (a)=\phi (x)&lt;/math&gt;

By Rolle's theorem, we have that there exists &lt;math&gt;c\in (a,x)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi '(c)=0&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding, we have (be careful while applying the product rule!) 

&lt;math&gt;0=\phi '(c)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=f'(c)+\left[ \tfrac{(x-c)f''(c)}{1!}-f'(c)\right] +\left[ \tfrac{(x-c)^2f'''(c)}{2!}-\tfrac{(x-c)f''(c)}{1!}\right] +\ldots &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;+\left[ \tfrac{(x-c)^{n-1}f^{(n)}(c)}{(n-1)!}-\tfrac{(x-c)^{n-2}f^{(n-1)}}{(n-2)!}\right]-\tfrac{A(x-c)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Which can be rearranged to give the telescopic sum:

&lt;math&gt;\left[ f'(c)-f'(c)\right] + \left[ \tfrac{(x-c)f''(c)}{1!}-\tfrac{(x-c)f''(c)}{1!}\right] +\ldots+\left[ \tfrac{(x-c)^{n-1}f^{(n)}(c)}{(n-1)!}-\tfrac{A(x-c)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}\right]=0&lt;/math&gt;


That is, &lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-c)^{n-1}f^{(n)}(c)}{(n-1)!}=\frac{A(x-c)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;A=f^{(n)}(c)&lt;/math&gt;


Now, we can easily see that &lt;math&gt;\phi (x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;\phi (a)=f(a)+\tfrac{(x-a)f'(a)}{1!}+\tfrac{(x-a)^2 f''(a)}{2!}+\ldots +\tfrac{(x-a)^{n-1}f^{(n-1)}(a)}{(n-1)!}+\tfrac{(x-a)^nf^n(c)}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;


but by choice, &lt;math&gt;\phi (x)=\phi (a)&lt;/math&gt; and hence we have:

&lt;math&gt;f(x)=f(a)+\tfrac{(x-a)f'(a)}{1!}+\tfrac{(x-a)^2 f''(a)}{2!}+\ldots +\tfrac{(x-a)^{n-1}f^{(n-1)}(a)}{(n-1)!}+\tfrac{(x-a)^nf^n(c)}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;QED&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>

This is the flexible move. The Knight comes out to f6 and threatens the e4 pawn. It's important that Black determines how White deals with the e4 pawn before moving pawns further if White plays Nc3 then he can no longer play c4 first. 5.e5? is a common mistake as ...Qa5+ picks up material.

      <comment>Some rephrasing for clarity; replacement of term &quot;accentuation&quot; with &quot;pronunciation&quot; and &quot;stress&quot;.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Gothic}}
=== Pronunciation===
Pronunciation refers to how a word is pronounced. No matter what language it is you are studying, pronunciation is important. For example in English, the word &quot;record&quot; has two different accentuations which can completely change its meaning, and its relation to the whole sentence - with the stress on the first syllable, it is a noun, but with stress on the second syllable, it is a verb.

To understand how to accent words, you must understand the concept of a ''syllable''. A '''syllable''' is simply what can be considered one sound within a sentence. For example, the word sentence has two syllables: &quot;sen&amp;middot;tence&quot;, and &quot;considered&quot; has three: &quot;con&amp;middot;sid&amp;middot;ered&quot;. A simple way to detect the amount of syllables in a word is to pronounce the word out loud, with your hand on your chin. Counting the amount of times you chin extends down will give you the approximate amount of syllables within a sentence.

=== Pronunciation in Gothic ===
Pronunciation in Gothic is much simpler than that of English. In simple words, the stress always falls on the first syllable, even if the word has a prefix (something attached to the beginning of the word) or a suffix (something attached to the end of the word). Compound words, however, have a different pronunciation. If the second element of the word is a noun or an adjective, the rule for simple words is followed. However, in words where the second element is a verb, the first syllable of the second element is what is stressed.</text>

| Upon another war between Britain and France, Janssens attempted to strengthen the defenses of the colony, but found resources lacking, having few trained troops at his disposal and the political situation tenuous at best. During this time, he was promoted to Lieutenant-General. Janssens was under no impression that he had the ability to defeat the British force, led by Lieutenant-General Sir David Baird, yet he mobilized his forces and engaged the British on January 8, 1806, at the Battle of Blaauwberg, near Cape Town. His force was defeated and he was forced to surrender Cape Colony to the British, this time permanently.

A certain logic in the move e5, Black doesn't delay playing e5, which hopes to resolve issues of the pawn structure early on. White has to move the d4 Knight the test to Black's plan is the Nb5 line  putting pressure on the d6 square.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Java Servlet Technology ==

Servlets works as [[w:Common Gateway Interface|CGIs]], that means that they generate dynamic content to return to the user through the [[w:Web Container|Web Container]]. The main advantage of a servlet, comparing to CGI applications is that the ''Web Container'' does all the hard work of processing the [[w:HTTP|HTTP]] request and handling all the details of the protocol, giving to the programmer only object representation of requests and responses.

This advantage take from the application programmer the responsibility of redoing a work so many times done before. Of course, well built and known libraries could do that too, but there are many other advantages too. Following are a few of them.

* '''Built on Standards''' - [[w:JEE|JEE]] is built over standards. These standards are defined by [[w:Java Specification Request|JSRs]]. The java community process is very efficient in defining standards and new technology that world wide companies use in their enterprise softwares because these companies are behind the committees that define, process and vote the new standards. So the standards guarantee that, at least, the specifications were well grounded with design patterns used in day-to-day proven applications. That gives the programmers another advantage, because they don't have to rethink what others, generally very more experienced programmers, had already thought. 

* '''One Instance''' - When handling a servlet, the web container maintains only one instance of it in memory, created at the first time it was requested, and removed when the server is stopped. CGI scripts do not do that, first because they aren't built over standards, so the server doesn't know how it works, secondly, it is just a program, and can be written in any language (including Java), it will be started and executed as a normal operational system process.

* '''Infrastructure''' - The Web Container offers much more than object representations of the request and response. It offer many other objects that can be very handy like session context, application context, filters, listeners and many more. These gives the servlet a whole context that inserts it in a real application instead of a one time only request/response with the client.

&lt;big&gt;'''Paget's Disease of the Breast'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Historical description: &lt;ref&gt;from PMID 9305706, Pierce 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote box
 | quote = &quot;[the nipple and areola have the] appearance of a florid intensely red raw surface; very finely granular, as if the whole thickness of the epidermis were removed; like the surface of very acute diffuse eczema &amp;hellip; (with) cancer of the mammary gland (following) within at the most two years and usually within one year &amp;hellip;&quot;
 | source = Sir James Paget&lt;br&gt;&quot;On disease of the mammary areola preceding cancer of the mammary gland.&quot;&lt;br&gt;''St. Bartholomew's Hosp Rep'' '''1874'''; 10: 87-9. 
 | width = 60%
 | align = center}}
*Clinical presentation of crusting, mild scaling, itching, and redness of the nipple skin. These can progress to more destructive stage, with burning, eczema, and nipple discharge, followed by ulceration and bleeding 
*Association with underlying breast cancer reported in 1874 by Sir James Paget
**&gt;95% of patients with Paget's Disease have underlying breast cancer (~10% DCIS, ~90% invasive)
**However, &lt;5% of all breast cancer patients present with Paget's Disease symptoms
*Underlying breast cancer
**If palpable or mammographic mass, &gt;90% will be invasive carcinoma, and &gt;50% may have LN+
**If non-palpable, 60-80% will be DCIS
*Work-Up
**Bilateral breast examination
**Mammogram
**Biopsy 


==Pathophysiology==
*Malignant epithelial (Paget) cells infiltrate and proliferate in the epidermis, causing thickening of the nipple and the areolar skin
*This is believed to be from retrograde extension of underlying intraductal carcinoma into the overlying epidermis through mammary duct epithelium
*Derived from luminal lactiferous ductal epithelium of the breast tissue 


==Staging==
*Stage 0 - no associated DCIS or invasive disease
*Stage I - associated with DCIS underneath the nipple
*Stage II - associated with extensive DCIS
*Stage III - associated with invasive ductal carcinoma


==Treatment Overview==
*Treatment strategy is typically dependent on the underlying malignancy ([[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/DCIS|DCIS]] vs. [[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Early_breast|IDC]])
*Mastectomy was the historical treatment, but breast conservation therapy appears to be increasing 
*Conservative surgery alone appears inadequate, with recurrence rates 20-40%
*BCS + lymph node assessment and adjuvant RT is likely a reasonable strategy for appropriately selected patients


*'''US Multi-Institutional''' (1980-2000) 
**'''2003''' PMID 12712465 -- &quot;Conservative management of Paget disease of the breast with radiotherapy: 10- and 15-year results.&quot; (Marshall JK, Cancer. 2003 May 1;97(9):2142-9.)
***Retrospective. 7 institutions, 36 patients without palpable mass or mammographic density. Complete/partial nipple-areolar complex excision in 94%, 100% whole breast RT 50 Gy, 97% boost to remaining nipple/tumor bed (median total dose 61.5 Gy). Median F/U 9.4 years
***Outcome: LR 16% (50% DCIS, 50% IDC); 5-year LC 91%, 10-year LC 83%, 15-year LC 76%; DFS 93%, 90%, 90%
***Conclusion: Excellent rate of LC, DFS and OS at 10 and 15 years following BCS and RT
**'''1997''' PMID 9305706 -- &quot;The conservative management of Paget's disease of the breast with radiotherapy.&quot; (Pierce LJ, Cancer. 1997 Sep 15;80(6):1065-72.)

*'''EORTC 10873; 2001''' (1987-1998) PMID 11169928 -- &quot;Breast-conserving therapy for Paget disease of the nipple: a prospective European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer study of 61 patients.&quot; (Bijker N, Cancer. 2001 Feb 1;91(3):472-7.)
**Registry study. 61 patients. 97% presented without associated palpable mass, 93% had underlying DCIS, 7% had no associated disease. Treatment was complete excision of nipple-areolar complex, SM-, followed by whole breast RT 50/25. Median F/U 6.4 years
**Outcome: Absolute LR 7% (2% DCIS and 5% IDC); 5-year LR 5%
**Conclusion: BCT is a feasible alternative for patients with Paget's and limited extent DCIS

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Filename convention ==
Filenames must be put between apostrophes, so they become atoms. ( &quot;foo.txt&quot; will not work, because it's a list of characters and not an atom.) In Windows systems you can write paths as 'C:/foo.txt' or 'C:\\foo.txt'.

== Reading a file the Edinburgh style ==

You can open a file with '''see/1''' and close with '''seen/0'''. The following program reads a file, and prints it to the standard output:


&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
process(X):-
        X = 'c:/readtest.txt',
        see(X),
        repeat,
        get_char(T),print(T),T=end_of_file,!,seen. &lt;/source&gt;

You can have multiple files open at the same time:
If you use '''see'''(''file1'') and then '''see'''(''file2''), you will have 2 open files at the same time, and if you now call '''get_char''', it will read from ''file2''. If you call '''see'''(''file1'') again, ''file1'' will be active again. You can close these files in any order you want.

The '''read''' predicate is for parsing prolog terms. (It can handle [[Prolog/Definite_Clause_Grammars|DCG grammars]] as well.) You might need it for self-modifying programs, or for programs which transforms prolog code.

== Reading a file the ISO style ==

When following the ISO standard, data from files and from network are handled the same way: as data streams. 
*Open a file for reading: '''open'''(''Filename'', read, ''Streamhandler'')
*Open a file for writing: '''open'''(''Filename'', write, ''Streamhandler'')


&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
process(File) :-
        open(File, read, In),
        get_char(In, Char1),
        process_stream(Char1, In),
        close(In).

process_stream(end_of_file, _) :- !.
process_stream(Char, In) :-
        print(Char),
        get_char(In, Char2),
        process_stream(Char2, In).
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Teacher Training: Ideal vs. Reality''' ==

By Adrienne Scott 

=='''Introduction'''==

Teachers have the rare opportunity to mold a person’s life forever. It’s no wonder that with such a tremendous responsibility comes conflict. People are beginning to question if what teacher candidates are learning is effectively preparing them for their career. The question presentation by this issue is clear, “do the ideal training teachers receive match with the reality they will face?” The answer however, is not as clear. Critics believe that institutions fall short when it comes to equipping teachers, not taking into account certain factors. Some of these factors are gender, technology availability, classroom experience, diversity, and social issues. On the other side are those who support institutions and their teaching programs. These supporters believe that teaching programs are sufficient and to make the programs any more specific would be detrimental to future teachers. There is no clear right or wrong answer on this issue. This chapter will serve as a source of information on the topic at hand. The goal of this chapter is to educate you on the topic so you will be able to make a more informed decision concerning teacher training, the ideal vs. the reality.

=='''Go Teacher U.!'''==

Teacher candidates often receive the best building blocks from their institutions. These blocks are styles, methods, and techniques, which give teacher candidates a foundation to build on. Many people criticize institutions for how they choose to prepare future teachers. The critics believe that an unreachable image of what teaching will be like is painted. In reality, institutions equip future teachers with all the tools they will need to become an effective teacher. For example, a course on integrating technology into the classroom might not be practical for teachers who will teach in inner-city schools, low budget school districts, or in communities suffering from digital divide. However, institutions realize that technology is becoming more accessible and that teachers need to learn how to be flexible and adapt to whatever school district they are in. It is the job of the institution to educate teacher candidates on the basics of teaching. Those candidates will then be able to take their problem-solving and application skills, which they also learn in college, and tweak the basics to appropriate their school.

Institutions educate future teachers on how to be effective in their classroom. The bottom line is that there is no way institutions can prepare teacher candidates for everything that might happen throughout their teaching career. The U.S. Department of Education conducted a study of teachers’ reflections of their educational institutions. They found that most teachers believed “there were issues for which no college or university could have prepared them” (U.S. Department, 2008). Lisa Shipley, a seventh and eight grade teach in Missouri, believes that her university prepared her the best it could for the expected, but the unexpected is another story (U.S. Department, 2008). Shipley states “college did not prepare me for the student whose mother was murdered by a jealous boyfriend; for the student who witnessed a drive-by shooting; for the student who was removed from her home because of an abusive father. These realities do not exist in textbooks, yet they are, sadly, all too often the realities that people—with real lives and real problems—bring into my classroom” (U.S. Department, 2008). Teacher preparation programs prepare future teachers in an effective manner, it is unfair for third parties to criticize this preparation because there is no way which teacher candidates can be completely prepared for the emotional stress their new job will bring.

Even after participating in teacher preparation programs, individuals really must complete on the job training in order to become more prepared and effective teachers.  One semester of student teaching generally does not adequately condition a future teacher in that it is impossible for them to encounter every possible conflict, just as Lisa Shipley had lamented (U.S. Department, 2008).  It takes a fair bit of on-the-job training or roughly two years to become competent at classroom management, and around six to seven years to become an effective teacher (Wallis, 2008).  This is where the harsh reality of the real world comes into play as many teachers struggle in their early years and consequently throw in the towel.  “Between a quarter and a third of new teachers quit within their first three years on the job,” and this is due to how under-prepared the teachers are and what little support they receive from their respective schools (Wallis, 2008).

=='''Welcome To The Real World'''==

In college, students are taught that boys and girls should be treated the same at all times however, in the classroom it is important for the teacher to make the distinction between the two groups. This distinction should not be made to favor one group over the other but to target each group with the specific teaching styles that will best reach them. David Kommer, middle levels specialist at Ashland University, does not agree with what teacher candidates learn in college. Kommer believes that it is essential for teachers to be aware of differences in gender so that they are able to be “purposeful in the treatment of each, and so they are able to send the healthiest messages” (Kommer, 2006). In fact, Kommer doesn’t even believe that boys and girls should be treated the same, “Our goal is not to try to make boys and girls the same; we tried that several decades ago. We might have more success if we teach boys and girls to respond to each other as people” (Kommer, 2006). 

Most colleges now require teacher candidates to take a course in technology integration. This course is wonderful; it enlightens future teachers on how technology is necessary and shows them how to use it to enhance the curriculum. The only problem with this class is that it makes the assumption that all schools will have up-to-date computer labs with various software and technology in every classroom. The reality is that many teachers will graduate college and begin their teaching career in an inner-city school, a school that doesn’t have the resources to provide students with constant access to technology, or in a community suffering from digital divide. Digital divide is “the gap between those who benefit from digital technology and those who do not” (Smith, 2008). Digital divide may not seem that important but in reality it has a huge impact on the poverty problem around the world. “Access to digital technology greatly enhances the effectiveness and affordability of efforts to improve the water supply, improve rural health and education, generate jobs and address any of the other interrelated problems of poverty” (Smith, 2008). It is important for future teachers to be educated on digital divide and ways to close the gap.

“Everyone should be treated equal”, this is a quote that many people pride themselves on, however, in education this declaration of equality could end up harming student’s education. Teachers against prejudice (TAP), is an organization devoted to erasing prejudice in school systems. TAP believes that future teachers need to be trained “to create a level-playing field respecting the inherent right of all to self-identify rather than be labeled” (Teachers, 2008). In the classroom, not every student is equal. Not every student learns the same way or has the same experiences, and teachers who treat them as though they do explicitly hinder their learning experience. Dr. Aretha Faye Marbley, an associate professor at Texas Tech University, believes that “the future welfare and the national security of our country depends not only on how well we educate our children, but also on how well we prepare teachers for working with racially and culturally diverse learners” (Marbley, 2007). 

Institutions are not properly preparing teacher candidates for their future profession if they are not altering course content to match the present workforce. When teachers first enter a classroom they need to have knowledge about some of the social problems effecting children today.  &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;35%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;

Effective educators need to be able to address these topics with sensitivity in a way that will reach their students. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; Future teachers should have even more knowledge about the social problems affecting the specific age group they plan to teach. Melissa Luroe, a seventh and eighth grade teacher in Maryland, feels as though her institution failed to prepare her for the social issues her middle-school students were dealing with. Luroe confesses, “My children are dealing with issues I never imagined when I was a 13-year-old. AIDS, abuse, neglect, drugs, and sex are `buzz words' I overhear in the hallways, classrooms, lunchroom, and library” (U.S. Department, 2008). Luroe’s college did not prepare her for handling these issues, but that will not keep her from tackling the problems, “as a teacher, mentor and friend, I have to deal with these issues every day” (U.S. Department, 2008).

=='''Bridging The Gap'''==

As you may recognize from the information provided on this topic, there is no right or wrong answer when it comes to figuring out if teaching training is ideal. However, choosing a stand on the issue is just the first step. Whether you support, oppose, or are just undecided on your view of teacher preparation programs, you must realize that many programs are not being finely altered. What this boils down to is that regardless of what teacher candidates believe, they must find a way to bridge the gap between the ideal and reality. 

Teacher candidates can help their ideal education become more like their future reality by taking initiative. One way for them to bridge the gap is to make the most of the experiences they do have. For future teachers this mean devoting time to studying and researching their subject and grade level and then putting those efforts into application during observation and practicum. This also means that teachers should be experimenting with different techniques and methods of dealing with children during their field experiences. Another way for future teachers to take initiative is by seeking outside opportunities to work with children and gain classroom experience. For some this may mean getting a job substituting in public schools or working at a day care center while for others, it may mean getting a summer job as a camp counselor. Taking responsibility is another way teacher candidates can help bridge the gap. Future teachers should know about the social issues their students are facing. Some way to do this are by attending PTA meetings, attending school board meetings, communicating with experienced teachers and community outreach programs, or simply by watching the local news.

My opinion of whether or not institutions are properly preparing future teachers falls somewhere between the two extremes. I believe that many colleges and universities are doing a good job by equipping teachers with basics that they will be able to mold and apply to many situations. However, it would be beneficial if these programs could focus more on realities teachers will face and classroom management. Good teaching can only go so far if the teacher can’t reach the children, whether its gender, technology, diversity or social issues getting in the way. That said, educators need to stop blaming their teacher preparation programs for not being ready for the work force and except some of the blame themselves. Our generation differs greatly from that of our parents, so imagine how out of touch we will be with our students if an extra effort isn’t extended. I believe that this extra effort is essential in a classroom to achieve effective learning.

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a recent contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has its own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator (See below), a chess diagram upgrade (looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== String Concatenation ==

The '''concatenation operator''' represented by an ampersand symbol is used to join two strings together:

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
 DIM bestclub AS String
 bestclub = &quot;Liverpool&quot; &amp; &quot; Football Club&quot;    ' Liverpool Football Club
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The addition operator cannot be used to concatenate strings ===

In gambas, unlike traditional basic, the plus symbol cannot be used as concatenation operator. If an attempt is made to use a plus symbol for this purpose, a type mismatch error will occur when an attempt is made to run the program:

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
 ' This does not work in gambas
 PRINT &quot;I have 3 cats&quot; + &quot; and 2 dogs&quot;    ' You cannot concatenate strings by using a plus symbol &lt;/source&gt;

=== Concatenation combination assignment operator ===

The '''concatenation combination assignment operator''' represented by a andequals symbol, can also be used to concatenate strings:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
 DIM breakfast AS String
 breakfast = &quot;bacon&quot;
 breakfast &amp;= &quot; and eggs&quot;    ' breakfast = breakfast &amp; &quot; and eggs&quot; (using the andequals symbol)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Search and Replace ==

hello i have made a try to search in a text file 
-two function :
1- search by line and column 
2-search by pos

-first function returns an array with results it will be for example like this [&quot;1,12&quot; , &quot;2,1&quot;] , the first element is the line the second is the column 

-second function returns also an array but single one ex:[1,2,45,455]
every element is the string pos 


here you are ! :

      <comment>/* Length */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">All latin syllables are either long or short and stressed or unstressed. The metre of Latin poetry, unlike English poetry, is dependent on the length of the syllables rather than their accent.

===Length===

The two different lengths for syllables are long (indicated by a macron ˉ ) and short (indicated by a breve ˇ ). All syllables are either one or the other. A syllable’s length is determined by both its nature and its position. If a syllable is long by nature that means that the vowel sound is long and pronounced differently to its short counterpart. For example: 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;border: #eeeeff; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeff;&quot;|ā is pronounced as in cart
|-
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeff;&quot;|ă is pronounced as in cut&lt;/font&gt;
|}


On the other hand, if a syllable is long by position, the consonants around the vowel sound determine the syllables length, rather than the syllable itself. If a vowel is followed by two consonants, then the syllable will be long irrespective of the nature of the vowel.


The following line is from Poem 1 by Catullus in hendecasyllables.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;border: #eeeeff; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeff;&quot;|cuī dōnō lĕpĭdūm nŏvūm lĭbēllŭm&lt;/font&gt;
|}


The long syllable at the end of novum is caused by the two consonants (m and l) following it whereas the long syllable at the end of dono has to be long by nature as there is only one consonant following it.

===Stress===


As well as long and short syllables Latin also has a stress accent, like English. This is where the natural emphasis goes when speaking. The stress accent is determined by the length of the syllables but not the same as it. Unlike English there are fairly consistent rules to work out where the stress accent is placed in Latin words.
 
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;border: #eeeeff; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeff;&quot;|1)	For words of two syllables, the accent always goes on the second last syllable.
|-
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeff;&quot;|2)	For words of more than two syllables where the second last syllable is long, the accent goes on the second last syllable.
|-
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeff;&quot;|3)	For words of more than two syllables where the second last syllable is short, the accent goes on the third last syllable.&lt;/font&gt;
|}


These rules are demonstrated in the following words taken from the extract above:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;border: #eeeeff; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeff;&quot;|1)	'''nŏ'''vūm
|-
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeff;&quot;|2)	lĭ'''bē'''llŭm
|-
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeff;&quot;|3)	'''lĕ'''pĭdūm&lt;/font&gt;
|}


===Poetic Meter===

As mentioned, Latin poetry depends on the length of syllables rather than their stress accent. A line of Latin verse is divided into feet depending on the pattern of long and short syllables. The pattern of feet then determines the meter. In some poetic meters, such as dactyllic hexameter, there is also a main caesura in every line written as (˄). This is caused when there is a break in words in the middle of a foot.

== Introduction == 

For the design of embedded automotive systems, the entire vehicle system is usually split up into four different functional areas, which could be separated during the design phase:
* Chassis
* Drive-train
* Body
* Telematics
Each of these areas will have different priorities and requirements and these areas will usually also be covered by different design teams. It is important to point out that whereas these areas where completely separated in the past, new functions and legislations are forcing these different areas to communicate with each other. 
The design requirements for these areas are very different and it is crucial to make the distinction between the requirements due to legislation and those due to competition. A lot of the demands for the drive-train and body (passive safety) areas will be due to legislation, and can thus be considered as hard constraint. Many of the requirements for chassis and telematics on the other hand are due to manufacturer-competition and offer more design-freedom.

== System requirements == 

This section will not elaborate on the different functional requirements of all the different vehicle-systems. Rather an overview of the most important system level requirements of the vehicle will be given and how this affects the requirements of the embedded control systems:

* Safety
The demand for safety will impose some important functional and non-functional constraints on the embedded systems of the drive-train and chassis. These demands aren’t usually driven by legislation but by competition between manufacturers.
** Hard real-time constraints: it is imperative that all safety related systems comply to real-time constraints. Systems like ABS should be able to react within mere milliseconds to ensure a timely intervention. This not only puts a constraint on the processors-speed, but also on the speed of the communication system used throughout the car, because these systems often rely on input signals from other systems and need to send outputs to different systems as well (e.g. [[w:Electronic_stability_control|ESC]]-system must communicate with engine management). 
** Fault-detection: every sub-system of a safety-critical function should be capable of auto-diagnosing of its function and should be able to switch to a safe shutdown condition in case of failure. Obviously also the communication system should be able to perform data-transfer checks. Legislation dictates that if a fault is detected, this should also be shown to the driver ([[w:Malfunction_Indicator_Lamp|MIL Malfunction Indicator Lamp]]) and be stored in the fault-memory of the controller.
** Redundancy: critical sensors, like the throttle in drive-by-wire systems, should have redundancy to minimize malfunction probability. 
** Reset-time? Start-up-time? 

* Cost
As in all industries manufacturing cost is also very important in automotive. 

* Emissions / fuel-economy
The main driver behind emissions-constraints has always been legislation, even though more recently fuel-economy has become an increasingly more important sales-argument. A very important aspect of this legislation is the On-board diagnostics ([[w:On-board_diagnostics|OBD]]), which monitors the engine-system continuously to ensure compliance with emission-laws in everyday use. Some of the most important demands for the drive-train-system are:
** Monitoring of emission-related electrical components (e.g. short-circuits) and storage of fault (OBD 1).
** Monitoring of system functionality (e.g. plausibility check of sensor-signals) (OBD 2)
** Components used to monitor emission-related components of which affect diagnosis must be monitored. (OBD 2)
** Monitoring frequency is usually prescribed by law.
** Malfunctioning must be displayed to the driver by MILs (Malfunction Indication Light).

* Time to market
Drive for shorter time to market pushes the system development towards more interchangeable components. This is currently very difficult because there are no clear communication standards. Bus-communication systems have made it a lot easier to introduce new functionalities into existing systems. 

* Passenger comfort
Passenger comfort is also very important in automotive due to competitive reasons. These requirements mostly apply to systems in the interior and telematics area. This gives also some constraints on the embedded systems: 
** Soft real-time constraints: many non-critical systems (e.g. electric windows, electric mirrors...) have prescribed timing constraints, but violating these constraints doesn’t have serious effect. A lot of these systems for example have to react within 100ms, with is the limit of delays a human can perceive.

== Design process ==  
Embedded systems in automotive usually follow a model-driven design workflow (as introduced in section [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Embedded_design_process | 
The design process]] ). 

Functional requirements should generally be taken into account during the functional design stage. This also includes fail-safe modes.

The timing constraints should be taken into account during the implementation stage. It is very important to make sure the hardware is capable of reaching the timing constraints, but is not to performant either. Also the demands for the communication-speed should be taken into account during this phase. If the communication-speed is very critical it might even be necessary to include a detailed model of the communication network in the original vehicle model. All the monitoring functions for hardware malfunctioning can only be designed during this stage as well. 
Crucial functions that have to meet real-time constraints will usually require their own hardware to assure real-time operation, so this is a constraint that should be taken into account from the start of the design. This might be very difficult in practice. 

A very important design-phase is the configuration of the communication between the different vehicle-systems. Due to the ever increasing amount of signals and lack of standardization this is currently very time-consuming. The AUTOSAR standard is meant to strongly facilitate this stage. 


== Hardware == 
Originally, cars were equipped with single signal cables. As electronic systems increased in number and complexity, this approach was no longer acceptable due to cost, weight and complexity. This is why manufactures have switched to bus-systems (e.g. CAN-bus) for in-car communication between the different systems. There are usually several buses in one vehicle, each system adapted to the speed demands of particular system-groups. More information on these bus-systems can be found in the chapter on [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Field_busses|field-buses]].

Most functionalities are currently programmed in a microcontroller with program memory ([[Embedded_Systems/Memory_Units|EPROM or flash]] ).
Due to the wide array of functionalities, there is a wide range of sensors in modern cars. Sensors on safety-critical components (like ESP-sensor) are required to have internal self-monitoring functions as well.  


== Autosar ==

=== Present Problems ===

Current vehicular systems are characterized by proprietary solutions: applications in different vehicular systems use other interfaces or other communication standards. This leads to suppliers that develop and maintain separate software for each system instead of using the same software on every system and dealing with compatibility issues of communication, function and signal definitions.

OEMs have the task of integrating the different systems and guaranteeing the deterministic functioning of the integrated system.  This task is often burdened by the different diagnostic services for applications of different suppliers.
With the growth in the number of embedded control systems and the degree of interaction, further proliferation of proprietary solutions will require more resources and it will become more difficult to guarantee the deterministic functioning of the integrated system. 

There is also a trend to more flexibility for the costumers; costumers want to chose from different options. This leads to many small variations of one basic vehicular system, which requires a lot of design effort in modern systems with a low level of modularity and implementation-flexibility.

To cope with these problems, automobile manufacturers, suppliers and tool developers have joined forces to develop a new standard. This project is named Autosar, which is an acronym for AUTomotive Open System Architecture. On the Wikipedia article of [[w:Autosar|Autosar]], the goals and technical information of Autosar are explained.

=== The Autosar Standard ===

The Autosar standard is meant to be a breakthrough that should allow a paradigm shift in vehicular system design and should lead to improvement of functionalities and higher safety.

==== Terminology ====

The Autosar project introduces its own terminology, which shall be used throughout the rest of this text. More information can be found on the Wikipedia article of [[w:Autosar|Autosar]].

&lt;u&gt;Autosar Methodology&lt;/u&gt;: a 4-step methodology that can be used to create the vehicular system architecture starting from the design-model.

&lt;u&gt;Basic software&lt;/u&gt;: Standardized software that doesn’t has any functionalities that are noticeable to the end-user but offers hardware-dependent and hardware-independent services.

&lt;u&gt;Runtime environment&lt;/u&gt;: implementation of the possible communication paths on a software level.

&lt;u&gt;Application software&lt;/u&gt;: The software that implements the actual functionalities, which are noticeable for the end-users.

=== Analysis of the Standard ===

==== Reusability ====

The Autosar project has chosen to standardize the communication and the non-functional software, such as the runtime environment and the basic software. The functional software, namely the application software, is only standardized by its interfaces.

This has several implications:

* OEMs can build a vehicular system by choosing the best soft- and hardware for each specific application, without having compatibility problems. This means that the integration cost decreases. In addition, maintenance is easier to execute because the diagnostic services can be standardized for all application instead of being supplier dependent.

* Suppliers can still compete on implementation of the application software components. This should lead to better components. Also because of the clear interfaces, suppliers can build, debug, and maintain one version of their application software for all the different vehicular systems, which reduces proliferation of software. Due to the clear interfaces, there is also more option to partition development between suppliers or between teams of a supplier.

* Hardware suppliers can still compete on the best hardware, only the basic software necessary to use the hardware will be standardized, but there will be options to protect specific software (for example special software to cancel non-linear effect of actuators).

* New companies can easily enter the market because of the clear set domains. A company should only be an expert on his domain.

==== Safety ====

To raise the safety of a vehicular system designed according to the Autosar standards, several safety measures are included&lt;ref&gt; Autosar Safety Approach - By Johannesen P. - Convergence 2006, Detroit, Michigan, October 16-18, 2006 - SAE Paper 2006-21-0044.&lt;/ref&gt;.

* Safety Integrity Functions, which are safety measures to be present in AUTOSAR, independent of the application context. These functions support the correct execution of application functions and safety functions. In general, the functions are related to protection of resources, monitoring, and self-testing. Extra safety measures of this category need to be taken due to the change in [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Automotive#Influence_on_system_complexity | system complexity]]. For example, if two applications can use the same resources and share memory, it will be necessary to build in some safety; for example to prevent write access to data segments of other applications.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.vector-worldwide.com/portal/medien/cmc/press/PSC/TrendsEmbedded_AutomobilElektronik_200602_PressArticle_EN.pdf (01-04-2009)&lt;/ref&gt;.

* Support of Safety Functions that are dependent on the application context. This means the support of typical safety functions of systems from the different applications, like a fast reset for critical applications.

* General Safety Requirements like local detection of faults without propagation.

Safety features can automatically be added to all vehicular software, which is a big advantage over the existing approach to vehicular software design.

The clear set of standards and interfaces reduces the chance of faults due to wrong interaction between applications.

==== Design in Autosar ====
===== Component based design ===== 
The Autosar project introduces the concept of component based software design in vehicular software design. This is a necessary change due to the growing complexity of the vehicular systems, which leads to a need for teamwork. 

* In component-based design, it is clear what each component should do, so the design can easily be divided over different teams. In addition, the interfaces are standardized which guarantees consistency in data exchange.

* The [[w:Meta-Object_Facility | meta-model]] simplifies teamwork. The formal description of the vehicular systems makes sure that the structure of the information can clearly be visualized and that consistency of the information is guaranteed.

* Component-based software design facilitates the use of model-based design. Thus the use of model-based design, which is a current standard in vehicular system design, can be expanded. 

* Component-based design shifts automotive software development from an ECU-based approach to a function-based approach and makes it possible to write application software independent of the used ECU.

===== The four fundamental &quot;concerns&quot; of system design =====
Due to the increasing complexity of vehicular systems, there is a need to explicitly control the interaction process instead of implicit definition of the interaction embedded in the different subsystems itself. 

In this context, the concept of [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Design_Patterns/4Cs | the four fundamental &quot;concerns&quot; of system design]] is introduced. These represent the different layers in the interaction-process.

Explicit layers facilitate the design of vehicular systems due to the better overview of the interaction process. Especially changes in the vehicular system, which requires changes in coordination, are more straightforward.

* &lt;u&gt;Communication&lt;/u&gt; depends on the used protocols, interfaces and agreements about data exchange formats. This is specified in the standard.

* &lt;u&gt;Computation&lt;/u&gt; depends on the application software components.

* &lt;u&gt;Configuration&lt;/u&gt; is dependent on the system designer and the used tool-chains for the methodology. The system designer designs the physical topology of the ECU-network and decides which applications he wants to add to the vehicular system. When following the methodology, the optimization algorithm in the selected tool-chain determines the distribution of the different application over the different ECU’s. 

* &lt;u&gt;Coordination&lt;/u&gt; is specified in the [[w:Runtime_system|runtime environment]]. The runtime environment is the implementation of the configuration, has the possibility to manage both inter- and intra-ECU communication and can call the different applications to handle communication at their communication ports.

The application software only affects the computation step and is therefore not aware of the computation and configuration layers. This makes it possible to create application software that is unaware of the number of interaction partners. In this way, there is a clear separation between the communication and functionality.

The explicit control of interaction makes it possible to add applications to the vehicular system without the need to change some of the application software that interacts with the new application.
The necessary changes are situated in the run time environment, which is automatically adjusted in the ECU-configuration step when using the Autosar methodology. 

==== Influence on system complexity ====
The AUTOSAR-standards also change the [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Categories_of_system_complexity|complexity of the vehicular system]]. Modern vehicle are of the type distributed hardware distributed software.

AUTOSAR sees the system as different applications running on one virtual platform. The standards make it possible to translate the virtual platform to a real implementation on the different ECU’s, where it is possible that some applications run on the same ECU. This methodology paves the way for a shift to systems with distributed hardware – central software.

This new model of a vehicle system has some implications for the [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Automotive#Safety|safety]].

The sharing of ECU’s is also necessary from a practical point of view. The number of embedded control systems in vehicles keeps rising, but the number of ECU’s in vehicles is reaching a limit. The cost is too high and the space in vehicles is limited. With Virtualization tools, as provided by AUTOSAR, there are possibilities to strictly separate functions on an ECU without loss of safety. This can open the path to less (but more powerful) ECU’s&lt;ref&gt; www.etas.com/data/presentations/BoCSE2007_AUTOSAR_Abstract_Maier_2007-03.pdf (01-04-2009)&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Practical Aspects ====

===== OEM’s =====
The Autosar standardization is a severe change in approach of a vehicular system design. This makes it difficult to adapt an existing vehicular system to an Autosar compatible architecture.
According to the roll out plan of the Autosar Core Partners, the OEM’s will not switch to an Autosar compatible system in one day, but they will start with the integration of one Autosar compatible ECU for one of the big subsystems (verwijzing) in a classically designed E/E-architecture. In this way, experience can be built, then an entire subsystem and eventually the entire vehicular-system can become Autosar compatible&lt;ref&gt; The standard for global Cooperation in Automotive SW Development - By Moessinger J. - TI Tokyo, July 23, 2008 - Available on [http://www.autosar.org www.Autosar.org] (21-12-2008).&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== Suppliers ===== 
The lack of existing Autosar compatible vehicular systems makes it difficult for suppliers to test new components that are supposed to be Autosar compatible.
To tackle this problem, some companies group together in projects to generate an Autosar compatible test bench where the different companies can test their soft- and hardware. An example is the SWAP-project, where eight Swedish companies with the necessary and complementing competence to design a professional test bench, have joined forces&lt;ref&gt; SWAP: Design of an AUTOSAR Open Laboratory Test Bench - By Hiller M., Sivencrona H. and Sandberg A.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The future ==

Looking further in the future, these trends seem to continue. [[w:CyberCars|Cybercars or driverless cars]] for example need to know the state of the whole vehicle to control the vehicle in an optimal way. This can only happen when there is central software.
 
In the far future, there might be a trend toward communication between cars and between cars and road infrastructure. 

An example is a fleet of cybercars. A fleet of such vehicles forms a managed transportation system, for passengers or goods, on a network of roads with on-demand and door-to-door capability&lt;ref&gt; http://www.cybercars.org/ (01-04-2009)&lt;/ref&gt;.
This kind of system belongs to the class of ‘distributed hardware – central software’.
The fleet problems concern essentially the following elements&lt;ref&gt; http://www.cybercars.org/technologies.html#spec (01-04-2009)&lt;/ref&gt;:
- vehicle allocation to a particular demand,
- vehicle relocation after a trip,
- deadlock avoidance,
- demand management and fare collection,
- distributed versus central management,
- communication architecture.

Instead of a fleet of cars which are controlled by a central management system, one can imagine that there will also be a quest for autonomous cars who only communicate with their surroundings and possible a central system to gather traffic information. This car can then decide autonomous what action he should undertake.

Experiments in this area are currently conducted by Mercedes-Benz. Their engineers are working on a system called &quot;Interactive Vehicle Communication&quot; which allows cars to communicate with one another. The current status of their research is shown in their concept car &quot;ESF&quot;. The exchange of data between different cars is via 'ad hoc' networks that are formed between vehicles over short distances. These WLAN require no extra external infrastructure. Transmission occurs at a frequency of 5.9GHz over a distance of up to 500 metres. Of course this distance is expanded if different cars are communicating with each other and messages are passed on.

Currently there is a project in Frankfurt called &quot;simTD&quot; &lt;ref&gt; http://www.simtd.de/ (02-03-2010) &lt;/ref&gt;. Different German car manufacturers are taking part in this test where up to 400 cars are communicating with each other. The main purpose of this test is to improve safety on the road.

what is more important is to know that addiction treatment in Iowa is also classified according to the modus operandi of the treatment center. For example, there are treatment centers that treat solely with a detox program and those which use different approaches such as dual diagnosis and cognitive behavioral therapies.

The gist of everything is that you need to study on the different kinds of treatment programs in Iowa and seek admission in one that best suits your interests.

= Blackmar-Diemer Gambit (BDG) =
===2...dxe4===
White has given up his king's pawn, in hopes of an aggressive game. Since there is no way White can win a pawn back immediately, he can expect this set-up most times he plays the Blackmar-Diemar Gambit. The most respectful move for White would be [[/3. Nc3|Nc3]], putting pressure on the e4 pawn. Sometimes [[/3. Bc4|Bc4]] is played, in hope of trapping Black quickly with a variation of [[Chess/Scholar's mate|Scholar's Mate]].

Similar to the Philidor's Defence, but here the e5 pawn is already defended. Black's kingside bishop is now blocked in behind the pawn chain. White has a spatial advantage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is microfluidics? ==

Microfluidics is the science of fluid flows at the microscopic scale.

Microfluidics mainly  deals with artificial systems, but is present in numerous natural systems:
* Trees: ascent of sap in xylem conduits in the trunk (conduit diameter around 30 micrometers), and in leaves (diameter around 50 nanometers).  
* Inside us: capillary blood vessels transport liquid (diameter 8 micrometer), lungs pump air in small alveola.

== Why do we care?==

[[Image:InkjetHead.svg|frame|50px|right|Head of an ink jet printer]]

Microfluidic is involved in present applications:
* Top one: ink-jet printer


Starting applications with a promising market are:
* medical implants (injection of drugs from an embedded pump)
* Lab-on-a-chip: miniature lab to perform biological test such as proteomics, or chemical analysis/synthesis of very exothermic reactions

For research purposes, it provides miniature  devices to study small objects.

=Baltic Defence=
===2...Bf5===
This developing move is to get the white squared bishop outside the pawn chain before playing e6. It weakens the b7 square, and this weakness is normally enough to ensure white good play.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;About ME!!!!!!!!&lt;/big&gt;
I am Tre', a senior at ODU.  I will be graduating, with a degree in English, in May, 2009.  I am studying to teach secondary English and my emphasis is in Journalism.  I am really looking forward to getting in my own classroom and showing these students why I think English is so great.  Hopefully, I will increase the literacy and overall enjoyment of reading in my students.  

For fun I like to travel.  My most recent vacation was to Myrtle Beach, SC.  Overall, my favorite things to do are READ, READ, and READ :)  My favorite book at the moment is Some Love, Some Pain, Sometime.  My favorite authors are Zora Neale Hurston, Walter Mosley, and J. California Cooper.  I also enjoy writing from time to time.  I am a Sex and the City fanatic.  I love movies in general.  My top five would have to be Love Jones, The Count of Monte Cristo, Gladiator, A Lot Like Love, and Braveheart.  I could not live without my laptop or my iPod...or my new cell phone....or my camcorder....okay I LOVE TECHNOLOGY :)  I think I would rather lose one arm than live without pizza, lasagna, philly steak subs, spaghetti, ribeye steaks, baked potatoes, double stuf oreos, or chocolate chip cookies.


'''&lt;u&gt;My Teaching Philosophy&lt;/u&gt;''' 
I realize that as a teacher, my job is not limited to the confines of my classroom.  I feel a responsibility to my school to be accessible and helpful in any way possible.  I feel that same responsibility to the parents of my students.  I will strive to attain communication with parents in hopes to better understand my students, allow parents to be aware of what is happening within the classroom, and to create an open dialogue where problem-solving may be done collectively.  I will use and create teaching strategies that will be most effective in my classroom. I look to create an interactive classroom conducive to work and play, where students are interested and excited about learning and feel that their opinions and experiences are valuable. My goal is to teach, and teach well.  I hope to make a difference in the lives of my students, to leave an imprint of a positive experience that will help provide guidance and aid in success for years to come.  

In my experience, I have seen far too many teachers that don’t reach all of their students.  They are stuck on teaching one way and to one type of learner.  I’ve watched different types of learners be neglected because of ineffective teachers.  I strive to be different.  I strive to learn my students’ needs and learning styles and to reach each of them individually.  Many of the techniques that I learned in special education will be very useful in educating my regular-ed students.  I believe that all students have special needs and that teachers should base their techniques on those needs.  

As an English teacher on the middle/high school level, I will be knowledgeable, fair, dedicated, and concerned about the well being of my students.  I strive to implement multicultural education and to accommodate all types of learners.  My goal is to effectively communicate material to be learned, have a classroom conducive to work and play and to promote self-expression and critical thinking.  I understand that I will be a role model and that I must take that task seriously.  I believe that as a teacher, I must educate by being educated.  In other words, I must continue to learn, to be open to new ideas and to stay abreast of new information and current events.  I will show responsibility by being responsible.  I will grade papers and return them in a timely manner, meet deadlines, and use my work as an example for projects, papers, self-expression, etc.  I believe that I cannot ask any more of my students than I am willing to give.  I hope to be a mentor to students and help to prepare them for life outside of the classroom.  I will promote self-expression among my students.  I believe that when your ideas are incorporated into any learning experience, you have no choice but to be excited about it and somehow relate to it.  I will encourage my students to think critically and analyze content while also realizing that some information must be accepted as far as testing is concerned. 

I believe that inclusive education can be successful with the right amount of dedication from both the student and the teachers.  It is going to take a lot of work on the behalf of everyone involved in the education system, to include administration, teachers, teacher’s assistants, parents, and students.  In order for inclusion to be successful, teachers need to be properly trained.  That is the key.  Too many teachers are walking into these situations basically blind and unprepared to survive in the classroom.

Overall, I strive to be effective as an English teacher.  I plan to take on each task with passion.  I will teach my students just as I would want a teacher to teach my child- with respect, patience, and caring.  I want to reach my students and not only teach them how to pass a test but give them something that sticks with them throughout their lives.  I hope to be a friend and a mentor and touch each of my students lives in a positive way.  I realize that teachers matter and that in many cases we are parents away from home and that we must be aware of our responsibility towards our children.

Hi There,
Based on what you said in your 'about me', it seems that we have a few things in common - especially favorite foods and movies. I have to agree that Brave Heart is one of the all time bests. As far as your teaching philosphy goes, I would also have to agree that not enough teachers take the time to get to know their students outside of the classroom setting. I think that, often times, this is far more important and long lasting than any information we can ever present to them. I am currently teaching high school science to juniors and seniors and feel that the bonds I form with my students not only give them a sense of trust, but make the whole learning process more enjoyable for both myself and the individuals in my classes.

Hi Tre'

I agree with your statement about how some teachers don't reach (or know how) to reach their students. I have found that the
most important thing is to be able to build a rapport with your students.  If you can't find some common ground, it will be difficult to relate to them on just about anything.  I have found it takes a lot of time and effort to get to know students,
but the payoff is there. I really appreciate your passion for the profession.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''About Me!'''
 
   
I am from Blackstone, Virginia and pursuing my degree in Elementary Education. I am a mother of a wonderful son and married to a wonderful man. I am hoping to teach in Nottoway County in any grades between K-6. If I go with the grades 4th-6th, I would like to teach Math and/or Science.
  
  
I have observed several different classrooms from K-4. I used to work as a teacher's assistant and I have had time to see what my philosophy would be. I would like to be a teacher that can have a good relationship with the students. I want the students to be able to see me as their teacher but also someone that they can come to with their thoughts. To be a good teacher you need to care about all the different types of students and treat them individually and not just a group of kids. I would like for my students to learn the subject material as well as understand how to use it in everyday life. I am a very &quot;work with your hands&quot; type of learner and I would incorporate activities and projects in my teachings as well as lectures to reach out to all types of learners. I believe that the best way to learn something is to try it out and work with it and not only read about it or hear about it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What does it look like?==

There are over 200 known Shield Bug species. Size, body ornamentation and color vary greatly. Most Shield Bugs are green, gray, or brown to match their environment and are not easily noticed. Some species have bright colors. 

They have a shield-shaped body. From the side, the back surface is slightly flattened and the underside appears slightly rounded. A distinctive, triangular shield hides the wings from the top and partially covers the abdomen underneath. A pale Y-shape often marks the back tip of the shield. The legs may be hairy or bristly and have only two segments at the end. The wings are well-developed. 

Members of the ''Acanthosomatidae'' family are usually broadly oval or slightly tapering at the back end. On the small head are five-segmented antennae that may appear sunk into the front edge of the exoskeleton (pronotum). Antennae may have up to five segments. 

Members of the ''Tessaratomidae'' family are often called Giant Shield Bugs. Some of these can be 1-1/2 inches long. 

Shield Bugs are often referred to as stink bugs because they are similar in shape and emit a foul odor. Shield Bugs have only four odor-emitting glands on the abdomen instead of six. 

Members of the ''Cydnidae'' family are called burrowing bugs. They are about ½ inch long and may be shiny brown, black, metallic, or bi-colored. They have a rounded, compact oval shape. Their spiny legs are adapted for burrowing into the ground.

==Where does it live?==


There are over 5000 Shield Bugs species worldwide. Several hundred species are found in warmer areas in the northern United States. They are abundant in wet meadows, especially on sedges. They can be found wherever there are woodlands and scrublands, but most live in subtropical and tropical regions.  

''Pentatomoidea'', the largest Shield Bug family, is especially abundant in warmer regions of the southern hemisphere.

Many species of burrowing bugs spend part of their lives above ground hiding under stones and leaf litter.

==What does it eat?==

All Shield Bug species are herbivorous (plant eaters). They suck juices from shrubs and trees. The younger stages feed only on shoots or unripe seeds of a limited range of plants. The older immature stages and adults feed on a wide variety of plants. 

Foliage of cypress trees is favored by some species. ''Elasmucha'' feeds on hanging spikes of small soft flowers of birch trees called catkins. 

Burrowing bugs can burrow down three feet or more to suck root sap from plants.

Several species feed on other insects. Shield Bugs are sometimes called “timid predators” because they do not use their legs to overpower or manipulate prey. They attack slow-moving, defenseless creatures like caterpillars and aphids.

==How does it defend itself?==

Shield Bugs are well known for their ability to produce a foul odor secreted from the thoracic glands in adults and from the abdominal glands in nymphs. Some species are brightly colored to warn predators of the foul-smelling, bitter liquid. Other species have muted colors to blend into the environment. 

''Elasmucha grisea'' are known as “parent bugs” because of the care they give their young. They guard their eggs and newly hatched nymphs from the attacks of predators.

In Australia, an unpleasant species of the family ''Tessaratomidae'' can squirt a potentially blinding stream of defensive secretions.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

Shield Bugs undergo simple metamorphosis, growing through three stages—egg, nymph and adult. The young or immature stages are called nymphs and often resemble small adults. The wings are less developed than those of the adult, and they are lighter in color. 

The soft, pale nymphs are especially susceptible to predators. A new exoskeleton generally hardens in an hour or two. The nymph grows to its new size by taking in air. The wings are expanded by forcing blood into the veins.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

The female parent bug lays her eggs away from the catkin food source. She later leads the nymphs in a column to the food, like a mother duck leading her ducklings to water. She continues to care for her nymphs throughout their development. 

Male and female burrowing bugs produce sound to attract a mate. They rub special pegs on the hind wings over file-like abdominal structures during courtship and mating.

==How does this bug affect people?==

The stink gland secretions are said to contaminate fruit when left on plants where Shield Bugs feed. 

Giant Shield Bugs are reported to harm citrus crops.

The family ''Scutelleridae'' is reported to be a very serious pest of wheat and barley in West Asia. These Shield Bugs are referred to as “sunn pests” and damage crops by feeding on leaves, stems and grains. During feeding they are said to inject chemicals that harm the quality of flour made from these grains.

===2...Nc6===
With the work in Georgi Orlov this previously obscure opening has been given new life. Black keeps a flexible central pawn options. White has a number of sensible replies but the most common is 3. Nf3 to discourage the e5 break.

==Prostate Cancer==
*'''ICORG 97-01; 2012''' (1997-2001) PMID 22682750 -- &quot;The effect of short term neo-adjuvant androgen deprivation on erectile function in patients treated with external beam radiotherapy for localised prostate cancer: an analysis of the 4- versus 8-month randomised trial (Irish Clinical Oncology Research Group 97-01).&quot; (Daly PE, Radiother Oncol. 2012 Jul;104(1):96-102.)
**See page at [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate/Hormones/Adjuvant ADT#Androgen suppression duration|Adjuvant ADT]]
**Conclusion: &quot;The first year post ADT and EBRT poses the greatest risk to sexual function and a continued decline may be expected. However, 26% of men can expect to retain sexual function at 5 years.&quot;
*'''Beth Israel / Harvard; 2011''' (2003-6) PMID 21934053 -- &quot;Prediction of erectile function following treatment for prostate cancer.&quot; (Alemozaffar M, JAMA. 2011 Sep 21;306(11):1205-14.)
**Longitudinal multicenter cohort study. 1027 pts treated with RP, BT, or RT. Developed models predicting erectile function at 2 yrs after treatment based on patient characteristics, sexual HRQOL, and treatment characteristics.
**37% of all pts and 48% of those who were potent before treatment remained potent at 2 yrs after treatment. 53% of pts reported use of medications for treatment of erectile dysfunction. Models were externally validated in a separate cohort.
**Conclusion: a model was developed to estimate risk of ED after treatment

==Brachytherapy==
*'''University of Washington; 2009''' (2001-2003) PMID 19303721 -- &quot;Erectile function durability following permanent prostate brachytherapy.&quot; (Taira AV, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Nov 1;75(3):639-48. Epub 2009 Mar 21.)
**Retrospective. 226 patients, treated with brachytherapy in 2 prospective randomized trials. Potency defined using IIEF-6 score. Median F/U 6.4 years
**Outcome: 7-year potency rate 56%. By baseline potency score (2004 vs. 2008): 29-30: 75% vs 74%, 24-28: 52% vs. 45%, 18-23: 48% vs. 40%, 13-17: 23% vs. 23%. Multivariate predictors were preimplant IIEF score, HTN, DM, prostate size, dose to proximal penis
**Dosimetry: Penile bulb D25 &lt;50% 71% vs. &gt;50% 45% (SS); highest impact in mild baseline dysfunction (IIEF score 18-23), where D25 &lt;50% potency 73% vs. &gt;50% 14% (SS)
**Conclusion: Potency preservation is durable following brachytherapy; penile bulb sparing may further improve it

==Penile Bulb Dose==
*'''RTOG 9406; 2004''' PMID 15590164 -- &quot;Penile bulb dose and impotence after three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer on RTOG 9406: findings from a prospective, multi-institutional, phase I/II dose-escalation study.&quot; (Roach M, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Dec 1;60(5):1351-6.)
**Subset analysis, 158 men potent at entry
**Outcome: &quot;Remained potent&quot; if median dose &lt;52.5 Gy 68% vs. &gt;52.5 Gy 52%; &quot;Became impotent&quot; 32% vs. 48%. Median dose to penile bulb if &quot;remained potent&quot; 49.8 Gy vs. &quot;became impotent&quot; 60.3 Gy. In MVA, age, dose to prostate, ADT correlated with risk of impotence
**Conclusion: Dose to penile bulb associated with risk of radiation-induced impotence


==Meta-Analysis==
*'''Robinson; 2002''' PMID 12419432 -- &quot;Meta-analysis of rates of erectile function after treatment of localized prostate carcinoma.&quot; (Robinson JW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Nov 15;54(4):1063-8.)

==Treatment==
&lt;big&gt;'''Treatment of ED in patients treated with RT for prostate cancer'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''''Randomized:'''''
*'''RTOG 0215''' -- sildenafil vs placebo
**Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled crossover design. 115 pts treated with EBRT + hormones for localized prostate cancer. No brachytherapy. Treatment with LHRH analogue for 8-28 weeks prior to RT and during RT but discontinued at the completion of RT. Must have erectile dysfunction with answers of &quot;no sexual activity&quot; (score 0) to &quot;sometimes&quot; (score 3) on Question #1 of IIEF (&quot;How often were you able to get an erection during sexual activity?&quot;)
***Arm 1: treatment with sildenafil PRN 50-100 mg qd x 12 weeks; 1 week break; crossover to placebo x 12 weeks
***Arm 2: placebo x 12 weeks; 1 week break; crossover to sildenafil x 12 weeks
**'''2011''' PMID 21235716 -- &quot;Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial of treating erectile dysfunction with sildenafil after radiotherapy and short-term androgen deprivation therapy: results of RTOG 0215.&quot; (Watkins Bruner D, J Sex Med. 2011 Apr;8(4):1228-38.)
***Sildenafil had a positive effect. However, as few as 21% of patients had a treatment specific response, only improving during sildenafil but not during the placebo phase.
***Conclusion: &quot;This is the first controlled trial to suggest a positive sildenafil response for ED treatment in patients previously treated with RT/ADT, however, only a minority of patients responded to treatment. ADT duration may be associated with response and requires further study. The overall low response rate suggests the need for study of additional or preventative strategies for ED after RT/ADT for prostate cancer.&quot;

==Prevention==
&lt;big&gt;'''Prevention of ED in patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''''Randomized:'''''
*'''MSKCC''' - sildenafil vs placebo
**Double blind randomized to 1) sildenafil 50 mg vs 2) placebo, beginning 3 days prior to start of RT and continuing for 6 months. Drug was then discontinued and taken PRN. 
**'''2013''': (Abstract) [https://www.astro.org/uploadedFiles/Main_Site/News_and_Media/Media_Resources/Press_Kits/Annual_Meeting_2012/ASTRO%20Annual%20Meeting%20Rls%20-%20ZelefskyM%20FINAL.pdf ASTRO Abstract - Press release PDF] [http://www.redjournal.org/article/S0360-3016(12)00958-3/fulltext Abstract HTML] -- &quot;Results of a Prospective Randomized Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial Evaluating the Use of Prophylactic Sildenafil Citrate During Radiation Therapy in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.&quot; (Zelefsky MJ, 2013 ASTRO Annual Meeting, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys Volume 84, Issue 3, Supplement , Page S2, 1 November 2012.) 
***The IIEF overall scores were significantly higher in the SC arm compared to placebo at 6 months (p = 0.006), 12 months (p = 0.02), and 24 months (p = 0.04) after therapy.
***Conclusion: Daily SC administered during and after radiation therapy for prostate cancer resulted in improved overall sexual function compared to placebo at all time points. This is the first randomized prospective controlled trial to demonstrate the utility of a PDE5 inhibitor as a rehabilitation strategy in the prostate cancer radiation therapy patient population.

*'''RTOG 0831''' -- tadalafil vs placebo
**Double blind randomized to 1) tadalafil 5 mg vs 2) placebo daily x 6 months beginning at start of RT. 
**2013: Preliminary results [http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/114695-132 ASCO Abstract 2013] -- &quot;Preliminary results of RTOG 0831, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of tadalafil in the prevention of erectile dysfunction in patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer.&quot; (Bruner D, 2013 ASCO Annual Meeting, abstract 9525, J Clin Oncol 31, 2013 (suppl; abstr 9525))
***155 analyzable pts. Spontaneous EF at 30 wks from drug start was not different between arms based on IIEF Q1 response, total IIEF score (52.5 drug vs 52.8 placebo), or score change from baseline (-8.0 drug vs -8.8 placebo). No difference at 1 yr. About 80% of pts maintained spontaneous EF in both arms. 
***Conclusion: &quot;Low-dose daily tadalafil did not preserve EF within the first year of RT for prostate cancer.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Introduction'''

Hi and welcome to my page.  My name is Stacy Thurber and I am a student here at Old Dominion University. I am not only a student here at ODU, but I am a substitute teacher for Newport News Public Schools, Williamsburg-James City County and Gloucester County Public Schools.  I know that sounds like a lot and yes sometimes it can be, but I have wanted to be a teacher since High School and have come to realize that in order to get your foot in the door you have to make yourself known.

Besides being a substitute teacher and a student, another one of my many roles is that I am a member of Alpha Phi International Fraternity.  My sisters are my life and without them I really do not feel that I would be here where I am today.  The sisters of Alpha Phi came along when I needed them the most, of course at the time I did not realize it, but I do now and do not hesitate to mention it to anyone that I meet.  

I think the last and perhaps the most important role that I have in life, besides being a future teacher, is that of a wife.  I am married to the most wonderful man in the world, Rob, who is in the Air Force.  We have been married for almost 4 years and have loved every minute of it.  Yes, it is not the easiest life at times, but the many people that I have met so far are all wonderful and dear friends of mine and I would not want to change that for anything.  

That is all that I have for now, but for those of you that are interested in seeing what I look like, what my husband looks like and what my furry puppies look like (sorry did I forget to mention that I have  dogs) please check back in the coming days and I will post some pictures.


'''What is Education'''

I believe the purpose of education is to provide every child an equal opportunity to learn. As a future high school social studies teacher, I feel that it is my duty to ensure equality in the classroom. I also believe that education should prepare children for life beyond the school walls, while at the same time allowing for experimentation with individual interests. As a student, I feel that education has provided me with more than content knowledge. I have also gained values and socialization skills. In my opinion, education should involve students in democratic activities and reflective thinking. Education can take various forms, but should produce the same outcome, which is ability to become productive citizens.
    
I believe that teaching should involve the infusion of historical events, the concepts of today and the expectations of the tomorrow. In my opinion, this is the only way to ensure that each student receives an ideal education. I believe that learning should be a cooperative endeavor between the teacher and students. It is a shared responsibility with the teacher being responsible for providing the knowledge and presenting it in a comprehensible manner while the students are responsible for asking questions and forming their own conclusions.
    
The role of the teacher is multidimensional and he/she needs to find an appropriate balance between these. The teacher is the authority figure, but should allow for a democratic classroom, rather than a dictatorship. He or she should ensure the environment of the classroom fosters learning, while keeping the children safe. This is the expectation for my classroom. I want for my students to feel comfortable asking questions. To me, a teacher should be caring, compassionate and trustworthy. They should nurture, guide and be a moral role model for their students. Although teachers are often the disciplinary figures, they are also motivators and facilitators who promote independent learning.
    
Students also assume many roles. It is their job to attend school and actively participate. I believe that they should engage in independent learning and conclusion making, while being responsible and courteous. It is the obligation of the student to ask questions to ensure understanding. As a teacher, I will provide opportunities for class discussion and questioning. Through the efforts of the teacher and the curriculum, students should learn civic duties to prepare them to become efficient citizens.
    
Knowledge cannot be confined to any one particular area. I believe that the curriculum should not be biased. It must encompass all aspects of society. Multiculturalism is essential to facilitate understanding and acceptance while eliminating discrimination. I think that this is the key for the future. I think that for a child to understand his or her future, they must understand their past. I also believe that children learn best through interaction; therefore, the classroom should offer hands-on teaching methods and activities. Interests of the students should not be ignored, but I don’t feel it should be the entire basis for education. To me, the main purpose of education is to instill children with the knowledge to succeed or survive in society depending on what decisions that they make.
    
I can not identify with any one particular philosophy of education. I am able to identify with certain aspects of each. For instance, I agree with the progressivisist idea that schools should help students develop personal and social values. I also agree that new ideas are important to make the future better than the past. I can also identify with perennialism because I believe that students should learn about the Western Culture. To a certain degree I also can relate to essentialism. I think that the back-to basics approach is a good idea. Additionally, I believe that students should learn discipline, hard work and respect from authority. This is necessary for a better society. For this reason I can also associate with reconstuctionism. I believe that education should transform society to a certain extent. It seems that I have tendencies toward most of the philosophies, which in my opinion is good because it indicates adaptability.

''''''About Me''''''

I currently reside in the town of Clarksville, VA which is in Mecklenburg Co. I am now actively perusing my Masters of Interdisciplinary Studies PreK- 6 at Old Dominion University, after taking six years off from my educational pursuit.  I am employed full time by Ruby Tuesday, as an assistant manager.  I have worked for them for the past five years starting out as a server and working my way up through the ranks.  Why such a vast career change, one might ask. The reason is with all of the negative work experiences I encounter, they have only pushed me further in this direction. From day to day I continue to see people who lack in education skills, especially reading. There has been too numerous times that I have found someone who can either read very poorly or not at all. It only angers me since my mother is a teacher with her masters in education and other endorsements that include reading specialist.  

Some of the actives that I do during free time include, horticulture, boating, reading, and actively involved with local community theater productions. I have two dogs, a black lab and a sheltie mix that was rescued from Richmond SPCA.   

----

''''''Ideals''''''

''&quot;The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.&quot; Aristotle''

As aforementioned, I have seen too many people who have such a lack of education skills in today’s work force. The lack of reading skills is, to me, at an all time low. Those skills are taught and reinforced in the elementary education level. With there being such a great need, I have decided to teach. We need to prepare our children for the future, not for the test that they are going to take tomorrow. How well you succeed in life on your own is the big test.

Basic reading skills are the large stepping stone in ones education pursuit. If missing that stone, there is a constant struggle to continue forward. If one thinks that that struggle is too great, then they may give up and not continue forward.   

To effectively make reading education a part of day to day function in the elementary classroom is what I would like to do. It is just not ‘reading time’ for fifteen minuets of the day, it is reading all day. Each instructional value that is to be taught is like a mini reading lesson with a hands-on approach. Introducing other things such as technology and other actives either further stimulate the child, reinforce, or remediate what is being taught.</text>

==Bogo-Indian Defence==
Black plays Bb4+ and White has to block against the check. If White plays Nc3 then it's tranposed into a Nimzo-Indian defence if instead White blocks on d2 then the resulting complications are likely to see an exchange of pieces. The positions are about equal and with pieces traded draws are not uncommon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Preston,
My name is Morgan, I am also majoring in Art Education at ODU. I want to teach at a middle school or high school level, What about you?  My concentration is in Drawing and Design as I am not that great at 3D art, which makes me appreciate the beauty and the hard work that went into 3D peices. I completely agree with you about the importance of art in students lives. It helps them express themselves in very unique ways. It teaches them that it is okay to be different than others, and yes, it gives them a sense of confidence in themselves. I also believe that art and music are very cathartic . I have always wanted to learn to play the bass guitar. Do you play for yourself, or are you in a local band?

Hi Preston, 

It is very interesting to hear from someone with a passion for teaching a specific subject matter. I am curious to know which age group you are planning to teach. Artistic expression does enable students to explore themes and ways of thinking that are outside the box.  As a child, I recall that art was definately a particular means of building self confidence and showing leadership abilities, if that makes sense.   Do you agree with Gardner's &quot;Theory of Multiple Intelligences&quot;?  Assumedly, your area of expertise seems to fall into the &quot;Visual/Spacial&quot; category. 

[[User:Kmill064|Kendall]] ([[User talk:Kmill064|talk]]) 01:58, 31 May 2008 (UTC)


==Hi Preston,==

Thank you for sharing your philosophy with us. One of the fondest memories I have of my high school teachers is of my sculpture and ceramics teacher. Often art courses aren't given the proper recognition for what they add to a student's career, but the courses gave me a much-needed creative and mental release.

I agree with your thoughts on the importance of connecting with parents. I'm hoping to involve parents in my classroom through frequent communication. Some parents prefer to be more involved than others, but I agree that it's important to touch base with all of them in some way. 

Your dedication to ensuring students feel safe in your classroom is important. I agree that in many courses, especially an art course, some students may be afraid to express themselves for fear of ridicule. But often it's once we let these guards down that we can see our true potential.

Art classes, because of their limitless possibilities for creativity, can really offer a much-needed boost of confidence for students that may need it to be successful in their other courses. 

I look forward to hearing more about your ideas on art education.

Preston,

As a current music teacher, I understand how important to you interdisciplinary studies are and that they have an incredible impact on the overall growth of young people.  An addition, I cannot agree with you enough the importance of &quot;getting to know&quot; your students.  Especially in the case of at-risk students, the interpersonal connections you can create with them truly do make a difference in the amount of effort they put into your class.  

As a young person, I never enjoyed art - coloring, drawing, clay.  I have no idea why this was the case!  I never remember a bad experience with art... I just never excelled in it.  But with music I excelled instantly.  I find it interesting how one can have completely difference responses to related subjects.  I wonder if this class will enlighten me any to this question!

Hey Preston, its awesome to see male figures wanting to take the lead and be teachers, and especially you going into art.  I am also an art education major. The passion you have for art and your passion to create will spread and be contagious to the students that will sit in your classroom, I'm excited to see how it goes.  What is your favorite concentration of the ones you stated in your bio? [[User:Imone001|Imone001]] ([[User talk:Imone001|talk]]) 22:05, 14 September 2008 (UTC)

Hi Preston, this Amanda, I am doing the distance learning program here at ODU.  I am also pursuing a career in Education, at the present time I am an instructional assistant at the high school.  I am in an art class this semetster, so I can definitely relate to your comment about the students feeling good about being successful in art as opposed to not doing so well in other subjects.  I have been told first hand how a student felt about excelling in this particular area.  I like your enthusiam and passion for art and I think that is what we need in regards to teaching:doing what we do with a passion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''ABOUT ME'''&lt;/big&gt;
I'm Preston i go to Old Dominion University on the Norfolk campus. I've been going there for what seems like forever now and i'm majoring in Art Education. I've been playing bass since i was a sophomore in high school, as for the arts i love every type of art, the ones i do the most are: Sculpture, photography, ceramics, and my favorite street art. aka (graffiti). I also enjoy painting drawling and tattoos but can't really do any of them well. Any questions just ask


&lt;big&gt;'''PHILOSOPHY OF TEACHING:'''&lt;/big&gt; There are people who argue the teaching is the most important profession the world has to offer; for without teachers who will teach the future doctors, lawyers, and politicians of the world. Every subject has its need in the world of teaching whether it is: math, English, science, history, music or art. I have chosen art as my subject to teach the next generation. Teaching art provides children with an opportunity to augment creative expression, self discovery, self esteem and self concept. Teaching art makes me believe that I’m helping the next generation to think outside the box onto bigger and better things. Through art and my guidance children will learn to value their own individuality and the uniqueness of their peers. By stimulating the interest of the students I will build their creativity and open their minds to new horizons. With the higher thinking and problem solving skills they learn from art our children will have the tools to go further then they ever imagined in life. I will put my philosophy into teaching by using patience with the students and modifying my teaching methods when necessary. Not every child is the same the method of teaching you use can’t be the same with every student either. I want my students to feel safe with me they should have nothing to fear in my class. Art teacher’s help children succeed in school were maybe they have problems in other subjects. When a student feels successful they gain confidence, with high confidence a student can do what ever they put their mind to. While students should be the most important thing to a teacher; the cooperation, guidance and teamwork of the parents should be taken into consideration as well. Parents will be well informed of what is going on in the classroom and how their child is doing. If a parent has any sort of problem with something happening at school I will make the time to hear them and talk to them about any problems they may have. Parents can be just as important as the students at times; if the parents aren’t happy with the school or teacher then the student will not be motivated to come to class or to participate in class. With teachers, students and parents unified together in the same cause of spreading knowledge from one generation to another, we can build a better world for all of us to live in. As a teacher I will swear to do my best in every aspect of teaching to insure that every child gets the education they so deserve.</text>

== The importance of reading ==

I agree that reading is the foundation of all other learning. It's so important what elementary teachers do. I applaud you for seeing the need through your daily work. Students learn so much better when reading is more than just 15 minutes a day, like you said -- when it's part of every subject from math to science to PE.

What type of books do you enjoy reading on your own? I think it's important to set an example.

[[User:Lroth009|Lroth009]] ([[User talk:Lroth009|talk]]) 02:29, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

== Hi Adam ==

I agree with your thoughts on how children should be prepared for the future. I was a teacher assistant for two years before I continued my education to become an educator. I have seen a lot of children that struggle with math and reading because their parents have not been taught to view those skills as important. I want to also be a teacher to help the children be prepared for the future and not just tomorrow.  I think that you have a wonderful philosophy about how education should be. 
[[User:Jmurphy|Jmurphy]] ([[User talk:Jmurphy|talk]]) 21:29, 29 May 2008 (UTC)


== I couldn't agree more ==

I enjoyed reading your philosophy exspecially of the reading as a steppin stone.I agree that 15 to 30 minutes of reading time isn't enough. Even if they do 30 minutes of reading time when you have a class of 20 to 30 kids it just isn't enough time. That gives them a chance to read a couples sentences a paragragh if they're lucky. 

my younger brother struggled greatly with reading in elementry school and it made it very hard for him. luckily he had some very good teachers that put the extra effort into making sure he got the skills he needed. Unfortunatly, Not every child is that lucky.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Construct a simple object===

Possibly the simplest project to build with lashing is a coat hanger. Only two sticks and one lash are required to create this simple but useful object. The two pictured below were made by Pathfinders earning this honor.

      <comment>Question related to statement of finally always being executed</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A slight nit-pick, but as Norvig notes here:

http://norvig.com/java-iaq.html

The finally block will not be executed if you actually call 'exit' inside the try.

Should that be included here or does that confuse matters?</text>

=King's Indian Attack=
===2. g3===
A sound, but very unambitious opening move where white almost certainly intends to fianchetto his bishop and enable castling.  Black has the choice to continue to mirror white's move once more with g6 or begin a more aggressive attempt to control the center.

'''''A Guide to Understanding and Creating Electronic Circuits.'''''

The aim of this book is to teach you simple analogue and digital electronics at a practical level. For the in-depth theory of electronics, please read the [[Electronics|Electronics Textbook]]. By the end of this book, you should be able to combine circuit elements to create more complex circuits, and have an understanding of how it works. To begin, you need just basic knowledge of high-school mathematics and physics, common tools and and piece of enthusiasm.

|-
! width=8% | Label
! width=50% | Criteria
! width=32% | Reader's experience
! width=10% | Example
|-
| [[:Category:A-class chess articles|A-class]]
| The article is well organized and is essentially complete, having been reviewed by impartial reviewers from WikiChess or elsewhere.
| style=&quot;font-size:95%&quot; | Very useful to readers. A fairly complete treatment of the subject.  A non-expert in the subject matter would typically find nothing wanting.
|-
| [[:Category:B-class chess articles|B-class]]
| The article is mostly complete and without major issues, but requires some further work to reach A-Class. 
| style=&quot;font-size:95%&quot; | No reader should be left wanting, although the content may not be complete enough to satisfy a serious student or researcher.
| [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Chess_Opening_Theory/1._e4&amp;oldid=1185355 Chess Opening Theory/1. e4]
|-
| [[:Category:C-class chess articles|C-class]]
| The article is substantial, but is still missing important content or contains irrelevant material. The article may still have issues and requires a tidy up. 
| style=&quot;font-size:95%&quot; | Useful to a casual reader, but would not provide a complete picture for even a moderately detailed study.
| [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Chess_Strategy/Mobility&amp;oldid=1204310 Chess Strategy/Mobility]
|-
| [[:Category:Start-class chess articles|Start-class]]
| An article that is developing, but which is quite incomplete.
The article has a usable amount of good content, but it is weak in many areas.
| style=&quot;font-size:95%&quot; | Provides some meaningful content, but the majority of readers will need more.
| [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Chess_Opening_Theory/1._e4/1...g6/2._d4&amp;oldid=1226831 Chess Opening Theory/1. e4/1...g6/2. d4]
|-
| [[:Category:Stub-class chess articles|Stub-class]]
| A very basic description of the topic. 
The article is very short with lots missing.
| style=&quot;font-size:95%&quot; | Provides very little meaningful content but is a required page that can be developed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Cold War was a direct result of the aftermath of World War II; which involved the rise of two major superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States. Although the Cold War did not yield any direct fighting between the two nations, it lasted almost half a century. The Cold War was also a time of tight tensions in the global network, which was primarily due to the fact that both superpowers were in possession of nuclear weapons, which could devastate the entire world. The Cold War would ultimately determine the future of the global network post World War II.

Although we now have a nifty way to represent constants,
we are now left with
a bigger problem: how to combine terms and constants.
We can't use Sway's &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; operator, since it only works
for numbers and strings.&lt;ref&gt;
Later, we will learn how to ''override'' the &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; operator so
that it can add terms and constants as well.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Instead, we will create an object to hold the two items
to be added.&lt;ref&gt;
Why we are doing this is not obvious. As we proceed, we will
see that the approach works, but it won't give us much insight
on how to come up with such solutions in the first place.
We are essentially going to ''delay'' the addition of the items
until we really need to add them together (''e.g.'', when we are
trying to compute a specific ''y'' value). The idea of delaying
is a powerful computer science concept.
Knowing when to delay, however, is more art than science.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Let's create a constructor
named ''plus'' to remind us that it generates an object that holds
the (potential) sum of two objects:

    function plus(p,q) //p and q are terms/constants 
        {
        this;
        }

We can't do much with ''plus'' objects, however, except extract
the original items, bound to ''p'' and ''q''.

How should we enhance our plus constructor?
Just like terms and constants, a plus object should be
able to:

    * compute its value
    * compute its derivative
    * visualize itself

Of course, the ''plus''  object doesn't know how to do
any of these things, since it's just
a container for holding two items.
What it ''can'' do, however, is
ask those items to perform computations and then combine
the results in a meaningful way.
&lt;ref&gt;
There are two main kinds of relationships between objects. In
this case, the relationship between the ''plus'' object
and ''p'' (or ''q'') is ''clientship''. The object
''p'' (or ''q'')
is said to be a client of the ''plus'' object since ''p'' (or ''q'')
is a component.
The other
main relationship between objects in ''inheritance'' in which
objects share traits.
You can read more about in [[The Sway Reference Manual]].
Although explicit inheritance is not used in this case, one
can think of ''terms'' and ''constants'' inheriting the idea of the
three methods: ''value'', ''diff'', and ''toString''.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Now our questions become:

* how should the values of the items be combined?
* How should the differentials of the items be combined?
* How should the visualizations of the items be combined?

For the ''value'' method, 
how should the value of ''p'' and the value of ''q'' be combined?
Since the  value of ''p'' is a number and the value of ''q''
is a number and since the ''plus'' object represents the additions
of its items, we can simply add the item values together:

    function plus(p,q) //p and q are terms/constants
        {
        function value(x)
            {
            p . value(x) + q . value(x);
            }
        this;
        }

Thus, to compute the ''y'' value of a two terms added together,
we simply find the ''y'' values of the terms separately, then
add the results together.
Mathematically,

    &lt;math&gt; y(p + q) = y(p) + y(q) &lt;/math&gt;

Let's test:

    sway&gt; var a = term(-5,2);
    sway&gt; var b = term(7,0);
    sway&gt; a . value(3) + b . value(3);
    INTEGER: -38
    sway&gt; var z = plus(a,b);
    sway&gt; z . value(3);
    INTEGER: -38

Note that our ''plus '' constructor doesn't actually
specify what kinds of objects the formal parameters ''p'' and ''q'' must
be bound to; the only requirement is that those objects
have a ''value'' method that takes a single argument.
We will take advantage of this fact later
and use ''plus'' objects to glue together ''terms'', ''constants'',
and other ''plus'' objects, nilly willy.

==The Power Rule and Sums==

We now turn our attention to the second method ''plus'' objects
need to implement, the ''diff'' method.
Of course, the power rule
won't work for sums,
because the rule only works only for computing the
derivative of a single term.

It turns out the derivative of two things added together
is the sum of the derivatives of each thing alone. Mathematically,

    &lt;math&gt; \frac{d(a + b)}{dx} = \frac{d(a)}{dx} + \frac{d(b)}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;

Now here's the tricky part (well it will seem tricky now, but in
a short time, you will think this is as easy as pie). We
use a ''plus'' object to represent the addition of two terms,
correct?
The right-hand-side of the equation above involves an addition. What are being
added?
Two derivatives. If ''a'' and ''b'' are term objects, then
what kinds of things 
are the derivatives of ''a'' and ''b''. Both are terms! Thus the
right-hand-side in this case is simply the sum of two terms. But
what do we use to represent the sum of two terms......wait
for it......a ''plus'' object.

Wow! Then the derivative of a ''plus'' object, consisting of
two terms, is another ''plus'' object containing the derivatives
of those two terms. This is both amazingly powerful and
amazingly simple at the same time.

If the above explanation has confused you, perhaps looking at the
code will help. Here is the revised ''powerRule'':

    function powerRule(obj)
        {
        if (obj is :term)
            {
            var a = obj . a;
            var n = obj . n;
            term(a * n,n - 1);
            }
        else if (obj is :plus)
            {
            var dp/dx = powerRule(obj . p);
            var dq/dx = powerRule(obj . q);
            plus(dp/dx,dq/dx);
            }
        else
            {
            throw(:calculusError,&quot;powerRule: unknown object&quot;);
            }
        }

Note that ''dp/dx'' is a variable name and is something
entirely different from ''dp'' / ''dx'', which is the variable
''dp'' divided by ''dx''.
For ''plus'' objects, we extract the two terms, ''p'' and ''q'', take
their derivatives using the power rule, and then combine
them into a ''plus'' object.

==More than two terms==

Our ''plus'' constructor is fine for representing lines as a line is composed
of two terms, one of them being a constant.
What do we do for
a sum of three or more terms?

How about doing...nothing.

Yes, nothing. It turns out that our design of ''plus'' is so
fine it not only handles the sum of two terms but the
sum of a ''plus'' object and a term.&lt;ref&gt;
You will find these happy occurrences often if you
write code that is simple and elegant.
&lt;/ref&gt;.
Recall
that the only requirement for the parameters ''p'' and
''q'' in a ''plus'' object are that they both be bound to
objects that have a ''value'' method.
Does a ''plus'' object have a ''value'' method?
Yes, indeed! So that means ''p'' or ''q'' or both
can be bound to ''plus'' objects.
Let's see:

    var a = term(-5,0);
    var b = plus(term(3,1),a);
    var y = plus(term(4,2),b);

The variable ''y'' now refers to the polynomial:

    &lt;math&gt; y = 4 x ^ 2 + 3 x ^ 1 + -5 x ^ 0 &lt;/math&gt;

or more simply:

    &lt;math&gt; y = 4 x ^ 2 + 3 x - 5 &lt;/math&gt;

Now, just because we should (and can) be able to
combine sums and terms nilly-willy with our ''plus''
constructor doesn't mean we can assume ''plus'' is completely
correct as written. We need to test&lt;ref&gt;
When you are a senior, rather than test some code
to see if it appears correct, you might ''prove'' it
correct. The advantage of proving code correct is
that performing all possible tests is sometimes difficult
or impossible.
&lt;/ref&gt;
in order to convince ourselves thoroughly that the code works.
Let's test ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' at some value of
''x'' that is easy to verify, say x = 2:

    sway&gt; a . value(2);
    INTEGER: -5
    
    sway&gt; b . value(2);
    INTEGER: 1
    
    sway&gt; y . value(2);
    INTEGER: 17

In this interaction, we see that ''a'', which is
&lt;math&gt;-5x^0&lt;/math&gt;,
has a value of -5 when ''x''
has a value of 2.
The object ''b'', which is
a ''plus'' object representing 
&lt;math&gt;3x^1 + -5x^0&lt;/math&gt;,
has a value of 6 - 5 or 1.
The object ''y'', which is
also a ''plus'' object and represents 
&lt;math&gt;4x^2 + 3x^1 + -5x^0&lt;/math&gt;,
has a value of 16 + 6 - 5 or 17.

It is not surprising that
the object ''a'', which is just a term,
and the object ''b'',
which is composed of two terms,
both give the correct answer; we are using
their constructors exactly in the manner
they were intended.
Less obvious is
why ''y'' works, being composed of a term and a ''plus'' object.
The next section will demonstrate
''visualization'' to help you understand
'why'.

==Visualizations==

A very good way to see why ''y'' works is to ''visualize''
the ''y'' object.
We begin by modifying
the term constructor to add a ''toString'' method. In
general, a ''toString'' method is used to generate
a string representing the current state of the object.&lt;ref&gt;
The use of the name ''toString'' is just a convention.
We are basing this convention on the Java Programming Language,
which uses a ''toString'' method for this very purpose.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Such a string is called a ''visualization''.

----
Before continuing, read up on [[The Sway Reference Manual/Primitives#Strings|strings]].
----

Here is the modified ''term'' function with its new ''toString'' method:

    function term(a,n)
        {
        function value(x) { a * (x ^ n); }
        function toString()
            {
            &quot;&quot; + a + &quot;x^&quot; + n;
            }
        this;
        }

As always, we write a bit of code, and then test, test, test! 

    sway&gt; var t = term(3,2);
    sway&gt; t . toString();
    STRING: &quot;3x^2&quot;

Given any term, we can quickly see the parts of our object
in a way that is very easy to understand.
&lt;ref&gt;
Be aware that this representation uses the operator precedence
you learned in grammar school, namely that the exponentiation operation
is performed before the multiplication by the coefficient. This
is unlike Sway, which would evaluate the expression &lt;tt&gt;3 * x ^ 2&lt;/tt&gt;
as &lt;tt&gt;(3 * x) ^ 2&lt;/tt&gt;. To learn more about how Sway computes
arithmetic expressions,
see [[The Sway Reference Manual/Precedence and Associativity|Precedence and Associativity]] in
[[The Sway Reference Manual]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
This is the goal of visualization.

We will also need to add a visualization to ''plus'':

    function plus(p,q) //p and q are terms or plus objects
        {
        function value(x) { p . value(x) + q . value(x); }
        function toString()
            {
            p . toString() + &quot; + &quot; + q . toString();
            }
        this;
        }

Note that ''plus'' visualizes itself by using the visualizations
of its component objects and adds a '+' sign to indicate addition.

Now we remake ''a'', ''b'', and ''y'' with these new definitions 
of ''term'' and ''plus'' in force:

    var a = term(-5,0);
    var b = plus(term(3,1),a);
    var y = plus(term(4,2),b);

Let's see what ''y'' looks like:

    sway&gt; y . toString();
    STRING: 4x^2 + 3x^1 + -5x^0

Looks exactly as intended.

To see further why the visualization works, it is sometimes
useful to look at the sequence of calls
generating the result. These calls are
organized into what is known as a 'call tree'.
Actions within a
call are
indented one-level from the originating call.
Leftward pointing arrows represent return values.

Here is to call tree for ''y'''s ''toString'' method
call:

    call y . toString()           //object y is plus(term(4,2),b)
        call p . toString()       //object p is term(4,2)
        &lt;-- &quot;4x^2&quot;                //return value
        &quot; + &quot;
        call q . toString()       //object q is b, plus(term(3,1),a)
            call p . toString()   //object p is term(3,1)
            &lt;-- &quot;3x^1&quot;            //return value
            &quot; + &quot;
            call q . toString()   //object q is a, term(-5,0)
            &lt;-- &quot;-5x^0&quot;           //return value
        &lt;-- 3x^1 + -5x^0          //return value
    &lt;-- 4x^2 + 3x^1 + -5x^0       //return value

Combining the strings from top to bottom  at the first indentation
level gives us the overall return value:

    4x^2 + 3x^1 + -5x^0

We can construct a call tree determining the value of ''y'' when
''x'' = 2, as well:

    call y . value(2)
        call p . value(2)         // p is 4x^2
        &lt;-- 16
        +
        call q . value(2)         // q is 3x^1 + -5x^0
            call p . value(2)     // p is 3x^1
            &lt;-- 6
            +
            call q . value(2)     // q is -5x^0
            &lt;-- -5
        &lt;-- 1
    &lt;-- 17

Summing the return values at the first indentation level yields 17,
the overall return value.

Visualization is an important technique.
You should always include
a visualization method for all your objects so that you can easily
debug your program when things go awry.
In such cases, your visualization
will likely point out that an object
does not appear as you expect it to,
an important first step in solving your problem.

==Power Rule Modifications==

We have tested our ''powerRule'' function on sums of terms, but will
it work for sums of sums?
Let's examine the code:

    function powerRule(obj)
        {
        if (obj is :term)
            {
            var a = obj . a;
            var n = obj . n;
            term(a * n,n - 1);
            }
        else if (obj is :plus)
            {
            var dp/dx = powerRule(obj . p);
            var dq/dx = powerRule(obj . q);
            plus(dp/dx,dq/dx);
            }
        else
            {
            throw(:calculusError,&quot;powerRule: unknown object&quot;);
            }
        }

If the formal parameter ''obj'' is bound to a sum of ''plus'' objects,
the ''powerRule''
function is called recursively on the two objects making up the sum.
As long as either of those two objects is a ''plus'' or ''term'' object, it
appears if ''powerRule'' can handle it. In the case of a ''plus'' object,
''powerRule'' calls itself recursively again.

Let's test the ''powerRule'' function on the polynomial bound to
the variable ''y'' above.
Recall ''y'' visualized as:

    4x^2 + 3x^1 + -5x^0

We would expect the ''powerRule'' function to produce a polynomial
that visualizes to something like:

    8x + 3

Let's see.

    var dy/dx = powerRule(y);
    
    sway&gt; dy/dx . toString();
    STRING: 8x^1 + 3x^0 + 0x^-1

Looking at the last term of the result, we note that zero times anything
is zero, so the result is equivalent to:

    8x^1 + 3x^0 + 0

or

    8x^1 + 3x^0

Noting, as before, that &lt;math&gt;x^0&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 1, the result
becomes:

    8x^1 + 3*1

or

    8x^1 + 3

Finally, realizing that &lt;math&gt;x^1&lt;/math&gt; is simply ''x'', the result
becomes:

    8x + 3

as desired. Some of the questions at the end of this chapter explore
how to have the ''plus'' and ''term'' perform some of these simplifications
automatically.

==Other mathematical combinations of terms==

What if we wish to subtract two terms, as in:

    y = 3x^2 - 4x

We can write a function named ''minus'' to do this:

    function minus(p,q)
        {
        function value(x)
            {
            p . value(x) - q . value(x);
            }
        function toString()
            {
            p . toString() + &quot; - &quot; + q . toString();
            }
        this;
        }

This is just like ''plus'', except that minus signs are used instead
of plus signs in methods ''value'' and ''toString''.&lt;ref&gt;
A fine example of ''programming by analogy''.
Be aware, that making a new function by copying an existing
function and making minor changes is usually a 'bad idea'.
If you find yourself doing this, ask yourself how can the
the two functions be combined into a single function?
There is a nice way to do this for ''plus'' and ''minus'',
but we'll skip that as to not impede the narrative flow.
&lt;/ref&gt;

What is the power rule for the subtraction of terms?
It is similar, but not quite the same as the power rule for
the addition of terms:

    &lt;math&gt;\frac{d(a - b)}{dx} = \frac{d(a)}{dx} - \frac{d(b)}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus ''powerRule'', as written, cannot work for ''minus'' objects because
there is no code in ''powerRule'' that subtracts or even
produces a ''minus'' object.
We will need to add a new clause to ''powerRule'':

    function powerRule(obj)
        {
        if (obj is :term)
            {
            var a = obj . a;
            var n = obj . n;
            term(a * n,n - 1);
            }
        else if (obj is :plus)
            {
            var dp/dx = powerRule(obj . p);
            var dq/dx = powerRule(obj . q);
            plus(dp/dx,dq/dx);
            }
        else if (obj is :minus)
            {
            var dp/dx = powerRule(obj . p);
            var dq/dx = powerRule(obj . q);
            minus(dp/dx,dq/dx);
            }
        else
            {
            throw(:calculusError,&quot;powerRule: unknown object&quot;);
            }
        }

While this will work, there is a clue that we are doing
something wrong. Whenever you see a if-chain
dealing with objects, it means you are not fully
exploiting the power of objects and you should reorganize
your code to remove the if-chain. The next section
shows how.

==The Object Way==

The design of a program usually evolves over time.
Some programmers feel very invested in the code they
have written and will doggedly hang on to it even
when a better way of doing things becomes apparent.
In the words of the immortal Kenny Rogers,
&quot;you got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em&quot;.
In this case, our ''powerRule'' function is threatening
to get out of hand, so we are going to fold and get
a new deal.

Our new approach expands on the statement:

* An object should be able to ...

In the case of our ''term'' and ''plus'' objects,
we have already implemented the following
versions of the above statement:

* A term object should be able to return its coefficient
* A term object should be able to return its exponent
* A term object should be able to compute a ''y'' value given an ''x'' value
* A term object should be able to be able to visualize itself
* A plus object should be able to return its components
* A plus object should be able to compute a ''y'' value given an ''x'' value
* A plus object should be able to be able to visualize itself

To this list, we will add the following statements:

* A term object should be able to differentiate itself
* A plus object should be able to differentiate itself
* Other similar objects should be able to differentiate themselves

Let's first update our ''term'' constructor so that terms
can differentiate themselves.
We do this by adding a ''diff'' (for differentiation) method:

    function term(a,n)
        {
        function value(x) { ... }
        function toString() { ... }
        function diff()
            {
            term(a * n,n - 1);
            }
        this;
        }

The body of the ''diff'' method is simply a form of the term code
found in the ''powerRule'' function.

We can do the same for the ''plus'' constructor:

    function plus(p,q)
        {
        function value(x) { ... }
        function toString() { ... }
        function diff()
            {
            var dp/dx = p . diff();
            var dq/dx = q . diff();
            plus(dp/dx,dq/dx);
            }
        this;
        }

To make ''plus'' a little shorter, we can replace the body of the diff
method with a single line:

    function diff()
        {
        plus(p . diff(),q . diff());
        }

Using the fact that ''plus'' is a function of two arguments, we can
use infix notation as well:

    function diff()
        {
        p . diff() plus q . diff();
        }

Modifying the ''minus'' constructor is similar. What about multiplying
and dividing terms?

According to CME,
the mathematical rule for differentiating a product is:

    &lt;math&gt;\frac{d(a * b)}{dx} = (a * \frac{db}{dx}) + (b * \frac{da}{dx})&lt;/math&gt;

The rule for division is more complicated still:

    &lt;math&gt;
        \frac{d(a / b)}{dx} = \frac
            {(a * \frac{db}{dx}) - (b * \frac{da}{dx})}
            {b^2}
    &lt;/math&gt;

The implementations of the ''diff'' methods for ''times'' and ''div''
constructors are left as an exercise.

After doing all this, the ''powerRule'' function becomes very simple:

    function powerRule(obj)
        {
        obj . diff();
        }

It is so simple, in fact, that it is
longer doing any useful work and can be discarded.

==Questions==

As CME, Chapter 7 notes, suppose:

    &lt;math&gt; y = f(x) &lt;/math&gt;

That is to say, ''y'' is some function of ''x''. If that is so, then:

    &lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;

is sometimes denoted:

    &lt;math&gt; f\,'(x) &lt;/math&gt;

with the apostrophe indicating differentiation.

Because of Sway's liberal views on naming variables, we can
use the same notation. Consider defining a line:

    var f = line(3,-5);      //equivalent to y = 3x - 5

where the ''line'' constructor  is just a wrapper for a call to the
''plus'' constructor:

    function line(m,b)
        {
        plus(term(m,1),term(b,0));
        }

Then, we can differentiate our line thusly:

    var f' = f . diff();

Since ''f'' represents a line
and the differentiation of a line yields
the slope of a line
and the slope of the line is always a constant ''m'', we
would expect that evaluating &lt;math&gt;f\,'&lt;/math&gt; at different points would always
yield the slope:

    sway&gt; f' . toString();
    STRING: 3x^0 + 0x^-1
     
    sway&gt; f' . value(0);
    EVALUATION ERROR: :mathError
    stdin,line 9: exponentiation: cannot divide by zero

What happened?  The problem is the second term of ''f'''.
We end up evaluating that term with ''x'' = 0. What is
&lt;tt&gt;x ^ -1&lt;/tt&gt; when ''x'' is zero? It's &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{0}&lt;/math&gt;.
That's what caused the divide-by-zero error.
What should we do about it? Whenever a term's exponent
goes to zero, we should force the exponent to stay at zero,
when differentiating.

Here's a new version of 
''diff'' for ''term'':

    function diff()
        {
        if (n == 0)
            {
            term(0,0);
            }
        else
            {
            term(a * n,n - 1);
            }
        }

Does it work? After remaking, ''f'' and ''f''', we have

    sway&gt; f' . toString();
    STRING: 3x^0 + 0x^0
     
    sway&gt; f' . value(0);
    REAL_NUMBER: 3.000000000

    sway&gt; f' . value(5);
    REAL_NUMBER: 3.000000000

we see that it does.

If we repeat the differentiation 
process again, we find out how fast
the slope is changing at any given point. For a line, the slope never
changes so we would expect the derivative of the derivative 
(also known as the ''second'' derivative) always to yield zero.

    var f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; = f' . diff();
    
    sway&gt; f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; . toString();
    STRING: 0x^0 + 0x^0
    sway&gt; f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; . value(0);
    INTEGER: 0
    sway&gt; f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; . value(5);
    INTEGER: 0

Confirmed.

==More on visualization==

We really need to do something about our visualization. It's printing
out terms that we really don't need to see. Let's simplify the output
by making ''term'''s ''toString'' method more complicated. Please implement
the following rules for term's ''toString'' method:

# if the coefficient is zero, ''toString'' should return &quot;0&quot;
# if the exponent is zero, ''toString'' should return &quot;&quot; + a
# if both the coefficient and the exponent are 1, ''toString'' should return &quot;x&quot;
# if the exponent is one, ''toString'' should return &quot;&quot; + a + &quot;x&quot;
# if the coefficient is one, ''toString'' should return &quot;x^&quot; + n
# otherwise, ''toString'' should return &quot;&quot; + a + &quot;x^&quot; + n

Earlier rules take precedence over later rules. After implementing these
rules and remaking &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f'&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt;,
we get the following visualizations:

    sway&gt; f . toString();
    STRING: 3x + -5
    sway&gt; f' . toString();
    STRING: 3 + 0
    sway&gt; f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; . toString();
    STRING: 0 + 0

Somewhat better. Now we need to improve ''plus'' to throw away constant
terms with a value of zero. We can do this in the main body of the
''plus'' constructor:

# if the first argument is equivalent to zero, have ''plus'' return the second argument
# if the second argument is equivalent to zero, have ''plus'' return the first argument
# otherwise, have ''plus'' return &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt;

Your logic should look like this:

    function plus(p,q)
        {
        ...
        if (p is equivalent to zero)
            {
            q;
            }
        else if (q  is equivalent to zero)
            {
            p;
            }
        else
            {
            this;
            }
        }

How do we determine if an argument to ''plus'' is equivalent to
zero? Since we are representing zero as a term with
a zero coefficient, we could use logic like
this:

    if (p is :term &amp;&amp; p . coefficient == 0)

Now our hack of using a term to represent zero is starting
to raise its ugly head. Our code is becoming non-obvious to
someone who might be reading our code (for maintenance purposes,
perhaps) without benefit of reading this text.  Zero is a constant,
in that it doesn't ever change; zero is always zero.
A term, on the other hand, often changes, depending on the
value of the independent variable. This leads to a cognitive
dissonance that increases the difficulty of understanding
our code.

Let's solve this problem by building a 'constant' constructor.
This constructor will have all the methods of ''term'', but
will better represent a value that never changes. Here  is
an attempt:

    function constant(value)
        {
        function toString() { &quot;&quot; + value; }
        function diff() { ... }
        function y(x) { ... }
        this;
        }

The implementations of ''diff'' and ''y'' are left as an exercise and should
implement the following logic:

*  the differential of a constant is a constant zero
*  the y value of a constant is always the value of the constant, regardless of the value of the independent variable

Now, we can test for a zero object in plus like this:

    if (p is :constant &amp;&amp; p . value == 0)

See how this code is much more understandable.
We now update our diff method in term to take advantage
of our new ''constant'' constructor.

    function term(coefficient,exponent)
        {
        ...
        function diff()
            {
            if (n == 0)
                {
                constant(0);
                }
            else
                {
                term(a * n,n - 1);
                }
            }
        ...
        this;
        }

With these changes and after remaking
&lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f'&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
with the new versions of ''plus'', ''term'' and ''constant'',
we get the following visualizations:

    sway&gt; f . toString();
    STRING: 3x + -5
    sway&gt; f' . toString();
    STRING: 3
    sway&gt; f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; . toString();
    STRING: 0

Much better.

==Successive Differentiations of Complex Polynomials==

It's rather uneventful to repeatedly differentiate a line.
Higher-order polynomials&lt;ref&gt;
The higher the order of a polynomial, the larger the largest
exponent in the terms making up the polynomial.
&lt;/ref&gt; are a little more interesting.
Rather than build up a high order polynomial of many terms
piece by piece, as in:

    var a = term(1,0);
    var b = plus(term(2,1),a);
    var c = plus(term(3,2),b);
    var y = plus(term(4,3),c);

We can build it up ''en masse'':

    var y = plus(term(4,3),plus(term(3,2),plus(term(2,1),term(1,0))));

or since this whole scale building can be hard to read, build
''y'' using infix operator syntax:

    var y = term(4,3) plus term(3,2) plus term(2,1) plus term(1,0);

No matter how you make ''y'' (it's all a matter of preference), we
can differentiate it successively:

    var y' = y . diff();
    var y&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; = y' . diff();
    var y&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; = y&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; . diff();
    
    sway&gt; y . toString();
    STRING: 4x^3 + 3^x2 + 2x + 1
    sway&gt; y' . toString();
    STRING: 12x^2 + 6^x + 2
    sway&gt; y&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; . toString();
    STRING: 24x + 6
    sway&gt; y&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; . toString();
    STRING: 24

To check numerically,
let's evaluate y&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; at x = 1 and 2.

    sway&gt; y&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; . value(1);
    INTEGER: 30
    sway&gt; y&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; . value(2);
    INTEGER: 54

The object y&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; should represent the constant 24:

    sway&gt; y&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; . value(1);
    INTEGER: 24
    sway&gt; y&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; . value(2);
    INTEGER: 24

Everything looks good.

==Questions==

'''1'''.
Justify mathematically each of the simplifying visualization rules for a term.

'''2'''.
Add simplification to the ''minus'' constructor. The simplification is 
similar to ''plus'' but is a tiny bit trickier.

'''3'''.
Add simplification to the ''times'' constructor. You should return constant
zero if either argument is zero and
if one of the arguments is constant one, return
the other. Otherwise, return ''this''.

'''4'''.
Add simplification to the ''div'' constructor.
You should return constant zero if the numerator (the first argument)
is constant zero.
You should return the numerator if the denominator (the second argument)
is constant one.
Otherwise, you should return ''this''.

'''5'''.
Represent and plot
&lt;math&gt; y = 2x^2 &lt;/math&gt; in sway using ''gnuplot''.
What is
&lt;math&gt; dy/dx &lt;/math&gt;?
Plot it versus ''x''.
What does it represent? 
What is
&lt;math&gt; d^2y/dx^2 &lt;/math&gt;?
Plot it versus ''x''.
What does it represent?
What
is &lt;math&gt; d^3y/dx^3 &lt;/math&gt;? Plot it versus ''x''.

'''6'''.
Use both sway or pencil and paper to do 1-3 on p. 82.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''One need not hope in order to undertake, nor succeed in order to persevere.-William the Silent''
==Origins of the Revolt==

[[Image:19- Rei D. Filipe I - O Prudente.jpg|thumb|right|Philip II]]

===Religion=== 
During the 16th century, Protestantism rapidly gained ground in the Dutch Provinces. Initially the Spanish repressed the Protestants, but eventually the local officials tolerated them. At the time the Protestants only formed a minority.

===Taxation===
The Dutch provinces were always a very wealthy region. Under Charles V the Habsburg empire became a worldwide empire with large American and European territories. Due to the wealth of the Dutch, they were taxed heavily, to defend the Habsburg possessions in Europe.

===Philip II===
In 1566, Philip II became the King of Spain. Charles, despite his harsh actions, had been seen as a ruler empathetic to the needs of the Netherlands. As soon as Philip became King, he began to suppress Protestantism by sending Spanish Troops, and imposing heavy taxes onto the Dutch. In an effort to build a stable and trustworthy government in the Netherlands, Philip appointed several members of the high nobility of the Netherlands to the States General, the governing body of the seventeen Netherlands. However already in 1558 the states started to contradict Philip’s wishes, by objecting to his tax proposals and demanding the withdrawal of Spanish troops. Petitions to King Philip by the high nobility went unanswered.

==The Revolt Begins==
Early in August of 1566, a mob stormed the church of Hondschoote in Flanders (now in Northern France). This relatively small incident spread North and led to a massive iconoclastic movement by Calvinists, who stormed churches and other religious buildings to desecrate and destroy statues and images of Catholic saints all over the Netherlands. The Calvinists said that they were idols. As the nobles began to turn against Spain, Philip realized he had lost control of the Dutch. On August 22, 1567, Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, marched into Brussels with 10,000 troops. 

Alba took terrible measures against the Dutch and quickly established his own court.  Over one thousand people were executed in the following months, even nobles who tolerated Protestantism were not safe. The large number of executions led the court to be nicknamed the &quot;Blood Court&quot; in the Netherlands, and Alba to be called the &quot;iron duke&quot;. Rather than pacifying the Netherlands, these measures helped to fuel the unrest.

===William of Orange===

[[Image:WilliamOfOrange1580.jpg|left|thumb|250px|William the Silent]]

William I of Orange, also known as William the Silent, was Stadtholder of the provinces of Holland, Zeeland and Utrecht, and Margrave of Antwerp; and one of the most influential nobles in the States General. After the arrival of Alba he was forced to flee, and his lands were forfeited to the Spanish king. 

However, he returned in 1568, and attempted to drive Alba out of Brussels. William said he remained loyal to Philip, but thought Alba was a misguided minister. Though the campaign ended in failure, it saw a Dutch Victory at Battle of Heiligerlee before William's army ran out of money.

William would continue to be the leader of the revolt for the remainder of his life. Today, he is still remembered in the Netherlands, as ''&quot;Vader des Vaderlands&quot;'' which in English means ''&quot;Father of the Fatherland&quot;''.

===Another Uprising===

By 1570 the Spanish had more or less suppressed the rebellion throughout the Netherlands. It was also a year of disaster. On All Saints Day a big storm hit the low lieing areas of the coast of Zeeland and Holland. It wiped away most of the dykes and killed thousands. This flood stands out as one of the more severe ones in the long litany of such events in the country's history.

There was little help from the authorities. On the contrary, in an attempt to finance the Spanish Army against the Ottoman Empire, Alba proposed the &quot;Tenth Penny&quot;, a 10 per cent levy on all sales other than landed property. At first it was rejected by the States, but soon after a compromise was agreed upon.  in 1571, Alba decided to press forward with the collection of the Tenth Penny regardless of the States' opposition. Catholics and Protestants protested together against this Tenth Penny, in vain. A band of ''Geuzen'', licensed pirates, led mostly by dispossessed members of the lower gentry that had lost their welcome in English ports, attacked and captured the coastal town of Brill on April first 1572. They were welcomed as heroes, particularly by the Protestants. Members of the Catholic clergy did not fare as well. To give their exploits an aura of respectability the pirates decided to declare themselves 'for the prince', referring to the Prince of Orange who had tried to inspire rebellion from his exile in Dillenburg in Germany. This was the first permanent foothold for the Dutch in the War. 

It would have been a relatively unimportant event if most of the important cities in the provinces of Holland and Zeeland had not declare loyalty to the prince as well, often prodded by their own population's rallies. Notable exceptions were Amsterdam and Middelburg, which would remain loyal to the Catholic cause until 1578. William the Silent was put at the head of the revolt. He was recognized as Governor-General and Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Friesland and Utrecht. In an attempt to encourage the people to revolt against Spain, William converted to Calvinism, as the Calvinists wanted above all other religions, to revolt.

===The response===
The rebellion was still limited to what, in the Burgundian-Habsburg Netherlands, were considered provinces of lesser importance. The rich provinces of Flanders and Brabant, with their ports and textile industry, remained quiet. This allowed the Spanish to attempt to quell the new rebellion. This proved a tedious and expensive process in the marshy lowlands. Naarden fell and its population was decimated. Haarlem underwent a long and horrible siege and its fall cut the rebels' territory in half. In 1573, Alba attempted to take the city of Alkmaar to the north, but he failed.  Leyden to the south also withstood the Spanish onslaught. The ''Geuzen'' pierced the dykes to flood the Spanish troops' positions and finished them off in flat-bottom boats.

===Bankruptcy===
Alba's failure caused him to be replaced by Luis de Requesens, because his failing policies meant a considerable strain on the Spanish finances. De Requesens, however, did not manage to broker a policy acceptable to both the Spanish king and the Netherlands when he died in early 1576. Spain was forced to declare bankruptcy and the Spanish troops, angered and unpaid, sacked Antwerp, leaving some 8,000 dead. 

This pierced the heart of the body politic. The rich merchants of Antwerp who had politely refused to take any political action so far did not like marauding soldiers invading their houses. They used their influence to do what the absentee king least of all wanted: they insisted upon the convening of the parliament, the States General.

The States General convened and decided to do what they had always refused to do for the king: they raised enough money to buy off the marauding troops. Their efforts reunited the provinces in what is known as the Pacification of Ghent. This meant that the other 14 provinces besides Holland, Zeeland and Utrecht were now de facto part of the rebellion because -whether intentional or not-  the mercenaries were now in ''their'' service rather than the king's. The king was furious because losing control to the parliament was the last thing he wanted.

He sent an ultimatum to submit to his control immediately and a fresh army from Spain to underline his resolve.

==Independence and Partition==
On January 6, 1579, prompted by the new Spanish governor Alexander Farnese and upset by the aggressive Calvinism of the Northern States, some of the Southern States, the so-called Walloon Flanders located in what is now France and Wallonia, signed the Union of Arras, expressing their loyalty to the Spanish king.  

In response to the treaty, William united the northern states of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders and the province of Groningen in the Union of Utrecht on January 23, 1579. Other southern cities like Bruges, Ghent, Brussels and Antwerp joined the Union of Utrecht. The 17 provinces of the Netherlands were now divided and this partition into what is now the Netherlands and Belgium would prove permanent, despite a brief and emphatically unsuccessful attempt at reunification from 1814-1831.

===The leadership question===

William of Orange, was declared an outlaw by Philip II in March 1580. Four years later he was assassinated by Balthasar Gérard, a Catholic and supporter of the Spanish King, on July 10, 1584. Gérard was later tortured to death. William's dying words were &quot;Oh my God, have mercy on this poor people&quot;. William would be succeeded as leader of the rebellion by his son Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, but the question about the political structure and the leadership of the rebellious Union remained unsettled for a long time

In the late 16th century, it was not conceivable that a country could be governed by anyone but high nobility, if not a king, so the States General tried to find a suitable replacement for Philip. They asked Queen Elizabeth of England, but she declined the offer. On July 26, 1581 the Oath of Abjuration was issued, in which the Netherlands proclaimed that the King of Spain had not upheld his responsibilities to the Netherlands population and would therefore no longer be accepted as rightful king. A few years later, in 1585, Elizabeth agreed to aid the Dutch, but as no one would be their king, the rebellious provinces decided for a rather unlikely option at the time: they became a republic: the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. Many nations recognized the fledgling country shortly after, including France and England. 

===Spain's response. Capitalist beginnings===

[[Image:Plakkaat van Verlatinghe.jpg|thumb|250px|The Oath of Abjuration]]

Immediately after the oath of abjuration, Spain sent a new army to recapture the Dutch Republic and a process of reconquest began, concentrating on the 'important' provinces like the cities of Flanders. Ghent fell and all of its Protestants fled north. This process led to the expulsion of an estimated 10-15% of the population of the South  who would flee to the North, often the more elite part of the population.

In 1585 the Spanish succeeded in capturing Antwerp. They may have believed they had won the war with that, but they allowed most of the merchants to leave, not realizing that without the people who made the trade work all they conquered were brick and stone. The merchants soon set up shop in Amsterdam. Meanwhile Spain had gained control over Portugal and what had been the major port for colonial goods: Lisbon. The merchants of the rebellious Netherlands therefore had no choice but to find ways to acquire the precious spices themselves as they were no longer welcome in Lisbon. They cooperated to raise enough capital for such a risky venture. To do so they developed instruments like shareholdership and insurance. The result was that the rebellious provinces rapidly developed into a merchant dominated oligarchy driven by colonial enterprise based on capitalist -rather than government controlled- principles. All colonies until 1795 would be strictly under control of the VOC or WIC companies. Dutch colonial enterprise was very profitable and quickly made it financially impossible for the Spanish to reconquer the lost provinces, although they would persist until 1648 in trying. However the Dutch model of colonial enterprise also had its drawbacks. Many decisions were strictly based on short-term bottom-line considerations. For example, when Mauritius -unsettled until the Dutch took it- suffered damage from a typhoon the island was simply abandoned because the leadership of the VOC did not deem it profitable to restore the damage. Few on the island speak Dutch today.

==International involvement==

Both England and France had followed the developments in the Netherlands with a keen eye. After all Spain was the sole superpower of its day, but one that seemed rather mired in Dutch peat and clay.

After finding out about English support for the Dutch in 1588, Philip ordered the Spanish Armada to invade England, the mission failed and the Spanish navy was crippled. Under financial and military pressure, in 1598, Philip ceded the Netherlands to his favorite daughter Isabella and to her husband, his nephew Archduke Albert of Austria.

Around this time, Maurice, son of William, launched a number of campaigns and over the next 12 years captured the cities of  Breda (1590), Zutphen, Deventer, Delfzijl and Nijmegen (1591), Steenwijk, Coevorden (1592) Geertruidenberg (1593) Groningen (1594) Grol, Enschede, Ootmarsum, Oldenzaal (1597) and Grave (1602). It was during this time when the fighting had left the heart of the republic, that the Dutch advanced into their Golden Age. 

After a decisive Dutch victory at the Battle of Gibraltar, Spain and the Dutch Republic agreed to a ceasefire. This resulted in the 12 Years Truce.

==12 Years Truce==
1609 saw the start of a ceasefire, afterwards called the Twelve Years' Truce, between the United Provinces and the Spanish controlled southern states, mediated by France and England at The Hague. It was during this ceasefire the Dutch made great efforts to build their navy, which was later to have a crucial bearing on the course of the war.

Negotiations for a permanent peace went on throughout the truce. Two major issues could not be resolved. First, the Spanish demand for religious freedom of Catholics in the northern Netherlands was countered by a Dutch demand for a similar religious freedom for Protestants in the southern Netherlands. Second, there was a growing disagreement over the trade routes to the different colonies which could not be resolved.

==War Breaks Out Again==

[[Image:Piet Hein.jpg|thumb|250px|Piet Pieterszoon Hein]]

In 1622, a Spanish attack on the important fortress town of Bergen op Zoom was repelled, but the countries were at war again. This part of the war would be a part of the more extensive Thirty-Years War. In 1625 the Spanish laid siege to the city of Breda, and Maurice died during the siege. After the English failed to relieve the siege, the city was surrendered to the Spanish. 

Despite this major victory, the Spanish would face a string of losses, including the Dutch capture of the cities of Groenlo, and Hertogenbosch.   The Dutch, led by Piet Pieterszoon Hein, captured a Spanish treasure fleet off the coast of present day Cuba. 

As more European countries began to build their empires, the war between the countries extended to colonies as well. Battles for profitable colonies were fought as far away as Macau, East Indies, Ceylon, Formosa (Taiwan), the Philippines, Brazil, and others. The most important of these conflicts would become known as the Dutch-Portuguese War. The Dutch carved out a trading empire all over the world, using their dominance at sea to great advantage.

===Spain's Decline at Sea===

In 1639, Spain sent an armada bound for Flanders, carrying 20,000 troops in a last attempt to end what they still thought was a &quot;Revolt&quot;. The armada was defeated by Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp in the Battle of the Downs. This battle was so crushing to the Spanish naval power, it would never fully recover.

==Peace==
On January 30, 1648, the war ended with the Treaty of Münster between Spain and the Dutch Republic. In the treaty, Spain agreed to recognize Dutch Independence, and finally, after an 80 year struggle, the Dutch Republic was an independent country, recognized by all. 

The treaty also confirmed that the new republic was formally independent from the Holy Roman Empire. This was a mere formality because a century before Charles V, both lord of the Netherlands and Emperor, had created the Netherlands as a separate entity in what is known as the Pragmatic Sanction. The 17 provinces were to be inherited together and had their own parliament, not subservient to the German Diet. To squeeze some more money out of the provinces, Charles had insisted that they pay a yearly sum of money to 'the emperor' (himself) in exchange for 'his protection', but that summed up what little relationships left with the Empire. A century later, in 1648, the Empire was little more than a rubble heap and the Republic the richest state in Europe. The Emperor knew that he needed to drop all expensive pretenses, if even Spain needed to.

The relations between Spain and the Republic would quickly improve and a few years later they were allies, particularly against French aspirations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Importing meshes/models across 3D modelling platforms is sometimes necessary in order for the creator to import their assets into Trainz or make use of various features available in different programs (e.g. bump mapping - not available in Gmax). 

Various methods have been devised to move models across from one piece of software to another, but there is currently no program available to directly convert from one file format to another. Due to the nature of importing meshes from one program to another, some methods involve loss of detail, loss of texturing or loss of animation.

== 3DS Max&gt;Gmax via .3ds ==

== 3DS Max&gt;Gmax or 3DS Max&gt;3DS Max via BFF Exporter ==

For users of 3DS Max v.7,8,9,2008,2009, the current lack of Trainz exporter has forced the use of a particularly useful freeware tool involving MaxScript to export and import between 3DS Max and Gmax freely. The BFF exporter and instructions are available at http://www.scriptspot.com/bobo/darkmoon/bff/ and although still in development allows complete transferability (minus animation) between two programs.

Can this material really call itself a textbook?  I agree it could be useful, but I don't think it is a textbook.  Seems like [http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata.html RFC Errata] is a more suitable home for this material.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 06:40, 1 April 2008 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol opinion vote.svg|15px]] '''FYI:''' this has survived a [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion/Archive_7#Errata|previous VFD]]. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:38, 2 April 2008 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' I think this nomination was made in error. The book subject is a bit confusing, the wikibook proposes to be a repository to any other book (not Wikibooks since they can be edited) erratas, this is indeed a useful and has great potential to be a community building idea, if it was somehow more publicly known. As it is It doesn't violate the definition of Wikibook but unfortunately seems a bit empty and unused, but still has great potential. In any case deletion shouldn't be considered a positive outcome for this state of things...
:Why not give this &quot;repository&quot; a greater visibility on Wikibooks, since there is no single subject or degree of conclusion can be attributed to it?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:47, 4 April 2008 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' - This is really ''not'' a textbook. It is a collection of notes about other textbooks. Since those other books aren't fiction, it's difficult to see this as an annotated text. It has no central narrative which tries to teach the reader about some topic. Rather, it's a resource that sits alongside a [[wikt:|dictionary, a thesaurus]], a [[w:Bescherelle|Bescherelle]], or an atlas; none of which are suitable for Wikibooks. Reading Rob Horning's comments from the first VFD are illuminating - he suggests that this is an attempt to use Wikibooks as an [[WB:INCUBATOR|incubator for a new project]] or [[WB:HOST|webhost]], which are expressly forbidden. Finally, the [[User:Chinasaur|main author]] seems to agree that it's not a real textbook, and it was more or less decided that a new home should be found for this project at Wikicities, which hasn't happened in the intervening years (to my knowledge). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:13, 6 April 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' It could be argued that it [''[[Real Book Errata]]''] has a &quot;bad&quot; title, almost an implication that Wikibooks (or other formats) aren't real books.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:20, 4 April 2008 (UTC)

:{{vd}} as sort of general interest, this [[Errata]] book is very old, it's been here since before I even joined. I do know that Wikibooks has changed a lot since this book was created, and it has definitely changed around here since last time this one was nominated for deletion. Unfortunately this book, historic as it may be, just isn't a good fit here at Wikibooks anymore. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:12, 11 April 2008 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' I agree with [[User:Whiteknight]] that the book as it is may not conform to what we now tend to expect form a Wikibook but it also doesn't violate the policy that guides us about it, furthermore if well worked it can be one of those works that can bring new users to Wikibook. Most of the keep reasons are still valid (from the previous discussion). A merge of the two pages should be made and it seems [[User:Mike.lifeguard]] offered to do it... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:36, 20 April 2008 (UTC)
::I suppose it might also attract new users if we became [[w:DMOZ|a link repository]], or if we allowed encyclopedia articles... &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:48, 20 April 2008 (UTC)
:::That is against policy and it does not generate useful content is there any other wikimedia project were this work would fit best?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:26, 20 April 2008 (UTC)
:::The point here is that this book is not a text book as we tend to define them here at least it doesn't have the objective of teaching something we can say it almost fits the annotation definition. It has a clear scope and is provides a useful service, another useful trait is that we would only have to support this one book (there will not be a need to create other similar books), and it can even be useful inside Wikibooks as a repository for major changes made to fixed version of other Wikibooks... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:38, 20 April 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki'''- Erratas seem to be acceptable content on Wikiversity. FYI &quot;[[w:Real Book|Real Book]]&quot; is a reference to a series of transcripts created by students at Berklee College of Music during the 1970s. So presumably that book is intended to list errors in the transcripts, while the other is a more general listing of errors in books. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:56, 20 April 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''- I don't understand how anyone would think that ''[http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata.html RFC Errata] is a more suitable home for this material.''
:Isn't that site only for RFC errata?
:The Errata wikibook currently does not have any RFC errata.
:I am mystified by the comment ''&quot;Since those other books aren't fiction, it's difficult to see this as an annotated text.&quot;''
:The current Wikibooks definition of &quot;annotated text&quot; doesn't mention this &quot;fiction&quot; requirement. Many annotated texts, used in university classes, discuss books that aren't fiction -- books that are considered &quot;the Gospel truth&quot;.
:I wouldn't mind a transwiki to Wikiversity. However, I suspect Wikibooks is more appropriate than Wikiversity.
:While Errata isn't a typical textbook, it looks more like a &quot;textbook&quot; than a &quot;class&quot; to me, and Wikiversity is more focused on &quot;classes&quot;, while Wikibooks is more focused on &quot;textbooks&quot;.  --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 00:46, 21 April 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''- I think Errata is great idea.
:I can easily see any one part of it printed out and used in a classroom -- a classroom that uses the particular book discussed by that part as a textbook -- and so I think it falls under the ''&quot;materials can be used in a traditional classroom&quot;'' and ''&quot;annotated text&quot;'' parts of the [[WB:WIW]] policy.
:If you want to delete it, please tell me a more appropriate place for this content.
:You may be able to convince me that certain books currently in the Errata wikibook would never be used as textbooks, and so errata for those books fails the ''&quot;materials can be used in a traditional classroom&quot;'' criteria -- but I still think errata for books that *are* used as textbooks should still be kept here at Wikibooks.  --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 00:46, 21 April 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''- Apologies the RFC Errata reference was my mistake I didn't look closely enough at that website.  I still however have an issue with calling this a textbook.  It currently contains errata for approximately 30 books.  Ranging from a one line comment on The Martians, paperback 1996 (fiction) (which I think anyone would struggle to call an anotation as such) to an external link for the book The C Programming Language, 2nd edition, hardback.  Who is going to look in  this book to try and find an Errata?  OK so I guess it is a work in progres, but if we imagine it with 1000s of books in it definitely becomes a project in it's own right with to wide a breadth to call itself a textbook.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 06:59, 21 April 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''. I've created a wiki for Errata at http://errata.wikidot.com/ and I've copied my entries there, and have since put in new entries. It's licensed under the CC ShareAlike 3.0 License, and since the GFDL and CC is not yet compatible I've only copied my own edits there, not the other wikibooks GFDL edits - other Errata editors are welcome to copy their edits there. -- [[User:Jeandré du Toit|Jeandré]], 2008-04-27[[User talk:Jeandré du Toit|t]]11:50z

=Center Game=

In the Center Game, White is happy with himself for knocking out black's only foothold in the center square, e5.  At the time, all four central squares are controlled by white.  This may seem like a huge advantage for white, but if black simply plays Nc6, the queen is forced to move.

Usually black responds to the center game by playing [[/3...Nc6/]] forcing white's queen to leave its central outpost.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ABOUT ME?
I am a 21 year old from Halifax County, VA. I am currently working toward my Bachelor's of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies with a Concentration in PreK-6 degree. I am in a wheelchair and have been most of my life because I was born with Spina Bifida. If anyone wants to know about that, I would be more than happy to talk about the parts I know about with you. I also collect keychains and hope to one day have one from every state as well as as many of the countries as possible. I have already gotten one from Japan and Australia. I want to teach somewhere in the neighborhood of K-2, however I am getting a degree through 6. I think my preference is second grade. They seem to know a lot already and can take care of the basic things they need, but they still don't know quite enough to hinder your efforts to teach effectively.

I am looking forward to teaching in the public school system in my county. I think every child deserves a great education and a teacher that can give them that. I had great teachers all through school and continue to have them in school. Students with special needs to be handled as they are just like everyone else. They do not to feel like they are an outcast in a group of their peers. I don't think that just because they need special accomendations they should be looked upon as adding extra work for the teacher. Some teachers look at it this way, but I feel this is wrong. They can't help the way they are, and they should not be treated as if they brought it on themselves. In addition to not treating special needs kids differently, I also do not see the point in separating kids based on gender or ability. In doing this, I think that it is sending a negative message to the groups saying, &quot;You are better/worse than the others.&quot;. There is already too much competition in schools today with all the programs that have been created for gifted kids. Why add to the competitions by taking the grouping another step further to boys in one group and girls in another. 

As for the ways I will go about teaching, I don't think I can really tell right now. I will try to do both lecture and group activities. I know at young ages a teacher has to keep on his/her toes just so the students don't get bored or off topic. However, because of SOL requirements the students will have to stay on the same requirements. It sounds a little dull, but because everyone must pass the test, it essential for everyone to be on the same page.

Since doing my observation, I have come to have a whole new idea of what classrooms should look like. When I was in school, all that was basically on the wall was the alphabet and maybe a few pictures that they teacher had found that were cartoons. I see now that the teachers have come a long way with the creativity of decorating a classroom. For my personal classroom, I want to be fun and exciting. I want it to be a place that the children look forward to coming to everyday. I am going to post up a word wall that has all the words we have studied from each subject. I am going to post up a number line that has how many days it has been since school started. It will have the odd numbers one color and the even ones another. I will have place where I can post when everyone's birthday is and try to have something on each of their birthdays. I want the parents to have as much involvement as possible. I will invite them into the classroom when every they want to come. I will also invite them to participate in what their child is learning, and maybe even assist a day or so. I will also have a chart that monitors the children's behavior. I want each student to take an active part in each day. I am going to have jobs for the students to do that not only teaches them responsibility but teachs them how to be a part of a group. I also want to have reward system set up that will encourage the children to do their very best and to maintain good behavior. This is where that chart I described comes into play.

I want the students to use technology in a way that is most effective for their level, as well as for what we are studying. I will have a time where the students go to the computer lab and learn how to use the computers, while at the same time the computers are teaching right along with what they are learning in the classroom.

I plan to test the children weekly to see what they know. I will also try to set up science activities to see how they can apply what they have learned. 

I will try to give as little homework as possible. I know everything can't possibly be covered in a day, but I feel like the time the students have at home is just as valuable as the time they have at school. It is very stressful on the students with the SOL, and they need a break.</text>

I have to totaly agree that SOL testing is not what it is cracked up to be. Properly following the SOL only as a guide line of what to be taught is wonderful, this allows us only expand on top of it. Proper reinforcement, remediation, and review is where we will actually win the children over. Once we have them, the wheels of learning has then only begun to roll. 

I also comend you for being such a brave, courageous, and heart-felt person. Someone as fearless as you with the drive and passion will only better Halifax Co. I all to well know since I reside in Mecklenburg Co., both a rural area of Virginia that gets little help when needed.

I totally admire your courage and your determination.  While most people would have probably given up by now, you have no signs of trying to do anything of the sorts and I believe your disability is truly giving you more strength and power than most without disability possess.  I honor your bravery and strength.  I truly am touch by the love in your heart.  I believe you are going to make some school happy.  You are really going to make a great teacher as well as mentor.  The children you get in your class will definitely be privileged.  I can only hope my children end up with a teacher who shares your spirit.  I agree with you on SOL testing, I feel that as long as the kids know what you taught them throughout the year and the parents (the ones who pay attention), really can see a progress, there shouldn't be a SOL test.  The quizzes and test the teacher gives should be enough evidence to show how far the child has come.  [[User:Pperk002|Pperk002]] ([[User talk:Pperk002|talk]]) 05:14, 31 May 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/99.246.118.193|99.246.118.193]] ([[User talk:99.246.118.193|talk]]) to last version by Recent Runes</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===Chapter 1===
The novel begins in a bleak building known as the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, where standardized fetuses are grown on in bottles on an assembly line. The Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning (D.H.C.) conducts a tour of students, explaining the process and why it is done. A [[../Castes|caste]] system is mentioned but not thoroughly explained.

===Chapter 2===
The D.H.C. and his students continue to the Infant Nurseries and Neo-Pavlovian Conditioning Rooms, where infants are [[w:Classical conditioning|conditioned]] and children are indoctrinated through [[w:Sleep-learning|hypnopaedia]]. Christianity seems to have been replaced by a worship of &quot;Our Ford&quot;, and the cross has been replaced by a &quot;T&quot; (as in Ford's [[w:Ford Model T|Model T]]).

===Chapter 3===
There are multiple settings in this chapter. The first is a continuation of the tour of students, now under the supervision of Mustapha Mond, one of the ten World Controllers. He explained how promiscuity and self-pleasuring were considered immoral, instead of obligations to society that were encouraged. Meanwhile, two women, Fanny and Lenina discussed the fact that Lenina had been dating only Henry Foster for four months. In a third scene, Henry attempts to give Bernard Marx some [[../soma/]], a drug described as &quot;Euphoric, narcotic, [and] pleasantly hallucinant.&quot; The reader learns that Bernard had invited Lenina to a &quot;savage&quot; (Native America) reservation, a fact that will be important later in the book.

===Chapter 4===
When Lenina takes Bernard up publicly on his offer to go to a Savage reservation, Bernard acts embarrassed because she says, &quot;That is, if you still want to have me.&quot; When Lenina leaves, Benito Hoover, too, offers Bernard ''soma''.

Bernard, ruminating on his feeling like an outcast and his un-Alpha-like physical inadequacy, visits Helmholtz Watson, who shares his feeling that something is wrong with society.

===Chapter 5===
While Henry and Lenina are flying to a cabaret, they discuss death as if it were a mundane concept. Lenina is puzzled when Henry reminds her that humans of all castes are physico-chemically equal - phosphorus collected from burning an Alpha's body is just as useful as the phosphorus from an Epsilon.

Bernard Marx attends a Solidarity Service, which is an orgy of sex and ''soma'' dedicated to Ford.

===Chapter 6===
Lenina, despite her discomfort with Bernard's preference for individualism, goes with him to the Savage reservation. When Bernard goes to the Director to finalize the authorization for the trip, the Director accidentally lets out that he fell in love with a girl, who died on a trip to the Reservation. The director, hearing of Bernard's strange behavior, threatens to send him to Iceland. Once in New Mexico, Bernard calls his friend Helmholtz Watson, who tells him that the Director's threat was genuine. Bernard, feeling appalled and fearful, takes two grammes of ''soma''.

===Chapter 7===
Bernard and Lenina watch a religious ceremony that combines Christianity and Native beliefs, but are surprised when they see a white man named John. It turns out that John was the son of the Director. John's mother Linda, who was lost to &quot;civilization&quot;, also lived on the native reservation.

===Chapter 8===
John describes to Bernard how in his childhood, he was shunned by the community for being white and having a promiscuous mother. To cope with his suffering, John reads Shakespeare ravenously. Bernard, knowing who John's father is, decides to bring John and Linda back to London.

===Chapter 9===
Bernard gets permission from officials to bring Linda and John back to London. Meanwhile, Lenina is still in New Mexico, on a ''soma''-induced trip. John breaks into her room, and considers touching her, but decides not to.

===Chapter 10===
Bernard shows the Director Linda and John, promptly leading him to resign.

===Chapter 11===
John becomes the center of attention, and Bernard, riding on his [[w:Coattail effect|coattails]], becomes popular and arrogant. John &quot;the Savage&quot; goes with Lenina to a &quot;feelie&quot;, hoping that John would enjoy it and later have sex with her. Yet afterwards, he tells her she shouldn't see such &quot;ignoble&quot; films, and leaves her empty-handed.

===Chapter 12===
When John does not attend an event that Bernard hosts, the guests lose courtesy for Bernard. The only friends that Bernard has left are John and Helmholtz. When the two meet, though, they become closer friends to each other than to Bernard, and constantly read Shakespeare. When John reads &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, he imagines himself as Romeo and Lenina as Juliet. Helmholtz laughs hysterically at the idea of people having parents, and of those parents forcing her to marry someone she didn't want.

===Chapter 13===
John opens the door, expecting to see Helmholtz, but instead sees Lenina. Although the two of them are attracted to each other, and Lenina had taken half a gram of ''soma'' in advance to prepare herself, the vast difference in their personalities leads to a conflict. In the middle of it, John gets a phone call telling him that his mother is sick.

===Chapter 14===
John goes to visit his mother, who is dying and semi-conscious in a hospital of an improperly happy atmosphere. Linda soon dies, and John panics.

===Chapter 15===
Bernard and Helmholtz, hearing of John's actions, quickly rush to the hospital, where over 150 Deltas are waiting in line for their ''soma''. John disrupts this process by throwing the soma away, with the help of Helmholtz (Bernard fearfully dithers between helping and not helping). In the end, the police get involved, and the three of them are arrested.

===Chapter 16===
Instead of being sent to jail, though, the three end up in one of Mustapha Mond's rooms. Mond explains to them the stability of society, and that Bernard and Helmholtz, like other individualists, will be sent to live on islands.

===Chapter 17===
With Bernard and Helmholtz out of the room, John and Mustapha have a learned discussion on religion and suffering. In short, John &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;[claims] the right to be unhappy.&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

===Chapter 18===
Although John does not go to an island, he still isolates himself by living in a lighthouse. He also whips himself in an effort to cleanse himself. Unfortunately, people notice him, and soon treat him like an animal to be gawked at. Eventually, Lenina arrives, and the onlookers start an orgy. John, shamed by the sight of Lenina, hangs himself.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 1em; line-height: 1em&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

== Example ==
&lt;h3&gt;Prep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;&quot;&gt;

First, you need to make a page that lists your contents.  In this example we use: [[User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Contents Block/doc/SampleContents]], but normally you would have some form of transclusion and category automatically generate the list.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;&quot;&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Contents Block
|title='''''What's Inside'''''
|contents=User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Contents Block/doc/SampleContents
|clear=yes please
}}&lt;/pre&gt;
''note that the content tag is actually space- and case-sensitive!''

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Output&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;&quot;&gt;

{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Contents Block
|title='''''What's Inside'''''
|contents=User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Contents Block/doc/SampleContents
|clear=yes please
}}

&lt;/div&gt;

The Dutch Golden Age was an age of wealth and prosperity in the Dutch Republic roughly from 1590-1715. Along with wealth, Dutch trade, science, and art were among the most acclaimed in the world. 

==Wealth==

During a large part of the 17th century the Dutch, traditionally able seafarers and keen mapmakers, dominated world trade, a position which before had been occupied by the Portuguese and Spaniards, and which later would be lost to England. With the VOC dominating trade in Asia, their wealth came into the Netherlands. The Dutch also dominated trade between European countries. The Low Countries were favorably positioned on a crossing of east-west and north-south trade routes and connected to a large German hinterland through the Rhine river. Dutch traders shipped wine from France and Portugal to the Baltic lands and returned with grain destined for countries around the Mediterranean Sea. The Trip brothers, arms traders, built the Trippenhuis in Amsterdam, currently the seat of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, which is a typical example of 17th century architecture.

==Social Structure and Religion==
Dutch society promoted freedom of expression and religious tolerance, with a wide array of religions from atheists to Catholics. There was a large and well-established middle class, and an excellent educational system.
==Science==

==Culture==
As a result of their trade, the Dutch were the wealthiest and most prosperous nation. There was a vast appreciation for the arts, and some of the most famous Baroque artists were Dutch, such as Vermeer, Rembrandt, and Reubens.

&lt;br /&gt;
== Introduction ==
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%; text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper&quot;&gt;

First, let's have an example:

{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Contents Block
|title='''''What's Inside''''' 
|contents=Category:Robbiemuffin book contents
|float=left
|clear=yes please;
}}
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cute little bit of CSS right?  But that's not the cool part, the cool part is, it is generated automagically from [[User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Contents Block/doc/SampleContents]]. So, you just have to maintain the inner list data, in a nice clean page, to generate your contents. If you only ever have one contents list, maybe that's not so important. But if you want to keep one on each Chapter, a nice small one like the above (which will expand quite a bit, by the way), you can do that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you generate the list pages from category tags, you're set, right? Because then you can just add a quick category tag to any new page in the book, and the contents update automatically. That's spiffy. So... how do you do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

== Prep ==
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;&quot;&gt;

First thing's first.  Let's make a category for our book. Add a category tag (something like &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:monospace&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Robbiemuffin book contents]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) to one of your pages.  This way, when the page is refreshed, you'll have a category all made up for you.  Sometimes that takes a minute though, so you might want to pour some wine.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--[[Category:Robbiemuffin book contents]]--&gt;

&lt;!-- end document --&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:3em&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; font-size:0.85em&quot;&gt;''this page was brought to you by an Ajax hacker''&lt;/div&gt;

I suggest merging the book &quot;[[knowledge patterns]]&quot; into the chapter &quot;[[Lore of Learning/Patterns of Learning]]&quot;.

To me, the title &quot;knowledge patterns&quot; sounds like about the same thing as &quot;patterns of learning&quot;.

Please feel free to educate me on the difference between &quot;knowledge patterns&quot; vs. &quot;patterns of learning&quot;.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 03:59, 15 May 2008 (UTC)

 Hi David,
 Thanks again for your interest :-).
 &quot;Knowledge patterns&quot; is about use of patterns in different disciplines
 towards a general approach of facilitating/catalysing learning across disciplines.
 It is closer to the structure of the knowlege than to patterns of learning,
 though ultimately it will hopefully become a useful resource to facilitate
 learning across disciplines.  
 So, your suggestion has merit. Perhaps, in Lore of Learning, we should start a 
 volume/series on field/discipline-specific praxis and orientate the writing towards
 the intended conclusion of Knowledge Patterns.
 For now, I will leave Knowledge Patterns as a separate book, and
 revisit this suggestion later when we have more to work with.

''The terms and procedures described here will enable a person to safely operate a 19th or 20th century steam locomotive well into the future.''

Ye gods: not only does this sound arrogant, but bearing in mind just how dangerous steam locomotives can be to the incompetent and anyone unlucky enough to be near them when they demonstrate their incompetence isn't it verging on criminal irresponsibility?

Another popular definition of &quot;integration&quot; was provided by [[w:Darboux|Jean Gaston Darboux]] and is often used in more advanced texts. In this chapter, we will define the Darboux integral, and demonstrate the equivalence of Riemann and Darboux integrals.

==Upper and Lower Sums==
===Definition===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; be a (finite) partition of &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;


For every &lt;math&gt;x_i\in\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; define: 

&lt;math&gt;m_i\dot{=}\inf \{f(x)|x\in [x_{i-1},x_i]\}&lt;/math&gt; and 

&lt;math&gt;M_i\dot{=}\sup \{f(x)|x\in [x_{i-1},x_i]\}&lt;/math&gt;


The '''Upper Sum''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;U(f,\mathcal{P})=\sum_{i=1}^n M_i(x_i-x_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt; 

The '''Lower Sum''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;L(f,\mathcal{P})=\sum_{i=1}^n m_i(x_i-x_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;

===Definition===
A partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}^*&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''Refinement''' for a given partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}\subset\mathcal{P}^*&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; be a partition and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}^*&lt;/math&gt; be a refinement of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, 

(i) &lt;math&gt;L(f,\mathcal{P})&lt;L(f,\mathcal{P}^*)&lt;/math&gt;

(ii) &lt;math&gt;U(f,\mathcal{P})&gt;U(f,\mathcal{P}^*)&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
Let &lt;math&gt;x_i,x_{i-1}\in\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;x^*\in\mathcal{P}^*\setminus\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; be such that &lt;math&gt;x_{i-1}&lt;x^*&lt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. Also, let &lt;math&gt;m_i=\inf \{f(x)|x\in [x_{i-1},x_i]\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m'_i=\inf \{f(x)|x\in [x_{i-1},x^*]\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m''_i=\inf \{f(x)|x\in [x^*,x_i]\}&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously, &lt;math&gt;m_i(x_i-x_{i-1})&lt;m'_i(x^*-x_{i-1})+m''_i(x_i-x^*)&lt;/math&gt;, but as &lt;math&gt;x_i\in\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary, we have that &lt;math&gt;L(f,\mathcal{P})&lt;L(f,\mathcal{P}^*)&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, we can prove &lt;math&gt;U(f,\mathcal{P})&gt;U(f,\mathcal{P}^*)&lt;/math&gt;

==Darboux Integration==
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''Darboux Integrable''' on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if 

&lt;math&gt;\sup_{\mathcal{P}}L(f,\mathcal{P})=\inf_{\mathcal{P}}U(f,\mathcal{P})&lt;/math&gt;, where the supremum is taken over the &lt;u&gt;Set of all partitions on that interval&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L=\sup_{\mathcal{P}}L(f,\mathcal{P})&lt;/math&gt; is also written as &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f=L&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Darboux integrable over &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;U(f,\mathcal{P})-L(f,\mathcal{P})&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

====Proof====
(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;)Let &lt;math&gt;A=\int_a^b f&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be given. Thus, by Gap Lemma, there exists a partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; such that both &lt;math&gt;U(f,\mathcal{P}),L(f,\mathcal{P})\in V_{\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}(A)&lt;/math&gt;, and hence &lt;math&gt;U(f,\mathcal{P})-L(f,\mathcal{P})&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;)Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0&lt;/math&gt; be any partition on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Observe that &lt;math&gt;L(f,\mathcal{P}_0)&lt;/math&gt; is a lower bound of the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}=\{U(f,\mathcal{P})|\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is any partition&lt;math&gt;\}&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;U(f,\mathcal{P}_0)&lt;/math&gt; is an upper bound of the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}=\{L(f,\mathcal{P})|\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is any partition&lt;math&gt;\}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, let &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\sup\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta=\inf\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;L(f,\mathcal{P})&lt;U(f,\mathcal{P})&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; cannot be true. Also, as &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\beta&lt;/math&gt; are a supremum and infimum respectively, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is also not possible. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\beta=L&lt;/math&gt; (say).

As &lt;math&gt;L=\sup_{\mathcal{P}} L(f,\mathcal{P})=\inf_{\mathcal{P}} U(f,\mathcal{P})&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f=L&lt;/math&gt;

==Equivalence of Riemann and Darboux Integrals==
At first sight, it may appear that the Darboux integral is a special case of the Riemann integral. However, this is illusionary, and indeed the two are equivalent.

===Lemma===
(1) Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be Darboux Integrable, with integral &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;
 
Define function &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon (\delta)=\sup\{|L-S(f,\dot{P})|:\|\dot{P}\|=\delta\}&lt;/math&gt;

(2) Then &lt;math&gt;\delta_1&lt;\delta_2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(\delta_1)&lt;\varepsilon(\delta_2)&lt;/math&gt;

====Proof====
Let &lt;math&gt;\delta_1&lt;\delta_2&lt;/math&gt;.
Consider set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of tagged partitions &lt;math&gt;\dot{P}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(\delta_1)\leq|L-S(f,\dot{P})|&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; be the set of &lt;math&gt;\dot{P'}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\dot{P'}\subset\dot{P}\in T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|\dot{P'}\|=\delta_2&gt;\delta_1&lt;/math&gt;

note that &lt;math&gt;T'\neq T&lt;/math&gt; and that the set &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; indeed contains all partitions &lt;math&gt;\dot{P'}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\|\dot{P'}\|=\delta_2&lt;/math&gt;

Now, for &lt;math&gt;\dot{P}\in T&lt;/math&gt;, we can construct &lt;math&gt;\dot{P'}\in T'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|L-S(f,\dot{P'})|&gt;|L-S(f,\dot{P})|&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sup_{\dot{P}\in T}\{|L-S(f,\dot{P})|\}&lt;\sup_{\dot{P'}\in T'}\{|L-S(f,\dot{P'})|\}&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(\delta_2)&gt;\varepsilon(\delta_1)&lt;/math&gt;
 
===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

(1)&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Riemann integrable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; iff

(2)&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Darboux Integrable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

====Proof====
(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be given.

(1)&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; tagged partition &lt;math&gt;\dot{P}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\dot{P})-L|&lt;\frac{\epsilon}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let partitions &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; be the same refinement of &lt;math&gt;\dot{P}&lt;/math&gt; but with different tags.

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;|S(f,P_1)-S(f,P_2)|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., by the triangle inequality, &lt;math&gt;|S(f,P_1)|-|S(f,P_2)|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Gap Lemma &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;U(f,P)-L(f,P)&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; being arbitrary, using Theorem 2.1, we have that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Darboux Integrable.  

(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;)Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be given. 

(2), Theorem 2.1 &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; partition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;U(f,P)-L(f,P)&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, &lt;math&gt;|L-S(f,P)|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;L(f,P)\leq S(f,P)\leq U(f,P)&lt;/math&gt;

By Lemma 3.1, &lt;math&gt;|L-S(f,P')|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\|P'\|&lt;\|P\|&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, if we put &lt;math&gt;\delta=\|P\|&lt;/math&gt;, we have (1)

We note here that the crucial element in this proof is Lemma 3.1, as it essentially is giving an order relation between &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, which is not directly present in either the Riemann or Darboux definition.</text>

Thank you for commenting on my &quot;About me&quot; page. I agree with your thoughts on being fair to students, as throughout school i noticed the same issues you did. I went to a high school where most of the kids came from &quot;well to do&quot; families, dressed the same, got good grades... the whole thing. However, whenever there was a student who did not conform to these norms, or stuck out in certain clothing or manner, a teacher would almost disregard them from class activities and would rarely spend time helping them develop and learn. I also found teachers would favor the more &quot;conforming&quot; students and they would end up doing better in the class for that reason only. I feel these kinds of actions by teachers and administrators need to be stopped, and the attitudes towards diverse students needs to be more accepted and praised rather than ignored.

Hi!

Thanks for commenting on my page.  Wow, you've had quite a varied range of experiences...and it sounds like you have a passion for education.  I'm sorry about your house fire; but yes, your wife is probably having a ball picking out all-new decorations and such.  :)
I agree with your educational philosophy, especially your thoughts on treating students equally.  I have just begun my teaching observation, and I am noticing that on each &quot;tier&quot; of the academic-achievement ladder, the students are treated differently.  The ones who might be considered poor or of a minority race are treated more harshly on average, but some of the teachers do not seem to expect very much out of them at all, which I think is a terrible thing.  You've definitely got something there.
Sincerely,
Sommer



Hey.  Sounds like you had quite the busy career at UPS.  I hear they are a great company to work for, but can sometimes be hard to get in the door.  I was wondering what subject you were interested to teach.  It sounds like with your UPS experience you would have plenty of knowledge with business world and could share that knowledge with students in a business class setting.  Just curious because many do not know that Business classes are even offered at a high school level.  Have a good one.

'''Only concentrate on the areas in bold''''''Bold text''' More was bolded than I intended to be. Just look for small differences not as bad as it looks.

TEACHING, IS IT REALY A TRUE PROFESSION?
By, Sean Lumsden
________________________________________
OUR GOALS ARE TO...
Read and understand this article in order to acquire '''an''' '''understanding''''''Bold text''' of some definitions for a profession and a professional. We shall compare and contrast they're differences and '''similarities''''''Bold text''' for the purposes of generalizability and applicability. It is important to stress that no definition is universally accepted for the defining of either a profession or a professional. You will also interpret the facts given within this article '''in order''''''Bold text''' to refine or establish your own personal idea of what constitutes a profession and a professional based on the societal norms within the United States. Lastly, you should understand some basic view points as to why or why not teaching is or is not considered a profession.
________________________________________
THE FEATURE PRESENTATION...
Possibly the most important task to determining if teaching is really a true profession is to determine what constitutes or defines a profession within the United States. For some this may seem like a simple task since nearly everyone has his or her own personal opinion of what is a profession and who are professionals. However for those of us who are a bit more inquisitive this is actually something relatively difficult to determine due to the vast differences in views and opinions; even just within the United States, never mind what other nations may consider. Regardless, it is important to establish some criteria '''in order''' '''Bold text'''to know what separates a profession from a career or a job and what must one do in order to be a professional.

If you were to run to your heavily used dictionary, as some of you may have or will do, and '''throw''''''Bold text''' open the pages for a comfortable and simple definition then you might just be surprised on the answers you find. Apparently the great powers that be which preside over the all knowing dictionaries also have some conflicting opinions. For instance, one definition reads, &quot;a vocation or occupation requiring advanced education and training, and involving intellectual skills, as medicine, law, theology, engineering, teaching, etc., the body of persons in any such calling or occupation, loosely, any occupation.&quot; (Webster's New World Dictionary, 1984) while another definition reads, &quot;a vocation requiring extensive education in science or the liberal arts and often specialized training... any vocation or business... the body of persons engaged in an occupation: the medical profession.&quot; (Random House Webster's College Dictionary, 1992). Perhaps this is what your dictionary reads in regards to a profession or perhaps not. Either way, '''lets us''''''Bold text''' analyze the two given definitions.

In the first definition we can see that it defines a profession as requiring advanced education and training but contradicts this by later saying that loosely any occupation is a profession. It goes one step further as to give some examples which, by the way, includes teaching right there in the list. So teaching must be a true profession then right? Well, '''let us''''''Bold text''' continue on before we jump into a definite answer already. The second definition says that extensive education in science or liberal arts is vital but also contradicts this by including any vocation or business. In this definition it seems that teaching could be a profession since it does require education in science or liberal arts. Ultimately, both definitions include any occupation so perhaps in the means of definition teaching is a true profession regardless of requirements.

Perhaps the best definition for a profession was best described by Arthur E. Wise who was president for the Nation Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. In an article titled &quot;The Essential Role of Accreditation&quot;, Arthur Wise opened up his article by defining a profession as, &quot;an occupation that seeks to regulate itself by (a) developing a consensus concerning what its practitioners must know and be able to do and (b) developing an accreditation and licensing system to ensure the transmission of that knowledge and skill. An occupation becomes a profession when organizations such as universities, states, and the public accept that system.&quot; (Arthur E. Wise, 2005) which does apply a greater degree of limitation upon what is a profession. If we utilize '''these criteria''''''Bold text''' as our means to weight '''an''''''Bold text''' occupation in order to determine if it is a profession then certainly we can eliminate some careers as being that, simply careers and not professions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''i2c_stream'' module implements a simple I2C data streaming protocol. The device from which data is streamed must implement that same protocol as well.

== Synopsis ==

Check out the source code of the '''i2c_stream_read''' program for an example.

== Description ==

This module uses the [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Modules/i2cal|i2cal]] module to transfer data blocks from the external device (chip) to the program. It basically consists of two functions:
* '''i2c_stream_read_start''', to start streaming
* '''i2c_stream_read_next''', which has to be called frequently (and in more or less regular intervals) to read the available data blocks
The following four settings need to be provided to the module
* &lt;tt&gt;device&lt;/tt&gt;: the I2C address of the device to query
* &lt;tt&gt;reg&lt;/tt&gt;: the I2C register from which the stream is read
* &lt;tt&gt;block_size&lt;/tt&gt;: the size of one block (in bytes)
* &lt;tt&gt;block_count_max&lt;/tt&gt;: the maximum number of blocks to transfer at once (this value must be &lt;= 128 / block_size)

== Streaming Protocol ==

The protocol used for data streaming is very simple: To reset the stream, the module first sends the register followed by a 1. To read a chunk, the module sends the register and then reads a multiple of (block_size + 1) bytes from the device. The first byte of a block is a status byte which can take one of the following values:
* 255 (I2C_STREAM_BUFFER_OVERRUN): A buffer overrun occurred on the device, i.e. the blocks were not read fast enough.
* 254 (I2C_STREAM_EMPTY): The block does not contain any data.
* 0..253: the available number of blocks on the device

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==


Attachment points are created in the 3D modelling software used to create an asset. Their purpose is to specify the exact coordinates where one asset item/sub-mesh/effect connects to another, for example, where the track connects onto a bridge, or where the cab is placed inside a locomotive. All attachment points are referenced in the config.txt file of an asset to define its use and function.

Attachment points must follow strict naming conventions provided in the Content Creation Guide for their implementation in Trainz. In 3DS Max and Gmax, attachment points should always be placed in top view with for the orientation of the axis to be correct. They may then be rotated if needed. If creating a Locomotive, the train should be facing down the page in top view.


== Commonly Used Attachment Points  on Locomotives ==

*&lt;code&gt;a.limfront&lt;/code&gt;: front of train
*&lt;code&gt;a.limback&lt;/code&gt;: rear of train
*&lt;code&gt;a.bog0&lt;/code&gt;: front bogey
*&lt;code&gt;a.bog1&lt;/code&gt;: back bogey
*&lt;code&gt;a.bog''x''&lt;/code&gt;: any other bogey
*&lt;code&gt;a.exhaust''x''&lt;/code&gt;: smoke/steam
*&lt;code&gt;a.light''x''&lt;/code&gt;: lights/coronas
*&lt;code&gt;a.cabfront&lt;/code&gt;: front cab
*&lt;code&gt;a.cabback&lt;/code&gt;: rear cab

      <comment>Preparing to transwiki Maori outdoor education text here</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Outdoor education occurs, in one form or another, in most if not all countries of the world.  However, it can be implemented very differently, depending on the cultural context.  Some countries, for example, view outdoor education as synonymous with [[w:environmental education|environmental education]], whilst other countries treat outdoor education and environmental education as distinct.  Modern forms of outdoor education are most prevalent in UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and to some extent Asia and Africa.  A map is available of locations of outdoor education organisations, facilities, and people [http://www.frappr.com/outdooreducation].

==UK==

After the [[w:second world war|second world war]] many local authorities in the UK emulated the Outward Bound principles and set up their own outdoor education centres for school children. Visits to these outdoor centres were often subsidised, allowing many children from the towns and cities a unique experience of the outdoor world.

By the late 1980s most UK local education authorities had an outdoor education centre, and there was a growing private sector offering similar experiences. Government moves to offer more autonomy to schools have badly affected this provision. Under regulations for the local management of schools that took effect in England and Wales from 1992 onwards, the majority of the money spent on education in the UK now goes direct to the school, and local authorities often find it difficult to subsidise their outdoor education centres. As a result many have closed.

One of the most significant changes in outdoor education in Great Britain came as a result of the [[w:Lyme Bay kayaking tragedy|Lyme Bay kayaking tragedy]] in March, 1993.  This tragedy accelerated governmental discussions until, in January 1995, the Activity Centres (Young Persons’ Safety) Act 1995 was passed through Parliament in January 1995 and an independent licensing authority, the [[w:Adventure Activities Licensing Authority|Adventure Activities Licensing Authority]] (AALA) was formed.

Overall, the AALA appears to have succeeded in its mission, but it has also created debate regarding whether it is possible for young people to experience adventure in an 'educational way' within tight regulations.  Some people view AALA regulations as tight and thus, restricting their opportunity to provide what they believe to be meaningful outdoor education. 

One further area worthy of note is the Campaign for Adventure (Campaign for Adventure, 2000a){{Fact|date=May 2007}}. This campaign started in 2000 following a one day conference titled “A Question of Balance.” Since then the campaign has concentrated on lobbying political individuals and parties to support risk taking and to acknowledge and work against the increasing trends indicated by a “[[w:culture of fear|culture of fear]].” This phrase is the title of Furedi’s (1997) book, which is heavily cited in recent UK outdoor education literature. As with most political campaigns it is difficult to assess progress but the work of those involved in the campaign can be followed on line (Campaign for Adventure, 2000a){{Fact|date=May 2007}}. Consistent with this position, a recent report from the Office of Standards in Education, which covers England and Wales, concluded that outdoor education is uniquely placed to offer structured opportunities for students to identify hazards, calculate the related risks and decide the significance of a risk in order to determine and implement the precautions necessary to eliminate and minimise risk. Students’ involvement in risk management makes them aware of potential harm and contributes towards their being able to take greater responsibility for their own and others’ safety. (Ofsted, 2004, p. 13){{Fact|date=May 2007}}

While on the surface Ofsted may appear to be consistent with the Campaign for Adventure there are some significant inconsistencies here worthy of brief explanation. It appears that Ofsted is suggesting that the very idea of risk taking is to be avoided and the role of outdoor education could be to enable students to assess risk and then ‘eliminate or minimise’ it. A contrary position is taken by the Campaign for Adventure based on adventure and risk as, at least an educational value, and perhaps even as central to life and a way of being, which is threatened by a culture of fear. The Campaign for Adventure believe that life is best approached with a spirit of adventure and that absolute safety is unachievable.  

Recently there has been concern expressed about the decline in the number and quality of school trips in the UK. In 2005 the Parliamentary select committee on Education published a report on 'Education outside the classroom' [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmeduski/120/12002.htm] which called on the UK government to do more to protect and promote outdoor education. In response the government promised to issue a manifesto for outdoor education, setting out what schools ought to offer their pupils.

==North America==

The origin of outdoor education in the USA is difficult to pinpoint&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, C. E. (1994). Progressivism never died, it just moved outside: What can experiential educators learn from the past? ''Journal of Experiential Education'', ''17''(2), 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt;.  North American culture, particularly since European colonization in the 17th century, has embraced a pioneering spirit.  This contributed to the extensive development of [[w:Summer camps|organized camping]] programs during the 20th century, Outward Bound programs since the 1960s, as well as many related off-shoot programs including Project Adventure, the National Outdoor Leadership School, the ropes course industry, and many other applications including [[w:wilderness orientation|wilderness orientation]] programs within colleges and universities and adventure therapy.  In the 1970's, the [[w:Association for Experiential Education|Association for Experiential Education]] was also formed, along with the Journal of Experiential Education which continues to have a strong focus on adventure education scholarship and practice.

==India==
:''Main article: [[w:Education in India#Outdoor Education in India|Outdoor Education in India]]''

==New Zealand==
:''Main article: [[Maori outdoor education]]''

== Germany ==
The term ‘outdoor education’ doesn’t seem to have an exact equivalent in the German language although [[w:Kurt Hahn|Kurt Hahn]], one of key figures in the development of outdoor education in the twentieth century was [[w:Germany|German]]. In general, outdoor or adventure education is not as widespread in Germany as in other developed regions, such as North America, Australia, and the UK.  However, a closely related educational approach called [[w:experiential education|experiential education]] (In German: “[http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlebnisp%C3%A4dagogik Erlebnispädagogik]”) is commonly applied.

Most organisations and companies offering programs and activities based on experiential education for children and youth also offer similar programs for adults and especially corporate teams which are then mostly referred to as 'outdoor trainings'.

Judging from the kind of outdoor training programs available in an internet search, the main clientele of German outdoor training providers seem to be corporate teams and organisations seeking [[w:team building|team building]] and [[w:personal development|personal development]]. There is also a wide range of organisations offering outdoor programs based on experiential education for children, adolescents, families and school classes with or without disabilities. German schools have seemingly started to make increased use of outdoor and experiential  possibilities when planning their school trips but the experiential approach is rarely implemented in the normal school system and it is by no means as common for school students to experience outdoor education trips as it is other countries.

A more detailed summary of German outdoor education and experiential educational providers and networks is available[http://www.wilderdom.com/oe/doku.php?id=international:germany].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want a single form that allows you to layout a single page dashboard.  In this case a dashboard in a set of &quot;Portlets&quot; that each have separate content.

== Method ==
Our dashboard builder will control a library of dashboards.  Each dashboard has a name, layout information and a list of portlets that are rendered in the dashboard.  In our example a dashboard may have up to 36 portlets, but best practices usually contain 7 portlets plus or minus one or two.

== Application Design ==
Our dashboard layout will be one of three types:
# row oriented where all portlets in a row have the same height
# column oriented where all portlets in a column share the same width
# grid-oriented where all portlets must be contained in a regular grid structure

The tool will allow the user to create a new dashboard and give it a name.  The user then selects one of the three layout types.  Each layout type will allows the user to specify attributes of each row or column such as using absolute width/heights in pixels or relative height/width percentage of width/heights.  Note that to allow dashboards to be resized to different screen sizes, relative sizes should be used.

Within each row, column or grid, the user can specify a set of portlets and then give each portlet some parameters.

When the user saves a dashboard it will save an XML instance document with the specification of the dashboard layout.  This layout can be transformed using XQuery or XSLT into a CSS file that is loaded each time the dashboard is displayed.

== Dashboard Layout Styles ==

&lt;gallery Caption=&quot;Dashboard Layout Types&quot;&gt;
Image:dashboard-row-layout.png|Row
Image:dashboard-column-layout.png|Column
Image:dashboard-grid-layout.png|Grid
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Conditional Display of Row/Column Information ==
This form should only display the row height specification if either row or grid layout is chosen.  Similarly, the column widths should only be displayed if either the column or grid layout is chosen.

The following code provides this logic.

         &lt;/data&gt;
      &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      &lt;xf:instance id=&quot;views&quot; xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
         &lt;data&gt;
            &lt;row-info /&gt;
            &lt;col-info /&gt;
         &lt;/data&gt;
      &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      &lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;instance('views')/row-info&quot; relevant=&quot;instance('my-data')/DashboardLayoutCode!='col' &quot; /&gt;
      &lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;instance('views')/col-info&quot; relevant=&quot;instance('my-data')/DashboardLayoutCode!='row'&quot; /&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Demonstration of relevant fields.  Grid layouts require both rows and columns to be specified.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;xf:value&gt;row&lt;/xf:value&gt;
         &lt;/xf:item&gt;
         &lt;xf:item&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Col&lt;/xf:label&gt;
            &lt;xf:value&gt;col&lt;/xf:value&gt;
         &lt;/xf:item&gt;
         &lt;xf:item&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Grid&lt;/xf:label&gt;
            &lt;xf:value&gt;grid&lt;/xf:value&gt;
         &lt;/xf:item&gt;
      &lt;/xf:select1&gt;
      &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;instance('views')/row-info&quot;&gt;
         &lt;h1&gt;Row&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;/xf:group&gt;
      &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;instance('views')/col-info&quot;&gt;
         &lt;h1&gt;Col&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;/xf:group&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;

[[Image:Procecidochares_atra.jpg‎|thumb|An adult Fruit Fly]]

Fruit flies belong to the Order Diptera and the Family Tephritidae. There are about 4500 species. Most have distinctive markings on their wings, such as bands, patches, or zigzags. Scientists use these patterns to identify individual species. 

Mediterranean fruit flies ''(Ceratitis capitata)'' are called Medflies. They are about the size of a common house fly. Their wings have orange and brown markings. There are dark and light patterns on the head. The abdomen is orange with light stripes and the legs are orange. 

Caribbean fruit flies ''(Anastrepha suspense)'' are mostly orange with some black markings. The wings are long with yellow-brown to brown bands. They are also known as Greater Antilliean fruit flies, guava fruit flies, and Caribfles. They can be 2 times larger than a common house fly. 

Papaya fruit flies ''(Toxotrypana curvicauda)'' have a long, thin body. There are orange patterns on the head and thorax, and orange and brown stripes on the abdomen. The transparent wings are long and thin and held straight back over the body. 

Asian papaya fruit flies ''(Bactrocera papayae)'' are black with yellow patterns on the thorax. The wings are transparent.

Olive fruit flies ''(Bactrocera oleae)'' are black with transparent wings. They have a reddish pattern on the head and abdomen.

European fruit flies ''(Icterica westermanni)'' are also known as “picture wing” flies. They are brown with tan stripes and have whiteish spots on brown wings.

==Where does it live?==

Fruit flies occur worldwide and live in a wide variety of habitats. 

Medflies are thought to have originated in Africa. They are now found in many other parts of the world.

Caribbean fruit flies are native to the West Indies. They are found in Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and South Florida.

Papaya fruit flies are found throughout tropical and subtropical areas of the western hemisphere. They are found in Central and South America. In the United States, they are found in southern Texas and southern Florida. 

Asian papaya fruit flies are found in Thailand, Malaysia, Borneo, Indonesia and Singapore, Papua New Guinea, and in Australian island territories.

Olive Fruit flies probably came to the Middle East and southern Europe from Africa. Scientists believe they were recently introduced to California olive groves from the Mediterrean region.

==What does it eat?==

Caribbean fruit flies infest only mature to overripe fruits. They feed on peaches, plums, oranges, grapefruit, guavas, rose-apples, and cherries.

Papaya fruit flies eat papaya, mango, and milkweed.

Adult Olive fruit flies feed on various substances including honeydew from insects, pollen, and bird droppings.

European fruit flies feed on the flowerheads of ragwort.

==How does it defend itself?==

Scientists have found that some fruit fly species change colors and patterns within a few generations. To blend in with different surroundings, a new generation may become darker or lighter than previous generations. Scientists believe this adaptation makes the new generation of fruit flies less visible and protects them from predators.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

Fruit flies undergo complete metamorphosis, changing to an adult in several stages: egg, early larva, full-sized larva, pupa and  adult. While in the pupal stage, they “rest” before the final molt to full grown adult.

Eggs are laid on plants. Some larvae feed and grow inside soft fruits or flowers. Others are leaf-miners or gall-formers. Larvae vary in shape and are smooth or slightly spiny. 

Adult Medfly females deposit their eggs in fruit skin that has been softened by damage. The eggs hatch within 3 days. Larvae grow inside the fruit. The flesh of the fruit decomposes as larvae feed. When fully grown, larvae stop feeding and leave the fruit. They burrow into the soil, pupate, and slowly develop into adults. Adults escape from the pupal case and burrow up through the soil. The amount of time from egg to adult varies from five weeks to five months, depending on temperature. Adults may live 2 to 3 months. 

Caribbean fruit fly eggs are laid one at a time and hatch in 2 to 3 days. The larvae feed and grow for about 2 weeks. The pupal period is about the same. Development from egg to adult takes longer in cooler weather. 

Female Papaya fruit flies produce hundreds of long, slender eggs. The eggs are deposited in immature papaya fruit. Young larvae feed on developing seeds in the center of the fruit. Unripe papaya juice is fatal to young fruit flies, so they wait for the fruit to become ripe. They eat their way out and drop to the ground. They mature beneath the plant, just under the surface of the soil. Adults emerge in 2 to 6 weeks.

Asian papaya fruit flies lay their eggs along with fruit-decaying bacteria just under the skin of the fruit. The inside of the fruit is damaged before signs of infestation appear on the outside. Small discolored patches appear where the female punctures the skin to lay eggs. Within 1 to 2 days, eggs hatch into larvae which feed on the decaying fruit. After  the decayed fruit drops to the ground, it takes 7 to 12 days for the larvae to leave the fruit and burrow into the soil to pupate. Mature adults emerge about 2 weeks later. In 1 to 2 more weeks mating begins. They live for several months and reproduce throughout their life span. They are able to multiply rapidly and disperse over great distances. 

Olive fruit flies only reproduce on olive fruit. Females prefer large green olives for egg-laying. Eggs are laid under the skin of the fruit. A few days later, the larvae appear. They feed on the pulp and pass through 3 larval instars. Pupae develop inside the fruit or on the ground.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

Male Medflies sing a unique “calling song” when courting females. A female will mate with a male whose sound tones are most attractive to her.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Many fruit fly species cause extensive damage to crops and fruit trees. Countries and states make rules against importing fruit from areas where fruit fly infestation has occurred.

Medflies damage citrus and other soft fruits. They multiply rapidly. People place Medfly traps on trees. If just one is found in a trap, citrus farmers prepare for the worst.    

Asian papaya fruit flies are a serious quarantine pest worldwide. They infest virtually all fruit, except pineapples, legumes, sweet corn, macadamia nuts, and coconuts.

Olive fruit flies have been the major pest of olive crops worldwide since biblical times.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;u&gt;'''About Me''&lt;/u&gt;''''.... Well, I currently live in Troutville, Virginia with my loving wife and brilliant ten year old daughter. All three of us were born in Roanoke, which is next to Troutville, and we love the mountains here in Virginia. We own our home which has undergone a transformation since we had a house fire last Thanksgiving and still to this day we are working on making it home again. Don't worry, we are in the &quot;buy-everything-again&quot; phase so the wife is loving life. My wife works full time for a hearing aid company, my daughter attends elementary school (with straight A's for the year), and I work full time for the Roanoke Valley Juvenile Detention Center. So as you may imagine I do get to meet some of the most... hmm..... unique children this area has to offer.

Prior to my current job I was a UPS Operations Area Coordinator, which is cool talk for &quot;business big wig&quot;. It was a stressful position which required me to make important decisions, be the boss for over 150 people, be on call 24/7, work an average of fifteen hours a day, and the most horrible part was that I had to wear a suit AND tie every day! Yea, it was really powerful, paid VERY well, and carried a lot of prestige but it kept me from having a life. So, I decided to stop &quot;living for work&quot; and begin &quot;working for a living&quot;. Crazy some may say but trust me, when you realize your job gets more attention from you than your child, well you just might start seeing life my way.

I also lived in Germany for three years, traveled most of Europe, did a little time above the arctic circle, and if you haven't guessed it, yes, I was in the military. Specifically, I served in an Army Airborne Ranger Unit were I fought in Kosovo but missed the Iraq efforts, every time. After earning my Sergeant strips, a couple of combat tours, and an airborne injury, I finally completed my contract and came running home so that I could finally go to college.

Now I have two A.S. degrees and a B.S. which have been enlightening. However, it is that prized M.S.Ed. which I currently seek in the hopes of switching jobs one more time. See, for me, a job is just a job until you love it, then it becomes a career. Hopefully, I will reach my goal in a little over a year and finally start teaching children.

'''''

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

''''&lt;u&gt;''Teaching Philosophy:''''''&lt;/u&gt; Personally, I feel that every child is a work in progress. I base this primarily upon our laws since I see it at work all the time. Imagine, suddenly one day you wake up and it is illegal for you to have a job... so you're fired. Next, you find out that you can't have any contracts.... so you are kicked out of your apartment or house, all your credit cards are canceled, and your car is repossessed. Now if this is not enough, you also in this same day get either one or two guardians assigned to you who instruct you in every minute of your day. They're views are totally different than yours since they are.... hmm... communist and if you rebel... well we all know what happens to people who rebel in communist nations. So, after all this life doesn't sound so good does it? You basically must do as told or else you starve, are punished harshly, and could never manage to get ahead ever again in life. Well, this is the life of a child. They are only as good as the adults in they're life. If the parents are bad then the child's chances of a good life are horribly diminished.

Taking this into account, I feel that my greatest belief is that every child must be treated equally, despite differences on all levels. Growing up, I hated school but it was for good cause. The teaching staff seemed to exercise a bias toward the less wealthy, they used discrimination based on appearances, and they too allowed themselves to gravitate toward cliques. This MUST not be allowed and it is the duty of the teacher to recognize this and refrain from these types of behavior.

Once again, imagine teaching a class for the first time. You enter the room after all the students have taken their seats. The first thing you do is look at the class, after all it is human nature. As you do so some individuals stick out in your mind. Typically it is the big kid dressed in punk rock clothing, the other kid dressed like a rap star, the girl with the short shorts on that no mother would allow her to wear, and the kid in the very back which you were warned about. Yeah, you will notice these individuals but you won't notice the &quot;well to do&quot; kids since they never cause any trouble... right? Well, let this be a lesson for you, if you think like this then those kids you noticed are already doomed for failure. Undoubtably, you will gravitate toward your comfort zone and focus upon those kids you did not see since you feel safe with them. However, it is those kids which I mentioned, remember the big kid in the back of the room, that pose the greatest asset to our future. They dare to challenge norms, they deal with a life harsher than those you trust, and because of these facts they have the greatest potential to learn, lead, and become more.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About Me ==

My name is Mary Worrell and I'm a student in the teaching licensure program at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va. 

I received my undergraduate degree at ODU in 2006, but I'm back already! I received my bachelor's in English with an emphasis in journalism and a minor in political science. I currently work as a reporter for a regional business journal. I love being a writer and reporter, but I'm looking for a change and teaching has me quite excited. 

I'm pursuing my license in secondary education with an endorsement in English. I'm also pursuing an add-on endorsement in journalism. I would love to teach high school, the place where I discovered my own love of writing and literature. 

When I'm not writing the day away at the office, I enjoy riding my bike around town, cooking for hours on the weekend and working with my hands as a part of the [http://www.norfolkcraftmafia.com Norfolk Craft Mafia]. No, I don't make cement shoes, but I do enjoy crocheting, working with embroidery and attempting to sew.

One of the overarching themes in my classroom will be connecting activities and projects to my students’ future places in the workforce. I want to apply everything to the “real world.” Students may not believe me when I say something will be important at the time, because my teachers used to say this to me often and I never believed them. But teaching is a long-term investment and my hope is they will realize the necessity of a lesson later on down the road. 

I believe communication and organization are important keys in successful teaching as they are in the workforce and in personal relationships. I want to have multiple lines of communication with my students and their parents (phone, e-mail, in-person) to ensure I can be reached and that I can reach my students. And I want my classroom and its schedule to be organized and easy to understand. For me as a student in high school organized teachers were always comforting, because I understood what was expected of me

Which brings me to a point about technology. I believe technology, because of the prevalence of it in our lives, is not something to be ignored or to force students to ignore in the classroom. I want to use it whenever possible and to encourage my students to do so. If there is a powerful tool available to my students (i.e. Google), I think it’s foolish to avoid using it just because it’s not traditional. However, there is a lot to think about in this regard because not every home has a computer. 

I don’t want my classroom to be a place where students fall asleep to the sound of my voice. I want to facilitate conversations between students and encourage discussions. I want students to work together to solve problems with me in the background. 

When it comes to writing assignments I plan to use peer reviews so students not only get my feedback, but also the feedback and advice of their fellow students. 

And I want my classroom environment to be one of encouragement. Every “mistake” will be an opportunity to learn. I don’t want my students to avoid taking risks because they fear embarrassment or punishment. Risks make life exciting and I want my classroom to be a place where students can practice diving right in.</text>

It looked bias towards the game console, focusing on the negatives of the computer more. Through it I could tell that the author played the Xbox and preferred it over most other game systems. Sure he declared the negative of the console, but not as much as the computer negatives.

There is also tactile output, with force feedback controllers.

:Feel free to contribute, as I was the one that merged and last moved things about on the book, I can assure you that there is n't in the book a single author (or major editor) viewpoint, it can be present on a single section but you should be bold and correct anything you disagree with, registering isn't even required...

Aside from the fact that there's no book content on here, this was probably directly ripped off of a published work and is thus, as tagged, a copyvio.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Creating a prototypical route in Trainz is very popular and there are many means of doing so. Prototypical routes can be downloaded from the DLS and others are available as content included for distribution with Trainz, e.g. TC3 has the 1950's/60's Settle and Carlisle route included. 

When attempting to create a prototypical route, it is up to the user how much detail, time and effort is put into the map, therefore affecting how representative and accurate the simulation is to be. 

The initial stage of creating a prototypical route (or any prototypical asset) involves some sort of research and collection of information, e.g. maps, photos or drawings to help the creator in placing track and other objects accurately on the map. Many Trainzers make use of software such as Google Earth, Flash Earth or Microsoft's maps.live.com in order to obtain aerial information regarding their route.

Of course, to be truly accurate and representative of the actual route, the user may need to consider creating his/her own content if the DLS and other sources are not satisfactory.

== An Introduction to DEM's and Their Implementation in Trainz: ==


== Baseboard Maps ==

Baseboard maps are objects (assets) that are able to be placed on a board in Surveyor mode in Trainz. The object is a flat plane with a 1km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; map textured over it. The purpose of baseboard maps is for accuracy in placing scenery and track items in a prototypical layout. The boards are height adjustable and can be used in multiples. Once finished with the asset can be removed from the map.

Baseboard maps are available from 3rd party sites on the internet or can be easily created with Gmax and a basic knowledge of content creation. The usefulness of these items depends on the map they are textured with and how the user implements them in Trainz.

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{navigation|Book=Algebra
|current=Who should read this book
|previous=What is math, exactly?
|next=Arithmetic
|cat=Algebra (book)}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This book is intended to be a comprehensive look at the mathematics topic of algebra. That said, it would be well suited for a wide variety of individuals, ranging from students (at any grade level) to adults interested in refreshing or improving their understanding of basic math. It could be used either as a primary text or a reference.

This book will avoid explaining subjects with ''only'' rigorous mathematical abstractions whenever possible. Math can be tricky and frustrating enough without it seeming inaccessible. So while every topic will be covered fully and correctly and in many times using proper mathematical terminology, there will always be a backup definition or simple explanation to complete the concept. This allows a wider variety of individuals to learn from this text, from an ambitious 12-year-old to a forgetful college professor. Algebra is applicable to your daily life in addition to academic settings, so an algebra textbook should be accessible to everyone.</text>

|}
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

== Example ==
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%; text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper&quot;&gt;

Replacing the two sections that default with a new documentation page with:

&lt;pre&gt;{{subst:User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/DT main|title=Some documentation|content=

{{subst:User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/DT section|title=Purpose}}
{{subst:User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/DT section|title=Specification}}
{{subst:User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/DT section|title=Usage}}
{{subst:User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/DT section|title=Example}}
{{subst:User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/DT section|title=See Also}}

}}&lt;/pre&gt;

-- generated this page.  (Save and load the page, then come back and edit the documentation to fill it.)

Since this works through substitution, you can use this method at any time to add new sections: If, later on, I want to add a new section after Usage, I could edit the USage section and add this code:
&lt;pre&gt;{{subst:User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/DT section|title=My New Section}}&lt;/pre&gt;

Calling this template without substitutions (and preferably without options) gives a quick short hand to edit the actual template ... '''''which you should never do unless you will revert the changes afterwards.'''''  This is a convenience method so you can tune your sections in a one-time-only fashion.

&lt;/div&gt;

== See Also ==
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%; text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper&quot;&gt;

The idea behind this contents listing is that it lists the contents under a given index.  So you can pass it _bookname_/Contents/ and all contents pages after that will automatically populate your contents list.  The downside is, right now at least, those pages all must keep their page names .. _bookname_/Contents/_actual page name_  ... which is none too pretty.

== Categorising my article ==

Hi

I originally wrote this article up (see link below) in Test-Wiki but it was deleted in time. Now I have put it in Wikibooks and need to categorise it into this grouping How-To Guides - Model Railways - Computer Control.

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Working_Rocrail_with_Hornby_Elite_DCC_Controller

The instructions for doing this are not very clear, especially for generating a new category, so if someone could please advise me or even amend the article to suit that would be appreciated.

Thanks, Robbie

:You will likely want to search through [[WB:AS]] to choose better categorizations. When you have done so, you can add them using {{tlx|Subject|category1|category2|...}} at the bottom of the page. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:51, 1 May 2008 (UTC)
== Filling in the wikibook outline ==

Hi all!

I have just started a wikibook.
It also means I am beginner.

my book is Computers &amp; Society
and I have just made book and chapter outline

I can only work on this few hours per day
(real day job gets in the way)

I use placeholder text...

but am getting Wikibookean queries on this?

any other way to give outline structure to be filled in?

thanx in advance

--Михал Орела 11:20, 6 May 2008 (UTC)

:Those are probably from me. As long as you're planning to put some content there soon, just put a note on the talk page for the tagged module and/or remove the {{tlx|query}} template. Creating modules with no content as a placeholder is mostly useless, and mildly annoying - they often get forgotten, leaving empty pages laying around being useless. As I say - if they're going to be filled with content, there's no problem. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:40, 9 May 2008 (UTC)

== Are you allowed to copy a page from wikipedia? ==

As a wikibooks is suppose to be self-contained. I'm considering copying a page(copy/paste) from wikipedia (at least a large part of it) rather then rewriting much of it myself on wikibooks. Would that be a copyright violation? [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 17:29, 16 May 2008 (UTC)
:No, I do that all the time.  Wikipedia content is licensed under the GFDL.  In order to remain compliant with the GFDL though, you should write something like &quot;imported text from &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Article]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; in the edit summary.  Another option is to log an import request on the [[Wikibooks:Requests for Import]].  When an admin sees it, it will be imported into transwiki space, and you will be told where to find it.  You can move it to where you want it from there and the edit history will be preserved.  You cannot, however, merge it with an existing module and preserve both edit histories.  So if you're starting from scratch, an import is a good way to go, but if you've already started, cut-n-paste + summary comment is better.  And BTW, sometimes imports fail if an article has more than 100 edits or so.  My recommendation: cut-n-paste+summary citation. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 17:47, 16 May 2008 (UTC)
:I would recommend that you always request an import for anything more than a paragraph. An admin can merge the page histories if you need to merge content into a pre-existing page. At the very least, a link to the Wikipedia article in the edit summary is required. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:20, 16 May 2008 (UTC)

== WMF Board of Trustees Election, Suffrage ==

The elections committee has released a list of requirements for all wikimedians who wish to vote in the upcoming board elections. To vote, you must have at least 50 edits on one project since January 2008. I don't know when the cutoff date is. If you've been mostly inactive this year, but want the right to vote, you should make a few quick edits here and there to fill the requirement. Of course, Wikibooks benefits from every edit, so the more the merrier! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:39, 1 May 2008 (UTC)
:The page with all the information is here: [[meta:Board elections/2008/en]]. It's 50 edits between Jan 01 and June 01 (which gives people 1 month to comply), and 600 edits total prior to March 01. If you haven't met the march requirement, you're out of luck. However, you should make 50 good edits here anyway! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:53, 1 May 2008 (UTC)

== Anyone know Greek? ==

At the page [[Writing_Adolescent_Fiction/Character_names/Greek]], someone made an edit. It added the surnames &quot;Res&quot;, and after the surname &quot;Siannas&quot;, added &quot;poutsogliftra&quot;: Siannaspoutsogliftra. What does this mean? The word &quot;Siannaspoutsogliftra&quot; gets no Google hits, but there are a few for the word &quot;poutsogliftra&quot; (nowhere telling you what the word means though). Is there anyone around here who speaks Greek? [[User:Cilantrohead|Cilantrohead]] ([[User talk:Cilantrohead|talk]]) 22:53, 3 May 2008 (UTC)
== About being adminstrators and Wikibookians ==

I have known that no everyone can be adminstrators , but I'd like to know how. Also, in fact, what are wikibookians? Can I be one of them?

:A wikibookian is a person who participates at Wikibooks. Anybody who comes here to author, edit, or even just to read is a &quot;Wikibookian&quot;. Administrators are a rarer breed, however. To be an administrator, you must be elected. Create a nomination at [[WB:RFP]] for yourself, and people will vote on it. However, successful administrator candidates usually need some qualifications first:
:*Experience editing: You seem to have about [[Special:Contributions/Relike868|about 10 edits so far]], we typically like to see administrators with several hundred or even a thousand edits. We also like to see members who have been active here for a long time, such as several months. This way, we know that you will be familiar with all our policies. These numbers are just a guideline, not a strict requirement.
:*Experience in maintenance. There are lots of jobs to do here at Wikibooks, and since administrators are primarily used for maintenance tasks, we ask that candidates have experience with them. See [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks maintenance]] for some idea of the jobs that need to get done around here. Vandal fighting, new page patrolling, book organization and categorization, and answering questions here on this and other discussion pages. If you demonstrate a need to be an administrator, we will elect you to be one. 
:I hope this answers your question. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:11, 6 May 2008 (UTC)

: Wikibookians are people who contribute to Wikibooks in some way, or can refer to someone whose a registered member of the Wikibooks community. You become a Wikibookian or a member of the Wikibooks community simply by contributing to Wikibooks. Administrators are Wikibookians with a few extra tools. A Wikibookian becomes an administrator by showing there willingness to have the extra tools and other Wikibookians showing there general willingness to let that person have the extra tools. Anyone can become an administrator provided those two things are true. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:33, 6 May 2008 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Nominations]] ==

I just wanted to draw people's attention to the three open nominations at [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Nominations]]. That page hasn't been particularly active lately, and I want to make sure that people aren't forgetting about it entirely. Also, I do know that Wikibooks has been a little quiet lately. Hopefully, as the current semester draws to a close, things will pick up again. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:24, 6 May 2008 (UTC)
:Does activity usually pick up over the summer? I'm never really sure. But yes, with less new books comes less FB nominations unfortunately. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 02:36, 8 May 2008 (UTC)

== how to determine if content conforms to license? ==

I'm planning on publishing several wikibooks in physical book form, and I've read the terms of the license quite thoroughly - still is there a way to have someone view a PDF of the book to verify compliance with all license terms? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:200.119.237.32|200.119.237.32]] ([[User talk:200.119.237.32|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/200.119.237.32|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:I would be happy to view your PDFs to check them for compliance, and I'm sure other Wikibookians would be happy as well. If you upload them here to Wikibooks, it will have the dual benefit of allowing us to look at it, and other readers to download them as well. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:31, 8 May 2008 (UTC)

== How to categorize a book? ==

I've recieved a notice that my new page &quot;animal taxonomy&quot; needs to be categorized. How do I do so?

:Add a suitable category at the end of the page for example [[:Category:Taxonomy]].&lt;br&gt;You can find existing categories here [[Wikibooks:Alphabetical_classification]], although in your case I suspect it's suitable to create a new category. If you choice a new category click it's red link and save the page. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 12:40, 23 May 2008 (UTC)
== Templates to expand images and formatting ==

I've created two templates (both of which probably need to be improved) to makr books that are light on formatting or images: {{tlx|Formatting}}, and {{tlx|Images}}. This way we can be more precise about certain requests then saying {{tlx|Cleanup}} or {{tlx|Expand}}. Also, I've written up a short &quot;cheatsheet&quot; for all these templates in one easy place: [[User:Whiteknight/Template Cheatsheet]]. For people who are confused about the templates or can't remember them all, I've found this to be a helpful resource to me. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:46, 9 May 2008 (UTC)
== Engineering bookshelf deprecation ==

I've taken the liberty tonight of deprecating the engineering bookshelf. It now redirects to [[Subject:Engineering]]. I'm going to fix up some of the double-redirects next. It's been a long term goal, not only of mine but of several other wikibookians, to deprecate all of the bookshelves and use the dynamically-updated subject pages instead. The engineering bookshelf is a personal pet project of mine, and so has progressed further then any of the others so far. Thus, I think it makes a good pilot for this initiative. Over the summer, as I have time and motivation, I would like to start increasing the quality of the remaining subject pages and deprecating additional bookshelves. I think it's going to be a much better solution for us in the long run, and I hope people agree. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:04, 9 May 2008 (UTC)

== Categories Overlapping ==

There's a little bit of a problem with the category system that we've been using, and for the most part we've been ignoring it. The problem is that both subject categories and books share a &quot;namespace&quot; when it comes to categorization. A book &quot;X&quot;, and all it's subpages, will be in Category:X. This can overlap if X is a common name for the subject. 

For instance, we have a book [[Calculus]], but we also have a few books by other names that are about calculus-related topics. If we put all the subpages of [[Calculus]] and the books that are related into the same category, it's not useful as a navigational or organizational tool anymore.

What I would like to do is change major-subject categories to have some kind of prefix, like &quot;Category:Subject-X&quot;. Book subpages could still be in &quot;Category:X&quot;, like usual. This won't really take much effort to implement, we would change the behavior of {{tlx|Subject}}, and then update all the dynamic lists in the [[WB:AS|Subject namespace]]. This way we won't have to worry about category name collisions anymore, and all the details will be hidden in templates that people are already mostly using. If nobody has strong opinions about this, I want to try to make this change next week. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:47, 9 May 2008 (UTC)
:Why wouldn't we have all modules of the book go in Category:Calculus (book) instead? This is a standard method which is used everywhere I've seen this overlap occur. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:30, 9 May 2008 (UTC)
::That's a good possibility too. I suggest doing it &quot;Category:Foo (Subject)&quot; or something similar instead for 3 reasons:
::#We can hide all the details inside {{tlx|Subject}}, and no authors will really need to deal with it.
::#If we wanted to make it standard, we would have to add &quot;(book)&quot; to the categories in every single book (and there are at least 1100 of them, depending on how you count). If we don't keep it standard for all, then we're left with another hack-job and there's no sense making any changes at all.
::#We would have to update all documentation to tell authors to use &quot;Category:BOOKNAME (book)&quot;, and then ensure that this was happening when we patrol.
::I'm fine with either way, we can employ bots to do it on the book-end like you suggest. I would prefer a method that doesn't put any work or strain on our authors, since the barrier to entry around here is already high enough without having to worry about your book's category. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:55, 9 May 2008 (UTC)
: How about renaming books to be more descriptive instead? Calculus isn't a descriptive name, it doesn't say who the audience is for, is it an introduction to Calculus, an advanced calculus book, how much coverage does it include, etc.? Using a descriptive book name would remove overlap between subject categories names and book categories as well. Its not like you'd goto a bookstore and find a textbook named just &quot;Calculus&quot; --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:48, 9 May 2008 (UTC)
::This really isn't an appealing solution to me. It requires that we rename books, as many as several hundred that are currently using common names. It also means that we will have to require new authors to avoid common names for their books, when it has been our de facto policy not to place any requirements on a book's title. We would have to police new books to ensure they weren't named after an existing or potential topic. A solution that requires us to do a large amount of work ''and'' requires new authors to jump through more hoops before they can start a new book is decidedly not a good solution. Changing the names of the subject categories, on the other hand, requires us to modify {{tlx|Subject}} and modify (probably by bot) several dozen Subject: pages. This is easier to execute immediately, requires far less maintenance, and won't cause additional hassle for new book authors. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:07, 9 May 2008 (UTC)

::: I think its easier to search for books by subject than it is by title. I don't think Category:Subject-X and Category:BOOKNAME (book) are good conventions to use. Another solution might be to enable case-sensitivity of the first letter as is done on Wiktionary, so that Category:calculus would be different from Category:Calculus, than we could require all subject categories be completely lowercase. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:31, 9 May 2008 (UTC)
::::Now that ''IS'' a good alternative solution. It has the benefit that we can do most of the modifications in the {{tlx|Subject}} template (use the #lc: magic word so we don't even need to fix any pages), and we guarantee that no collisions will ever happen because Book titles must have a capital first-letter. It also had the added benefit of fixing the non-standard way we've been capitalizing subject names so far: Some are &quot;Title Caps&quot; and some are &quot;First caps&quot;. Using #lc: for all of them would completely remove these issues. I'm in favor of this proposal. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:47, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

Another possible solution: Check out what I've done with [[:Category:History]]. Each book gets its own category- for example, [[History of Spain]] is in [[:Category:History of Spain]]. This category is then put in [[:Category:European History]], along with other national histories. The book [[European History]] is in this category as well as pages, while the other books get their own subcategories. So, all the pages in, say [[Intermediate Algebra]] would go into [[:Category:Intermediate Algebra]], while all the pages in [[Algebra]] go into [[:Category:Algebra]], of which Category:Intermediate Algebra would be a sub-category.

:I'm not sure I see the use here, it's like including one book as a subcategory of another book. Plus, if you try to set up a subject page to list just the main pages of a book, you're going to include all the subpages as well. This organization would suggest that a book like [[Abstract Algebra]] was a subset of the [[Algebra]] book when the exact opposite relationship is true. 
:Also, consider if we have two books, X and Y, with Category:Y being a subcategory of Category:X. If we delete book X for whatever reason, the category system for Book Y gets all messed up. This creates a level of interdependence between books when we've traditionally tried to make books monolithic and independent. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:14, 10 May 2008 (UTC)
::Allowing lowercase titles is probably the worst option, IMO. &lt;code&gt;$wgCapitalLinks=false;&lt;/code&gt; would break many links, and is generally not useful here.

:::You're right, I was under the impression that [[:Category:Calculus]] and [[:Category:calculus]] would be different pages, but they apparently arent. With this realization, a capitalization-based scheme is obviously not acceptable.
::As for making &quot;Category:BOOKNAME (book)&quot;, it requires us to change the ''de facto'' way that our books have been categorized since the very beginning of Wikibooks, and the possibility is there that we will have to recategorize 1000 books (plus all subpages) or more. Plus, we will have to write documentation to require new book authors to use this new scheme, and we will have to include a check for proper categorization when new books are created. In short, it puts the burden on the book authors, a group of people who's life we should be striving to make ''easier'', not harder. Any system that decreases the usability of this site for the common author really isn't an acceptable one. Now, if we could find a way to abstract out the details into a template like {{tlx|BookCat}} or something, then it wouldn't be as big a deal. Still, we would have to go through ''every single page'' on wikibooks and include this template to make it work ubiquitously. Plus, there are lots of books that use header templates to include categories automatically, and those will need to be edited manually. I think it's just a lot of work. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:43, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

Hi, can someone create a green(fond) on black(background) style that is better for intensive reading.
Thanks for your attention and hope someone can help!

::Hi:   I am not sure that I like the colours but the usual way would be to put the whole page in &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags, and to include a style expression for the font.   If you copy this code line into the sandbox and Preview it, it will give the result below...

== Automatic Book Outline Tool ==

I've been hard at work for the last few days (as any RC patroller will probably tell you) working on a new JavaScript-based tool for designing and outlining new books. [[User:Mike.lifeguard]] did a quick beta test for me yesterday, from which I got a lot of good feedback. I have made a lot of improvements, and would like to get more feedback from a wider audience. Eventually, if things seem to work well, I would like to turn this into a gadget and actively promote it as a way for new users to easily and methodically create new books.

To install the gadget, add the following three lines to your [[Special:MyPage/monobook.js|personal monobook script]]:

 import_script('User:Whiteknight/gadgetscore.js');
 import_script('User:Whiteknight/categorize.js');
 import_script('User:Whiteknight/designer3.js');

Once these lines are added, do a hard reset in your browser (probably by pushing ctrl + f5, or similar), and go to [[User:Whiteknight/Visual Book Designer]]. This is the page where the form is located, although I have it set up as a template so it could be transcluded into other pages as well if desired.

The tool uses a visual outlining interface. You start with the main page of the book, and you can add subpages or headings. To those headings and subpages you can add more subheadings and sub-subpages, etc. The tool recurses so you can add as many levels of detail as you can fit on your screen. This means you have the flexibility to make Book/Page, Book/Chapter/Page, Book/Section/Chapter/Page, ... Once you have your outline, the tool has the ability to convert the outline into wikitext. It also has an AJAX interface where it can open an edit window automatically to save the generated text to the specified pages. You can add categorization templates too. Basically, it has a lot of features, and I would like people to play around with them. I would love to hear any and all feedback about this. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:58, 24 April 2008 (UTC)

::::WK, the basic idea is a very good one, I think this could become very useful (especially for people who have difficulty understanding the naming convention, this does it for them so that they'll learn what it's all about!). Is it possible to put a link to preview what the page will look like from the menu on the top? (next to edit, save, etc.) For someone who hasn't used it before, previews are nice to know what each function does / will look like when finished. 
:::: I didn't test it, but I presume that if you make a sub-page to a sub-page, those are all created too? I'd imagine it'd be pretty difficult to get those in a preview since the mediawiki software isn't set up that way.
:::: I think it's also pretty confusing having two different &quot;save&quot; functions, one which saves the book 'for real' and one which is a temporary save; would it be possible to change the latter labels so that it is clearer that these saves aren't permanent?

:::::Thanks for the feedback matt! A preview button would be a nice addition, and I could probably add a button for it pretty quickly. You're also right that having two functions to &quot;save&quot; is probably not intuitive. Maybe I could include the temporary save/load functions in a separate menu?
:::::I'm also working on a function to &quot;automate&quot;, using AJAX to perform edits on all pages in the outline in one button click. I'm hesitant to add this feature until we get the &quot;delete this book&quot; function for admins.

== Manual on Salt Lake Methods ==

Hi, I am Peri Coleman, completely new to Wiki-anything. 
I have been nagging away at anyone who cared to listen for some years about the need for a &quot;Standard Methods&quot; book for analyses of hypersaline brines. At the recent 10th International Society for Salt Lake Research triennial, held in Salt Lake City this month (May 08) a number of delegates agreed on the need and suggested to me that Wiki would be the place for it - Wikibooks in particular. So here I am, learning rather rapidly. I plan to get the basic outline up, then the various members of ISSLR will be approached to fill in the methods with which they are most familiar. Any pointers will be greatfully received.

== Rescuing and forking off the cookbook ==

For background: the cookbook was once one of our most successful collaborations, and in some ways helped us learn how Wikibooks should work. However, activity on the cookbook has been slowly decreasing over the last couple years. I'm guessing that has a lot to do with a lot of reasons, but the four that I can think of off hand are (1) [[User:Kellen]] is not very active any more, (2) there are a lot of websites out there allowing recipe sharing now, (3) the cookbook above all other books has served as a &quot;dump&quot; for the Wikipedians (who despise recipes as unencyclopedic), and (4) it's a big mess and no-one has dared clean it up.

I was a bit alarmed by [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook_talk:Table_of_Contents#Improvements_needed this discussion], but after thinking about it for a few weeks, I think I might have an idea. Kellen has a good point about remaking the cookbook as a '''textbook''' about cooking methods, ingredients, etc. ''Deleting'' all the recipes seems a bit over the top. 

I propose we transwiki the recipes of the cookbook to Wikiversity. There we could poll for yumminess, collect/collate/rate infinite numbers of variations on each recipe, and link it into other Wikiversity content related to availability of local foods, etc. The cookbook, as textbook, could then have content related to the history and &quot;basics&quot; of a recipe, and allow the back and forth of &quot;whose mom's meatloaf recipe is the best&quot; take place on Wikiversity (where participation is at least as important as content). 

My agenda is just this: I want to do outreach for the cookbook through churches and folks I know in the restaurant industry. It would be a lot easier to sell if we could have &quot;research projects&quot; where people try recipes, rate them, and make improvements towards recipes they don't like. 

I eagerly await your fruity missiles :) --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:55, 9 May 2008 (UTC)

: Forking is fine, but reducing the cookbook to only &quot;basic&quot; recipes doesn't sound so hot to me. I think a decrease in contributions is not a good reason to discourage recipes or to reduce its size. Maybe the cookbook has reached a point where there is enough coverage that there isn't much left to add, but variations. The cookbook could become a multi-wiki project if that is what's wanted, but I don't think anything needs to change in its scope or coverage. People seem to still be contributing to it, and someone may come a long at some point with the motivation to take over where Kellen left off. Nothing has to change here in order for the cookbook to be forked on another project and for you to achieve what you wish on WV, this isn't a WB issue, but a WV issue. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:29, 9 May 2008 (UTC)

: I don't have a clear idea of what your fork concept entails would it be a duplication of content (no deletion), and then reformat the relevant parts of it on Wikiversity? I don't see a particular need for this as the content can be referenced here and extended there and later synchronized, (I think I remember some proposal, not on Wikibooks, of Darklama on a similar solution for translation that addresses a similar synchronization problem, but can't find the link), but most of this we already do it here with articles on Wikipedia, we transwiki them here completely, partially (with attribution), or link to them and at least I try to maintain both (on Wikipedia I don't edit articles, but use the discussion pages to reference updates,etc...). One should keep in mind that one of the problems with forking is that it not only fragments the work but the contributors, and increases work for all, even to users, ultimately the optimal outcome of a fork is a merge and that is even more work...
: Moving the content out of Wikibooks doesn't seem to me the best path and the rational that it would fix the problem of new contributions is debatable. As a user it would upset me since I'm not and active on Wikiversity and so having the content forked there would have some impact, since I do use that book from time to time.
: The expressed needs to have a &quot;research project&quot; does seem suitable to Wikiversity but if it is not, you can even do it on your and other participants user space, since ultimately the content would be volatile and intended to be merge to the book.
: I haven't contributed content to that particular book, only minor edits but I would support any decission that users that have/are working on it to reformat or even fork the book (on the Wikibooks project) if no loss of content occurs. I strongly object to deletion of useful content from the Wikibooks project. For the rest the users that are willing to do the work and have been doing it should have a free hand on implementing any changes they come to &lt;u&gt;agree&lt;/u&gt; upon.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:29, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

:I do like the idea of the cookbook becoming more textbook-like, it's been a little bit of a sore thumb because it stands out as such a large example of a book which isn't textbook-like but is allowed to stay here anyway. I think the cookbook is great and valuable, but if it sets a bad example for new books and leads new authors into thinking the wrong things, then it hurts us more then it helps. That said, I definitely do not want to delete it.
:The point about there being an infinite number of recipes is also a problem, because it's a violation of our requirements that books have a finite scope. If I make a recipe and add paprika to it then I have a second recipe which is almost exactly the same except for a small variation. Trying to be a mere collection of recipes, then, is not good for the cookbook to do. 
:Better would be to talk about how to cook and cooking utensils/techniques, and use select recipes as examples of those ideas. It's the same way we show particular programs as examples of vague computer science topics.
:Doing it this way, a central narrative with copious examples, would seem to suggest a massive reorganization. For one, it probably doesn't need it's own namespace if it's going to have a more concrete organizational structure like ordinary books. As a collection of unrelated articles a namespace is fine, but as a traditional textbook about cooking this method is far less then ideal and probably would encourage people to write articles instead of chapters. 
:I'm also not interested in &quot;moving&quot; content to Wikiversity, although I am highly interested in &quot;Sharing&quot; content. If WV could use it's magic to rate and improve recipes, WB could discuss them. It would be a great way for us to work together. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:05, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

::Whiteknight, can't find a policy that defines that books must have a finite scope. I understand the intention but don't see how it would be enforcible, and it wouldn't be a good wording for a scope limiting policy, a book on mathematics, physics, languages (even computer languages) could suffer the same problem of never ending additions of &quot;recipes&quot;, examples and updates.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:26, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

:::You're right, the passage that I was referring to is actually part of [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]], which is not yet policy. Regardless, the scope is just one problem from many that could justify deletion of the cookbook under it's condition. So far we've avoided the issue for many reasons, but that doesn't mean it's really the model for aspiring textbook authors. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:33, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

::Well, what I had in mind was more what Whiteknight was referring to: judging by my experiences over the years and the most recent discussions by the main editors, it seems the recipes have been a distraction from the core goal (keep in mind that the vast majority of them are transwikis kicked our way by the wikipedian deletionist cabal, bless their hearts). As an &quot;outreach project&quot;, it would be a bit easier to point to one project as a starting point, and the cookbook as it is now is not such a great thing to point to. Adding a bit of paprika/lemon juice/marijuana/whatever is probably a minor thing, but not necessarily a trivial thing to the person who comes up with the idea. Wikiversity's scope is much more slanted towards community participation than end results, and while we of course want as much participation as we can get on Wikibooks, we're really aimed at an end result (i.e. textbooks). My hope is that this could take advantage of the strengths of both projects and communities by enticing people to edit and contribute in the &quot;come what may&quot; atmosphere on Wikiversity, and use the Wikibooks cookbook as a textbook (to be improved as often as possible and necessary). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:07, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

::: I'm against any moving of the recipes to Wikiversity (why move it to a virtually dead project?) or making it more textbook like.  It's a cookbook and that's what's good about it.  It still needs massive improvement.  Creating a Cookbook recipe (or any type of wiki book or article) is very difficult.  Wiki software and markup is not user-friendly and creating attractive pages is not easy.  I'm talking personally here and I have many years experience of the IT industry so if I find it difficult and time-consuming to make good wiki pages then ordinary non-geek editors probably won't even try.  Look at some of the other cooking and recipe websites out there.  Notice how they incorporate far more images, animated flash pictures and instant conversion from American measurements to standard metric measurements.  Notice how some of them include alternative recipes on the same page and how the presentation of the whole page is clutter-free and easy to read (why do Wikibook pages have to have the annoying wiki bar on the left, another bar at the top and then a copyright section at the bottom - so much wasted space and not relevent for people unless they are editors as opposed to readers).  We need to get the opinions of those who 'read' the Cookbook rather than the very small number of people who edit on Wikibooks (and rarely on the cookbook). --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:44, 11 May 2008 (UTC)

:::: I agree with most of what you've said. However I don't understand why you would think that anyone who contribute to other books, cannot be a reader, or doesn't read the cookbook. While I can agree that the opinions of readers need to be considered, I don't agree with the implication that people can't be both readers and contributors, that there opinions don't represent the views of a reader, or that anyone whose responded so far doesn't read the cookbook. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:50, 12 May 2008 (UTC)

::::: My point was that we need the views of the readers.  Most views and decisions on Wikibooks are expressed by us (the editors) but the vast majority of people who visit Wikibooks visit only to read (the same applies to all wikies, us editors are probably only a small part)--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:49, 12 May 2008 (UTC)

::::I would disagree with what Xania said about Wikiversity. Wikiversity isn't a &quot;dead project&quot; by any means. By my measurements, WV has edits at about 1/3 the frequency as Wikibooks does. It's also significantly younger then WB is, and is growing at a steady rate that is similar to the growth Wikibooks experienced when it was the same age. Of course, Wikibooks hasn't been particularly lively in recent months either, maybe we're becoming the &quot;dead project&quot;.
::::As for the stuff about the user interface, I agree, although it's an issue that affects more books then just the cookbook. The user interface is significantly more cluttered then it needs to be for either readers or writers. A solution may be to create a javascript that removes, for people who are not logged in) a number of unnecessary links and tabs from the main interface. That could be something we discuss in more detail at the [[WB:BUGS|Feature Requests page]]. 
::::The issue about difficulty editing wikitext is well-understood, but there is nothing that we can do about it from our end. The developers are going to have to create a better editing interface if we are going to have it at all. There are, I think, some things that we could try to do locally like creating better templates or boiler-plate text for Cookbook pages that insert all the necessary templates and categories automatically. 
::::Regardless, the cookbook really isn't a &quot;textbook&quot; as most of our other books are, and while I don't disagree that recipes have their place here as examples, the cookbook should really be a textbook first and a recipe book second. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:27, 12 May 2008 (UTC)
::::: I wasn't trying to dis wikiversity (well reading what I wrote it appears that I was).  The aim of Wikiversity has been explained to me many times but I still don't see the need for it and defining the difference between text books and courses seems unnecessary - if editors have trouble knowing where to put their work and understanding the differences then there's little hope for ordinary editors.  Can we have a good definition of 'text book' please? I'd assumed it was simply an instructional book which includes text.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:52, 12 May 2008 (UTC)

::::::* Wikibooks explains how something is done
::::::* Wikiversity explores why and the many ways how something can be done
::::::* Wiktionary defines what something means
::::::* Wikisource documents something previously published

== Dictionary extensions for the Firefox browser ==

Hi again,

Can anybody help with this problem?

As you know, the Firefox browser has a switch-on / switch-off spell-check for use in editing windows like Wiki.   It is limited however, to the ''common'' language as opposed to encyclopaedic knowledge.

Does anybody know of an extension to spell-check HTML and Wikitext?   In fact, is there a secret stash of dictionary add-ons anywhere for Wiki interests?

If so, it would help to clear the redlining which routinely results when tables or HTML is used in the editing of Wiki pages.

Thanks in advance for any help that users can provide.   [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]])

=Danish Gambit, Collijen Defense=
The Danish Gambit, Collijen Defense is popular among club players, but not so popular at the highest level.  That is because, it is easy for black to fall into one of the many traps on this line, but if black knows what to do, white can get no more than equality out of the opening.  

White has two main options from this position:
:[[/4. Bc4/]]
:[[/4. Nxc3/]]

Although it may have been known earlier, Danish player Severin From essayed the gambit in an 1867 Paris tournament and he is usually given credit for the opening.  The Danish gambit was popular with masters of the attack including Alexander Alekhine, Frank Marshall, Joseph Henry Blackburne, and Jacques Mieses, but as Black's defenses improved it lost favor in the 1920s.  Today it is rarely played in top-level chess.

White will sacrifice one or two pawns for the sake of rapid development and attack.  With care, Black can accept one or both pawns safely, or simply decline the gambit altogether.

      <comment>/* Installing the OS */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Installing the OS ==

First obtain a disk image from the [http://www.centos.org/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=30 Centos 6.2 Mirrorlist].  This guide is for 6.2/isos/i386/CentOS-6.2-i386-minimal.iso.

Boot from the CD and when the boot menu shows up hit tab and append &quot;linux text&quot;.  That means hit the tab key, space bar and then linux text.

*Skip media test
*OK to welcome screen
*OK to English
*OK to us keyboard layout
*Partition disk(s), for the most part it will be
**/boot with 100MB
**swap with 1024MB
**/ with remainder of disk (also enable force to be primary partition)
*OK to use GRUB
*OK - no kernel options needed
*OK leaving no GRUB password
*OK to use default boot loader configuration
*Use /dev/sda or /dev/hda to use the MBR part of the disk for the boot loader
*Default ethernet device settings are DHCP
*OK for system to use UTC and New York time zone
*Root password - make it good!
*Select Basic Server for the set of software

Now you have the minimal packages for working with a CentOS system.

== Obtaining the package and installing it ==

Starting with root...

&lt;pre&gt;
yum -y install yum-priorities
#first line is tools that are not included in minimal install
yum -y install wget httpd make vim nano man
yum -y install gcc gcc-c++ pcre-devel libpng-devel openssl-devel openldap-devel rrdtool-devel
wget http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el6.rf.i686.rpm
rpm -i rpmforge-release-*.rpm
yum -y install fping
yum -y update
echo &quot;all done with yum&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now reboot with the new kernel

Once you've rebooted we've got to get to configuring.  Let's start by changing the ServerTokens directive in httpd.conf

&lt;pre&gt;
nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

Change '''ServerTokens OS''' to '''ServerTokens Major'''

Add a user for Xymon to use. A popular user is xymon.

Make this easier and enable copy and paste

&lt;pre&gt;
XYMONUSER=xymon
echo $XYMONUSER
&lt;/pre&gt;

The echo should spit out changethis or whatever you want your Xymon user to be.

&lt;pre&gt;
echo &quot;helo&quot; &gt; /var/www/html/index.html
ln -s /etc/init.d/httpd /etc/rc3.d/S83httpd
/etc/init.d/httpd start
useradd $XYMONUSER
passwd $XYMONUSER
&lt;/pre&gt;

Make sure you pick a good password!

&lt;pre&gt;
chmod o+rx /usr/sbin/fping
chmod go+rx /home/$XYMONUSER
yum check-update
su - $XYMONUSER
cd ~
wget http://iweb.dl.sourceforge.net/project/xymon/Xymon/4.3.10/xymon-4.3.10.tar.gz
tar -xzf xymon*tar.gz
cd xymon*
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now compiling Xymon...

&lt;pre&gt;
./configure.server

I found fping in /usr/sbin/fping
Do you want to use it [Y/n] ?
y

Do you want to be able to test SSL-enabled services (y) ?
y

Do you want to be able to test LDAP servers (y) ?
y
Enable experimental support for LDAP/SSL (OpenLDAP 2.x only) (y) ?
y

What userid will be running Xymon [xymon] ?
$XYMONUSER
&lt;/pre&gt;

At this point accept the defaults until you see...

&lt;pre&gt;
What group-ID does your webserver use ?
apache
&lt;/pre&gt;
The rest will use default except the name of the '''host and IP address'''.  These two options will vary depending on the host's destined network installation.  Now compile the code:

&lt;pre&gt;
make
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now '''exit''' out to become root and finish with...

&lt;pre&gt;
cd /home/$XYMONUSER/xymon*
make install
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Groundwork Configuration ==

Let's stop those crawlers at the door!

&lt;pre&gt;
echo -e User-agent: *&quot;\n&quot;Disallow: / &gt; /var/www/html/robots.txt
mkdir -p ~$XYMONUSER/server/www
echo -e User-agent: *&quot;\n&quot;Disallow: / &gt; ~$XYMONUSER/server/www/robots.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;

You will need to take the configuration from the Xymon created xymon-apache.conf and place it in the Apache HTTPD running configuration.

&lt;pre&gt;
cp /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.orig
cat /home/$XYMONUSER/server/etc/xymon-apache.conf &gt;&gt; /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;

and also add some more configuration to httpd.conf around line 292 and 595 (under the Redirect comment)

nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

&lt;pre&gt;
DocumentRoot &quot;/home/xymon/server/www&quot;
RedirectMatch ^/robots.txt$ /xymon/robots.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now test the new httpd.conf and restart Apache HTTPD to those configurations.

&lt;pre&gt;
apachectl configtest
apachectl graceful
&lt;/pre&gt;

Create a user for the administrative scripts on Xymon and we're done working with Apache.

&lt;pre&gt;
htpasswd -c /home/$XYMONUSER/server/etc/xymonpasswd YOURUSERNAME
&lt;/pre&gt;

Next we'll want to steal the Xymon startup script and use it to start Xymon upon entering run level 3.

&lt;pre&gt;
cd /etc/init.d
wget http://iam8up.com/xymon-initd/xymon
chmod 755 xymon
ln -s /etc/init.d/xymon /etc/rc3.d/S70xymon
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST MODIFY /etc/init.d/xymon''' and will probably only need to change STARTBIN, STARTDIR and USERNAME as this example shows:

&lt;pre&gt;
STARTBIN=Xymon.sh
STARTDIR=/home/xymon
USERNAME=xymon
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now you want to open the firewall to allow this viewer to see Xymon's web page outputs.

nano /etc/sysconfig/iptables
&lt;pre&gt;-A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j ACCEPT&lt;/pre&gt;

This can go a lot of places, but this works

&lt;pre&gt;# cat /etc/sysconfig/iptables
# Firewall configuration written by system-config-firewall
# Manual customization of this file is not recommended.
*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
-A FORWARD -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
COMMIT&lt;/pre&gt;

SELinux causes a lot of problems for me.  You can do it the right way, but this guide is just to get it working.

Disable it for now
&lt;pre&gt;echo 0 &gt;/selinux/enforce&lt;/pre&gt;

Disable it upon boot

nano /etc/selinux/config
&lt;pre&gt;SELINUX=permissive&lt;/pre&gt;

You will need NTP for a time based application =)

&lt;pre&gt;
yum -y install ntp
cd /etc/rc3.d/
ln -s /etc/init.d/ntpd S11ntpd
ntpdate time.iam8up.com
/etc/init.d/ntpd start
clock -w
&lt;/pre&gt;

Make it so that Xymon has the capability of reading /var/log/messages

&lt;pre&gt;
chgrp $XYMONUSER /var/log/messages
chmod g+r /var/log/messages
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Installation Completion ==

You should have a Xymon server with basic configuration ready to go.  You can either reboot to confirm you have a working init script or just start it with

&lt;pre&gt;/etc/init.d/xymon start&lt;/pre&gt;

Wait about 5 seconds for Xymon to do it's initial run and you should be able to browse to your server at http://servername.com/xymon/

== Important Network Information ==

I personally disable SELinux and the firewall on my installations.  I have a dedicated firewall and a strong hate for SELinux.  I suggest installing security software - at the very least [http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/ DenyHosts].

If you want to run Xymon under SELinux, here is one recipe [[System_Monitoring_with_Xymon/Selinux]].

'''Content Creator Plus''' (CCP) is a Trainz database importer program that is included with TRS2006 and later releases. As it has been updated, some of the bugs that plagued the early version have been ironed out and advancements have been made in its usefulness. In essence, the CCP software requires definitions of assets to comply with Trainz standards, and provides fields for filling in and specifying the parameters which define which type asset the asset is ({{N3V|KIND}}s) and sub-classifications ({{N3V|Category-class}}) and which {{TL|Container}}s that KIND and category-class require. This 'scripts' the user into proper definition, formulation, and assembly of a complete simple or complicated {{wp|software component|multi-component}} by forcing definition of required {{wp|data type}}s needed by that type asset. Many older {{TL|Trainz assets}} can be successfully translated into newer Trainz releases and still exist on the {{TL|DLS}}. Many of those were mal-specified however, resulting in a translation problem that the {{TL|TrainzUtil}} utility cannot resolve, creating a {{TL|Trainz Error}}. Many times such errors are simple typos, or elements no longer used in the Trainz data model schema. These can be fixed using simple tools, most often, just a plain ordinary {{wp|text editor}} like the ubiquitous {{wp|Windows Notepad}} editor.

{{Trainz-sect-stub}}
CCP now serves the purpose of:

* Creating a folder for a new asset.
* Creating a config.txt file for a new asset.
* Checking assets for errors and reporting them.
* Allowing the user to edit the config.txt file as they wish, adding containers and tags as need be. 

A config.txt may still require manual editing for various reasons, one being the fixing of faulty assets. CCP is accessed from CMP or directly from the Trainz installation folder.

To use the CCP efficiently, it is essential to have the Content Creation Guide (CCG) at hand. For an asset to work correctly, CCP needs to be used with knowledge of Kinds of assets.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Introduction''' ==
Welcome to the K-12 School Computer Network wiki book!

=== Who is this book for? ===
This book is specifically targeted for the average K-12 school technical coordinator. The book is also useful for any educator interested in understanding the technology that envelops the school environment. Just as you do not need to be an auto mechanic to drive a car, it does help to understand the basics of its operation. 

=== Where does this come from? ===
This book is the effort of a multiple sessions of a course taught at [http://www.tc.edu/ Teachers College, Columbia University] titled &quot;Managing Educational Technology Resources&quot;. The authors are graduate students at Teachers Colleges and this book is an integral part of their course work.


Many of the students are either practicing technical coordinators in K-12 schools or are training with that goal in mind. This book is intended as a resource for K-12 technical coordinators in the field. Please leave comments and post ideas for new sections -- and of course, add content of your own. The course at Teachers College is password protected, but you can leave comments that you don't feel belong here in the instructor's technology blog: [http://techshoestring.blogspot.com/ Technology on a Shoestring].

=== Why this book? ===
As an instructor with more than twenty years of experience, one of the clearest lessons I've learned is that the closer an assignment comes to meeting a real situation, the better the resulting learning. It's one thing to ask a student to write as if the instructor was a member of the public or to have another student fill that role; it's entirely different when there really is a public – you are that public.

As for ''why ''Wiki Books, the answer is that this may be the best possible location to expose this information to the largest number of people. 

=== When will it be done? ===
The first edition will start in June and complete at the end of July. This will certainly not complete the book, but it should provide enough information as to make it useful. Generally, the course on Managing Educational Technology Resources is taught every other semester and during the summer. The first classes will focus on the basic writing with following classes adding extra materials and multimedia content. 

=== What does it cover? ===
Yes, there are books here on Wiki Books that cover ICT in education and various aspects of instructional technology. While valuable, they do not address the issues school technical coordinators have in putting all these elements together. Perhaps there is the assumption that technical coordinators are essentially the equivalent of a corporate network administrator. Yes, the firewalls and Ethernet cabling may be the same, but the meager school budgets and the unique environment of the school make the application of networking technology radically different from that experienced by the average corporate network administrator.

http://www.cot.cz/zobrazcl.php?id=5156

== Rødbede ==
&lt;pre&gt;Opskrifter og lidt baggrund:
http://www.landbrugslauget.dk/Forside/gamleNyhedsbreve/2005_43.htm

200 gram sukker
½ liter eddike
3-4 hele nelliker
8 sorte peberkorn.
2-3 laurbærblade
1 hel stang vanilje - flæk den og skrab frøene ud, og kog stang og frø med i lagen
Evt. skiver af peberrod og chilikapsler
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Tarhonya ==
Fry dry tarhonya in a pot with a bit of oil. After app. 5 minutes or when the tarhonya start to to turn brown, cover with cold water (2 volume units of water per 1 unit tarhonya) and continue heating. Don't stir anymore at all. When starting to boil, add salt to water and let simmer with lid on low heat until all water is absorbed. Fits letscho well.

Tarhonya is a traditional staple food which was made at home in large amounts by pressing the dry dough of flour, eggs and salt through a coarse sieve onto a big table (taking care that the small irregular balls didn't stick together). The tarhonya was then allowed to dry on the table (in the winther near the fire place, in the summer outside) and when completely dry, packed in sacks for storage. Tarhonya is today seldomly made at home, but can be bought in any Hungarian food store.

The effects at the beginning of the table become increasingly present when down-sizing.

== Examples in Nature of the hierarchy of forces ==

=== Insects can walk on water ===
[[Image:WaterstriderEnWiki.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[w:water strider|Water strider]] uses surface tension to walk]]
[[Image:PatteInsecte.svg|thumb|200px|right|Surface tension acts on the perimeter of legs]]
A contact line occurs on the legs of these insects. The leg surface is hydrophobic, and therefore the surfaced is curved downwards, which creates an upward tension force. 

The typical leg diameter  is l, and we can estimate the intensity of the forces:

* Capillary force scales like &lt;math&gt; \sigma \pi l&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; the surface tension, a force per unit length whose value is &lt;math&gt;\sigma=70.10^{-3} \mathrm{N/m}&lt;/math&gt;
* Weight scales like &lt;math&gt; \rho g l^3&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore weight is comparable to the capillary force at the characteristic leghtscale:

:&lt;math&gt;l^*=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{\rho g}}\simeq 3 \, \mathrm{mm}&lt;/math&gt;
Below this length capillary forces are preponderant. 

=== Smaller but stronger ===
How many times can you lift people of your size?

The structure of muscles is universal in the animal kingdom, with similar fibers of diameter &lt;math&gt;l_0&lt;/math&gt;. 
Each fiber can exert a maximum force &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. 
The number of fibers is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle l^2/l_0^2&lt;/math&gt;
* Muscular force exerted by a muscle therefore scales like 
:&lt;math&gt;F\sim P l^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P=f/l_0^2&lt;/math&gt; the maximum stress exerted by a fiber. It is a &quot;Natural&quot; constant, independent of the size. It can be evaluated for human beings as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P\sim F/l^2=100\; \mathrm{N}/10\;\mathrm{cm}^2\simeq 10^4 \;\mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt;, where we computed the typical force exerted by a muscle divided by its typical section area.
* The weight scales like 
:&lt;math&gt;W \sim \rho g l^3\,&lt;/math&gt;

The number of people you can lift is therefore 
:&lt;math&gt;N=\frac{F}{W}=\frac{P}{\rho g l}=\frac{H}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;H\simeq 1 \; \mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; a constant independent of size.

Humans (l~1m) can lift 1 people
Small ants (l~1mm) can lift 1000 people!

Note, that this force is used by a particuliar species of ants to jump.  These ants  strike their mandibules on the ground with a force that is 300 times its own weight, and propell themselves up to 10cm in height

      <text xml:space="preserve">The stars.dat file contains information about stars in a binary format. The format is as follows:

A 14-byte file header:
 8-byte character string   &quot;CELSTARS&quot;
 2-byte unsigned integer   version number = 0x0100
 4-byte unsigned integer   number of records in file

Followed by records of length 20 bytes of the form:
 4-byte unsigned integer   Hipparcos catalog number (=0 for Sol)
 4-byte floating point     x-coordinate in light years
 4-byte floating point     y-coordinate in light years
 4-byte floating point     z-coordinate in light years
 2-byte signed integer     absolute magnitude * 256
 2-byte unsigned integer   spectral class

The x, y and z coordinates are calculated as follows

&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\begin{array}{c}x \\ y \\ z\end{array}\!\right)
=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos\epsilon &amp; \sin\epsilon \\
0 &amp; -\sin\epsilon &amp; \cos\epsilon\end{array}\right)
\left(\!\begin{array}{c}
d \cos\theta\sin\phi \\
d \cos\phi \\
-d \sin\theta\sin\phi\end{array}\!\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;var&gt;d&lt;/var&gt; is the distance in light years, &lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt; = RA + 180°, &lt;var&gt;φ&lt;/var&gt; = Dec − 90° and &lt;var&gt;ε&lt;/var&gt; = 23.4392911°.

==Spectral class==

The spectral class is written as four hexadecimal digits 0x''KTSL''.

The ''K'' digit represents the kind of object, these are:
 K=0   normal star
 K=1   white dwarf
 K=2   neutron star
 K=3   black hole

The ''T'' digit represents the spectral type. It has different meanings depending on whether the object is a normal star or a white dwarf. This digit is ignored when the object is a neutron star or black hole.

       normal stars            white dwarfs
 -----------------------------------------------------
 T=0   spectral type O         spectral type DA
 T=1   spectral type B         spectral type DB
 T=2   spectral type A         spectral type DC
 T=3   spectral type F         spectral type DO
 T=4   spectral type G         spectral type DQ
 T=5   spectral type K         spectral type DZ
 T=6   spectral type M         unknown spectral type D
 T=7   spectral type R         spectral type DX
 T=8   spectral type S
 T=9   spectral type N
 T=a   spectral type WC
 T=b   spectral type WN
 T=c   unknown spectral type
 T=d   spectral type L
 T=e   spectral type T
 T=f   spectral type C

The ''S'' digit represents the spectral subtype. This digit is ignored for neutron stars and black holes.
 S=0   spectral subtype 0
 S=1   spectral subtype 1
 S=2   spectral subtype 2
 S=3   spectral subtype 3
 S=4   spectral subtype 4
 S=5   spectral subtype 5
 S=6   spectral subtype 6
 S=7   spectral subtype 7
 S=8   spectral subtype 8
 S=9   spectral subtype 9
 S=a   unknown spectral subtype

The ''L'' digit represents the luminosity class. This digit is only relevant for normal stars.
 L=0   luminosity class Ia-O
 L=1   luminosity class Ia
 L=2   luminosity class Ib
 L=3   luminosity class II
 L=4   luminosity class III
 L=5   luminosity class IV
 L=6   luminosity class V
 L=7   luminosity class VI (also written as prefix sd)
 L=8   unknown luminosity class

Thus a star of spectral type G2V uses the number 0x0426.

==Old format==
Prior to version 1.4.0, Celestia used a slightly different stars.dat format.

A 4-byte file header of the form:
 4-byte unsigned integer   number of records

Followed by records of length 25:
 4-byte unsigned integer   Hipparcos catalog number
 4-byte unsigned integer   HD catalog number
 4-byte floating point     Right Ascension in degrees
 4-byte floating point     Declination in degrees
 4-byte floating point     Parallax (in milliarcseconds?)
 2-byte signed integer     Apparent magnitude * 256
 2-byte unsigned integer   Spectral class
 1-byte unsigned integer   Parallax error * 200

Note that for current versions of Celestia, the HD catalog numbers are stored in the hdxindex.dat file.

Hello. I don't know how to mess with the formatting on this page, but it seems that the &quot;Nf6&quot; link actually links to d5. I'm pretty sure the link is correct (d5 is a common response in this opening), but the labelling is wrong. I would change it myself, but I don't know how.</text>

      <comment>/* Forces within a fluid */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The motion of fluid is described by applying the fundamental law of mechanics, known as [[Newton's second law]], not on a point particle but on a fluid.

== Fluid particle ==
[[Image:FluidParticle.svg|thumb|200px|right|Range of applicability of the fluid particle]]

A fluid particle is a volume, large enough to contain smooth the molecular variations, but small compared to the system size.
It is has mesoscopic character, intermediate between a microscopic (molecular) and macroscopic description.
A continuum approach is possible.



In '''liquids''' the fluid particle size an be larger than molecules and smaller than micrometric channels. 

In '''gases''' the mean free path &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; can be not smaller than the microsystem size, a specific approach is necessary.

The continuum approach allows to define, as a function of the position in space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and the time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;\rho (\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;, the mass density (unit kg/m^3)
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;, the velocity (unit m/s)

== Mass conservation ==
It writes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
For  incompressible fluids (which is almost the case with liquids, and gases at velocities small in front of the speed of sound), &lt;math&gt;\rho=\mathrm{cst}&lt;/math&gt;, and mass conservation implies a specific flow field that is divergence free,  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle div(\mathbf{v})=0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Forces within a fluid ==
[[Image:VolumeElement.svg|thumb|200px|left|Volume element with outward normal on a surface]]

Two kind of forces are present in a fluid:
* Isotropic  normal force: the '''pressure'''. They provide a component 
:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{f}=-p\, \mathbf{n}\,dS&lt;/math&gt;on a small element of surface &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; being the outward normal to volume element.
* Shear forces: due to internal friction they provide a component 
:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{f}=\mathbf{\tau}\, .\, \mathbf{n}\, dS&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; the shear stress tensor. 

For a [[w:Newtonian fluid|Newtonian fluid]] the shear stress tensor components are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij}=\mu\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the viscosity.

|-
| olive oil
| &lt;math&gt;0.1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| glycerin
| &lt;math&gt;0.85&lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Navier-Stokes equation ==
For a Newtonian fluid the Navier-stokes equation writes
:&lt;math&gt;\rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt;

The second term on the left hand side comes from the inertia of the fluid. It is a non-linear term that produces history dependent effect very present at the human scale or larger scale:
* swirls, tornados
* turbulence
* propulsive forces

However at small scales inertia is damped by viscous effects (second term on the right) that are preponderant.
The [[w:Reynolds number|Reynolds number]] provides an estimation of the ratio inertial forces/viscous forces:
if the typical velocity of the fluid is &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, and the typical size &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R\!e=\frac{\rho u l}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;.

At small scales &lt;math&gt;R\!e\ll1&lt;/math&gt;, and the second term &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; can be neglected, the Navier-Stokes equation becomes the Stokes equation. This equation is linear and easier to solve.
:&lt;math&gt;\rho \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}  = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity field solution of these equations is linear in applied stresses meaning:
* the solution is unique (whereas the full Navier-Stokes equation gives rise to turbulence and instabilities)
* the solution is reversed when the forces are reversed: it is impossible to create a fluid &quot;diode&quot; at small scales

It can also be shown that  the solution minimizes the total dissipated power.

== Boundary conditions ==
The equations of motions can be solved when boundary conditions are given at the surface of the fluid.
===For usual liquids===
there is a no-slip boundary condition, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;at the surface
===For gases, and for some non-wetting liquids ===
For gases, the [[w:Knudsen number|Knudsen number]] compares the mean free path to the typical lengthscale of the flow.
:&lt;math&gt;Kn=\frac{\lambda}{l}&lt;/math&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;Kn&lt;0.003&lt;/math&gt; the continuum approach still holds with no slip at the interface.
For &lt;math&gt;Kn&gt;0.01&lt;/math&gt; a molecular approach is necessary.
For intermediate numbers &lt;math&gt;0.003&lt;Kn&lt;0.01&lt;/math&gt;, Navier-Stokes still holds but 
there is a slip at the solid surface, defined by the Navier length &lt;math&gt;L_s&lt;/math&gt;, such that the slip velocity of the fluid is 
:&lt;math&gt;u_s=L_s\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; the distance to the surface.
Usually &lt;math&gt;L_s\simeq \lambda&lt;/math&gt;

For liquids, the debate is still open...

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:SCD algebraic notation.png|right|Chessboard notation|frame]]

'''Algebraic notation''' is used to record and describe the moves in a game of chess. It is now standard among all chess organizations and most books, magazines, and newspapers.

==Naming squares on the board==
Each square of the chessboard is identified with a unique pair of a letter and a number.  The vertical ''files'' are labeled '''a''' through '''h''', from White's left to White's right. Similarly, the horizontal ''ranks'' are numbered from '''1''' to '''8''', starting from White's home rank.  Each square of the board, then, is uniquely identified by its file letter and rank number.  The white king, for example, starts the game on square '''e1'''.  The black knight on '''b8''' can move to '''a6''' and '''c6'''.  Chess notations are a way to determine any unique point on the board.

==Naming the pieces==
Each type of piece (other than pawns) is identified by an uppercase
letter, usually the first letter in the name of that piece in whatever
language is spoken by the player recording.
:'''K''' for king
:'''Q''' for queen
:'''R''' for rook
:'''B''' for bishop
:'''N''' for knight (since '''K''' is already used).
Pawns are not indicated by a letter, but by the absence of such a letter—it is not necessary to distinguish between pawns for normal moves, as only one pawn can move to any one square.

==Notation for moves==
Each move of a piece is indicated by the piece's letter, plus the
coordinate of the destination square.
For example '''Be5''' (move a bishop to '''e5'''), '''Nf3''' (move
a knight to '''f3'''), '''c5''' (move a pawn to '''c5'''—no initial
in the case of pawn moves).

===Notation for captures===
When a piece makes a capture, an '''x''' is inserted between the initial and the destination square. For example, '''Bxe5''' (bishop captures the piece on '''e5'''). When a pawn makes a capture, the ''file'' from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial. For example, '''exd5''' (pawn on the '''e'''-file captures the piece on '''d5''').

===Disambiguating moves===
If two (or more) identical pieces can move to the same square, the piece's
initial is followed by (in descending order of preference):
# the '''file''' of departure if they differ;
# the '''rank''' of departure if the files are the same but the ranks differ;
# Both the '''rank''' and '''file''' if neither alone uniquely defines the piece (after a pawn promotion, if three or more of the same piece are able to reach the square).

For example, with two knights on '''g1''' and '''d2''', either of
which might move to '''f3''', the move is indicated as '''Ngf3'''
or '''Ndf3''', as appropriate.
With two knights on '''g5''' and '''g1''', the moves are '''N5f3'''
or '''N1f3'''.
As above, an '''x''' may be used to indicate a capture: for example,
'''N5xf3'''.

===Pawn promotion===
If a pawn moves to its last rank, achieving promotion, the piece chosen is indicated after the move, for example '''f8Q''', '''f8B''', or '''f8(Q)'''. The use of '''f8=Q''' is discouraged for technical reasons.

===Castling===
Castling is indicated by the special notations '''O-O''' for kingside castling and '''O-O-O''' for queenside castle.

===Check and checkmate===
:A move which places the opponent's king in check usually has the notation &quot;+&quot; added.
:Double check is sometimes represented &quot;++&quot;.
:Checkmate can likewise be indicated &quot;#&quot; (some use &quot;++&quot; or &quot;mate&quot; instead).

===End of game===
The notation '''1-0''' at the end of the moves indicates that white won, '''0-1''' indicates that black won, and '''½-½''' indicates a draw. Often there is no special indication of ''how'' a player won (other than checkmate, see above), so simply &quot;1-0&quot; or &quot;0-1&quot; may be written to show that one player resigned. Sometimes the word &quot;Resigns&quot; (or &quot;White resigns&quot; or &quot;Black resigns&quot; as appropriate) is used to show this.

==Example==
'''1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O'''.
Moves may be interspersed with text. When the score resumes with a black move, an ellipsis (...) takes the place of the white move, for example:

:'''1. e4 e5'''
:'''2. Nf3'''
:Black now defends his pawn'''
:'''2.&amp;nbsp;... Nc6'''
:'''3. Bb5 Nf6'''
:'''4. O-O'''

An ellipsis is also used when a score ''starts'' with a Black move (when the score is not of a complete game but starts from a diagrammed position). However, helpmates usually use an opposite convention; Black moves first by default and ''White'' moves are indicated with an ellipsis if no Black move precedes.

==Common shorthand notation==
===Regarding specific moves===
The following short-hand notations are sometimes used to comment single moves:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
  | style=&quot;text-align:center; width:3em;&quot; | !  || A good move
|-
  | style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;            | !! || An excellent move
|-
  | style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;            | ?  || A mistake
|-
  | style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;            | ?? || A blunder
|-
  | style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;            | !? || An interesting move that may not be best
|-
  | style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;            | ?! || A dubious move, but not easily refuted
|-
  | style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;            | TN || A theoretical novelty
|-
|}

===Regarding specific positions===
The following short-hand notations are sometimes used to describe the annotator's view of the balance of strength between White and Black, in respect to a specific position on the board:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This article uses [[Chess/Algebraic notation|algebraic notation]] to describe chess moves.''

A '''chess opening theory table''' or '''ECO (Encyclopedia Of Chess Openings) table''' presents lines of moves, typically (but not always) from the starting position. Notated [[chess]] moves are presented in the table from left to right. Variations on a given line are given horizontally below the parent line.

==Theory tables on Wikibooks==
Theory tables are a way of representing chess variations from a position in a quick reference manner. Chess opening books sometimes make extensive use of them to represent a good amount of information in a compact form. Here on Wikibooks the compactness is not so useful, but the quick reference manner can help the chess player familiar with theory tables quickly locate the information required.

==Arrangement==
Chess opening theory tables are commonly published in opening books with annotations by experienced chess players. These tables are typically arranged in a compact manner to allow experienced players to see variations from a position quickly. Usually, the table indicates that either White or Black has equal, slightly better, or better chances at the end of the variation. Sometimes, this information is distilled down to mere symbols or the percentage of games (usually tournament games) where White won – no information is usually given on what the assessment is based on or how to proceed in the game.

==Notation==
Typically, each table has a heading indicating the moves required to reach the position for which the table provides an analysis. The first row provides the move numbers with subsequent row representing different variations. White half-moves are shown above black half-moves. Ellipses (...) represent moves that, for the variation, are identical to the variation above. Bold type indicates that another variation is considered elsewhere – usually in another table. A dash (-) indicates that the variation transposes to a variation elsewhere. Transpositions are common in chess – a given position can often be reached by different move orders – even move orders with more or fewer moves.

It is common to add notes regarding whether a certain variation is considered better for White or for Black. This is done at the end (i.e. to the right) of every variation, using shorthand notation [[Chess/Algebraic_notation#Regarding_specific_positions|regarding specific positions]]. For instance, the remark += (or +/=) indicates that White has a slight advantage. If reversed (=+ or =/+) this would be true for Black instead.

==Example theory table==

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;[[/3. d5|d5]]&lt;br/&gt;Bc5&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Nc3&lt;br/&gt;d6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;=&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;[[/3. dxe5|dxe5]]&lt;br/&gt;Ne4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Nf3&lt;br/&gt;Nc6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;a3&lt;br/&gt;d6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;exd6&lt;br/&gt;Bxd6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Nbd2&lt;br/&gt;Bf5&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Nxe4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;+=&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Ng4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Nf3&lt;br/&gt;Bc5&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;e3&lt;br/&gt;Nc6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Be2&lt;br/&gt;O-O&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;O-O&lt;br/&gt;Re8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Nc3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;+=&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Bf4&lt;br/&gt;Nc6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Nf3&lt;br/&gt;Bb4+&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Nbd2&lt;br/&gt;Qe7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;e3&lt;br/&gt;Ngxe5&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Nxe5&lt;br/&gt;Nxe5&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;+=&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Shortcomings==
Chess opening theory books that provide these tables are usually quite large and difficult for beginners to use. Because the table entries typically do not include the themes or goals involved in a given line, beginners will either try to memorize the tables (not an easy task) or simply drown in the detail. '''[[Chess Opening Theory]]''' aims to bridge this gap by providing this type of information at the end of each line.

== Overview ==

'''''Fiendfyre''''' is an all-consuming form of fire, that can be created magically.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are looking for Ravenclaw's lost Diadem in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] when they are intercepted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]. Knowing that whatever Harry is looking for could restore his family in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|the Dark Lord]]'s good graces, Draco is intent on taking it from him. In the ensuing battle, Crabbe sets Fiendfyre, but evidently does not know how to stop it, and perishes in the flames.

The updraft from the fire does toss the Diadem up in the air, and Harry, then riding a broomstick, is able to catch it while making his escape.

== Analysis ==

It is noted that the flames make the shapes of a number of vicious magical creatures, presumably this is part of the reason for the name of the spell. We don't see the spell being cast; and in fact we have no way of knowing why Crabbe would have used this spell anyway as its purpose seems purely destructive.

It should be noted that a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], as we learned in the early part of this book, can only be destroyed by more than ordinarily magical means. For instance, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]] venom, for which the only known antidote is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Phoenix|Phoenix tears]], is not something that can be cured by ordinary means. Basilisk venom has been used to destroy all of the Horcruxes found to date; the Diadem was destroyed by simply bouncing around in the flames of Fiendfyre for a short while. This is a clear indication that Fiendfyre is not an ordinary magical form of destruction, but is unusually powerful in its effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thank you for contributing to Wikibooks.  I notice you have changed the ingredients for a recipe from 4 ounces to 100g.  I have to agree with you that it is much better, more accurate and of more use to use the metric system for these measurements but it seems to be Wikibooks policy to use both systems when necessary.  A book can use American measurements (imperial) or it can use World measurements (metric / standard) or it can use both but it is considered bad practice to ''remove'' one form of measurement for the other.  I have changed your edit so that the American measurements are given in brackets.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:31, 16 May 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Classic RequestResponse vs. AJAX Cycle */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{XML-MDE|prev=XUL|next=Web Services}}
AJAX is nowadays one of the most common used words in the WEB 2.0 era. While the historic remains of it are not really clear (similar logic to manipulate parts of a webpage was already thought of as DHTML, long before the term AJAX existed and suprisingly even using some type of DOM later on) it is now one of the most important technologies used by modern webdesigners. 
&lt;br&gt;But what does AJAX mean? - In short, AJAX stands for '''''A'''synchronous '''J'''avaScript '''a'''nd '''X'''ML''. It describes a concept of asynchronous data transfer (here: data encapsulated in XML) between the client (usually a webbrowser) and a server to only exchange/ alter a part of the webpage without the need of a full pagereload. That means the browser will issue an XMLHttpRequest in the background and receive only a part of the page - usually tied to one or more html-tags holding uids.

The following are the main components of the Ajax programming pattern.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;JavaScript - The most popular scripting language on the Web and supported by all major browsers. Ajax applications are built in JavaScript. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document Object Model (DOM) - Defines the structure of a web page as a set of programmable objects. In Ajax programming, the DOM allows us to redraw portions of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) - Provides a way to define the visual appearance of elements on a web page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XMLHttpRequest - Allows a client-side script to perform an HTTP request, effectively eliminating a full-page refresh or postback in Ajax applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML - It is sometimes used as the format for transferring data between the server and client, but other text-based formats work as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Ajax offers a number of advantages. Some of the most important are listed below.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower demand of bandwidth: The fact that it is not necessary to re-load a page completely when additional information is requested allows minimizing the data transfer. The demand of bandwidth is also reduced by producing HTML locally within the browser (note: however as we have additional overhead produced by the embedding of the JavaScript this is only true in case of more than one or two pagerequests from the same site).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser plug-in not necessary: Ajax runs with every browser which supports JavaScript. There is no additional plug-in needed. This is an advantage over technologies like Shockwave or Flash (note: in some cases however it is possible that some browsers behave different; especially IE prior to version 6 is known for odd behaviour).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separation of data and formats: This allows the web application to be more efficient. Programmers can separate the methods and formats for delivering information over the web. So they can use a language they are familiar with (note: the reason for this is CSS and not AJAX).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Websites more user-friendly: Because of the minimized data transfer the response to the actions of the user is much faster. Furthermore interfaces built with Ajax can be more user-friendly (note: however, AJAX without fallback to plain-vanilla HTML request-response cycle is infamous for beeing a big drawback to barrier free web design).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Classic RequestResponse vs. AJAX Cycle ==
&lt;!-- Image commented as it was deleted. &lt;center&gt;[[Image:Xml-Ajax.png]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt; --&gt;
As you can see in the image, the AJAX cycle embedds an additional JavaScript library into the client side. The JS lib therefor is used to communicate with the server (in case the AJAX is in use) as well as manipulating the HTML page it is embedded on. For a small example well now take a look at a so called AutoComplete (we take a look at basic procesing there and skip the detailed JS-DOM manipulating). The traditional approach on the other hand allways requires a full request-response cycle that sends the whole page from the server to the browser.

== A Simple Example: AutoComplete ==
This example shows a simple AutoComplete textfield from the wicket examples (wicket is a component oriented JavaWebFramework under the hood of the ASF - http://wicket.apache.org/). The example is online [http://wicketstuff.org/wicket13/ajax/autocomplete live here] so you can not only follow the code but rather see it live in action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Xml-autocomplete.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

The idea behind an AutoComplete textfield is to aid users by showing useful possibilites during the filling of the field. Imagine you are at amazon.com looking for a product &quot;foo&quot; and you fill it into the search bar just to find out that it doesnt exist after submitting it - with an AutoComplete aware field you would already have known that after some letters. To have an easy example we now will look at a single field where you can enter the names of countries like &quot;England&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot; or &quot;Austria&quot;.

The HTML behind it is rather easy (the necessary JavaScript is automatically provided by wicket; similar to what pure JS libs like prototype do; you could of course provide your own implementation, even if this would not really make sense):

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
... header containing CSS + HTML-head left out...
The textfield below will autocomplete country names. It utilizes AutoCompleteTextField in wicket-extensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

        &lt;form wicket:id=&quot;form&quot;&gt;
            Country: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; wicket:id=&quot;ac&quot; size=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
...footer left out...
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

So we currently only got a simple form holding a plain &lt;input /&gt;. The &quot;wicket:id&quot; is only for tying it to the Java code and has no impact on AJAX (in fact in production mode it will be stripped out).

The Java is also not too complicated:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class AutoCompletePage extends BasePage
{
    /**
     * Constructor of the AutoCompletePage
     */
    public AutoCompletePage()
    {
        Form form = new Form(&quot;form&quot;);
        add(form);

        final AutoCompleteTextField field = new AutoCompleteTextField(&quot;ac&quot;, new Model(&quot;&quot;))
        {
            protected Iterator getChoices(String input)
            {
                if (Strings.isEmpty(input))
                {
                    return Collections.EMPTY_LIST.iterator();
                }

                List choices = new ArrayList(10);

                Locale[] locales = Locale.getAvailableLocales();

                for (int i = 0; i &lt; locales.length; i++)
                {
                    final Locale locale = locales[i];
                    final String country = locale.getDisplayCountry();

                    if (country.toUpperCase().startsWith(input.toUpperCase()))
                    {
                        choices.add(country);
                        if (choices.size() == 10)
                        {
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }

                return choices.iterator();
            }
        };
        form.add(field);

        ...more Java here, but not needed for this simple example case...

    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

So we see here a plain page that gets a Form attached. That Form on the other side holds an ''Ajaxified'' version of a TextField. The ''protected Iterator getChoices(String input)'' is called after hitting a key (entering some value into the field by using your keyboard) by an AJAX call (we see this later) - meaning this function is the representation of the business logic for the AJAX. Here we only check if we already have sth. entered (user may delete sth.) and if it is, then if there are countries existing that start with the already entered letters (e.g.: if you enter ''Aus'' it will find coutries like Austria and Australia).

The resulting WebPage will be this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;!--/*--&gt;&lt;![CDATA[/*&gt;&lt;!--*/

var clientTimeVariable = new Date().getTime();

/*--&gt;]]&gt;*/&lt;/script&gt;


	...title + css stripped out...
       &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;resources/org.apache.wicket.markup.html.WicketEventReference/wicket-event.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
       &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;resources/org.apache.wicket.ajax.WicketAjaxReference/wicket-ajax.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
       &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;resources/org.apache.wicket.ajax.AbstractDefaultAjaxBehavior/wicket-ajax-debug.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;resources/org.apache.wicket.extensions.ajax.markup.html.autocomplete.AutoCompleteBehavior/wicket-autocomplete.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; &gt;&lt;!--/*--&gt;&lt;![CDATA[/*&gt;&lt;!--*/
Wicket.Event.add(window, &quot;domready&quot;, function() { new Wicket.AutoComplete('i1','?wicket:interface=:1:form:ac::IActivePageBehaviorListener:1:&amp;amp;wicket:ignoreIfNotActive=true',false);;});
/*--&gt;]]&gt;*/&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    
   ...head stripped out...
    

		The textfield below will autocomplete country names. It utilizes AutoCompleteTextField in wicket-extensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

		&lt;form action=&quot;?wicket:interface=:1:form::IFormSubmitListener::&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; id=&quot;i2&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;i2_hf_0&quot; id=&quot;i2_hf_0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			
			Country: &lt;input value=&quot;&quot; autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; size=&quot;50&quot; name=&quot;ac&quot; onchange=&quot;var 
                        wcall=wicketSubmitFormById('i2', '?wicket:interface=:1:form:ac::IActivePageBehaviorListener:3:&amp;amp;wicket:ignoreIfNotActive=true', null,null,null, function() 
                        {return Wicket.$$(this)&amp;amp;&amp;amp;Wicket.$$('i2')}.bind(this));;&quot; id=&quot;i1&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;/form&gt;

		
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;!--/*--&gt;&lt;![CDATA[/*&gt;&lt;!--*/

window.defaultStatus='Server parsetime: 0.0070s, Client parsetime: ' + (new Date().getTime() - clientTimeVariable)/1000 +  's';

/*--&gt;]]&gt;*/&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

So we now got our html decorated with a bunch of JS resources (holding the DOM parser, transformer and so on) as well as a JS behaviour to our &lt;input&gt; field using the ''onchange=&quot;...&quot;'' JS method.

If you now start entering some chars like &quot;au&quot; into the field, the onchange event is triggered and will call the wicketSubmitFormById() method issueing a call to the server and receiving XML:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
1  INFO: focus set on i4
2  INFO:
3  INFO: Initiating Ajax GET request on ?wicket:interface=:1:form:ac::IActivePageBehaviorListener:1:&amp;wicket:ignoreIfNotActive=true&amp;q=au&amp;random=0.9530900388300743
4  INFO: Invoking pre-call handler(s)...
5  INFO: Received ajax response (85 characters)
6  INFO:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li textvalue=&quot;Austria&quot;&gt;Austria&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li textvalue=&quot;Australia&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
7  INFO:
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

In line 1 the focus on the field (here with uid i4) was set. After we entered &quot;au&quot; into the field in line 3 an AJAX request to the server is issued. Line 4+5 illustrate the pre-call handlers and the receiving of the AJAX response. Line 6 displays the already decoded content of the response, holding a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; with the 2 expected countries that are starting with &quot;au&quot; and that are now placed by the JS header libs at the appropriate place on the page.

You now have seen a small, simple example in the big world of AJAX. To really understand it you should [http://wicketstuff.org/wicket13/ajax/autocomplete watch and use it live] (dont forget to hit the &quot;wicket AJAX debug&quot; link on the right lower corner, so you can see the communication). Under http://wicketstuff.org/wicket13/ajax/ you'll find plenty more running examples all with code.

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

My advice for Wikibooks is that they be more than just phrases, in order to be more useful. Grammatical forms are good to practice phrases with, but perhaps that's not the way this is set up. At least, I suggest that the creator of lists adds some exercises so that students may practice the phrases. Even if we do not add exercises, which at the inefficient level of information may not even be very useful, a way to improve phrases themselves is to turn them into actual usable sentences or parts of sentences, not just individual terms which will obviously already require great knowledge of the language. Therefore, instead of just &quot;bus stop&quot;, the phrase might be &quot;Where is the bus stop?&quot; or something to that effect.

I added some of what I was suggesting; however, I am not proficient in Romanian, so I appeal to those who are. P.S. If anyone has found these additions helpful, please let me know. This is based on what works for me and in theory, but feedback is good.

== Despre mine / About me ==
Because I have edited page(s) about the Romanian language, I must say that I am by no means fluent in the language. However, I have studied it to the intermediate level, and I have my own interests in promoting the language online. Also, an excellent book which gives me ideas is called Îmi place limba română by Boţoman, Corbin, and Walters - for beginner-intermediate learners.

I have studied several languages, mostly independently and online, and I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Linguistics. Therefore, I hope you can expect of me fairly high quality contributions. Nevertheless, I can only promise so much as a non-fluent speaker of a given language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cquote|The residence of the Plymouth settlers in the Netherlands, and the later conquest of the Dutch colonies, had brought the Americans into contact with the singularly wise and free institutions of the Dutch.|||Albert B. Hart}}

==Nine Years War==
In 1686 the Dutch joined The League of Augsburg along with Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the Holy Roman Empire. The goal of the alliance was to resist growing French aggression in Europe. France had expected a benevolent neutrality on the part of James II's England, but after James's deposition and replacement by his son-in-law William of Orange, Louis's inveterate enemy, England declared war on France in May of 1689, and the League of Augsburg became known as the &quot;Grand Alliance&quot;, with England, Portugal, Spain, the United Provinces, and most of the German states joined together to fight France.

At the start of the War, the French had enormous success especially in the Spanish Netherlands. They began to push into the Spanish Netherlands, until they were finally stopped at the Battle of Walcourt. The French quickly recovered from their defeat with a victory at the Battle of Fleurus. The French were also successful in the Alps in 1690, with Marshal Catinat defeating the Duke of Savoy at the Battle of Staffardand occupying Savoy. The French were also successful at sea in 1691, defeating an Anglo-Dutch fleet at the Battle of Beachy Head. The French followed up on their success in 1691 with victories Mons and Halle. Also at this time the French continued their advance into Italy. The Dutch and English, very worried about Frances success, attempted to drive the French out of the Spanish Netherlands but were defeated at the Battle of Steenkerque in 1692.

Despite astounding French success on continental Europe, they were less successful in Ireland. An Army comprised of mostly Dutch troops under the command of Godert de Ginkell, defeated the Irish and French troops at the Battle of Aughrim, which resulted in the surrender of the French and Irish troops in Ireland.

French success in the seas would soon end. After an Anglo-Dutch victory at Battle of La Hougue the French lost control of the Channel for good. The allies were now free to make full use of their own, to harass the French coast, to intercept French commerce, and to cooperate with the armies acting against France.

For the next 6 years the Dutch role in the war was very minor. The Treaty of Ryswick was signed on September 20, 1697. In the Treaty the French paid the Dutch a sum of 16,000 pagodas.

==War of Spanish Succession==
The War of Spanish Succession would be the last war that the Dutch would be a major power in. Spanish King Carlos II.,of the Habsburg Dynasty, died in 1700 and was without a male heir. France wanted to see a new dynasty on the throne. Europe's other powers were interested in both preventing France from extending her influence, and in preventing another long and costly war. In February 1701 Philip of Bourbon, 17 years old and named heir to the throne by Carlos II, entered a cheering Madrid; he was crowned King Philip V.
[[Image:Duke-of-Marlborough-signing-Despatch-Blenheim-Bavaria-1704.jpg|thumb|250px|The Battle of Belnheim]]
The Austrians, English the Dutch and the Portuguese, stood together against France and Spain. In 1702 the French had occupied the Spanish Netherlands in order to keep it safe for Spain. The Duke of Marlborough, commanding English-Dutch-Danish and Austrian troops, was victorious in the Battle of Blenheim 1704, Austrian forces in the Battles of Ramillies 1706, Oudenaarde 1708, and an Austro-English-Dutch force was also victorious at the Battle of Malplaquet in 1709.

The Anglo-Dutch fleet inflicted major damaged on the Spanish and French navies at the Battle of Vigo Bay.

In 1701 Austria had invaded Lombardy. Over the next six years, with the Anglo-Dutch Navies in control of the Medderteranian, the Austrians would push the French and Spanish troops off Italy.

The peace treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt formally ended the war in 1714. The Spanish Netherlands, for the most part, had gone to Austrian Control, Spain ceded most of its possessions in Italy and Philip V was still on the Spanish throne.

==War of the Quadruple Alliance==
On August 2nd 1718, Great Britain, Austria, France and the Dutch Republic concluded the Quadruple Alliance, formed in order to contain Spain.

Spain began hostilities against the Holy Roman Empire by invading the island of Sardinia, given to Austria by the Treaty of Utrecht ending the War of the Spanish Succession. Shortly thereafter, the Spanish advanced, invading Sicily, which had been awarded to the Duke of Savoy.

The Dutch joined the war in 1719. Spain fared poorly in the war. A French army under the Duke of Berwick invaded the Basque provinces of Spain almost without resistance in April 1719, before being forced back by disease. Meanwhile, British and Dutch fleets captured Vigo and Pontevedra in October, and that same month,Messina surrendered to the Austrians.

Spain made peace with the allies at the Treaty of The Hague on February 17, 1720. Included in the terms of this treaty, the Duke of Savoy was forced to exchange his throne in Sicily for that of the less important Kingdom of Sardinia

This section is intended for the students enrolled in the Managing Educational Technology Resources. The list below are the expectations required of each student in terms of writing this book.


# Each student should write approximately 2000 words for their assigned section. Students may combine into teams, but the total still needs to be a multiple of 2000 per student. A section will in most cases be a single topic, but it may be several shorter topics. Please send the instructor a copy of your content via email.
# Each 2000 word section should include at least one image or diagram. As with all content, all materials must comply with Wiki Books standards. 
# Each 2000 word section should have the below listed types of references. In all cases, the student should pick references that are relevant, authoritative, and will be likely found by readers months and years later. 
## Two traditional references
## Two references to non-traditional sources, such as to Wikipedia.
## Two links to external sources of relevant help, such as a resource web site or blog. 


While knowledge of wiki editing is not a stated objective of the assignments, it is a valuable skill to know and will enhance the presentation of the content.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_%28software%29 Blender] is a complicated professional grade 3d modeling tool which has been used to create static and animated models, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_Frankie! computer games], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation animated], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film short] films. You can either go directly to Trainz Specific Moving House tutorial below or you may wish to spend time learning to use the software proficiently before attempting to create content for Trainz. There are many sources of information on Blender, including high school and college level courses, forums, and tutorials.

===Courses===

*A free [http://www.cdschools.org/Page/455 high school level course], created by James Chronister, of Central Dauphin High School, in Harrisburg, PA.

*A free [http://gryllus.net/Blender/3D.html college level course], created by Neal Hirsig of Tufts University.

===Sources for help===

Besides the official [http://www.blender.org/ Blender] site, from which the software can be downloaded, and at which the user can find [http://www.blender.org/forum/index.php forums], and [http://www.blender.org/education-help/tutorials/ tutorials] there are a number of third party sites which offer tutorials or forums supporting Blender. As of first quarter 2013, these include (but are not limited to)

*[http://blenderartists.org/ Blenderartists.org]
*[http://www.blenderguru.com/ Blenderguru.com]
*[http://blendertut.com/ Blendertut.com]
*[http://www.blendertutor.com/ Blendertutor.com]
*[http://cgcookie.com/ cgcookie.com]
*[http://rab3d.com/ rab3d.com]

Youtube also hosts a number of channels of material by people creating Blender tutorials.

===Other Considerations===

*Because Trainz uses phototextures exclusively, users wanting to create content will be well advised to have working knowledge of image manipulation software which is capable of writing image files in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jpeg jpeg] and uncompressed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA ~.tga] formats. 

There was a major update to Blender effective with version 2.50, issued in July 2010, which dramatically changed the user interface. Unfortunately, many of the tutorials for Trainz were created with the older interface, and while users well versed in more recent versions of Blender can complete the tutorials, less accomplished users who want to use the older interface can still obtain that version of the software used in the tutorials from the [http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.49b/ download site]. 


The first thing you have to do is install Blender.  So go directly to http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Trainz/Tutorial_for_Blender#Getting_started
and follow the instructions on installing Blender and the exporter.

===Trainz Specific Moving House tutorial===

The recommendation is to watch the video tutorials http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Trainz/Tutorial_for_Blender#Video_tutorials_from_Blender.org before attempting the basic house tutorial but it is not essential to do so. 

Next you need to create something then export it.

*{{stage short|00%|February 19, 2008}}''[[/Tutorial to build a basic house:/]]''

*{{stage short|00%|February 19, 2008}}''[[/Tutorial to build a basic house:2.65 /]]''

To texture this house download &lt;code&gt;kuid:86627:2491&lt;/code&gt; or any version of it such as &lt;code&gt;kuid2:86627:2491:3&lt;/code&gt;.  You want the texture file from it (&lt;code&gt;Terrace one.tga&lt;/code&gt;).  Use that file and the 
texture tutorial to texture the house.  It is a 3.25 Mb download so if you don't have a first class ticket you might do better downloading it from [http://www.trainzproroutes.com/downloads TrainzProRoutes.com]. The object is called ''[http://trainzproroutes.com/downloads/index.php?act=view&amp;id=1177 Leopold Lane slate roof with front yard and pavement]''.

*{{stage short|00%|February 19, 2008}}''[[/Tutorial to texture a basic house:/]]''

*{{stage short|00%|February 19, 2008}}''[[/Tutorial to texture a basic house: in 2.65 /]]''

To export the house:

*{{stage short|00%|February 19, 2008}}''[[/Tutorial to export a basic house:/]]''

*{{stage short|00%|February 19, 2008}}''[[/Tutorial to export a basic house: in 2.65 /]]''

To convert it into a moving house:

*{{stage short|00%|February 19, 2008}}''[[/Tutorial to create a moving house:/]]''
*{{stage short|00%|February 19, 2008}}''[[/Tutorial to create a moving house: in 2.65 /]]''

If we change the shape we can actually get a reasonable basic wagon out of it.



Also please note that Paul Hobbs has three blender tutorials here: http://www.44090digitalmodels.co.uk/

These tutorials cover a lot of material quite quickly and Paul is very knowledgeable.

Under the heading '''Textures''' is a basic tutorial that will guide you through creating a cylinder in Blender then exporting it as a scenery object and also as a wagon into Trainz.  Sample config.txt files for cylinder are available on the DLS.  Please do the video getting started tutorials first.

Blender is a big complex product but we only need a sub section of the features for building models for Trainz, so start with the tutorial under Textures then have a look through the getting started videos, especially the interface ones.


Things you may find useful when working with Blender.

Under File is &quot;load factory settings&quot;, in Blender it is possible to change the default this one gets you back to sanity.

When texturing with an external .tga file the exporter expects a certain type of texturing.  Even if you can see it in Blender it may not export. F6, choose as texture type &quot;Image&quot; and load your image file.

b is box select, ie select everything in the box.

Trainz requires absolute sizes and positioning. Type &quot;N&quot; to bring up a properties dialog so you can type in dimensions directly.  Note the name is entered here OB:a.limback etc.  You can select or search and select an object in the outliner window / view, then mouse over to a 3d view where you can tab to edit.  You may need to experiment in outliner to find the view that lets you select.

Working with four 3D windows above the button window makes sense.  If you go into user preferences (click the mouse just below the file add labels and pull them down) click on the view name button each quadrant will be labelled.

Number pad 0 is camera view, the others are 1 3 7.  &lt;Ctrl&gt;3 or &lt;Shift&gt;3 gives the opposite side etc. 5 changes from ortho view to perspective.

fa: next to the www.blender.org 2.46 gives the number of faces, multiply by 2 to get poly counts.  M move the selected item to a different level to see the poly count for a selected item.  You can reduce the poly count be selecting unseen faces then deleting them.

F9 brings up the double sided button to turn off double sided texturing.

Use append (&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;F1&gt;)to combine things from two files. http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/Using_Linked_Libraries

To change the texture file name F6, then change the file name under still. 

To pick out an item by name use the outliner.

When creating an animated load note that the first and last frame seem to interact so the highest load should be the frame before last or a wagen with no load may show the high load when empty.  Also export with the frame number set to the highest number.

To tile a texture in Blender 
&quot;Select your plane, press F, press A until all the faces are selected, and then in the UV image editor press A a few times untill everything is selected.
Press S and scale it up.  That is it... just scale it bigger then the UV texture window and it will automatically tile for you&quot;

Importing from GMAX into Blender

The process is:

http://www.44090digitalmodels.co.uk/

first tutorial setting up GMAX.

Page 6 and 7 refer to Tempest game pack this gives you a MD3 export. It also tells you were to download the tempest game pack. If you get desperate I think I have it somewhere. Getting out of GMAX is the most difficult part.

Then go here:
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/...trunk/blender/

copy all the scripts into your Blender script folder.

Import md3.

== Getting started ==

:What you need to create content for Trainz with Blender is obviously [http://www.blender.org/ Blender] itself Note 2.49b the version that many Trainz specific tutorials use can be obtained here [http://download.blender.org/release/ Blender2.49b ] and the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/blenderextrainz/ Blender Exporter for Trainz]. The script was developed for Blender 2.45, by Torsten but any later version should work also. To use the Blender Exporter for Trainz, you must unzip the archive and copy the included file ''trainz_exporter.py'' into the script directory of Blender. This is normally the folder ''scripts'' located in the subdirectory ''.blender'', so if you install Blender on a Windows system using the default path, you have to copy the file ''trainz_exporter.py'' from the archive into the folder ''C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts''. On some Blender installations it maybe found in Application Data\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts under document and settings, application data maybe a hidden folder / directory in windows which makes locating it difficult sometimes especially on Windows 7 machines where you may have to turn off UAC to reach it. Alternately if you have two different versions of blender installed or have upgraded from one version to the another you will find additional folder in the &quot;\Application Data\Blender Foundation\Blender&quot; location. Open the folder for the current version of blender your using for example &quot;Application Data\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.60\scripts\addons\&quot;

For Blender 2.5 and later you need the exporter at bitbucket also by Torsten [https://bitbucket.org/uschi0815/blender-exporter-for-trainz/downloads/ bitbucket.org]. The scripts that are available for download work with blender 2.65 at the time of this writing.

You also need to copy in the Auran XML importer, needed for Blender etc. http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5/Downloads then download Trainzimporter.rar

Every time Blender starts it scans this directory and include any scripts found into its menu structure. So if you start or restart Blender after copying the exporter script then you call it using the Blender menu '''File &gt; Export &gt; Trainz Export'''. After selecting what you want to export and if no problems occur you find yourself in Blender's file save dialog. Choose the desired location and filename and press '''Save''' to finally create the resource file. You should always check the Blender console for infos or warnings, as the exporter only stops at fatal errors.

Help for Blender is here: http://blenderartists.org/forum/

and this thread on the forum contains lots of useful information.  http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?89501-Blender-Exporter-for-Trainz&amp;highlight=Blender

== Blender settings ==

We are still experimenting with the Blender settings in order to get the best results in Trainz. Nevertheless, the following suggestions should be noted:

*In Blender it is not possible to set a reference scale for Blender units, unlike in GMAX where we can specify that one GMAX unit equals, say, one metre. In Blender, simply assume that one Blender Unit (BU) is one metre. This is the assumption that is built in to the Trainz Blender exporter. If you want to use imperial units, then you may wish to explore the [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.4/Py/Scripts/Mesh/BMAE Blender Mesh Attribute Editor] script.
*If you want to move an object to an absolute position, then change to Object Mode via {{key press|Tab}} then press {{key press|N}}. The Transform Properties window will appear, then you can enter the values you need. A word of warning, however: &lt;code&gt;LocX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LocY&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LocZ&lt;/code&gt; refer to a coordinate in the local coordinate system. These refer to a coordinate in the world coordinate system only if the object does not have a parent. If you have already assigned a parent, then you must enter the location relative to that parent.
*Not all material properties visualized in Blender will have an effect in Trainz, and some effects achievable in Trainz are unable to be visualized in Blender. Therefore be sure to take a look at your model in Trainz, and do not trust what you see in Blender.
*Regarding textures: only diffuse, opacity, reflection and normal maps have any effect in Trainz. You can also export meshes that do not have any texture.
*If your installation folder is on your boot drive and in Program Files, you should also ensure that your temp folders (set in user preferences) are somewhere else or Blender will have problem writing temp files.

== Objects ==

=== Meshes ===

:Meshes are the Blender objects you will see in Trainz. You can build your objects by manipulate Blender primitives or even place vertices and create faces. Just keep in mind the following things:

:*center your creation around the point of origin, as Trainz place this point at cursor position when you insert the asset

:*Faces can be double or single sided, in Blender this is a mesh and not a material option. You will recognize the difference only in Trainz, as Blender render faces always double sided.

:*every mesh needs a material; you can use one material for different meshes

:*keep an eye on vertex and face count

:The Exporter only recognizes meshes which are visible during export. Make sure all objects you want to export are visible and you have selected all needed layers too! There are two reasons for this behaviour: First, nothing will be exported what you not see(maybe a long forgotten test mesh). The second reason is that you can hold big or animated objects in one Blender file and export only the needed parts by changing visibility(here the layers comes into play).

=== Bones ===

:The term '''bone''' in this section stand in general for a helper object to build up hierarchical animation systems. It is '''not''' related to the subobject ''Bone'' contained in Blender ''Armatures''. Up to now, the Blender Exporter only recognizes '''Lattices''' as valid bone-objects.   

:Here are two tutorials to get a clue about animation basics in Blender:  
::• Animation do this video tutorial first to understand the basics like where the frame number is. [http://www.blender.org/education-help/video-tutorials/animation/]
::• Next for simple animation such as we use in Trainz do this tutorial. [http://feeblemind.tuxfamily.org/dotclear/index.php/2005/03/08/17-didacticiel-animations-simples-1ere-partie---tutorial-simple-animations-1st-part]

:As soon as you want to animate your asset, there is no way around using bones. You can create bones by placing a Lattice('''Add &gt; Lattice''') and rename it to something like ''b.r.something'' as it is described for the bone naming conventions in CCG. 

:Note the animation works by making the bone b.r.rot etc a parent of object then the animation is applied to the bone.

:If you use bones you need to build up a complete hierarchy, that mean starting from a root bone all other bones or meshes need to be child of this root bone or any subordinated bone. The Exporter will fail if you have loose meshes or bones, because unbound meshes will not shown in Trainz.

:The root bone should be located at the point of origin and should not be rotated. Best practice might be to place it in top view (Hotkey '''NumPad 7''') and leave it untouched. The root bone also must not be animated; it serves as parent for any not animated mesh within this asset and for any bone which is not driven by/depending on an animated parent.

:To export bones they must be visible; so watch your Outliner and your Layers.

=== Attachment Points ===

:Attachment points are used in Trainz to attach effects, tracks or even other meshes. To create an AP you have to add an Empty first('''Add &gt; Empty'''). Afterwards place and rotate it like you need and give it a name following the CCG-Rules for APs(''a.whatsoever'', do you remember? ;)). APs don't need a parent, as this information will get lost during export. To although made animation possible, Trainz use an extended naming schema. Assume you have a bone ''b.r.john'' and an AP ''a.doe''. To tell Trainz that ''a.doe'' should be animated like ''b.r.john'', you must rename the AP to ''a.r.john/a.doe''. In your config.txt this AP is still to refer as ''a.doe''.

:What is valid for meshes and bones, is also valid for attachment points: If they are not visible, they will not be exported.

== Materials ==

=== Colors ===
:You can manipulate diffuse and specular color in Blender to give the material in Trainz the appearance you want. Both you find at the material panel, '''Col''' for diffuse and '''Spe''' for specular color:
[[Image:Materialpanel.png|frame|center|1 - Blender material panel]]
:There are two other colors supported by Trainz: ambient and emissive.

:The ambient color in Blender work different from Trainz and as in most cases ambient and diffuse color will be equal,  ambient color is copied from diffuse color during export. The emissive color is used for self illumination in Trainz and not provided in Blender. As things normally have the same color even if lighted or light, the Exporter here also copies the value of diffuse color.

:If you plan to use textures you should set the diffuse color to pure white, else your textures will appear darker in Trainz than expected.

=== Opacity ===

:Also on the material panel you find the slider for Opacity, in Blender called Alpha(slider '''A''' down at the right side). A value of 1 means the material is completely visible, a value of 0 render your material completely invisible. If you use texture maps which also affect the opacity, then better leave the Alpha-slider at its right position as the over all opacity will not be higher then the material opacity.

=== Specularity ===

:Specularity can be adjusted using the '''Shaders''' panel. The interesting sliders are '''Spec''' (specularity) and '''Hard''' (hardness) in the middle of the panel:
[[Image:Shaderpanel.png|frame|center|2 - Blender Shaders panel]]
:The '''Spec''' (&quot;specularity&quot;) slider adjusts the intensity of specular color from 0 (no specular highlight) to 2 (full specular highlight), while the '''Hard''' (&quot;hardness&quot;) slider adjusts the intensity of the reflected light. A high hardness value gives a hard specularity (imagine glass or an polished surface), whereas a low hardness value gives a dull shine (like asphalt or rough/dirty metal). The hardness range (0 to 511) will be scaled down by the Trainz Exporter to 0 to 128. A hardness value below 4 switches off specularity in order to avoid strange effects in Trainz.

=== Self Illumination ===

:The brightness without to be lighted. You find the slider '''Emit''' in the lower right corner of shader panel. The more emissive you order, the more your material glow in diffuse color.

== Textures ==

This is the area that causes the most problems.

This is the simplest case so do it first, once you have this part working you can add complexity.

Right click the image below and save it as &lt;code&gt;Blender cylinder texture.jpg&lt;/code&gt;. Trainz can use &lt;code&gt;.jpg&lt;/code&gt; files but it is much better to convert it to &lt;code&gt;Blender cylinder texture.tga&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Image:Blender cylinder texture.jpg]]

'''Step 1:''' After starting Blender, delete the default cube. Press {{key press|Space}} then create a cylinder of 8 sides. Press {{key press|N}}, which displays the '''Transform Properties''' dialog.

[[Image:Blender Cylinder.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

'''Step 2:''' By changing the values in the Transform Properties dialog, you can change the dimensions and rotation of the object. Here the cylinder has been raised by 2 metres by changing &lt;code&gt;LocZ&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;2.00&lt;/code&gt; and its direction has been changed by setting its &lt;code&gt;RotY&lt;/code&gt; to 90.

[[Image:blender raise and rotate.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

'''Step 3:''' Press {{keypress|F5}}. In the '''Links and Pipeline''' pane, select '''ADD NEW''' from the dropdown menu that currently displays &lt;code&gt;MA:Material&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Image:Blender F5.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

The dropdown menu should now display &lt;code&gt;MA:Material.001&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Image:After add new F5.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

'''Step 4:''' Press {{keypress|F6}}. In the '''Texture''' pane, select '''ADD NEW''' from the dropdown menu that currently displays &lt;code&gt;TE:Tex&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Image:F6.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

The dropdown menu should now display &lt;code&gt;TE:Tex.001&lt;/code&gt;. Select '''Image''' from the '''Texture Type''' dropdown menu. The '''Map Image''' and '''Image''' panes will appear.

[[Image:F6 sel image.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

'''Step 5:''' In the '''Image''' pane, press '''Load''' then navigate to your image file.

[[Image:Blender load image.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

Double-click the image file and its name will appear in the second field at the top of the file-select dialog. Press '''SELECT IMAGE''' and the image's metadata will appear in the '''Image''' pane.

[[Image:blender cylinder image.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

'''Step 6:''' Press {{keypress|F5}} then navigate to the '''Map Input''' pane. Press the '''UV''' button to change the map input to UV.

[[Image:Blender map input UV.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

'''Step 7:''' Change one of the 3D display windows to '''UV/Image Editor''' and press the button immediately to the right of the '''Image''' button in order to select the texture file you just loaded.

[[Image:Blender select.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

'''Step 8:''' In order to map the texture, we have to unwrap the mesh in Edit mode. Change from Object mode to Edit mode by pressing {{keypress|Tab}}.

[[Image:Blender select edit mode.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

'''Step 9:''' Make sure the entire mesh is selected by pressing {{keypress|A}}. Press {{keypress|U}} and select '''Unwrap (smart projections)''' to unwrap the mesh.

[[Image:Blender smart projections.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

Accept the default settings by clicking the '''OK''' button.

[[Image:Blender smart projections 2.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

[[Image:Blender mapped.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

'''Step 10:''' In order to edit the UV mapping, click the '''UV Island select mode''' button in the UV/Image Editor's toolbar. The button looks like an equilateral triangle with little squares representing the vertices.

[[Image:Blender select face tool.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

'''Step 11:''' Move the faces of the mesh into position on the texture map. First, in the '''UV/Image Editor''' window, select the eight faces that comprise the lower end of the cylinder. Right-clicking selects one face, and {{keypress|Shift}}+right-click selects multiple faces in succession. Once selected, position the faces over the orange circle on the texture map. To do this, use the Grab tool (press {{keypress|G}} and move the mouse). If necessary, you can constrain the Grab tool to the ''x''- or ''y''-axis by pressing {{keypress|G|X}} or {{keypress|G|Y}}, respectively. You can rotate the faces if necessary using the Rotate tool (press {{keypress|R}}). Scale the faces down to fit inside the circle by pressing {{keypress|S}} then dragging the mouse. Position the faces that comprise the top end of the cylinder on the blue circle of the texture map in the same way.

Scale down the faces of the cylinder's side in order to avoid a coloured dot in the middle.

For a preview of the result, press {{keypress|F12}}.

[[Image:Blender Render.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

'''Step 12:''' Return to Object mode by pressing {{keypress|Tab}}. Now it's time to export the object to Trainz. Go to the '''File''' menu and select '''Export\Trainz Export (im, km, pm)...'''. Export the object to &lt;code&gt;cylinder.im&lt;/code&gt; to match the sample kuid.  Copy the &lt;code&gt;cylinder.im&lt;/code&gt; file, texture file and &lt;code&gt;texture.txt&lt;/code&gt; file into a scenery object clone such as &lt;code&gt;kuid:86627:1791&lt;/code&gt; available on the DLS. The scenery object should show up in Trainz.

[[Image:Blender export.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

If you don't have the Trainz Exporter script, get it from the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/blenderextrainz SourceForge project page]. Copy the script file into &lt;code&gt;Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts\&lt;/code&gt;.

To create a wagon or locomotive, we need to add attachment points and have a different &lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file such as &lt;code&gt;kuid:86627:1792&lt;/code&gt; (available on the [http://www.auran.com/TRS2004/DLS.php Trainz Download Station]).

First we need to rotate the object so that it sits along the track. In Object mode, press {{keypress|N}} to enter the '''Transform Properties''' dialog. Note the &lt;code&gt;RotY&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RotZ&lt;/code&gt; values here.

[[Image:Blender rotate.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

We are going to add more items to the scene and in order to select items easily in Blender we use the Outliner. Select '''Outliner''' from the '''Window type''' list (first button in the toolbar of the lower window). Bring up the Outliner, then press the '''View''' button in the Outliner's toolbar, then select '''Show Outliner'''.

[[Image:Blender outliner.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]
[[Image:Blender outliner1.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]
[[Image:Blender outliner2.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]
[[Image:Blender outliner3.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

Next we add the empty which will become our attachment point.


[[Image:blender add empty.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

Trainz expects to see a specific name on the attachment point so we change the &lt;code&gt;OB:&lt;/code&gt; name in the '''Transform Properties''' dialog from &lt;code&gt;Empty&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;a.limfront&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Image:Blender rename.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

In the '''Transform Properties''' dialog, change the &lt;code&gt;LocZ&lt;/code&gt; value to &lt;code&gt;0.89&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;LocY&lt;/code&gt; value to &lt;code&gt;-4.5&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;LocX&lt;/code&gt; value to &lt;code&gt;0.0&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Image:Blender a limfront.jpg|thumbnail|center|800px]]

We need to add another attachment point for the rear coupler. Duplicate the &lt;code&gt;a.limfront&lt;/code&gt; attachment point by pressing {{keypress|Shift|D}}. Rename the duplicate to &lt;code&gt;a.limback&lt;/code&gt;. Change its &lt;code&gt;LocY&lt;/code&gt; value to &lt;code&gt;4.5&lt;/code&gt;.

We also need to add attachment points for the bogies. Add the following attachment points:
* &lt;code&gt;OB: a.bog0&lt;/code&gt; with parameters &lt;code&gt;LocX = 0.0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LocY = -1.0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LocZ = 0.0&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;OB: a.bog1&lt;/code&gt; with parameters &lt;code&gt;LocX = 0.0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LocY = 1.0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LocZ = 0.0&lt;/code&gt;

If you are using the sample wagon config, you also need to add:
* &lt;code&gt;OB: a.bog2&lt;/code&gt; with parameters &lt;code&gt;LocX = 0.0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LocY = 0.0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LocZ = 0.0&lt;/code&gt;

Now save your work (Name your file 'cylinder') and export the model to Trainz. File/Export/Trainz Export. Copy the cylinder.im file, texture and texture.txt file into a wagon object clone such as &lt;code&gt;kuid:86627:1792&lt;/code&gt; available on the [http://www.auran.com/TRS2004/DLS.php Trainz Download Station]. The wagon object should show up in Trainz. Note the sample kuid has two cylinders so if you see one you have been successful.

=== General ===

At first some common things to textures:

*NEVER use compressed image formats such as &lt;code&gt;.jpg&lt;/code&gt;, as they often distort colors, waste resources while loading (to extract they need additional memory and CPU-time) and have the same footprint in memory as an uncompressed picture format. A good format to use is Targa (&lt;code&gt;.tga&lt;/code&gt;), as it is uncompressed (don't use the RLE-option!) and also has the ability to store an alpha channel if required.

*Make your textures as small as possible. What ever should work is the creation of your texture twice as big as finally used and afterwards scale them down with enabled antialiasing. You get nearly the same detail grade as in the original map and need only 1/4 of its memory.

*Always use &quot;power of 2&quot; values as map dimensions (i.e. 64x64, 128x128, 128x512). Such textures could processed very fast because &quot;power of 2&quot; - numbers are the native language of your hardware. If you don't abide by this rule your meshes will be white in Trainz. You don't have to use square maps, but you must avoid an aspect ratio above 1:8 (this is unsupported in Trainz).

In Blender in order to access textures you must first add them to the project through the '''Texture''' pane in the '''Material buttons''' window. Press {{keypress|F5}} to access the Material buttons window, then click the '''Add New''' button in the Texture pane to add a new texture.

{|border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;83%&quot;
|[[Image:Texturpanel1.png|frame|3 - Blender Texture panel - empty]]
|[[Image:Texturpanel2.png|frame|4 - Blender Texture panel - texture object created]]
|}

After creating a texture (&lt;code&gt;TE:&lt;/code&gt;) object you use the '''Map Input''' pane to tell Blender where the mapping information should come from, and the Map To pane to specify which material property should be influenced.

{|border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;83%&quot;
|[[Image:Mapinputpanel.png|frame|5 - Blender Map Input panel]]
|[[Image:Maptopanel.png|frame|6 - Blender Map To panel]]
|}

The default map input choosen by Blender is '''Orco'''. This is okay for reflection maps, but for the other kinds of maps the Exporter script only accepts the '''UV''' map input. As mapping target ('''Map To''' pane) you can choose one or more of the following options:

::* '''Col''', used for diffuse maps
::* '''Alpha''', used for opacity maps
::* '''Ref''', used for reflection maps
::* '''Nor''', used for normal(bump) maps

You can assign other mapping targets and these textures will be exported, but you will not notice the slightest effect in Trainz.

What's now left to do is of course loading the texture itself. In Blender you define the content of a texture using the Texture pane (press {{keypress|F6}} to access). The only Texture Type you can export to Trainz is '''Image''', so all of the other options (DistortedNoise, Voronoi and so-on) can be ignored.

[[Image:Texturebuttons.png|frame|center|7 - Blender Texture buttons]]

:Now select the appropriate image by pressing '''Load''' on the Image panel.

:There is only one option left, the option &quot;no texture&quot;. The Blender Exporter for Trainz allows you to export models without any texture. This can speed up asset creation due to &quot;quick checks&quot; of the pure mesh directly in Trainz. To export without any texture you simply have to delete eventually assigned texture objects.

=== Diffuse Textures ===

:Diffuse textures are the kind of textures used most often. They essentially define the surface of objects. To use them you need to select the '''UV''' button in the '''Map Input''' pane, and the '''Col''' button in the '''Map To''' pane. You can adjust the amount of texture with the '''Col''' slider on the right-hand side of the '''Map To''' pane.

=== Opacity Textures ===

:Alpha textures are used to simulate transparent materials or to make parts of your object invisible. You can create dirty windows or let a simple plane look like a bogey part. An alpha map normaly comes together with a diffuse map, so the needed '''UV''' mapping should already be done. As target select '''Alpha'''. The texture amount is controled by slider '''Var''' at the right side of Map To panel.

:You can combine diffuse and opacity texture if you use an image with alpha layer. You need to select the option '''UseAlpha''' at the Map Image panel and must select '''Col''' and '''Alpha''' as targets at the Map To panel.

:One little problem can occure if you work with opacity: Due to a bug in Trainz not completely opaque or transparent areas may overlap each other. You can take a look at the problem and one possible work around by downloading the two related examples from [https://sourceforge.net/projects/blenderextrainz/ SourceForge].

=== Reflection Textures ===

:These textures are a bit different in usage as the others, because Trainz map them automatically using spherical mapping. How this works you can imagine best if you create a smooth sphere and assign a reflection map. Which map part is shown depend on the direction in which the imaginary ray from the camera to the objects surface would be reflected. That's why you see the whole map on the surface of a smooth sphere.

:To use reflection maps you only need to press button '''Refl''' in Map Input panel and button '''Ref''' in the Map To panel of the designated texture. You will notice that no colors appear neither in material preview nor in render window. That's because Blender use reflective textures to modify the strenght and not the color of reflection. But no fear, in Trainz you get your colors back ;).

=== Hardness Textures ===

:You can assign hardness textures but you will be disappointed. They don't affect hardness, instead they will be typed as reflective texture during export. This behavior is copied from the original exporter, as any attempt to influence the &quot;shinestrength&quot; so far ends in a complete white unlighted object.

=== Normal Textures ===

:A normal texture is used to fake highs and lows on an plain surface. To use it you need an '''UV''' Map Input and a '''Nor''' Map To. Please take care to use an normal map and not a bump map. Both are used for the same purpose, but they contain different data.

=== Texture Combinations ===

The influence that a texture has on an object's appearance in Trainz is controlled by so-called &quot;material name decorations&quot;. With one exception the Blender Exporter for Trainz selects the appropriate decoration depending on the textures you have assigned. This exception is &lt;code&gt;m.billboard&lt;/code&gt;, as this material decoration is used for objects always facing the camera. Because the Exporter has no chance to detect if you want this behavior, you have to decorate the material name for yourself with the ending &lt;code&gt;m.billboard&lt;/code&gt;. Generally the Exporter doesn't overwrite a known material decoration, so if you want to ensure your material will be exported as &lt;code&gt;m.gloss&lt;/code&gt;, then simply append &lt;code&gt;m.gloss&lt;/code&gt; for yourself to the material name.

====List of all currently supported texture combinations====

'''single textures:'''
* diffuse texture
* reflection texture
* hardness texture (will appear as reflection texture)
'''double textures:'''
* diffuse &amp; alpha texture
* diffuse &amp; reflection texture
* diffuse &amp; hardness texture (the same as diffuse &amp; reflection)
* diffuse &amp; normal texture
'''triple textures:'''
* diffuse, reflection &amp; alpha texture(in this case the alpha texture affects the reflection texture and not the diffuse texture)
* diffuse, alpha &amp; normal texture(no reflection or hardness texture allowed)
* diffuse, reflection &amp; normal texture (no alpha texture allowed)

== Events ==

:In case of animation export the original exporters ask you for an event file to bind events to specific frames. To use events with the Blender Exporter for Trainz is similar. Switching a Blender window to Text Editor window and create a new TX object via '''File &gt; New''' (Hotkey '''Alt N'''). Enter for every event a line with frame number, event type and event name. If you finally rename this TX object to ''events'', then the Exporter will parse this text and create the desired entries in your animation file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
[[Image:Digestive_system_diagram_en.svg‎|thumb|right|The digestive system]]
In mammalian physiology, the '''alimentary canal''' is the location of all digestion. The alimentary canal is most easily described as a long tube which runs from the mouth, through the body to the anus. In an adult human, it can be up to 6 metres long, and is obviously coiled to preserve space. This canal, in addition to organs which secrete various substances into it make up the '''digestive system'''. 

You may remember from your work on blood vessels, for example, that the space inside the tube is known as a '''lumen'''. The lumen of the alimentary canal goes straight from the mouth to the anus without obstruction and thus substances can pass right through without ever entering a cell, and the lumen is thus considered a part of the outside world. The process of '''absorption''' is what moves food substances from the lumen into cells and usually into the blood stream. 

Eating food and thus entering it into the alimentary canal is known as '''ingestion''', followed by digestion and then absorption. Any food that cannot be digested for whatever reason (cellulose is a good example), passes all the way through the alimentary canal and out the anus in the form of '''faeces''', the removal of which is known as egestion. Remember, egestion is not excretion, since excretion is the removal of metabolism waste products, but egestion deals with material that has not been absorbed and therefore cannot have been part of metabolism.

Due to requirements of absorption in the alimentary canal (very small size), usually only small molecules (e.g. iron, calcium, vitamins, amino acids, monosaccharides) and water can be absorbed immediately. Other molecules (known as macromolecules) such as starch and proteins cannot be absorbed and they must first be broken down into smaller molecules - the less complex monomers from which they are constructed.

'''Mechanical digestion''' is the process of chewing (also, the churning of the stomach), breaking larger pieces of food into smaller ones, providing a larger surface area for the digestive enzymes to act on during '''chemical digestion'''. The macromolecules we discussed in the previous paragraphs can then be more easily broken down - via '''hydrolysis''' reactions catalysed by a variety of enzymes.

== Enzymes in Digestion ==

All digestive reactions are hydrolysis - breaking down complex molecules into simple ones with the addition of water, and thus all digestive enzymes are hydrolases.

A table detailing the enzyme activity in a human alimentary canal can be found below;

===Protein Digestion===

Protein digestion takes place in the stomach, duodenum and ileum. The stomach has the protease pepsin which catalyses the hydrolysis of peptide bonds within protein molecules, splitting them into smaller chains, and is thus known as an endopeptidase. In the duodenum, trypsin and chymotrypsin do the same thing. An exopeptidase is one which cleaves off single amino acids from the end of a chain, and the one in the ileum is the carboxypeptidase, producing amino acids which are then absorbed into the blood capillaries.

==Gastroinestinal Tract== 
[[Image:Gut_wall.svg|right|thumb|General structure - note that the all glands, lieberkuhn and villi are not ever-present. Click to enlarge.]]
The alimentary canal, a canal that travels from mouth to the anus, has the same structure throughout, a wall with four main layers - the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa and serosa. 

The mucosa is the layer nearest the lumen and on its inner surface is a thin epithelium, which contains goblet cells. These secrete mucus to lubricate and protect the cells from abrasion by food. It also stops damage by digestive enzymes. Except for this common factor, the epithelium differs in various parts of the alimentary canal. Beneath the epithelium is a layer of connective tissue, and beneath that is a layer of smooth muscle called the muscularis mucosa. It is smooth muscle which allows it to contract slowly and rhythmically for long periods without tiring.

The submucosa consists of connective tissue lying within blood vessels and nerves. It contains a high proportion of collagen and elastin (fibrous proteins).

The musclurais externa, again smooth muscle, is made up of two bands - longitudinal muscle and circular muscle. Longitudinal lies lengthwise along the wall of the canal, whereas circular muscle lies around the wall. Their combined contraction and relaxation moves food through the alimentary canal via peristalsis.

The serosa is a thin layer of connective tissue that makes up the outer layer of the wall

===Mouth/Oesophagus===

Food is ingested and then masticated (chewed) using the broad ridges/grooves on molars/premolars which breaks solid food into smaller pieces, increasing its surface area. Saliva is also secreted into the mouth - being mostly water it helps dissolve any soluble components, and the enzyme amylase begins the breakdown of starch to maltose. Swallowing takes the food into the top of the oesophagus, and peristalsis takes it to the stomach.

===Stomach===

The stomach is a small sac with muscles at either end (sphincters), which control the entry and exit of food. When a bolus (ball of food) arrives at the stomach, the cardiac sphincter relaxes to allow food to enter, whilst the pyloric sphincter remains contracted so that food can remain there for several hours. It then allows the partially digested food to pass, now called chyme, into the duodenum.

The mucosa in the stomach is very folded, forming gastric pits, which secrete gastric juice. The epithelium is made up of columnar cells. It also contains chief cells and oxyntic cells, the former of which produce pepsinogen and the latter of which produce hydrochloric acid. Oxyntic cells have many mitochondria and deep invaginations on their surface.

====Digestion====

Gastric juice is mostly water but also contains hydrochloric acid from oxyntic cells. This hydrochloric acid gives gastric juice a pH of &lt;1.0, which kills a high proportion of bacteria that is present in food. Chief cells secrete pepsinogen, which does not function as an enzyme and is converted to its active form (pepsin) by the removal of a short length of amino acids. This is achieved by both hydrochloric acid and pepsin itself.

Gastric juice also contains lipases to break down fats. The walls of the stomach lining is protected by alkaline mucus, coating the entire stomach wall.

====Absorption====

Only a few substances can be absorbed here, small, lipid-soluble molecules, for example alcohol, and aspirin.

===Liver/Pancreas===

The mix of enzymes, hydrochloric acid and chyme (partially digested food) passes into the small intestine when the pyloric sphincter relaxes, and this coincides with the liver and the pancreas releasing juices into the small intestine. One of the liver's functions is to produce bile, which is stored in the gall bladder and then carried along the bile duct into the dueodenum. Bile contains bile salts which help emulsify fats, and are then reabsorbed (mostly) and go back to the liver, where they are then resecreted. Bile also contains hydrogencarbonate ions which help neutralise the acidic mixture of the duodenum.

The pancreas is both an endocrine and exocrine gland - its endocrine functon is to secrete insulin and glucagon (produced by the islets of Langerhans). Its exocrine function, the one we'll discuss most here, is the secretion of pancreatic juice into the pancreatic duct. 

Pancreatic juice consists of enzymes and enzyme precursors. Trypsin and chymotrypsin are secreted in an inactive form, trypsoinogen and chymotrypsinogen. The former gradually changes to trypsin, and is speeded up by an enzyme enterokinase. Trypsin can then act on trypsoinogen and chymotripsinogen to activate them. Other enzymes include carboxypeptidase (secreted in inactive form, tripsin sorts it out), lipase and amylase. It also contains hydrogen carbonate ions to neutralise the acidic mixture of food and gastric juice in the duodenum.

===Small Intestine===

The small intestine consists of three regions - the duodenum, jejunum and the ileum. The structure of the ileum has many numerous tiny folds in the walls, known as villi, made from the mucosa layer, and each villus is around 1mm tall. These villi all have their own microvilli which combined have a great surface area available for absorption. The smooth muscle in the musclaris mucosa can make them contract and sway around for great contact with the food in the lumen, and the villus also have a network of blood capillaries for absorption and transport of food.

Beneath the villi are glands called the crypts of Lieberkuhn, which contain goblet cells to secrete mucus.

====Digestion====

The enzymes from the duodenum continue to act, and enzymes that act in the ileum do so while attached to the surface of the epithelial cells of the villi. Some enzymes from the duodenum become adsorbed onto the surface of the cells, ensuring that the products of digestion are concentrated right next to the cells which will absorb them. In fact the majority of the digestion in the ileum happens right next to the plasma membranes of epithelial cells.

====Absorption====
[[Image:Gobletcel.jpg|right|framed|A longtidutinal section through a villlus - you can see the 'brush border' created by the microvilli, the arrow points to mucus in a goblet cell]]
The products of digestion; amino acids, fatty acids, glycerol and monosaccharides, can all cross the plasma membranes of the epithelial cells on the villi, passing through these cells to enter either the blood or lymphatic capillaries. Monosaccharides and amino acids go straight into the blood stream, whilst fatty acids and glycerol go into the lymphatic system.

Monosaccharides are absorbed in the same way as amino acids - sodium ions are continually pumped out of the base of the epithelial cells into the surrounding tissue fluid, resulting in sodium ions travelling down this created concentration gradient, carrying glucose and amino acids with them - co-transport.

Fatty acids and glycerol are able to diffuse through the phospholipid bi-layer (lipid-soluble), and are converted back to triglycerides on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of an eptithelium cell, transferred to the Golgi and then surrounded by a protein to create a chylomicron.

Water, inorganic ions and vitamins are also absorbed in the ileum, via osmosis, active transport, facilitated diffusion or plain diffusion (lipid-soluble only).

===Colon===

The colon, caecum, appendix and rectum make up the large intestine, and the colon's function is to absorb inorganic ions and water, what remains anyway. The epithelium does not contain villi but it does have columnar cells with microvilli, providing a relativley large surface area for absorption. The material that reaches the rectum is mostly indigestible material - cellulose and lignin as well as mucus and cells that have been shed form the canal - it is passed out as faeces.

==Control of Digestion==

===Endocrine system===

The secretion of the digestive juices from the stomach/pancreas and the bile from the gall bladder is controlled by hormones. The arrival of action potentials at the stomach wall causes the secretion of a hormone called gastrin, which is released into the blood causing gastric glands to produce large quantities of gastric juice. This is also stimulated by the presence of food in the stomach.

The secretion of pancreatic juice is largely controlled by the arrival of food in the duodenum. The contact with acidic substances stimulates cells of the wall to secrete a hormone called secretin, which stimulates exocrine cells in the pancreas to release a hydrogencarbondate rich juice into the pancreatic duct.

The dudodenum epithelial cells react to products of fat or protein digestion by secreting CCK which acts on the exocrine cells of the pancreas, stimulating the secretion of an enzyme rich juice, and causing the gall bladder (by forcing it to contract its smooth muscles) to force bile along the bile duct.

===Nervous system===

The taste, sight and smell of food all feed into the nervous system, and the medulla oblongata carries impulses from it to the salivary glands as part of the autonomic nervous system. Gastric juice secretion is also stimulated by nerve impulses sent from the brain to the stomach wall (see above)

==Digestion and Dentition in other animals==
===Herbivores===

The food herbivores eat is surrounded by cellulose cell walls that cannot be digested by enzymes, and are so have to be masticated by molars etc. A herbivore, such as a cow, may not have any canines at all, a diastema (gap), instead allows the long flexible tongue to move grass around the mouth. The chewing is done by premolars and molars, which have broad surfaces with ridges and cusps which move side to side and fit into each other. The cow does have incisors, but they are only on the lower surface, with a horny pad on the top where the upper incisors should be - these two act as a kind of clamp for the cow to pull grass from the ground. Cow's teeth continue to grow throughout life, since they are continually ground down by all the chewing.

A cow has a four chambered stomach - the largest chamber, the rumen (and also the reticulum), has a community of anaerobic microorganisms that produce enzymes to break down cellulose to glucose. Other enzymes break down this sugar to a fatty acid, thus many tissues in a cow are adapted to use fatty acids as their main respiratory substrate.

Plant material is passed up from the rumen and reticulum back into the mouth peridocally until it is completely chewed up, and is known as chewing the cud. Material is then passed from the rumen and reticulum into the omasum and abomason. Here hydrochloric acid and protease is secreted, as in a human stomach. Then the material continues into the small intestine.

===Carnivores===

Carnivores, in contrast to herbivores, are meat eating animals and thus have very different dentistry and digestion. The wolf, for example, has long pointed teeth known as canines at the front of its mouth, which allow the wolf to stab the body of its prey when it bites it, killing it. Behind the canines are premolars and molars with extremely sharp edges, and are known as carnassial teeth because they slice past each other with the jaw is closed in a scissor like action that cracks, crushes bones and cuts meat into smaller pieces.

The inciscors at the front of the wolf's mouth are used in scraping meat from the surface of the bones. Since meat does not contain starch or celluose cell walls, amylase is not required, and dogs do not have to chew very much. However, compensating for the lack of chemical digestion in the mouth is a very concentrated acid in the dogs stomach, allowing a dog to eat 'dangerous' food that is rotten without harm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Regular Affirmative Spanish Commands==

Spanish commands can vary based on if they are singular or plural and their formality.

==Tú Commands==

An affirmative tú command is the same as the Present Third Person Singular (Él, Ella, Usted) conjugation in present tense.

For Example:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! colspan=2 | Ar
! colspan=2 | ER
! colspan=2 | Ir
|- 
| colspan=2 | Stem + a 
| colspan=2 | Stem + e
| colspan=2 | Stem + e
|-
|Habla
|Speak
|Come
|Eat
|Escribe
|Write
|}

==Usted Commands==

===Ar===
An Ar usted command is formed by dropping the &quot;o&quot; from the Present First Person Singular conjugation (the yo form) and then adding an &quot;e&quot;.
For Example:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! colspan=2 | Hablar - To speak
! colspan=2 | Comprar - To buy
|-
! Yo Form
! Command
! Yo Form
! Command
|-
| Hablo 
| Hable
| Compro
| Compre
|}

===Er and Ir===

An Er/Ir usted command is formed by dropping the &quot;o&quot; from the Present First Person Singular conjugation (the yo form) and then adding an &quot;a&quot;.
For example:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! colspan=2 | Beber - To drink
! colspan=2 | Vivir - To live
|-
! Yo Form
! Command
! Yo Form
! Command
|-
| Bebo
| Beba
| Vivo
| Viva
|}

==Ustedes Commands==

An ustedes command is formed by adding an &quot;n&quot; to the end of an usted command.

For example:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! colspan=2 | Hablar - To speak
! colspan=2 | Compartir - To share
|-
! Ud. Command
! Uds. Command
! Ud. Command
! Uds. Command
|-
| Hable 
| Hablen
| Comparta
| Compartan
|}

== thank you! ==

on several occasions you've fixed the new pages i've created where i've forgotten to include the ''cookbook:'' prefix to my page name ... thanks!! [[User:Wikidsoup|Wikidsoup]] ([[User talk:Wikidsoup|talk]]) 22:43, 2 May 2008 (UTC)

== About the Author ==

Hi Mike,

I'd like to hear your thoughts regarding the creation of &quot;About the author&quot; pages.  I have one at [[:About the author/Jomegat]] and I transclude it in several chapters of the [[:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]].  There are a few other authors who have also created them (after I encouraged them to do so).  [[User:Jazzmanian]] created one last week and you moved it around and maybe deleted it.  I'm too tired right now to track down everything that happened (just returned from a weekend camping trip) but thought it would be good to see what you were thinking.  Do you think they are appropriate (I obviously do)? Do you think they belong in user space (I think maybe they do). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 23:29, 4 May 2008 (UTC)
: Ha!  Just read the answer a little further up on this talk page.  I think that's prolly a good idea, so I'll move mine (but maybe tomorrow - I am awfully tired tonight). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 23:32, 4 May 2008 (UTC)
::Yeah, if it's going to be transcluded into several books, it should be either a template or in your userspace (best idea). There's no book called [[About the Author]], so the mainspace isn't a good location for it. At least, that's my take on it. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:34, 5 May 2008 (UTC)
:::I think I found all of them and moved them into user space.  I created mine when I was still pretty much a noob here and never really gave it a second thought.  Thanks for your input on this. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 14:08, 5 May 2008 (UTC)
::::Is there an easy way to do this then ? I was editing my profile page where I added my about. If I can create one in the correct spot, mine in the incorrect place can be deleted please. [[User:Jazzmanian|Gerald]] ([[User talk:Jazzmanian|talk]]) 19:43, 6 May 2008 (UTC)
::::: Hi Gerald - It looks like you have one in the correct spot ([[:User:Jazzmanian/About the author]]).  To add that to a book just insert &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:User:Jazzmanian/About the author}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; where ever you want it to show up. If you can point me to one that's not in the right place, I can delete it for you. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 19:50, 6 May 2008 (UTC)
::::::I thought that one was delete for being in the wrong spot - perhaps when Mike restored it, he relocated correctly on my behalf. - If so Thanks Mike ! [[User:Jazzmanian|Gerald]] ([[User talk:Jazzmanian|talk]]) 00:03, 7 May 2008 (UTC)
::::::: The wrong spot was [[:About the author/Jazzmanian]].  The preferred spot is in the User: namespace. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:06, 7 May 2008 (UTC)

You guys got it :) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:57, 7 May 2008 (UTC)

== Radiation Oncology textbook ==

Thank you for your nomination of the [[Radiation_Oncology]] textbook for a [[WB:FBN#Radiation_Oncology|Featured Book]]. We recently received an acceptance of an abstract describing it at our professional society ([http://www.astro.org/ ASTRO]) annual meeting. I just wanted to follow-up to see if/what else we need to do to continue with the nomination process. Thanks! [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] ([[User talk:Tdvorak|talk]]) 03:37, 6 May 2008 (UTC)
:There's nothing left, except for an admin to close the discussion. It looks like there's a fair amount of discussion, and the only negative comments have been addressed, or are relatively minor (formatting). I would do it myself, but as I'm the nominator, I can't. I imagine someone else will get to it soon enough. Congrats on getting the abstract accepted. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:43, 6 May 2008 (UTC)

Wikibooks2PDF only accepts Wikibooks URLs. Thus it was for testing reasons the only way to use a normal Wikibooks page because the Sandbox can be modified from another user when using Wikibooks2PDF.

== Yet another bot job (wikiversity) ==

This time just  a minor modification to the middle template, and a massive change for the bottom template (trying to add more switch functions and get rid of the embedded templates we've been using up 'til now).
&lt;!--
Follow categories  middle = [[v:Category:Bcpmiddle v. 8.4.25]] bottom = [[v:Category:Bcpbottom v. 7.10.24]]

On the middle template:

'''1.''' Change &quot;New Region 3&quot; to &quot;Moravia-Silesia&quot;

'''2.''' Change &quot;New Region 4&quot; to &quot;Czech name&quot;

'''3.''' Change &quot;New Region 5&quot; to &quot;Aurora, Colorado&quot;

'''4.''' Grab:
&lt;pre&gt;
| version tracking for middle template (for robotic use) = 8.4.25
&lt;/pre&gt;
...and replace with:
&lt;pre&gt;
| New Region 13 = 
| New Region 14 = 
| New Region 15 = 
| version tracking for middle template (for robotic use) = 8.5.12
&lt;/pre&gt;

For the bottom template:

'''1.''' Grab:
&lt;pre&gt;
| flower color (/ white, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, black) =
&lt;/pre&gt;
...and replace with:
&lt;pre&gt;
| white flowers = 
| pink flowers = 
| red flowers = 
| orange flowers = 
| yellow flowers = 
| green flowers = 
| blue flowers = 
| purple flowers = 
| brown flowers = 
| black flowers = 
| flower color (/ white, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, black) =
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''2.''' Grab:
&lt;pre&gt;
| pollination method (/pollination/ wind, insect, water, self) =
&lt;/pre&gt;
...and replace with:
&lt;pre&gt;
| insect pollinated = 
| wind pollinated = 
| bird pollinated = 
| water pollinated = 
| self pollinated = 
| pollination method (/pollination/ wind, insect, water, self) =
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''3.''' Grab:
&lt;pre&gt;
| type (/ herbaceous, shrub, tree, vine) = 
&lt;/pre&gt;
...and replace with:
&lt;pre&gt;
| herbaceous = 
| woody = 
| forb = 
| shrub = 
| tree = 
| vine = 
| emergent aquatic = 
| submerged aquatic = 
| floating aquatic = 
| type (/ herbaceous, shrub, tree, vine) = 
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''4.''' Grab:
&lt;pre&gt;
| leaves absent when flowering (yes if true) =
&lt;/pre&gt;
...and replace with:
&lt;pre&gt;
| fruits present when flowering (yes if possible) = 
| leaves absent when flowering (yes if possible) = 
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''5.''' Grab:
&lt;pre&gt;
| version tracking for bottom template (for robotic use) = 7.10.24
&lt;/pre&gt;
...and replace with:
&lt;pre&gt;
| leaf veination (pinnate, palmate, linear) = 
| version tracking for bottom template (for robotic use) = 8.5.12
&lt;/pre&gt;
--&gt;
One general request for all of these: please add a blank space after the &quot;=&quot;. This makes it a bit more pleasant to edit (looks funny when there'sno space, and the template acts the same). 

Diff for reference (mostly... I also fixed a couple of the fields): http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=BCP%2FRhododendron_calendulaceum&amp;diff=266067&amp;oldid=265983


Let me know if there are any issues, and thanks yet again! Hopefully we won't need another for at least a month or so, unless we get a sudden flood of new contributors. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:10, 12 May 2008 (UTC)

==POLT image==
Hello Mike,

Thank you for your hard work. However, we are wondering why you deleted the book image of POLT (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Learning_Theories) again. As I explained to you last year, the POLT is one of Dr. Bonk's research project and he hired someone to create the book image that you deleted. So, the owner of the copyright for the image is Dr. Bonk (cjbonk@indiana.edu). Please let us know what is wrong with our image.
Thank you.
:If Dr. Bonk owns the copyright, then it needs to be freely licensed. I had explained that previously, but couldn't enforce it at the time. Since then, we have enacted [[WB:MEDIA|a media policy]], which made the licensing situation contrary to policy. The cover image must be free; there are two ways to achieve this:
:#Freely-license the deleted image, which would of course be restored, or
:#Create or find a new freely-licensed image.

I am trying to put the category onto my subpages, as you suggested, but it keeps inserting the word &quot;template&quot; into the category. Is this meant to happen? I have made the change on my Methods Manual for Salt Lake Studies/Authors page for you to have a look at when you have the chance.

Hi Mike,
Hope your keeping well

[[:w:Wikipedia_talk:AutoWikiBrowser/Bugs#Inability_to_retrieve_lists_from_special_pages.2C_image_pages_or_links]]

Finally have got around to trying to deal with this bug (as im in the process of overhauling the back end of the list maker, making it more modular, and able to accept listmaker plugins and such.

Where the 3 problems Special Pages, Link on Page and Images on Page?

As the latter 2 seem to work again (must have been more API changes), but special pages is certainly still broken.

Just wanting to verify what was broken

Please feel free to reply to me at en.wp, or on the bug entry at AWB.

::Depends. If it belongs to a book, it is probably ok. Very short pages (&lt;5 sentences?) should perhaps get {{tlx|query|''comments if any''}}. As well, you will get to know which books are active - usually there is only one contributor per book, and other people adding pages in those books deserve a bit more attention.

== Chilean salmon sector ==

Hi,

Just a comment on the deletion of the &quot;Chilean salmon sector&quot;. I published this article on Wikipedia, but an administrator deleted it and said that I had to publish the article on Wikibooks. 

Any advice?

Thanks,

:Hello Mike, I'm the said administrator from Wikipedia. The article is a copy of his master thesis, which ya prolly know is original research, so it's not appropriate for Wikipedia.

Hello Mike &amp; DEA,

It seems that the salmon article is 'locked in' between Wikibooks and Wikipedia. Can we find a solution? The information itself is very useful for those who are both interested and active in the sector. The article explains the roots of the Chilean salmon sector; i.e. why does it exist and how did it develop.

Regards,

Bcbolman

'''Pronunciation rules'''

Vowels:

Slovenian has 8 vowels: /a/, /e/, /ɛ/, /ə/, /i/, /o/, /ɔ/, /u/. They are written using the letters A, E, I, O and U. The schwa /ə/ is sometimes repesented by the letter R, taking place before said letter.

The Slovene diphthongs are generally considered phonemically as combinations of two phonemes, a vowel and /j/ or a vowel and [w] (often written as [u]. The Slovene phonetic diphthongs are [ew, Ew, aw, Ow, ej, oj, Oj, aj, uj]. 
The diphthongs [aw] and [aj] can safely be used as equivalents of the English /aU/ and /aI/.
* aj 
''Like the word &quot;eye&quot;''
* ej 
''Like 'ay' in &quot;pay&quot;''
* oj 
''Like 'oy' in &quot;toy&quot;''
* uj 
''Like 'wee' in &quot;week&quot;''
* ae 
''Like 'a' in &quot;father&quot; and 'e' in &quot;empty&quot;''
* ija 
''Like 'ia' in &quot;Lydia&quot;''
* ije 
''Like 'ie' in the Spanish word &quot;miedo&quot;''

===Greetings===

* '''Dobro jutro''' - Good morning ''('doh-broh 'yuh-troh)''
* '''Dober dan''' - Good day ''('doh-behr dahn)''
* '''Dober večer''' - Good evening ''('doh-behr veh-'cher)''
* '''Lahko noč''' - Sleep well ''('lah-kho noch)''


* '''Živijo''' - Hello ''('zhi-vi-yoh)''
* '''Zdravo''' - Hello ''('zdrah-vo)''
* '''Čao*''' - Hi ''(like the italian 'ciao'; chau)''


* '''Na svidenje''' - Goodbye (literally 'to the meeting', untill we see eachother again) ''(nah 'svih-deh-nye)''
* '''Adijo''' - Bye ''(ah-'dioh)''
* '''Zbogom''' - Goodbye (literally 'with God', with a connotation of 'we won't meet again') ''('zboh-ghom)''
* '''Čao*''' - Bye ''(like the italian 'ciao'; chau)''


''* The word 'čao' is a slang word, used both to say hello and goodbye.''

''Note: it is recommended that you learn the pronunciation of slovene letters, as their sounds are almost '''always''' exactly the same as written (the exception being v, l, and some vowels)''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

[[:w:Higher-order programming|Higher-order programming]] means writing programs that take other programs as input and/or return still other programs as output. Higher-order programming is common in [[:w:Functional programming|functional programming]], but can be in done in Prolog as well.

As an example, suppose you are writing a speech synthesis application that reads out phone numbers aloud. We might have a predicate &lt;code&gt;digit_english/2&lt;/code&gt; that relates Prolog integers 0 through 9 to English words (as symbols):

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
digit_english(0,zero).
digit_english(1,one).
digit_english(2,two).
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, to translate a phone number, define:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
phone_english([],[]).
phone_english([Digit|Ds],[Word|Ws]) :-
    digit_english(Digit,Word),
    phone_english(Ds,Ws).
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, suppose we want to add support for another language, say, German. You define &lt;code&gt;digit_german&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
digit_german(0,null).
digit_german(1,eins).
digit_german(2,zwei).
...
&lt;/source&gt;

To translate a phone number, use &lt;code&gt;phone_german&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
phone_german([],[]).
phone_german([Digit|Ds],[Word|Ws]) :-
    digit_german(Digit,Word),
    phone_german(Ds,Ws).
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the common recursion pattern in &lt;code&gt;phone_english/2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;phone_german&lt;/code&gt;. You've probably seen that many times before, even written it several times. It can be summed up as:

* Base case: relate the empty list to itself.
* Recursive case: relate the first element of the first list to the first element of the second via some predicate, then recur on the tails of both lists.

This pattern can be captured by a higher-order predicate generally known as &lt;code&gt;map/3&lt;/code&gt; (but not defined by standard Prolog):

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
map([],P,[]).
map([X|Xs],P,[Y|Ys]) :-
    Goal =.. [P,X,Y],
    call(Goal),
    map(Xs,P,Ys).
&lt;/source&gt;

In Prolog, we cannot write P(X,Y) since the head of a functor must be a symbol. Therefore, we use the infix operator &lt;code&gt;=..&lt;/code&gt; that unifies its first argument with a term built from its right argument, which must be a list. The first element, which must be a symbol, becomes the functor, the rest its arguments. We then apply &lt;code&gt;call/1&lt;/code&gt; to the term we constructed to invoke it as a Prolog goal.

We can now redefine &lt;code&gt;phone_english/2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;phone_german/2&lt;/code&gt; as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
phone_english(P,E) :- map(P,digit_english,E).
phone_german(P,G) :- map(P,digit_german,G).
&lt;/source&gt;

Both predicates still work in both directions and non-determinism is preserved.

The befenit is obvious: by using &lt;code&gt;map/3&lt;/code&gt;, we avoid repeating code fragments so our programs become shorter and easier to read and understand.

I think there was another cvs parsing thread on the mailing list which I deemed appropriate, but I can't remember.

== Space Leak ==

jkff asked about some code in #haskell which was analyzing a logfile. Basically, it was building a histogram

&lt;pre&gt;
foldl' (\m (x,y) -&gt; insertWith' x (\[y] ys -&gt; y:ys) [y] m) M.empty
  [(ByteString.copy foo, ByteString.copy bar) | (foo,bar) &lt;- map (match regex) lines]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The input was a 1GB logfile and the program blew the available memory mainly because the &lt;code&gt;ByteString.copy&lt;/code&gt; weren't forced and the whole file lingered around in memory.

The '''Fundamental Theorem of Calculus''' is said to be the central theorem of elementary calculus. It states effectively that &quot;Differentiation&quot; and &quot;Integration&quot; are inverse operations.

Conventionally, the theorem is presented in two parts
==First Form of the Fundamental Theorem==
===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;f,F:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;F'(x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be Riemann integrable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

Then, &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
Let &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f=L&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be given.

Then, there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for a partition &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Consider a partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;x_{i-1},x_i\in\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;. By Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem, we have that there exists &lt;math&gt;c_i\in (x_{i-1},x_i)&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies &lt;math&gt;\frac{F(x_i)-F(x_{i-1})}{x_i-x_{i-1}}=F'(c_i)=f(c_i)&lt;/math&gt;

Let the tagged partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; be the partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; along with the tags &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, &lt;math&gt;S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})=\sum_{i=1}^n f(c_i)(x_i-x_{i-1})=\sum_{i=1}^n \tfrac{F(x_i)-F(x_{i-1})}{x_i-x_{i-1}}(x_i-x_{i-1})=\sum_{i=1}^n (F(x_i)-F(x_{i-1}))=F(b)-F(a)&lt;/math&gt;

But we know that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and hence, &lt;math&gt;|F(b)-F(a)-L|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

As &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary, &lt;math&gt;|F(b)-F(a)-L|=0&lt;/math&gt; that is, &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)&lt;/math&gt;

==Second Form of the Fundamental Theorem==
We first define what is known as the &quot;Indefinite Integral&quot;
===Definition===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be Riemann integrable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;.

We define the '''Indefinite Integral''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to be the function &lt;math&gt;F:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; given by 

&lt;math&gt;F(x)=\int_a^x f&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;
===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be continuous at &lt;math&gt;c\in [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;F:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be the indefinite integral of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;

Then, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F'(c)=f(c)&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
Let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be given, and let &lt;math&gt;x\in [a,b]&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;x\neq c&lt;/math&gt; 

Observe that &lt;math&gt;F(x)-F(c)=\int_c^x f=L&lt;/math&gt;(say). 

There exists &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that if a partition &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; then, &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|&lt;\varepsilon |x-c|&lt;/math&gt; (note that in this proof, all the Riemann sums are over the interval &lt;math&gt;[c,x]&lt;/math&gt;).

As &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is integrable over &lt;math&gt;[c,x]&lt;/math&gt;, it is bounded over that interval. Hence, let &lt;math&gt;M=\sup f([c,x])&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})\leq \sum_{i=1}^n M(x_i-x_{i-1})=M(x-c)&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;M(x-c)-S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})&lt;\varepsilon |x-c|&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;|x-c|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.

Now consider &lt;math&gt;x\in V_{\delta}(c)&lt;/math&gt;

Then, &lt;math&gt;\left| \tfrac{F(x)-F(c)}{x-c}-f(c)\right| =\left| \tfrac{L}{x-c}-f(c)\right| &lt;\left| \tfrac{S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})+\varepsilon|x-c|}{x-c}-f(c)\right|&lt;\left| \tfrac{M(x-c)+2\varepsilon|x-c|}{x-c}-f(c)\right|&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;\left| \tfrac{f(c)(x-c)+3\varepsilon|x-c|}{x-c}-f(c)\right|&lt;3\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{F(x)-F(c)}{x-c}=f(c)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;F'(c)=f(c)&lt;/math&gt;</text>

==Introduction==
For many practical applications, for example for describing forces in physics and mechanics, you have to work with the mathematical descriptions of '''lines''' and '''planes''' in 3-dimensional space.

==Parametric Equations==
===Line in Space===
A line in space is defined by two points in space, which I will call &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_1&lt;/math&gt; be the vector from the origin to &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_2&lt;/math&gt; the vector from the origin to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;.
Given these two points, every other point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; on the line can be reached by

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}_1 + \lambda \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt; is the vector from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{x}_2 - \mathbf{x}_1 &lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:LinesPlanes_1.png|250px|Line in 3D Space.]]
&lt;/center&gt;

===Plane in Space===
The same idea can be used to describe a plane in 3-dimensional space, which is uniquely defined by three points (which do not lie on a line) in space (&lt;math&gt;P_1, P_2, P_3&lt;/math&gt;).
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_i&lt;/math&gt; be the vectors from the origin to &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;. Then

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}_1 + \lambda \mathbf{a} + \mu \mathbf{b}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
with:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{x}_2 - \mathbf{x}_1 \,\, \text{and} \,\, \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{x}_3 - \mathbf{x}_1
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note that the starting point does not have to be &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_1 &lt;/math&gt;, but can be any point in the plane. Similarly, the only requirement on the vectors &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b} &lt;/math&gt; is that they have to be two non-collinear vectors in our plane.

==Vector Equation (of a ''Plane in Space'', or of a ''Line in a Plane'')==
An alternative representation of a Plane in Space is obtained by observing that a plane is defined by a point &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; in that plane and a direction perpendicular to the plane, which we denote with the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;.
As above, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_1&lt;/math&gt; describe the vector from the origin to &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; the vector from the origin to another point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in the plane. Since any vector that lies in the plane is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;, the '''vector equation''' of the plane is given by

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_1) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In 2 dimensions, the same equation uniquely describes a Line.
==Scalar Equation (of a ''Plane in Space'', or of a ''Line in a Plane'')==
If we express &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; through their components

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{n} = \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
   a  \\
   b  \\
   c  \\
\end{array}} \right),\,\,\text{and}\,\,
\mathbf{x} = \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
   x  \\
   y  \\
   z  \\
\end{array}} \right),
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

writing out the scalar product for &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_1) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
provides us with the '''scalar equation''' for a plane in space:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
ax+by+cz=d
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; d = \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{x}_1 &lt;/math&gt;.

In 2d space, the equivalent steps lead to the scalar equation for a line in a plane:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
ax+by=c
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

I found this book while looking through [[:Category:Featured book]]. It most certainly is not and never has been featured. This book is highly confusing to me. On the font page there is a template that points to the &quot;Landan Wikibooks&quot; (there is no &quot;Landan&quot; project), although the link points to the Esperanto one. The link to the Wikipedia article, [[w:Landan]], points to a page which doesn't exist, and was never created. Half the pages in the TOC point to pages in the [[Dutch]] book. Doing a google search for &quot;Landan&quot; brings up this book, and a number of people named Landan, but no information about a language. This book was written almost exclusively by anonymous editors (which is not necessarily an indictment). There is a Wikiversity course on [[v:Topic:Landan]] which was written by the same authors. Frankly, if this isn't OR or some kind of webhost violation, then it's a hoax. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:24, 9 May 2008 (UTC)

==Introduction==
[http://www.acord.org ACORD] is the '''A'''ssociation for '''C'''ooperative
'''O'''perations '''R'''esearch and '''D'''evelopment.

===Organization===


== ACORD ==
was founded in 1970 as a standards setting organisation for the insurance industry. As a global working non-profit organisation they develop and provide cost saving digital standards for data interchange to reduce classical paperwork, surely a „war against paper forms“, trying to minimize redundant work and to maximize data accuracy. That would make life far more easy for all companies, agents and customers (policyholders) [[#References|[1]]].

===Work===

The standards are the result of the work of all members, synchronized by ACORD working groups. Finally the  ACORD Steering Committees will decide, which results would end up as public standards, in coordination with other standardization organisations and governments.

One of the recent standards incorporates the use of XML as a frame for flexible data transmission and interchange. In 2001 XML for P&amp;C and Surety Version 1.0 was approved, in 2002 Version 1.2 was approved [[#References|[1]]].

===XML===

[http://www.w3.org/XML/ XML] provides an open standard, with easy to be made connectivity between [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Resource_Planning ERP] systems, managment systems, web services, web applications and other related systems. It can be used in business-to-business, customer-to-business and business-to-customer applications.

==Benefits of ACORD XML==

Usually the benefits of XML are across all industries and domains of similar type, but that does not apply to the insurance industry. There you can find unique benefits like  [[#References|[6]]]:

===Partner to Partner Integration===

Common data elements and definitions are necessary to deal with external business partners in this industry. So you need a common language to share data with all actors from the value chain, e.g. reinsurers or intermediaries. By involving this actors in the process of development ACORD designed this common language and data standards.

===Internal Integration===

The Insurance industry requires the separation of communication systems to complete a business process. Furthermore a claim adjuster, who wants to verify coverage or to ensure that the claim's code is correct, needs a system that offers accurate transfer of the claim or policy number. ACORD XML standards are essential to transfer such items from system to system.

===Electronic Data Sharing===

Moreover the data should have a high quality and transparency. Without that fact it is not possible for carriers to get exposure information in disparate and incompatible formats in order to identify aggregation of exposure across customers and lines of business in an effective way. Reinsurers need high visibility into cedent risk portfolios for extensive exposure analysies.
ACORD data standards support a format that captures and analyzes informations and data in multiple formats across partners.

===Web Services===

By reason of Web Services are required for real time integration througout the transaction processing cycle, ACORD standards realise processes like the integration of back-end systems with an agent portal.

===Document Repository Standards===

A single repository for all risk related information is in general not possible. Due to the fact that consistency across data repositories is very important, ACORD XML standards were established to allow trading partners to share structured and unstructured documents and data also in a variety of third party systems. Therefore Document Repository Interface Standards exist to guarantee access to free format documentation for improving decisions.

===Improved Cash Flow===

By using ACORD XML standards transaction processing is accelerated. Consequently there is a faster access to money or other types of payments.

==Standards==
Following standards allows different companies along the value chain of a market to exchange data with less &quot;frictional losses&quot; that are usually generated by the usage of incompatible data formats. A standard serves as a common communication method to increase efficiency - a lowest common denominator. It is a set of rules and guidelines that provide a common framework for communication.[http://acord.org/Standards/what.aspx] The set of ACORD standards consists of subsets for the 3 main segments of insurance industry. These are:

* Life, Annuity  and Health
* Property and Casualty
* Reinsurance and Large Commercial


By implementing and following ACORD's standard definitions, member companies can achieve ...

* competitive advantages
* end-to-end process support
* easier access to markets
* lower costs, which lead to more profit
* better market acceptance 
* higher performance and enhanced credibility.


As seen in the previous chapters (esp. in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XML_-_Managing_Data_Exchange/Introduction_to_XML &quot;Introduction to XML&quot;]) using XML as a means of data exchange is a suitable base for a standard like ACORD. It's flexible enough to be tailored for the usage within different insurance segments but it also offers methods to ensure data quality and the stability of the standard.

==Technical Standardization==
The ACORD standard describes different concepts that can be implemented by a member. The access to the standard's descriptions is partly free, partly limited to ACORD members. It can be found here: [http://www.acord.org/Standards/download_standards.aspx ACORD Standard Descriptions].   

===XML structures===
To ensure the correct form of the transferred data, ACORD provides XML schemas and DTDs for its members. Companies implementing the standard can validate their data against those definitions. The ACORD XML standard is strongly based upon the United Nations [[w:en:EDIFACT|EDIFACT]] standard and expands the standard XML data types with the financial data types used by the [[w:en:Interactive_Financial_Exchange|'''I'''nteractive '''F'''inancial '''E'''xchange]] (IFX). 

ACORD's data types consist partly of those definitions but also expand them with own data types. The data types are used as building blocks for larger entities within the specification:


'''Exhibit 1: XML entities used within the ACORD XML standard'''
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
! style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Entity
! style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Description
|-
| Element
| a base element, based on one or more of the described data types
|- 
| Aggregate
| a collection of corresponding elements, entities or aggregates
|- 
|Entity
| aggregate with the same structure
|- 
|Message
| an aggregate that is used as one entity for communication 
|- 
|Service
| a collection of corresponding messages
|- 
| Document
| a collection of messages that are sent together at the same time  
|}


A detailed description of the technical XML related aspects of the ACORD standard can be obtained for [http://www.acord.org/Standards/propertyxml.aspx Property &amp; Casualty] and for [http://www.acord.org/Standards/lifexml.aspx Life, Annuity &amp; Health].

===XML messages===
The before mentioned data types and structures are used to define messages that can be interchanged between companies implementing the ACORD standard. Different message types are defined within the data model for each insurance segment. The following example shows the messages used within the Reinsurance &amp; Large Commercial segment:


'''Exhibit 2: ACORD XML message types for RLC business'''
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
!style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Message
!style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | Description
|-
| Placing
| message for placing obligatory or facultative business 
|-
| Bordereau 
| message between primary insurance and reinsurance company with information about signed risks
|-
| ClaimMovement 
| message for a claim notification
|-
| TechAccount 
| message to exchange accounting data for a treaty 
|-
| Settlement 
| message to exchange settlements
|-
| Acknowledgement
| message to confirm other messages or to request information 
|}

===ACORD message service===
ACORD messages can be exchanged between implementing companies as plain XML files. Additionally the ACORD standard defines a specialized message exchange service. It is based on the  [[w:en:Web_Services_Description_Language|'''W'''eb '''S'''ervice '''D'''escription '''L'''anguage]] (WSDL) to implement the concepts of web services. The messages are send using the [[w:en:SOAP|'''S'''imple '''O'''bject '''A'''ccess '''P'''rotocol]] (SOAP) standard. Following this protocol a message consists of an envelope with the XML root element, a header and a body which both are direct child elements of the envelope. The SOAP envelope only contains structural information, not the message itself. The actual SOAP messages are send as attachments with the message and are referenced within the message body.

Therefore it's possible to enrich the ACORD messages with additional information in PDF or DOC format.

===Examples===
To provide an impression of the complexity of ACORD's XML standard definitions, following a small excerpt (only some lines of more than 5.000 per XML schema file / DTD) of the Reinsurance &amp; Large Commercial segment's XML schema and DTD files are presented:

===Certification===
To ensure data quality and member's compliance with the proposed standards ACORD offers a special certification program. ACORD members can send their XML messages to ACORD. There the messages are validated in 2 steps:

#Automatic Validation against the standard's XML schema and DTD files
#Validation of the sent data by a human for plausibility which goes beyond the automatical, technical consistency check

==Members==
World's largest insurance companies and insurance related businesses are ACORD members: &quot;Over 70% of the top 10 and 60% of the top 25 Life &amp; Annuity carriers; Over 75% of the top 50 Property &amp; Casualty carriers; and 70% of the top 10 Reinsurers, as well as the Top 5 reinsurance brokers representing 80% of the top 20's gross revenue.&quot;[http://acord.org/about/ourmembers.aspx] The following list shows just some of them:

| In the previous chapter you have learned about the insurance industry's standard for electronical data exchange. It's maintained by a nonprofit organization called ACORD and defines data models for the main insurance segments. The main concepts of the ACORD XML standard are:

* a set of XML schemas and DTDs to ensure the content, structure and &quot;quality&quot; of the sent XML streams
* a set of XML messages for different business cases
* the ACORD message service for exchanging enriched XML data based on WSDL and SOAP

{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Blockquote | Language is a city to the building of which every human being brought a stone. | Ralph Waldo Emerson }}
Usually the details are shielded from the learner, making it at once easier to learn ''exactly and only'' the target language, and harder to reproduce the experience when targeting a different (from-to) language pair. This is of great benefit to the learner, who can just blindly learn, but it is a significant detriment to her future students. 

In the modern world, a great breadth of languages are available for interaction online, in communities, chat rooms, and the like. Likewise, another of the outgrowths of this new access has been self-organized, spontaneous groups, albeit to varying degrees of success. Therefore the learner can no longer afford ignorance of language presentation. This book attempts to address that problem, specifically in the context of developing L2 materials here within the wikimedia communities. 

— At least in english. 

So, we begin by defining our terms.


''&lt;small&gt;note to contributors: please read the [[User:Robbiemuffin/L2 Presentation Patterns/conventions of this book]] first.&lt;/small&gt;''

==Second Language Acquisition==

''First paragraph from [[w:Second_language_acquisition|Second language acquisition]]''

Second [[w:Natural_language|language]] acquisition is the process by which people learn a [[w:Second_language|second language]] in addition to their [[w:Native_language|native language]](s). The term second language is used to describe the [[w:Language_acquisition|acquisition]] of any language after the acquisition of the mother tongue. There is also research into the similarities and differences of Third Language Acquisition. The language to be learned is often referred to as the &quot;target language&quot; or &quot;L2&quot;, compared to the first language, &quot;L1&quot;. Second language acquisition may be abbreviated &quot;SLA&quot;, or L2A, for &quot;L2 acquisition&quot;.

L2 acquisition can be seen as a process through which students (in the plural) develop their own personal language, the [[w:learner_language|learner language]]. By continually refining and adding to the learner language, and then rehearsing, memorizing, and practicing, they reshape the learner language into the target language. This description has the advantage that it well describes the difference between a professional level of understanding a language, and a native understanding of a language. To achieve the native level ''&lt;small&gt;(see &lt;ref&gt;[[w:ILR_scale|ILR scale]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages|Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]]&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;'', you need not have a professional proficiency; you simply must be there. Or more to the point, a native speaker may not be able to express long, nuanced and profound technical arguments: In the United States, teaching this sort of expression typically is only begun at the third year of English at the undergraduate level. In Javanese, people that master the [[w:Honorifics|honorifics]] are held in high esteem. By changing contexts from the learner language to the actual target language, all the countless intangibles of culture, religion, and other social contexts have full breadth and their correct, natural associations with the language presentation itself — ''at least existentially''.

== L2 in practice on the Internet ==

There are different approaches; some expect the learner to construct the language from samples for memorization, or one might achieve an equivalent approach by directly engaging in chat without prior knowledge, while others provide varying degrees of the rules of the language; comparatively or constructively.  Regardless of what is exposed, it is a fact that all languages are approximable if not systematic. Learners from another language will be studying the parts of these systems in their target language.

== Format of this book ==

'' ''* ''The following concepts from computer science are required for a thorough understanding of the coverage in this section: '''[[w:Design_pattern_(computer_science)|pattern]]''', '''[[w:Scaffold_(programming)|scaffolding]]'''.

=== Modules ===

Each chapter in this book is divided into learning modules. There will be several of these; but each module is short and approachable. They are intended to be bite-sized chunks of information. Throughout the first section of the book we will build out a framework for language presentation, always this language as the example. After establishing an appreciation of this process, we will talk about the intersection of two such structures (the langauges of the from-to language pair).

=== Patterns ===
A presentation pattern is '''not''' a [[w:Pedagogical_patterns|Pedagogical pattern]].

A presentation pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in presentation. Such a pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into a usable presentation. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. The patterns typically show relationships and interactions, without specifying the final application involved in a learning exchange.

=== Scaffolding ===

Scaffolding is a technique of presentation in which the presenter may write a specification that describes the application  of patterns to specific data, towards an overreaching goal. Within each module in the book are one or more scaffolding, and each scaffolding applies one or more pattern to data towards the conveyance of some end-goal.

== Modularization ==

Generally, to teach a language one need convey many things.  The sounds and writing of the language, at least a working vocabulary of lexemes, a grammar, complete with semantic and pragmatic coverage specific to the logosphere, and culture.

# '''Extended NSM words''' to the 50% frequency — ''(see the Core vocabulary section of the  [[w:Pimsleur_language_learning_system|Pimsleur]] system)''
# '''Basic vocabulary'''
# '''Familiar [[w:Loan_words|Loan words]]''' — ''from the mother tongue or the mother tongue family if relations permit.''
# '''Other Loan words''' — ''from other languages or language families where the exotic language contributes substantially to the target langauge''

# '''Simple tenses''' — ''temporals demarked only through inflection or the like''
# '''[[w:Auxiliary_verb|Auxilliaries]]'''
# '''[[w:Linguistic_modality|Modals]]'''
# '''Other Verb Qualities''' — ''[[w:Grammatical_mood|Mood]], [[w:Grammatical_voice|voice]], [[w:Grammatical_aspect|aspect]], and [[w:Grammatical_person|person]], as necessary to &lt;small&gt;FLESH OUT&lt;/small&gt; the verbs.''
* '''&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps; font-size:1.25em&quot;&gt;Pragmatics &amp; Semantics&lt;/span&gt;'''
# '''Advanced Grammar''' — ''compound, complex sentence/phrasal structure''
# '''Technical, professional discourse'''
# '''[[w:Honorific|Honorifics]]'''
* '''&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps; font-size:1.25em&quot;&gt;Logospheric Semantics&lt;/span&gt;'''
# '''Phrases'''
# '''Signs''' — ''for example, in many places in Asia it is common to imply things the public is not allowed to do at a location: A sign may describe the embarrassment of litering, in place of a direct prohibition''
# '''Jargon and other microformats''' — ''such as Legal, contractual language''
* '''&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps; font-size:1.25em&quot;&gt;Culture and related Pragmatics&lt;/span&gt;'''
# '''Introductory cultural topics'''
# Survey of literature
# Survey of film and the arts
# Survey of technical, professional work
# '''Local cultures'''
# '''Local accent'''
# '''Cultural identity'''
# '''Place within culture'''

It is a generally complete list of the modules we will use for presenting a language — and together in some form they should suffice. Nonetheless, using this list directly as a plan for language learning is unworkable.  Simply put: Topics often need be presented simultaneously, and in a recurring fashion, and not simply rearranged into a different order.

Most language learning resources follow a path that maps well to the [[w:Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages|Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]].  Like the following:
{|
|'''Travel'''
| Phrases, official signs, NSM

|-
|'''A1'''
| Sounds and writing, simple tenses in pure form, expanded NSM, phrases, introductory cultural topics
|-
|'''A2'''
| Further writing if required, simple tenses, Simple modals/auxilliaries in pure form, fundamental vocabulary, more phrases, cultural topics
|-
|'''B1'''
| Modals/auxilliaries, complex phrases , introductory literature/movies, subculture-specific accent focus and identity
|-
|'''B2'''
| Compound/complex sentences, literature/movies, subculture-specific accent focus and identity
|-
|'''C1'''
| Persuasive devises, technical and professional topics, subculture-specific accent focus and identity
|}
Although most free coursework on the internet will only provide guided coverage until the B1 level.

'''Because of the variety in the presentations available, this ''average'' plan will be the plan used by convention in this book.'''

== Recap ==

This book attempts to present the oft-hidden structure in online L2 language instruction. We will flesh out a general framework of: The sounds and writing of the language, at least a working vocabulary of lexemes, a grammar, complete with semantic and pragmatic coverage specific to the logosphere, and culture. Later we will work with this framework in a more directed fashion.

Hello, my name is Justin and I am currently a CTE teacher at Warwick High School in Newport News, VA. I worked for The Hershey Company for five years and then decided to change careers to become a teacher. I am currently taking course in order to receive my full teaching license.


'''''My Educational Philosophy'''''

When I worked at Hershey, I consistently saw young people who were leaving high school without the skills necessary to be successful in the corporate world. I believe in showing students how they can take what they have learned in all of their courses and apply it to real world scenarios. I believe that all students can learn and be successful in their post secondary endeavors if they find what their skills are and match it to what type of job or career interests them. I feel it is my responsibility to prepare and provide the students with the skills they will need in order to be ready to take advantage of career opportunities.

I believe in facilitating a high level of parental involvement in my classes. This is one of the main keys to having a successful class in the areas of discipline and instruction. I have seen that the students who have parents who are involved in their academic endeavors perform far better than those who don't. 

I am a Career and Technical Education teacher, so I use technology every day in my class. We use computers, an LCD projector,  podcasts, blogs, Microsoft Office 2008, and many more software applications to facilitate the learning experience. I believe in having a class with a high level of student engagement and the technology is what is used to accomplish this. It is always exciting to see the student's eyes light up when they get the opportunity to utilize a new piece of technology. Having access to this technology is what will enable the students to be successful in the 21st Century job market.
 
I beleieve in utilizing differentiated instruction strategies in my classroom. This doesn't mean that I give each student a different way to complete every assignment, but it does mean that I try to vary the types and ways to complete different assignments throughout the year which will allow all students to have a chance to be successful depending on how they learn. I also give my special needs and ESOL students the same assignments I give the rest of the class, but I do try to walk around and provide them with additional help in order for them to be successful. I have found that these students can perform very well and be successful with many, if not all, of the assignments when they are given the extra instruction and help they need.

Finally, I assess my students performance based off of tests, quizzes, projects, classwork, and homework. I believe in trying to find as many ways to assess my students work as possible because I know that not only do students learn different, but they also have their strengths and weaknesses in different forms of assessment. For instance, in the computer courses I teach, I have students who can understand how to complete assignments on the computer and do fantastic projects, but they don't test well. If they show me that they can perform the activity that I am teaching, is that not as good or better than writing it down on a test? By differentiating the ways that I assess students work, I can ensure that there is a more accurate assessment of what they are learning and achieving.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== clock ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
clock_t clock( void );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The clock() function returns the processor time since the program started, or -1 if that information is unavailable. To convert the return value to seconds, divide it by '''CLOCKS_PER_SEC'''. 

{{NOTE|If your compiler and library is POSIX compliant, then '''CLOCKS_PER_SEC''' is always defined as 1000000.}}

Hello David! I must admit that I had no interest in my buisness class and/or computer class during high school. But to be fair, In high school i didn't really take interest to any of my classes. It sounds like you have a good understanding of your students and you are passionate about your subject. I think that will take you very far in your teaching career and the students will respect you for it. [[User:Cojames|Cojames]] ([[User talk:Cojames|talk]]) 22:23, 1 June 2008 (UTC)


Hey David! As a fellow business teacher, it seems that we have a lot in common. I can definitely relate to your experiences in terms of many students not taking our business courses as seriously as they should. I look forward to having some discussions with you as to how we can reach these students! [[User:Jroer001|Jroer001]] ([[User talk:Jroer001|talk]]) 03:41, 2 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

CTE teacher, is that Technology Education?  I know several teachers at Warwick, one in the Math department and two in the History Department. I am a substitute teacher for Newport News, as well as Gloucester County and Williamsburg, so if you ever need someone (unless I get a full time teaching job next year) just contact me and I would be glad to help out if I can. Great page so far though. [[User:Sthur002|Sthur002]] ([[User talk:Sthur002|talk]]) 00:04, 31 May 2008 (UTC)



Hey fellow business teacher.  We will have to get together and discuss lesson plan ideas in the summer.  I am teaching mainly computer courses (which I saw you also teach).  I am also teaching Business Management: Virtual Enterprise, which can be a great class, but is a lot of work on the student end as well as the teacher end.  Hope the last two weeks go well for you. [[User:Davidbaer|Davidbaer]] ([[User talk:Davidbaer|talk]]) 04:04, 2 June 2008 (UTC)

Yes, it is a challenge balancing work, school and motherhood. I'm leaning on my husband more and trying to be good with my time, but I'm not sure I have it all figured out yet!

Following on from the introduction of sets and their manipulation, this section introduces formal number theory.

=Numbers=

The use of numbers was probably the first application of mathematical theory. As we have seen, many many objects can be defined using mathematical logic, but the study of quantities of these objects is based in number theory. As a human, it is natural to have an implicit understanding of quantities, but defining numbers formally will require definitions from the previous section. Again, let us start with nothing; in particular the number zero (0), representing the quantity of no objects. Formally it can be stated that a set with zero objects is empty. If an object, any at all, is introduced into this set, the set is no longer empty, and the quantity of objects within it is no longer zero. As long as the introduced object is solitary, we can state in English that the set now contains one object. Progressing onwards from this results in the concept of numbers that we know and love.
* &lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; A number is representative of the quantity of arbitrary objects in an arbitrary set.
* &lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;math&gt;n(A)&lt;/math&gt; is an operation performed on a set A that gives the quantity of objects contained within.

These definitions lead to the progression below

&lt;math&gt;0=n(\mathcal{f}\}),\;1=n(\{a\}),\;2=n(\{a,b\}),...&lt;/math&gt;

giving us the set of symbols {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} to represent quantities.

When progressing beyond the value of 9 we could try to represent each value with a different symbol to infinity, but this would quickly become tedious, as the symbols would either have to differ by infinitesimally small amounts or grow to very large sizes to represent the changes in value, and in practice they would have to grow anyway due to limitations in resolution and the particular nature of the universe. So we do not do this; here the concept of a positional numeral system needs introduction.

Within a positional numeral system, the actual value of a numeral depends (as the name implies) on its position within the collection of numerals that make up the number. Following on from the progression before, the sequence continues with the number 10. Here the numeral 1 holds the value of &lt;math&gt;n(A)&lt;/math&gt; where A is a set holding one more object than the number represented by the symbol 9. The numeral 0 is a placeholder, important in that it increases the value of the numeral to the left by its presence. A numeral holding the position of the 1 in this, the number ten, will have its value similarly scaled. For example, jumping forward in the progression, the number 83. The numeral 3 holds its base value, and the numeral 8 has its base value scaled by the value the 1 represents in the number 10. In this, the commonly used Hindu-Arabic system, the value of a numeral is ten times the value it would hold were it placed one position to the right, down to the base value of the numeral at the rightmost position. The result of this is a powerful system that allows the concept of the value of large and diverse numbers to be communicated in concise written form.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Second Order Systems: Examples==

===Example 1===

A damped control system for aiming a [[w:Hydrophone|hydrophonic]] array on a minesweeper vessel has the following open-loop transfer function from the driveshaft to the array.

::&lt;math&gt;G(s)=\frac{K}{Js^2 + K_ds}&lt;/math&gt;

The gain parameter ''K'' can be varied. The moment of inertia, ''J'', of the array and the force due to viscous drag of the water, ''K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' are known constants and given as:

*&lt;math&gt;J = 9 \, N \, m \, s^2 \, rad^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;K_d = 2 \, N \, m \, s \, rad^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

====Tasks====
#The system is arranged as a closed loop system with unity feedback. Find the value of ''K'' such that, when the input is a unit step, the closed loop response has at most a 50% overshoot (approximately). You may use standard response curves. Should ''K'' be greater or less than this value for less overshoot?
#Find the corresponding time-domain response of the system.
#The system is now given an input of constant angular velocity, ''V''. For the limiting value of ''K'' found above, calculate the maximum value of ''V'' such that the array follows the input with at most 5° error.

====Task 1====

First, let us draw the block diagram of the system. We know the open-loop transfer function, and that there is unit feedback. Therefore, we have:

[[Image:Control Theory Example 1.svg|center]]

The closed-loop gain is given by:

::{|
|&lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;=\frac{G(s)}{1+G(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;||&lt;math&gt;=\frac{\dfrac{K}{Js^2 + K_ds}}{\dfrac{Js^2 + K_ds+K}{Js^2 + K_ds}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;||&lt;math&gt;=\frac{K}{Js^2 + K_ds+K}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

We now need to express the closed-loop transfer function in the standard second order form.

::{|
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2+2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2}&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;=\frac{K}{Js^2 + K_ds+K}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;||&lt;math&gt;=\frac{\frac{K}{J}}{s^2 + \frac{K_d}{J}s+\frac{K}{J}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

We can now express the natural frequency  ''&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and damping ratio, ''&amp;zeta;'':

::&lt;math&gt;\omega_n^2 = \frac{K}{J} = \frac{K}{9}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;2 \zeta \omega_n = \frac{K_d}{J}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \frac{K_d}{2J} \sqrt{\frac{J}{K}} = \frac{K_d}{2} \sqrt{\frac{1}{KJ}}=\frac{1}{3\sqrt{K}}&lt;/math&gt;

We now look at the standard response curves for second order systems.

[[Image:2nd Order Damping Ratios.svg|center|500px]]

We see that for 50% overshoot, we need ''&amp;zeta;''=0.2 or more.

::&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \frac{1}{3 \sqrt{K}} \le \frac{1}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;K \ge \frac{25}{9}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the maximum permissible value, thus ''K'' should be less than this value for less overshoot. We can now evaluate the natural frequency fully:

::&lt;math&gt;\omega_n = \frac{5}{9}&lt;/math&gt;

====Task 2====

The output of the second order system is given by the following equation:

::{|
|&lt;math&gt;y(t) &lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;= 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}} e^{-\zeta \omega_n t} \sin \left( \sqrt{1-\zeta^2} \omega_n t + \sin^{-1} \sqrt{1-\zeta^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;||&lt;math&gt;= 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} e^{-t/9} \sin \left( \frac{5\sqrt{0.96}}{9} t + \sin^{-1} \sqrt{0.96} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;||&lt;math&gt;= 1 - 1.02 e^{-t/9} \sin \left( 0.544 t +0.436 \pi \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

We can plot the output of this system:

[[Image:Control Theory Example 1a.svg|center|500px]]
====Task 3====

The tracking error signal, ''E(s)'', is equal to the output's deviation from the input.

::&lt;math&gt;E(s) = R(s) - Y(s)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can find the gain from the reference input, ''R(s)'' to the error tracking signal:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{E(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{R(s)-Y(s)}{R(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

The gain from the input to the error tracking signal of a unity feedback system like this is simply &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+G(s)}&lt;/math&gt;.

::{|
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{E(s)}{R(s)} &lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1} { 1 + \frac{K}{9s^2 + 2s}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;||&lt;math&gt;= \frac{9s^2 + 2s}{9s^2 + 2s + 2.78}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Now, ''R(s)'' is given by the Laplace transform of a ramp of slope ''V'':

::&lt;math&gt;R(s) = \frac{v}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;

We now use the final value theorem to find the value of ''E(s)'' in the steady state:

::{|
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t \to \infty}{e(t)} &lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;= \lim_{s \to 0}{sE(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;||&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{s \to 0}{s \frac{9s^2 + 2s}{9s^2 + 2s + 2.78} \frac{V}{s^2} }&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;||&lt;math&gt;=\frac{2V}{2.78}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

We require this to be less than &lt;math&gt;5^\circ = \frac{5\pi}{180} \mbox{rad}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;V \le \frac{2.78}{2}\times \frac{5\pi}{180} = 0.12 \,\mbox{rad/s}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">in the last chapter, it says, the TV shows the same as the monitor, this is not the case if the Tv has a smaller resolution, then it only shows a part.

== How do you put in more than one monitor configurations?  ==

Which monitor is monitor 0?
and can you put more than one monitor configuration up?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Avoid peacock and weasel terms ==
[[Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms|Avoid peacock terms]] that show off the subject of the article without containing any real information. Similarly, [[Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words|avoid weasel words]] that offer an opinion without really backing it up, and which are really used to express a non-neutral point of view.

|}

Believe in your subject. Let the facts speak for themselves. If your [[w:ice hockey]] player, [[w:canton (district)|canton]], or species of [[w:beetle]] is worth the reader's time, it will come out through the facts. However, in some cases (for example, history of graphic design) using superlative adjectives (in the &quot;... ''one of the'' most important figures in the history of ...&quot; format) in the description may help readers with no previous knowledge about the subject to acknowledge the importance or generally perceived status of the subject discussed. Note that to use the this type of superlative adjective format, the claim must be supported by the most reputable experts in the respective field.

Avoid blanket terms unless you have verified them. For example, [[w:List of the most common U.S. county name etymologies#Montgomery County (18 counties)|this article]] states that of the 18 Montgomery Counties in the United States, '''most''' are named after Richard Montgomery. This is a blanket statement. It may very well be true, but is it reliable? In this instance the editor had done the research to verify this. Without the research, the statement should not be made. It is always a good idea to describe the research done and sign it on the article's talk page.

If you wish to, or must refer to an opinion, first make sure it is given by someone who holds some standing in that subject. A view on former American President [[w:Gerald Ford]] from [[w:Henry Kissinger]] is more interesting for the reader than one from your teacher at school. Then say who holds the opinion being given, preferably with a source or a quote for it. Compare the following:

:Some critics of [[w:George W. Bush]] have said he has low intelligence.

:Author [[w:Michael Moore]] in his book ''[[w:Stupid White Men]]'' wrote an open letter to George Bush. In it, he asked, &quot;George, are you able to read and write on an adult level?&quot;.

=== Examples ===
Sometimes the way around using these terms is to replace the statements with the facts that backs it up:

:&quot;The Yankees are one of the greatest baseball teams in history.&quot;

:&quot;The New York Yankees have won 26 World Series championships&amp;mdash;almost three times as many as any other team.&quot;

(What does the phrase &lt;i&gt;in history&lt;/i&gt; mean, anyway?)

By sticking to concrete and factual information, we can avoid the need to give any opinion at all. Doing so also makes for writing that is much more interesting, for example:

:'''''William Peckenridge,''''' ''eighth '''Duke of Omnium''' ([[w:1642]]? – [[w:May 8]], [[w:1691]]) is widely considered to be one of the most important men to carry that title.''

:'''''William Peckenridge,''''' ''eighth '''Duke of Omnium''' ([[w:1642]]? – [[w:May 8]], [[w:1691]]) was personal counselor to [[w:James I|King James I]], general in the [[w:Wars of the Roses]], a [[w:chemist]], [[w:bandleader]], and the director of the secret society known as [[w:The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]. He expanded the title of Omnium to include protectorship of Guiana and right of revocation for civil-service appointments in [[w:India]].''

[[w:Show, don't tell]]. The first example simply ''tells'' the reader that William Peckenridge was important. The second example ''shows'' the reader why he was important.

=== Exceptions ===
When repeating established views, it may be easier to simply state: &quot;Before [[w:Nicolaus Copernicus]], most people thought the sun revolved round the earth&quot;, rather than sacrifice clarity with details and sources, particularly if the statement forms only a small part of your article. However, in general, everything should be [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|sourced]], whether within the text, with a footnote, or with a general reference.



==Avoid devilishly flawed reasoning==

A great example of devilishly flawed reasoning can be seen at [[w:Hangul#Orthography|Hangul]], I am borrowing the meat of it here:
&lt;!-- vv These transcriptions are correct; please see the talk page. vv --&gt;
*Pronunciation and translation:
:{{IPA|[mo.tʰa.nɯn.sa.ɾa.mi]}}
:''a person who cannot do it''
*Phonemic transcription:
:모타는사라미
:{{IPA|/mo.tʰa.nɯn.sa.la.mi/}}
*Morphophonemic transcription
:못하는사람이
:{{IPA|//mos.ha.nɯn.sa.lam.i//}}
*Morpheme-by-morpheme [[gloss]]:
{|
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||못-하-는||사람-이
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||mos-ha-neun||saram-i
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||cannot-do-[modifier]||person-[subject]
|}
*Modern orthography
:못 하는 사람이
&lt;!-- ^^ These transcriptions are correct; please see the talk page. ^^ --&gt;

The code looks like this:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!-- vv These transcriptions are correct; please see the talk page. vv --&gt;
*Pronunciation and translation:
:{{IPA|[mo.tʰa.nɯn.sa.ɾa.mi]}}

*Modern orthography
:못 하는 사람이
&lt;!-- ^^ These transcriptions are correct; please see the talk page. ^^ --&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

So, you can see the author anticipates challenges to what is otherwise a rather straightforward looking example.  What this does, in effect, is it '''''injects''''' a negative bias into the example that matches an instance where someone reading up on Hangul and wanting to learn or having difficulty, sees a defeatist message.  This deflates morale, and cannot be tolerated in any neutral text.

==Block quotes==
{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Blockquote|In the book of life, the answers aren't in the back.|Charlie Brown}}
Actual quotes should use the [[User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Blockquote]] template.

The code looks like this:
&lt;pre&gt;{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Blockquote
|In the book of life, the answers aren't in the back.
|Charlie Brown}}&lt;/pre&gt;

==Inserts==
{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Insert|content=
&quot;In the book of life, the answers aren't in the back.&quot; As quoted from Peanuts, Charlie Brown
}}
Actual insets should use the [[User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Insert]] template.

The code looks like this:
&lt;pre&gt;{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Insert|content=
&quot;In the book of life, the answers aren't in the back.&quot; As quoted from Peanuts, Charlie Brown
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

==Contents==
{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Contents Block
|title='''''L2 Presentation Patterns'''''
|contents=User:Robbiemuffin/L2 Presentation Patterns/Contents/registry
|clear=yes, please
}}
Each new page in the flow of the book (excepting the contents page and other special pages) should begin with a contents block. Depending on the content it may need a &quot;clear=yes&quot; flag.
{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Contents Block
|title='''''L2 Presentation Patterns'''''
|contents=User:Robbiemuffin/L2 Presentation Patterns/Contents/registry

}}
 Otherwise this could happen
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
here is the code for a Contents Block:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Contents&quot; /&gt;{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Contents Block
|title='''''L2 Presentation Patterns'''''
|contents=User:Robbiemuffin/L2 Presentation Patterns/Contents/registry
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

==Recap==
Every page should end with a recap with a link to the contents block for that page. See the main page for an example, here is the code for that section:

&lt;pre&gt;== Recap ==

This book attempts to present the oft-hidden structure in online L2 language instruction. We will flesh out a 
general framework of: The sounds and writing of the language, at least a working vocabulary of lexemes, a grammar, 
complete with semantic and pragmatic coverage specific to the logosphere, and culture. Later we will work with this 
framework in a more directed fashion.

'''Return to the [[User:Robbiemuffin/L2 Presentation Patterns#Contents|Contents]]'''
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Transclusion ==
===Modules===
Modules should be transcluded into each chapter, of the form: /L2 Presentation Patterns/CHAPTER/MODULE.
And display a heading link like the following:
'' ''* ''transcluded from the [[User:Robbiemuffin/L2 Presentation Patterns/Sounds and Writing/Writing system|Writing System Module]]: visit it on that page for the recap section of the module.''

===Scaffolding===
Within each module will be scaffolds made of patterns and data. Although the scaffolding should not be transcluded ''per se'', it is important that each have a visual representation if nothing else, and that this itself be transcludable. They should be kept in /L2 Presentation Patterns/CHAPTER/Scaffolding/MODULE

===Pattern===
The patterns should also be transcluded: /L2 Presentation Patterns/Patterns/PATTERN</text>

=== Relationships among Arithmetic, Geometric and Harmonic Mean ===
The Means mentioned above are realizations of the generalized mean 
:&lt;math&gt; \bar{x}(m) = \left ( \frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum_{i=1}^n{|x_i|^m} \right ) ^{1/m} &lt;/math&gt;
and ordered this way: 

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{2}
&amp;\mathit{minimum}&amp;\;=\;&amp;\bar{x}(-\infty) \\
\mathrel&lt;\;&amp;\mathit{harmonic\ mean}&amp;\;=\;&amp;\bar{x}(-1) \\
\mathrel&lt;\;&amp;\mathit{geometric\ mean}&amp;\;=\;&amp;\lim_{m\rightarrow0}\bar{x}(m) \\
\mathrel&lt;\;&amp;\mathit{arithmetic\ mean}&amp;\;=\;&amp;\bar{x}(1) \\
\mathrel&lt;\;&amp;\mathit{maximum}&amp;\;=\;&amp;\bar{x}(\infty)
\end{alignat}

{{RightTOC}}

==A==
===Apocalypse===
The first step toward freedom involves a sorting out of the false from the true. This is a process of separation in the constructive sense, and reflects the true meaning of the Apocalypse. (C2S9¶4)

===Atonement===
Atonement is not welcomed by those who prefer pain and destruction.  c18 - s7 - p1

===Attack===
In the &quot;dynamics&quot; of attack is sacrifice a key idea. 26, 1, 1

==B==
===Blessedness===
You are being blessed by every beneficent thought of any of your brothers anywhere. You should want to bless them in return, out of gratitude. You need not know them individually, or they you. (C5S1¶3)

===Body===
The body cannot heal, because it cannot make itself sick. It needs no healing. Its health or sickness depends entirely on how the mind perceives it, and the purpose that the mind would use it for. It is obvious that a segment of the mind can see itself as separated from the Universal Purpose. When this occurs the body becomes its weapon, used against this Purpose, to demonstrate the &quot;fact&quot; that separation has occurred. The body thus becomes the instrument of illusion, acting accordingly; seeing what is not there, hearing what truth has never said and behaving insanely, being imprisoned by insanity. 19,1,3

==C==
===Choice===
When you come to the place where the branch in the road is quite apparent, you cannot go ahead. You must go either one way or the other. For now if you go straight ahead, the way you went before you reached the branch, you will go nowhere. The whole purpose of coming this far was to decide which branch you will take now. The way you came no longer matters. It can no longer serve. No one who reaches this far can make the wrong decision, although he can delay. And there is no part of the journey that seems more hopeless and futile than standing where the road branches, and not deciding on which way to go. 22-5-1

===The Course===
This course will be believed entirely or not at all. For it is wholly true or wholly false, and cannot be but partially believed. 22-3-7
The motivation for this course is not knowledge but peace. Peace is the prerequisite to knowledge.

===Creation===
In the creation, God extended himself to his creations and imbued them with the same loving will to create. You have not only been fully created, but have also been created perfect. 2-1-1

===Creativity===
Because of your likeness to your Creator you are creative. 2-1-1

==D==
===Death===
Death is the central dream from which all illusions stem. Is it not madness to think of life as being born, aging, losing vitality, and dying in the end? We have asked this question before, but now we need to consider it more carefully. It is the one fixed, unchangeable belief of the world that all things in it are born only to die. M-S27-P1

===Denial===
And if you accept denial, you can accept its undoing.  10-6-6

==E==
===Earning===
Miracles are a way of earning release from fear. C1S1

===Empathy===
To empathize does not mean to join in suffering, for that is what you must refuse to understand. That is the ego's interpretation of empathy, and is always used to form a special relationship in which the suffering is shared. The capacity to empathize is very useful to the Holy Spirit, provided you let Him use it in His way. He does not understand suffering, and would have you teach it is not understandable. When He relates through you, He does not relate through your ego to another ego. He does not join in pain, understanding that healing pain is not accomplished by delusional attempts to enter into it, and lighten it by sharing the delusion.

The clearest proof that empathy as the ego uses it is destructive lies in the fact that it is applied only to certain types of problems and in certain people. These it selects out, and joins with. And it never joins except to strengthen itself. Make no mistake about this maneuver; the ego always empathizes to weaken, and to weaken is always to attack. You do not know what empathizing means. Yet of this you may be sure; if you will merely sit quietly by and let the Holy Spirit relate through you, you will empathize with strength, and will gain in strength and not in weakness. 16 - 1 - 1&amp;2

===Ego===
Let me repeat that the ego's qualifications as a guide are singularly unfortunate, and that it is a remarkably poor choice as a teacher of salvation. T-C9-S4-P8

As host to the ego, you believe that you can give all your guilt away whenever you want, and thereby purchase peace. And the payment does not seem to be yours. While it is obvious that the ego does demand payment it never seems to be demanding it of you. You are unwilling to recognize that the ego, which you invited, is treacherous only to those who think they are its host. The ego will never let you perceive this, since this recognition would make it homeless. For when the recognition dawns clearly, you will not be deceived by any form the ego takes to protect itself from your sight. Each form will be recognized as but a cover for the one idea that hides behind them all; that love demands sacrifice, and is therefore inseparable from attack and fear. And that guilt is the price of love, which must be paid by fear. 15 - 9 6

The ego does not want to teach everyone all it has learned, because that would defeat its purpose. Therefore it does not really learn at all. The Holy Spirit teaches you to use what the ego has made, to teach the opposite of what the ego has &quot;learned&quot;. 7 - 4-3

Your ego and your spirit will never be co-creators, but your spirit and your creator will always be. Be confident that your creations are as safe as you are.

The kingdom is perfectly united and perfectly protected, and the ego will not prevail against it. Amen.

This is written in the form of a prayer because it is useful in moments of temptation. It is a declaration of independence. You will find it very helpful if you understand it fully. The reason you need my help is because you have denied your own guide and therefore need guidance. My role is to separate the true from the false, so truth can break through the barriers the ego has set up and can shine into your mind. Against our united strength the ego cannot prevail. 4,4,1&amp;2

===Emptiness===
There is no emptiness in you. 2-1-1

===Extension===
To extend is a fundamental aspect of God which he gave to his son. 2-1-1

==F==
===Faith===
Do not overlook our earlier statement that faithlessness leads straight to illusions. For faithlessness is the perception of a brother as a body, and the body cannot be used for purposes of union. If, then, you see your brother as a body, you have established a condition in which uniting with him becomes impossible. Your faithlessness to him has separated you from him, and kept you both apart from being healed. Your faithlessness has thus opposed the Holy Spirit's purpose, and brought illusions, centered on the body, to stand between you. And the body will seem to be sick, for you have made of it an &quot;enemy&quot; of healing and the opposite of truth.

It cannot be difficult to realize that faith must be the opposite of faithlessness. Yet the difference in how they operate is less apparent, though it follows directly from the fundamental difference in what they are. Faithlessness would always limit and attack; faith would remove all limitations and make whole. Faithlessness would interpose illusions between the Son of God and his Creator; faith would remove all obstacles that seem to rise between them. Faithlessness is wholly dedicated to illusions; faith wholly to truth. Partial dedication is impossible. 19,1,4-5

===Fear===
Fear is not of the present, but only of the past and future, which do not exist. There is no fear in the present when each instant stands clear and separated from the past, without its shadow reaching out into the future. 15,1,8

===Forgiveness===
Forgiveness is the key to happiness. (W121¶1)

Forgiveness is the end of specialness. (C24S4¶1)

==G==
===Giving===
The unforgiving mind does not believe that giving and receiving are the same. W121P10

==H==
===Healing===
To heal is to make happy. (C5S1¶1)

Those who attempt to heal without being wholly joyous themselves call forth different kinds of responses at the same time, and thus deprive others of the joy of responding wholeheartedly. (C5S1¶1)

Health is the witness unto health. As long as it is unattested, it remains without conviction. Only when it has been demonstrated is it proved, and must provide a witness that compels belief. (C27S5¶1)

You do not know what healing is. 16 - 1 - 3

===Health===
Health is inner peace. It enables you to remain unshaken by lack of love from without and capable, through your acceptance of miracles, of correcting the conditions proceeding from lack of love in others. (C2S1¶5)

Health is the witness unto health. (C27S5¶2)

===Holy Spirit===
The Holy Spirit communicates only what each one can give to all. He never takes anything back, because He wants you to keep it. Therefore, His teaching begins with the lesson:
:''To have, give all to all. 
:6,7,5

==I==
===Imagination===
You can violate God's laws in your imagination, but you cannot escape from them. C10S1P1

==J==
===Justice===
Justice is the divine correction for injustice. Injustice is the basis for all the judgments of the world. Justice corrects the interpretations to which injustice gives rise, and cancels them out. Neither justice nor injustice exists in Heaven, for error is impossible and correction meaningless. (M19¶1)

==K==
===Knowledge===
True perception is the basis for knowledge, but knowing is the affirmation of truth and beyond all perceptions. (C3S3¶1)

==L==
===Learning===
There is no need to learn through pain. 21-2-3

===Love===
There is no difference between love and joy. (C5S1¶2)

==M==
===Miracles===
A miracle is a correction. It does not create, nor really change at all. It merely looks on devastation, and reminds the mind that what it sees is false. It undoes error, but does not attempt to go beyond perception, nor exceed the function of forgiveness. Thus it stays within time's limits. Yet it paves the way for the return of timelessness and love's awakening, for fear must slip away under the gentle remedy it brings.

A miracle contains the gift of grace, for it is given and received as one. And thus it illustrates the law of truth the world does not obey, because it fails entirely to understand its ways. A miracle inverts perception which was upside down before, and thus it ends the strange distortions that were manifest. Now is perception open to the truth. Now is forgiveness seen as justified.

Forgiveness is the home of miracles. The eyes of Christ deliver them to all they look upon in mercy and in love. Perception stands corrected in His sight, and what was meant to curse has come to bless. Each lily of forgiveness offers all the world the silent miracle of love. And each is laid before the Word of God, upon the universal altar to Creator and creation in the light of perfect purity and endless joy.

The miracle is taken first on faith, because to ask for it implies the mind has been made ready to conceive of what it cannot see and does not understand. Yet faith will bring its witnesses to show that what it rested on is really there. And thus the miracle will justify your faith in it, and show it rested on a world more real than what you saw before; a world redeemed from what you thought was there.

Miracles fall like drops of healing rain from Heaven on a dry and dusty world, where starved and thirsty creatures come to die. Now they have water. Now the world is green. And everywhere the signs of life spring up, to show that what is born can never die, for what has life has immortality. [[Wikisource:A Course in Miracles/Workbook for Students/What Is a Miracle?|What Is a Miracle?]]

&lt;center&gt;'''Principles of Miracles'''&lt;/center&gt;

1. There is no order of difficulty in miracles. One is not &quot;harder&quot; or &quot;bigger&quot; than another. They are all the same. All expressions of love are maximal.

2. Miracles as such do not matter. The only thing that matters is their source, which is far beyond evaluation.

3. Miracles occur naturally as expressions of love. The real miracle is the love that inspires them. In this sense everything that comes from love is a miracle.

4. All miracles mean life, and God is the giver of life. His voice will direct you very specifically. You will be told all you need to know.

5. Miracles are habits, and should be involuntary. They should not be under conscious control. Consciously selected miracles can be misguided.

6. Miracles are natural. When they do not occur something has gone wrong.

7. Miracles are everyone's right, but purification is necessary first.

8. Miracles are healing because they supply a lack; they are performed by those who temporarily have more for those who temporarily have less.

9. Miracles are a kind of exchange. Like all expressions of love, which are always miraculous in the true sense, the exchange reverses the physical laws. They bring more love both to the giver and the receiver.

10. The use of miracles as spectacles to induce belief is a misunderstanding of their purpose.

11. Prayer is the medium of miracles. It is a means of communication of the created with the Creator. Through prayer love is received, and through miracles love is expressed.

12. Miracles are thoughts. Thoughts can represent the lower or bodily level of experience, or the higher or spiritual level of experience. One makes the physical, and the other creates the spiritual.

13. Miracles are both beginnings and endings, and so they alter the temporal order. They are always affirmations of rebirth, which seem to go back but really go forward. They undo the past in the present, and thus release the future.

14. Miracles bear witness to truth. They are convincing because they arise from conviction. Without conviction they deteriorate into magic, which is mindless and therefore destructive; or rather, the uncreative use of mind.

15. Each day should be devoted to miracles. The purpose of time is to enable you to learn how to use time constructively. It is thus a teaching device and a means to an end. Time will cease when it is no longer useful in facilitating learning.

16. Miracles are teaching devices for demonstrating it is as blessed to give as to receive. They simultaneously increase the strength of the giver and supply strength to the receiver.

17. Miracles transcend the body. They are sudden shifts into invisibility, away from the bodily level. That is why they heal.

18. A miracle is a service. It is the maximal service you can render to another. It is a way of loving your neighbor as yourself. You recognize your own and your neighbor's worth simultaneously.

19. Miracles make minds one in God. They depend on cooperation because the Sonship is the sum of all that God created. Miracles therefore reflect the laws of eternity, not of time.

20. Miracles reawaken the awareness that the spirit, not the body, is the altar of truth. This is the recognition that leads to the healing power of the miracle.

21. Miracles are natural signs of forgiveness. Through miracles you accept God's forgiveness by extending it to others.

22. Miracles are associated with fear only because of the belief that darkness can hide. You believe that what your physical eyes cannot see does not exist. This leads to a denial of spiritual sight.

23. Miracles rearrange perception and place all levels in true perspective. This is healing because sickness comes from confusing the levels.

24. Miracles enable you to heal the sick and raise the dead because you made sickness and death yourself, and can therefore abolish both. You are a miracle, capable of creating in the likeness of your Creator. Everything else is your own nightmare, and does not exist. Only the creations of light are real.

25. Miracles are part of an interlocking chain of forgiveness which, when completed, is the Atonement. Atonement works all the time and in all the dimensions of time.

26. Miracles represent freedom from fear. &quot;Atoning&quot; means &quot;undoing.&quot; The undoing of fear is an essential part of the Atonement value of miracles.

27. A miracle is a universal blessing from God through me to all my brothers. It is the privilege of the forgiven to forgive.

28. Miracles are a way of earning release from fear. Revelation induces a state in which fear has already been abolished. Miracles are thus a means and revelation is an end.

29. Miracles praise God through you. They praise him by honoring his creations, affirming their perfection. They heal because they deny body-identification and affirm spirit-identification.

30. By recognizing spirit, miracles adjust the levels of perception and show them in proper alignment. This places spirit at the center, where it can communicate directly.

31. Miracles should inspire gratitude, not awe. You should thank God for what you really are. The children of God are holy and the miracle honors their holiness, which can be hidden but never lost.

32. I inspire all miracles, which are really intercessions. They intercede for your holiness and make your perceptions holy. By placing you beyond the physical laws they raise you into the sphere of celestial order. In this order you are perfect.

33. Miracles honor you because you are lovable. They dispel illusions about yourself and perceive the light in you. They thus atone for your errors by freeing you from your nightmares. By releasing your mind from the imprisonment of your illusions, they restore your sanity.

34. Miracles restore the mind to its fullness. By atoning for lack they establish perfect protection. The spirit's strength leaves no room for intrusions.

35. Miracles are expressions of love, but they may not always have observable effects.

36. Miracles are examples of right thinking, aligning your perceptions with truth as God created it.

37. A miracle is a correction introduced into false thinking by me. It acts as a catalyst, breaking up erroneous perception and reorganizing it properly. This places you under the Atonement principle, where perception is healed. Until this has occurred, knowledge of the Divine Order is impossible.

38. The Holy Spirit is the mechanism of miracles. He recognizes both God's creations and your illusions. He separates the true from the false by his ability to perceive totally rather than selectively.

39. The miracle dissolves error because the Holy Spirit identifies error as false or unreal. This is the same as saying that by perceiving light, darkness automatically disappears.

40. The miracle acknowledges everyone as your brother and mine. It is a way of perceiving the universal mark of God.

41. Wholeness is the perceptual content of miracles. They thus correct, or atone for, the faulty perception of lack.

42. A major contribution of miracles is their strength in releasing you from your false sense of isolation, deprivation and lack.

43. Miracles arise from a miraculous state of mind, or a state of miracle-readiness.

44. The miracle is an expression of an inner awareness of Christ and the acceptance of his Atonement.

45. A miracle is never lost. It may touch many people you have not even met, and produce undreamed of changes in situations of which you are not even aware.

46. The Holy Spirit is the highest communication medium. Miracles do not involve this type of communication, because they are temporary communication devices. When you return to your original form of communication with God by direct revelation, the need for miracles is over.

47. The miracle is a learning device that lessens the need for time. It establishes an out-of-pattern time interval not under the usual laws of time. In this sense it is timeless.

48. The miracle is the only device at your immediate disposal for controlling time. Only revelation transcends it, having nothing to do with time at all.

49. The miracle makes no distinction among degrees of misperception. It is a device for perception correction, effective quite apart from either the degree or the direction of the error. This is its true indiscriminateness.

50. The miracle compares what you have made with creation, accepting what is in accord with it as true, and rejecting what is out of accord as false. (C1S1)

==N==
===Needs===
No learning is acquired by anyone unless he wants to learn it and believes in some way that he needs it. C1S6P1

==O==
===Ownership===
If you share a physical possession, you do divide its ownership. If you share an idea, however, you do not lessen it. C5S2P1

==P==
===Pain===
You no more recognize what is painful than you know what is joyful, and are, in fact, very apt to confuse the two. 7-10-3

===Peace===
You who want peace can find it only by complete forgiveness. C1S6P1

If you want peace you must abandon the teacher of attack. The Teacher of Peace will never abandon you. You can desert him but he will never reciprocate, for his faith in you is his understanding. It is as firm as is his faith in his Creator, and he knows that faith in his Creator must encompass faith in his creation. In this consistency lies his holiness which he cannot abandon, for it is not his will to do so. With your perfection ever in his sight, he gives the gift of peace to everyone who perceives the need for peace, and who would have it. Make way for peace, and it will come. For understanding is in you, and from it peace must come. 14 - 11 - second to last

===Problems===
Problems are not specific but they take specific forms, and these specific shapes make up the world. And no one understands the nature of his problem. If he did, it would be there no more for him to see. Its very nature is that it is not. And thus, while he perceives it he can not perceive it as it is. (C27S5¶8)

===Promises===
Whoever says, &quot;There is no gap between my mind and yours&quot; has kept God's promise, not his tiny oath to be forever faithful unto death. And by his healing is his brother healed. 28 - 6 - 5

==Q==
===Questions===
Your question is whether the means by which this course is learned will bring to you the joy it promises. 21-2-3

==R==
===Redemption===
In the extreme, you are afraid of redemption and you believe it will kill you. 13,3,8

===Relationships===
Time is indeed unkind to the unholy relationship. For time is cruel in the ego's hands, as it is kind when used for gentleness. The attraction of the unholy relationship begins to fade and to be questioned almost at once. Once it is formed, doubt must enter in, because its purpose is impossible. The &quot;ideal&quot; of the unholy relationship thus becomes one in which the reality of the other does not enter at all to &quot;spoil&quot; the dream. And the less the other really brings to the relationship, the &quot;better&quot; it becomes. Thus, the attempt at union becomes a way of excluding even the one with whom the union was sought. For it was formed to get him out of it, and join with fantasies in uninterrupted &quot;bliss.&quot; 17,3,4

===Religion===

Allegiance to the denial of God is the ego's religion. 10-6-3

==S==
===Salvation===
Salvation is undoing. 31 - 6 - 1

Salvation does not ask that you behold the spirit and perceive the body not. It merely asks that this should be your choice. 31 - 6 - 3

Say only this, but mean it with no reservations, for here the power of salvation lies: 
:I am responsible for what I see. 21 -2 - 12

===Shoulds===
Yet I have said already that only constructive acts should be involuntary. (C2S7¶1)

Ask me which miracles you should perform. (C1S3¶4)

Your words should reflect only mercy, because that is what you have received and that is what you should give. (C3S6¶6)

I can tell you what to do, but you must collaborate by believing that I know what you should do. (C8S4¶4) 

===Sickness===
Sickness is isolation. For it seems to keep one self apart from all the rest, to suffer what the others do not feel. It gives the body final power to make the separation real, and keep the mind in solitary prison, split apart and held in pieces by a solid wall of sickened flesh, which it can not surmount. (W137¶3)

When a brother is sick it is because he is not asking for peace, and therefore does not know he has it. The acceptance of peace is the denial of illusion, and sickness is an illusion. Yet every Son of God has the power to deny illusions anywhere in the Kingdom, merely by denying them completely in himself. 10,4,7

===Sight===
Never forget the world the sightless &quot;see&quot; must be imagined, for what it really looks like is unknown to them. They must infer what could be seen from evidence forever indirect; and reconstruct their inferences as they stumble and fall because of what they did not recognize, or walk unharmed through open doorways that they thought were closed. And so it is with you. You do not see. Your cues for inference are wrong, and so you stumble and fall down upon the stones you did not recognize, but fail to be aware you can go through the doors you thought were closed, but which stand open before unseeing eyes, waiting to welcome you. 21,2,1

===Sin===
Sins are in bodies. They are not perceived in minds. They are not seen as purposes, but actions. Bodies act, and minds do not. And therefore must the body be at fault for what it does. It is not seen to be a passive thing, obeying your commands, and doing nothing of itself at all. If you are sin you are a body, for the mind acts not. And purpose must be in the body, not the mind. The body must act on its own, and motivate itself. If you are sin you lock the mind within the body, and you give its purpose to its prison house, which acts instead of it. A jailer does not follow orders, but enforces orders on the prisoner. 31, 3, 3

Yet if the Holy Spirit can commute each sentence that you laid upon yourself into a blessing, then it cannot be a sin. Sin is the only thing in all the world that cannot change. It is immutable. And on its changelessness the world depends. The magic of the world can seem to hide the pain of sin from sinners, and deceive with glitter and with guile. Yet each one knows the cost of sin is death. And so it is. For sin is a request for death, a wish to make this world's foundation sure as love, dependable as Heaven, and as strong as God Himself. The world is safe from love to everyone who thinks sin possible. Nor will it change. 25, 8, 1

===Solitude===
Lead not your little life in solitude, with one illusion as your only friend. 26-6-2

===Suffering===
No one can suffer if he does not see himself attacked, and losing by attack. 28 - 6 - 4

==T==
===Teaching===
A good teacher clarifies his own ideas and strengthens them by teaching them. Teacher and pupil are alike in the learning process. They are in the same order of learning, and unless they share their lessons conviction will be lacking. A good teacher must believe in the ideas he teaches, but he must meet another condition; he must believe in the students to whom he offers the ideas. 4, 2, 1

===Thought===
You are being blessed by every beneficent thought of any of your brothers anywhere. (C5S1¶3)

Every loving thought held in any part of the Sonship belongs to every part. (C5S5¶3)

===Time===
The purpose of time is to enable you to learn how to use time constructively. It is thus a teaching device and a means to an end. Time will cease when it is no longer useful in facilitating learning. (C1S1¶1)

===Truth===
It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it is necessary to seek for what is false. 16,4,6

==U==
===Uncertainty===
Uncertainty brought to certainty does not retain any conviction of reality. 14-8-3

==V==
===Vision===
True vision is the natural perception of spiritual sight, but it is still a correction rather than a fact. Spiritual sight is symbolic, and therefore not a device for knowing. It is, however, a means of right perception, which brings it into the proper domain of the miracle. A &quot;vision of God&quot; would be a miracle rather than a revelation. The fact that perception is involved at all removes the experience from the realm of knowledge. That is why visions, however holy, do not last. 3 - 3 - 4

Spiritual vision literally cannot see error, and merely looks for Atonement. All solutions the physical eye seeks dissolve. Spiritual vision looks within and recognizes immediately that the altar has been defiled and needs to be repaired and protected. Perfectly aware of the right defense it passes over all others, looking past error to truth. Because of the strength of its vision, it brings the mind into its service. This re-establishes the power of the mind and makes it increasingly unable to tolerate delay, realizing that it only adds unnecessary pain. As a result, the mind becomes increasingly sensitive to what it would once have regarded as very minor intrusions of discomfort. 2- 3-4

==W==
===War===
Peace is impossible to those who look on war. MfTS11P4



==Y==

===Yoke===
Remember that &quot;yoke&quot; means &quot;join together,&quot; and &quot;burden&quot; means &quot;message. &quot;Let us restate &quot;My yoke is easy and my burden light&quot; in this way; &quot;Let us join together, for my message is light. &quot; 5,3,11

===You===
You have no idea of the tremendous release and deep peace that comes from meeting yourself and your brothers totally without judgment. 3,6,3

When you feel tired, it is because you have judged yourself as capable of being tired. 3,6,5</text>

Hi,

I have a knack for math too. Even though I am a writer, and have had things published, I think English has always been my weakest subject. I would like to be a creative writing teacher, but I have been looking math as a more realistic first step. I think it is very important to get some good math teachers out there. At one point I wouldn't have thought twice about becoming a math teacher because I loved math, but during high school I had a teacher who made me hate it and I am just getting over that horrible influance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Relational Schema ==

[[Image:planet-express-db.png]]

PK and FK stand for primary key and foreign key respectively.

== Exercises ==

The first several exercises build on each other and illustrate the use of subqueries.

Who receieved a 1.5kg package?

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT Client.Name
FROM Client JOIN Package   
  ON Client.AccountNumber = Package.Recipient 
WHERE Package.weight = 1.5;
--- The result is &quot;Al Gore's Head&quot;.
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

What is the total weight of all the packages that he sent?

{{ExerciseSolution|text=

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT SUM(p.weight) 
FROM Client AS c 
  JOIN Package as P 
  ON c.AccountNumber = p.Sender
WHERE c.Name = &quot;Al Gore's Head&quot;;

---  Or the entire the result from the first exercise could 
--- be embedded explicitly as a subquery, like the following,
--- which also returns the number of the packages.

SELECT SUM(p.weight), COUNT(1)
FROM Client AS c 
  JOIN Package as P 
  ON c.AccountNumber = p.Sender
WHERE c.AccountNumber = (
  SELECT Client.AccountNumber
  FROM Client JOIN Package 
    ON Client.AccountNumber = Package.Recipient 
  WHERE Package.weight = 1.5
);

--- The answer is 28.5kg in two packages.
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

Which pilots transported those packages? 

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT Employee.Name
FROM Employee
  JOIN Shipment ON Shipment.Manager = Employee.EmployeeID
  JOIN Package ON Package.Shipment = Shipment.ShipmentID
WHERE Shipment.ShipmentID IN (
  SELECT p.Shipment 
  FROM Client AS c 
    JOIN Package as P 
    ON c.AccountNumber = p.Sender
  WHERE c.AccountNumber = (
    SELECT Client.AccountNumber
    FROM Client JOIN Package 
      ON Client.AccountNumber = Package.Recipient 
    WHERE Package.weight = 1.5
  )
)
GROUP BY (Employee.Name);

-- The answer is that the two shipments were managed by Phillip J. Fry and Turanga Leela .
--
-- Without some sort of &quot;GROUP BY&quot; clause, the correct pilots are returned multiple times,
-- since the embedded JOIN over clients and packages returns one result
-- for each package, not each shipment.

&lt;/source&gt;
}}

== Table creation code ==

 CREATE TABLE Employee (
   EmployeeID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,

Please note the syntax presented here is for the SQLite system. It has been tested by the authors on &lt;code&gt;sqlite3&lt;/code&gt; specifically.

Also note that the &lt;code&gt;NOT NULL&lt;/code&gt; constraint on the primary key fields is semantically redundant, but a syntactic necessity in SQLite.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the last decade, online media has become increasingly accessible and plentiful. With free video hosting sites the potential for creating and sharing videos has become huge.

It has been suggested by a number of Trainz users that the developers incorporate a motion recorder into future versions of Trainz. This may well happen one day, but for now the alternative is external applications. 

Many users choose to use [http://www.fraps.com Fraps], a real time video capture application. Fraps is capable of more than adequate frame rates and screen resolutions for Trainz videos.

'''&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps; font-size:1.25em&quot;&gt;[[w:Phonology|Sounds]] and Writing&lt;/span&gt;'''
== '''Writing system''' ==
===Introduction===
Given that there are [[w:Natural_language#Linguistic diversity|nearly 7,000 languages]] in the world today, there are surprisingly few writing systems:
[[Image:WritingSystemsoftheWorld.png|550px|thumb|left|Writing systems of the world today. ]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
'' &lt;small&gt;* each of the writing systems in the above represent a family of writing systems (and perhaps each color is a type or a prototypical family for a type) used by one or more languages.  Each language may add or exclude characters, diacritics, prescriptive use and may change the sounds: additionally within many languages there are regional accents that change the actual sounds represented and their prescriptive use.&lt;/small&gt;''

And of those few, all of them fit into six types: The three main types, [[w:Logogram|logographic]], [[w:Syllabary|syllabic]], and [[w:Alphabet|segmental]] (e.g., an alphabet); along with the three ''in between'' types, [[w:Abugida|abugidas]], [[w:Abjad|abjads]], and [[w:Featural_alphabet|featural]].  

The difference between a syllabic and a segmental system is that the syllabic system demarks entire [[w:Syllable|syllables]]. The main thing to notice is how syllabic and segmental are so similar. They break words up into their basic constituent sounds (segmental systems are more of an abstraction of the concept). 

====Indistinctly Alphabetic and Syllabic====

[[w:Hangul|Hangul]] ([[w:Korean_language|Korean]]) uses a writing system that perhaps appears logographic, but is actually approximate to an syllabary: many [[w:Hangul_consonant_and_vowel_tables|Jamo]] (strokes) for each feature of a sound are combined into a ''syllablic'' character using a set prescription. About half of the Jamo are direct equivalents of latin alphabet letters, with the others representing [[w:Consonant|consonant sounds]], consonant sounds with [[w:Vowel|vowels]], [[w:Vowel#Monophthongs, diphthongs, triphthongs|dipthongs]], and consonant sounds with dipthongs.  The result is a system that gives all the information of an alphabet, abstracting to the level of phonetic features, but whose prescriptive use imparts further information:

{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Insert|content=
In english we write &lt;code&gt;polysyllabic&lt;/code&gt; and with this grouping of symbols we associate a definition, which must be separately commited to memory. We also associate a prescriptive remedy for pronouncing words, in this case: '''pol&amp;#8288;&lt;big style=&quot;padding-right: 0.125em&quot;&gt;•&lt;/big&gt;&amp;#8288;y&amp;#8288;&lt;big style=&quot;padding-right: 0.125em&quot;&gt;•&lt;/big&gt;&amp;#8288;syl&amp;#8288;&lt;big style=&quot;padding-right: 0.125em&quot;&gt;•&lt;/big&gt;&amp;#8288;lab&amp;#8288;&lt;big style=&quot;padding-right: 0.125em&quot;&gt;•&lt;/big&gt;&amp;#8288;ic ''' &lt;code style=&quot;font-size:1.125em&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;ˌpälisəˈlabik&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  However, since there are many irregularities, one generally cannot claim to know how to pronounce a unfamiliar word simply upon its reading: while these features are built into the grouping of Jamo in Hangul, and thus one generally can know its utterance immediately upon scanning the word.
&lt;!-- I would love to give an example but the orthography section of hangul is devilishly flawed --&gt;
}}

====Approximately Syllabic or Segmental====

Chinese is an [[w:Isolating_language|isolating]], [[w:Analytic_language|analytic language]], such that there are many effectively modifying [[w:Lexeme|lexemes]] and the [[w:Lemma_(linguistics)|lemma]] of many words are bare in sentences. For that matter, [[w:Chinese_character|Chinese]] and all other living logogramatic languages have only one syllable per character, while most modern chinese words are of course polysyllabic.

Of the segmentals, there are systems that demark only consonants because the vowel sound can be inferred or is allowed to vary.  The [[w:Latin_alphabet|Latin alphabet]] comes from an older abjad, the name for this type of system. An abugida necessarily adds the vowels.

====Model of abstraction====

=====At a glance=====

For living languages, this makes exchanging between the writing systems relatively easy, because one is always fundamentally familiar with the model of abstraction.

{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Insert|content=
'''Divide each [[w:lexeme|lexeme]]'''


&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; display: inline; position: relative; top:-0.25em; background-color: rgb(255,200,0); padding: 1.1em 0.5em; border: solid thin green; border-radius: 2em; -moz-border-radius: 2em; -webkit-border-radius: 2em&quot;&gt;''sound''
&lt;/div&gt;
'''&lt;span style=&quot;float: left; position: relative; top:0.25em; font-size:5em&quot;&gt;→&lt;/span&gt;'''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
''* where sound is either an [[w:allophone|allophone]]/[[w:phoneme|phoneme]], or a [[w:syllable|syllable]]''
}}

Despite this (which some learners might think of as a veritable ''holy grail'' of a mapping, because of the simplicity it implies), most languages only partially support this analogy.  According to the [[w:phonemic orthography|phonemic orthography]] wikipedia entry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Languages with a good grapheme-to-phoneme&lt;small&gt;[sic]&lt;/small&gt; correspondence include [[w:Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[w:Basque language|Basque]], [[w:Estonian language|Estonian]], [[w:Finnish language|Finnish]], [[w:Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], [[w:Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[w:Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[w:Mongolian language|Mongolian]] in [[w:Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]], [[w:Korean|Korean]], [[w:Romanian language|Romanian]], [[w:Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], [[w:Turkish language|Turkish]], [[w:Croatian alphabet|Croatian]], [[w:Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[w:Spanish language|Spanish]]. Most [[w:constructed language|constructed language]]s such as [[w:Esperanto|Esperanto]] and [[w:Lojban|Lojban]] have phonemic orthographies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other languages generally map one or more sounds to one or more glyphs or sequences of glyphs, and even the natural languages above usually do not ''approach'' true one-to-one correspondence, having a healthy selection of contextual differences.  What they do offer, however, is the ability to know, at a glance, what are the phonemes of the written word.

One can think of this presentational model as: Essentially correct ''(some exclusions apply)''.  Those exclusions are almost always more complex than the writing system; the [[User:Robbiemuffin/L2 Presentation Patterns/Sounds and Writing#Sounds of the language|sounds of the language]] module will delve into the exclusions.

=====The Pattern=====

We're going to present two tables for the raw data for our writing system.  One table to show the alphabet or syllabary (for large syllabaries, a selection of glyphs required for procifiency, likely on the order of 1,000) in the majescule and miniscule, and on a second table a much smaller list of the &quot;essential&quot; characters.  We will map from the essentials to the others on the basis of whatever similarity presents itself. When presenting this information, the large table is the reference, and the small table is the associative, teaching tool.

{{User:Robbiemuffin/Templates/Insert|content=
'''&lt;big&gt;the Writing System Pattern&lt;/big&gt;'''
'''Ingredients:'''

1 Complete table for reference of the actual system

1 Small list of “essential” characters

1 Map to show the essentiality of the small list and most importantly to direct the student back to the reference list

== '''Sounds of the language''' ==

Whereas Japanese may be the most complicated writing system (when taken as a whole), English itself may be the least regular in terms of mapping its sounds to its words.  Differences in dialect, differences accounted for by the huge surplus of its users as a [[w:lingua franca|lingua franca]], as well as a profound set of rules and long lists of exceptions, push English to the verge of offering no phonetic clues at all in the morphology of its written language. In some places such as [[w:Guyana|Guyana]] and [[w:Caribbean|the Caribbean]], the meter of spoken language becomes consonant-vowel dominated and loses quite a bit of stress-timing (features wholly foreign to English but in keeping with Spanish and many african cultures), and in general English adopts itself in predictable ways to it's regional, cultural context. However, English only stands out as an extreme example of these features, and generally all languages have wide variation in  [[w:pronunciation|pronunciation]] both [[w:Historical linguistics|diachronically]] and [[w:Descriptive linguistics|synchronically]] from [[w:dialect|dialect]] to dialect.

Note that exp(1/x^2) is not analytic at x=0. Anyways, more general asymptotic scales can be used with the commands of the MultiSeries package. In particular, 

 with(MultiSeries);
 series(exp(1/x^2), x);

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Author Biography''' 


Name: '''Anthony L Young (Author)
'''
Born: August 7, 1978

Birthplace: Winter Park, Florida
 
Education: Gibbs College
		Livingston, NJ 	2005
University of Phoenix 	
		Phoenix, AZ

Past Work: First book written and published through PublishAmerica.com. “The Kingdom of Eternity: The Awakening” was his first novel
Second Project: &quot;The Angel’s Gospel&quot; available through LuLu Publishing

Anthony Young grew up with his sister in his birthplace of Florida until the age of 10 years old with his aunt and her children. When he was 10 he and his sister were sent to live with another aunt in South Carolina to his dismay and after years of feeling isolated from everyone his mother passed away from a life long struggle with drug dependency and he grew up instantly! He lost all hope of ever regaining the missing piece to himself through her and had tough times dealing with life in general. After barely finishing high school after a very tumultuous and bad living situation he left that home to be on his own knowing he had no place to call home and no security. Anthony Young had no one to rely on and had to live without any support from that family and was told that growing up by them all the while. Through God’s help and a willingness to be successful Anthony went on to graduate from college with honors while writing his first book and years after he finished his second book and is continuing to write more. Anthony Young is the author of “The Kingdom of Eternity” and “The Angel’s Gospel” and accredits his ability to overcome to his past through faith in his purpose on earth and God alone.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Mediterranian Sea 16.61811E 38.99124N.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Satellite image of the Mediterranean]]

The written word has changed and shaped the history of the Ancient Mediterranean as history has changed and shaped it. Language first began in distant human evolution. The first words to be written down were simple, arising from cave art. These pictures became more advanced and capable of conveying more complex meanings. With trade and conquest, these alphabets spread and merged to form the recognisable systems of the ancient Mediterranean. Originally, they were used predominantly for recording commerce and deals that would otherwise risk being forgotten or manipulated. As empires grew larger and communication more difficult, writing was used to convey messages to large numbers of people or to give information to a distant party. Gradually, writing became more than just communication, but an art form, as literature developed. Writing has been a major influential force from the live of the common man to the success of empires.

===Spoken Language===

It is impossible to know when and where spoken language began, not least because of ambiguity as to what defines it. Speculation about the larynx and the tongue shape give some indication of which of our ancestors may have been able to produce the range of sounds necessary for speech. A tentative estimate places the advent of spoken language with the Neanderthal at around 300 000BC. This advanced ability to communicate would have greatly improved the structure and tasks of primitive society. 

===Writing===

The first known pictures were discovered in caves at Lascaux from c. 14 000BC. These were probably the ancient scribbles of a culture seeking to express what they saw in a way clearer and more lasting than spoken words. Tablets from Mesopotamia in the 4th millennium BC engraved with images of livestock are thought to have been used as records of trade promises and deals. It is thought that writing grew from pictures, which became simplified and stylistic cuneiform with time and use. The letter A was originally symbolic of an ox or aleph in Phoenician. It was the first letter of the alphabet because to the ancients the ox symbolised strength and energy. Thus the symbol came to represent these abstract ideas as well as a physical animal. Originally, the letter was a picture of a whole ox but through metonymy it came to be represented by only the head of an ox. This simplified into the Greek Alpha and the Latin A. This process of picture, symbol, letter formed all of the Greek and Latin alphabets.

A major step from these pictographs was the Egyptian initiative to make them represent sounds, often in the form of syllables, rather than ideas. This developed from acrophony: symbols for ideas or objects coming to represent the initial sound of that word. This change eliminated much of the ambiguity of symbols and gave writing the full complexity of speech. In the Cratylus, Plato speaks about writing as a form of imitation, as a representation of the spoken alphabet rather than visual elements. The first alphabetical scripts were developed from hieroglyphs in Egypt and Cuneiform in Uruk. From these systems, close to all of the modern alphabets evolved.

[[Image:Behistun detail.jpg|thumb|right|the distinctive &quot;wedge letters of cuneiform]]

The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote in the 5th century BC that the Greek alphabet arrived with the Phoenician settlement in BC. Plato traced the Phoenician letters back to the Egyptians, who legend states received it as a divine gift. Plato discusses the origins and development in his works Cratylus and Phaedrus. The changes in the shapes of the letters came from a variety of sources. One that can clearly be seen is the medium available. Cuneiform was mainly written with reed styli on clay tablets, and by necessity are made of wedge-shaped indents (cuneiform literally means “wedge letters”). Roman stone inscriptions used straight lines as well resulting in the blocky capitals that we use today. Another influence was ease of use. With time and employment, the letters became more stylised and removed from their original pictures and symbols. With trade and conquest, different writing systems were united and separated, merging two old alphabets into one, or changing with time isolated from a parent system. This can be seen in the unification of Greek and Etruscan to produce the Latin alphabet. Thus sprung the different alphabets of the Ancient Mediterranean as varied as spoken language.

===In Society===

Writing has served many different cultural functions. It is thought to have sprung from mundane necessities such as commerce and debt but when its power was realised, it quickly became the duty of scribes and those who had the time and wealth to afford education. In such cultures as ancient Rome, It became a social divider; those who could read could get a job high paying enough to afford to teach their children to read. Literacy was widespread in free males in 5th century Athens. In some cultures, such as Egypt, writing took on a mystical role, perhaps due to its perceived divine origins. Herodotus coined the term “hieroglyphs” from “hieros” meaning sacred.  The Greek word for alphabet, stoicheia, also means “elements” and as such, the letters were considered the building blocks of the cosmic order. It also became a symbol of cultural unity; the entire area of what we now call “Ancient Greece” was a collection of separate city states united only by language. 

As medium became more available and education more widespread, writing became a successful way of communication across long distances of space and time. In the Near East, writing came to be used for public monuments, declarations of military success, and legal codes. In Greece and Rome (famously Pompeii) many instances of graffiti have been found advertising services, declaring love, and even complaining about noise levels in the area. Writing also became vital for running a military campaign so that generals could report to each other about their location, resources, and plans. Letters from all over the Roman Empire detail both political and personal matters. This use of language as long-distance communication enabled great conquests and widespread control in the Ancient Mediterranean.

Another great development in the place of writing in society was its use in literature, an art form rather than a purely practical method. It is hard to define where exactly the difference lies in matters such as Biblical texts and Homer’s epics, which are both religious and historical accounts as well as literary stories. One important aspect of literature is poetry. The Epic of Gilgamesh is an epic poem recorded in the 7th century BC in Babylonia about a hero-king who is thought to have lived in the 3rd millennium. More recent and famous are the works of Homer, the Odyssey and the Iliad. The ancient writers of Greece and Rome studied arts of rhythm, metre, and language techniques in great depth and covered topics of love, religion, and mythology among others. The literature of the ancient world served in education, entertainment, and determining social class.
 
The written word was shaped by the people of the ancient Mediterranean and in return has shaped their world. From its origins in pictures to the Golden ages of classical literature, it has been a part of daily life and decisive politics. Its development and influences can be traced throughout the Mediterranean.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:BD Hunefer.jpg|right|thumb|400px|a scene from the Book of the Dead: the weighing of the heart]]

Writing was important to Egyptian society not only as a means of recording facts and debts but by the Ramesside period, also as a means of cultural expression and identity. 

Because of the dry climate, much of their literature has come down to us on papyrus manuscripts accidentally dried in the desert sand. Fragments have also survived on ostraca. Ceramic ware was very common In the ancient world, more so than paper. When composing a text before transferring it to a final medium, scribes often scratched the words onto fragments of broken pottery, known as sherds or ostraca. In other cases, literature has been deliberately preserved carved into temples, monuments and most famously, tomb walls. 

===Genres===

Literature had initially sprung from religious beliefs but by the nineteenth dynasty involved many different styles including instructions, love poetry, and narrative. Mortuary writing was one of the first genres of Egyptian writing, first appearing as basic accounts and then growing into tomb autobiography. One of the most famous examples of this is The Book of the Dead, in Egyptian the Coming forth by Day. This is a collection of hymns, spells, and advice to help the deceased in the afterlife. It was most often written on a papyrus scroll and richly illustrated. A person would prepare for their death by paying a large sum for the creation of a copy by specialist scribes, sometimes costing as much as half a year’s wage. From it, historians have a very detailed picture of Egyptian religious beliefs and afterlife. Unlike most modern religious texts it was not considered to be divine inspiration and therefore unchangeable but evolved slowly from pyramid texts and coffin texts. 

Sebayt was another genre at the time. It is often translated as Instructions or Teachings and they contain ethical rules and ways of living. Many are addressed to a specific person such as from a father to a son, but these were not necessarily created by the attributed authorIt is comparable to other sophist literature such as Proverbs in the bible. Many of the sebayt papyri that survive are copies of older works, dating back to the Middle kingdom but it is impossible to tell when they were first composed as it is thought that they were falsely attributed to earlier times to give them greater authority. From them, it is possible to gain an understanding of the structure of Egyptian society and the ethical and philosophical ideas of the time. 

Love poetry from nineteenth and twentieth dynasty Egypt has survived on 3 papyri, a vase, and about 20 ostraca. It was lyrical in form, similar to hymns such as those in the book of the dead, but without rhyme like modern poetry. Like much ancient poetry it would probably have been set to music. By this time it had developed a sophisticated structure, sometimes narrative in nature. The poems were often from a first person perspective as this one is and the lovers addressed each other as brother and sister. This is a curious example of how important family was to the Egyptians. It was also common to use symbolism form the natural world which sustained their way of life through agriculture: for example, The Nile, crops, animals and plants.

===Tales=== 

The Tale of Two Brothers was a narrative myth detailing how Bata and Anpu, two brothers, fight and reconcile over love and how eventually Bata becomes Pharaoh. It survived on the nineteenth dynasty papyrus D’Orbiney by the scribe Ennana, which had belonged to Seti II. It reveals much about the everyday role of the family and the structure of the household in Egyptian Culture as well as Pharaoh succession. There is speculation that it may have been a political satire based on Seti and his brother but too little of the events at the time are known to reach any definitive conclusion. The names Bata and Anpu are from Local Gods in upper Egypt which suggest that it was more based in mythology than politics. 

The story of Horus and Seth, like the Tale of Two brothers, is a myth in the form of a story. Horus is the nephew of Seth and tries to reclaim his father’s right to the throne of Egypt after Seth murdered him. This form of narrative religion with the gods’ interaction mirroring humans is comparable to the Greek myths. Many aspects of the story influenced Egyptian religion, such as the Eye of Horus, which was supposed to have been lost and regained by Horus in a struggle with Seth. It also demonstrates the ideals that Egyptian society was based on. Seth was the God of chaos and disorder and was opposed to the pharaoh when it came to ruling over Egypt but was often invoked when embarking on a war. 

We can gather that literature from the nineteenth and twentieth dynasties was varied and skillfully written, playing many important roles in their culture. It was a way of recording religious matters, teaching ethical living and even includes more everyday issues such as love. Unfortunately however, there is little doubt that much of it has been lost through the ages.

== '''About Me''' ==
'''
Hello, Wiki world. My name is Aubrey Bibbs. I was born and raised in Virginia (Tidewater Region). I am an active duty marine currently enrolled at Old Dominion University (Norfolk, Virginia) on an enlisted to officer program, Marine Enlisted Commissioning Education Program (MECEP). I am currently in my senior year in pursuit of a bachelors degree in applied mathematics with a minor in education. My intentions are to teach high school math upon retirement from the Marine Corps. I enjoy spending my free time with family and friends. Some of my many hobbies include: any and all things related to the hip hop culture, reading, watching movies (all genres except cheesy love stories/chick flicks), playing sports, watching sports, reading, writing and making music.

Pictured above: Crystal (my lovely wife of 7 years) and I, followed by our three sons, Omari, Tahir and Naeem.
'''

== '''Teaching Philosophy''' ==
'''
My primary goal as a professional educator would be to provide fair and equal treatment to each student through the practice of equal opportunity regardless of race, ethnicity, age, sex or religious conviction. Additionally, I intend to create a safe and comfortable learning environment that fits the approval of all parties directly and indirectly associated with the academic process and overall welfare of the class as a whole and of each individual student. I also intend to be fair and flexible to the needs of the class as a whole and to the needs of each student as it pertains to his or her unique personality, learning needs and learning ability.

There is a list of several other goals I intend to strive for as a professional educator. That list of goals is as follows:

1. To promote good order and discipline and address discipline issues in a timely manner using tact, fairness and appropriate disciplinary action.

2. To establish a mutual respect between student and teacher.

3. To teach in a flexible nature, remaining open to reasonable suggestion from the student.

4. To provide a constructive yet enthusiastic learning environment that promotes the individual student to participate in class activities.

5. To ensure each student has a clear understanding of the curriculum through the use of a syllabus aided by daily communication at the opening and closing minutes of each class session.

6. To cover the curriculum in a timely and effective manner, providing sufficient in class lecture, in class assignments (group and individual) and homework.

7. To create an external resource by designating a block of time outside of the regular class schedule to help students in need of additional guidance as it pertains to the course material.

8. To lead by example by maintaining a high level of professionalism and dedication toward student interest.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">(Each caste is split into &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;minus&quot; members.)

===Alphas and Betas===
Alphas and Betas are at the top of the caste system, and perform the more intellectual jobs. Unlike the lower castes, Alphas and Betas are not clones, allowing for more individual personalities. Alphas wear gray, and Betas wear mulberry. Examples of Alphas include Thomas, Henry Foster, Mustapha Mond, Bernard Marx, Benito Hoover, and Helmholtz Watson. Some Betas included Lenina Crowne, Fanny Crowne, and Linda.

===Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons===
The lower three castes do more menial and standardized work.  As a result, they are usually clones.  When being decanted, processes such as oxygen deprivation are used. Gammas wear green, Deltas wear khakis, and Epsilons wear black.  Gammas, Deltas, and Episilons are conditioned to serve the higher ranking castes (Alpha and Beta).  In Chapter 5, it states that &quot;Everyone works for every one else.  We can't do this without any one. Even Epsilons are useful.  We couldn't do without Epsilons. Every one works for every one else.  We can't do this with any one...&quot;

===Henry Ford===
Henry Ford is best known for his use of the assembly line to mass-produce automobiles. The first of these vehicles was the Model T Ford. Instead of stating years in terms of AD, the World State uses the term &quot;After Ford&quot; (AF). Instead of crosses, the symbol of belief is a capital T.

===Sigmund Freud===
The term &quot;Freud&quot; is sometimes used by characters in the book instead of &quot;Ford&quot;. Sigmund Freud is known for his popularization of the idea of sex being connected to mental well-being.

===William Shakespeare===
Brave New World contains a number of quotes from Shakespeare's plays. In fact, the title comes from Act V, Scene I of ''The Tempest'':
:&quot;O god
:How many goodly creatures are there here!
:How beauteous mankind is!
:O brave new world
:That hath such people in't!&quot;
John &quot;the Savage&quot; often makes references to Shakespeare's works.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I edited the second paragraph of &quot;The Rat Race&quot; according to what I assumed was what the author meant. Most, if not all, of my changes were in punctuation. The last sentence of that paragraph still needs help. I cannot make heads or tails of it. I'm curious how it contributes to the book as a whole, but I'm trusting that the original author knew what they were doing. I hope my edits helped.

This is one of the worst written pages in this book.  It's negative, disconcerting, bitter, and doesn't have anything to do with learning about game development.

Since I wrote it in &lt;s&gt;30m or so&lt;/s&gt; 8m (I've checked), I agree that it was a bit raw, you are free to improve upon it. In it I tried to transmit the idea that games (at least good games), need a special kind of person and require a specif understanding that it will not be a easy task, the outcome will require a specific and hard to reach equilibrium of a multitude of expectations and know how ( even about marketing or business processes). Games are not a simple task. I've done some more changes taking your comments into consideration...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:46, 4 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''About Me'''

Hi, I'm Bryceleigh.  I recently graduated from James Madison University with a B.S. in Media Arts and Design and a minor in communication studies.  My focus at JMU was Corporate Communications, which is basically advertising, PR, and managing the communications department in businesses and corporations.  During my junior year I decided that working in an office all day wasn't something that really appealed to me and since I have a passion for working and teaching children, I decided that I wanted to go back to school to be an elementary school teacher. So, now that I've graduated, I'm enrolled at Old Dominion to get my masters in elementary education for grades PreK through 6th.  This summer I am taking 4 pre-requisite classes that I have to complete before I start the graduate classes in the fall.

During my college career, I did an internship with Beach Events, which is an event planning company that plans the events for the City of Virginia Beach.  I learned a lot about event planning and advertising through that experience.  I did not work while I was taking classes but each summer I work for a promotions company which promotes brands such as Planters Peanuts, Crystal Light, Gillette, and other companies during events like the Boardwalk Art Show throughout the summer in Norfolk and Virginia Beach.  I have really enjoyed working for the promotions company because it allows me to work with variety of different people and it's really entertaining.

I was born in Virginia Beach and I have lived in the area for my entire life except for the 4 years that I was away at JMU.  I love Virginia Beach and I really can't see myself living anywhere else. I really enjoy playing tennis.  I played throughout high school year-round and really developed a passion for the sport.  I also like to hang out with my boyfriend (who I've been dating for 3 years :)) and my close friends that I've had since elementary school.  I really miss my best friends from college though, and plan on visiting them a lot throughout the summer.  Finally, I love going to the beach and shopping...both are a good stress relief for me!

'''My Teaching Philosophy'''

As a teacher, I think the most important thing is for you to be passionate about your job and the subject or grade level that you are teaching and to convey and instill that same kind of passion in your students.  It is important to make sure that all of your students succeed in your classroom by devoting your time and effort to make sure that your students understand the material you are teaching and that they know exactly what is expected of them in the classroom.  A teacher should always have a positive attitude in the classroom and create a positive classroom environment that inspires meaningful learning.  Along with these basic beliefs, I devised 7 objectives  that I want to strive to meet when I become a teacher, and even though I created these objectives for another class several months ago, I think that they provide a detailed explanation of my educational philosophy.  

–The first objective is to create learning experiences that will ensure that the central concepts of the subject matter are meaningful for my students and will support and further their intellectual, social, and personal developmental needs.   The rationale for this objective is that learning needs to be real and meaningful each day for young children because the educational foundations they receive in elementary school will be essential in order for them to be successful in higher learning environments.  It is important to make sure that the children are directly involved in the lesson and thoroughly understand the subject matter each day.  Making sure that the students are active participants in the classroom will help them to better understand and comprehend the material, aid in the development of their role as a student in the classroom, and will also promote self-confidence. Finally, encouraging students to participate will make them more interested in the lesson and feel a more personal connection to the subject. 

–The second objective is to create instructional and learning opportunities that adapt to learners from different cultural backgrounds and also those learners with exceptionalities.  The rationale for this objective is that students' past experiences and heredity allow them to create their own thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes of themselves and the world and therefore, they come to school with different perspectives and views of the learning environment.  Because of this, each student may learn different things in different ways.  It is important as a teacher to understand how each student learns and to meet all of their needs during each classroom session. 

–The third objective is to use a variety of instructional and learning strategies that will ensure that I am reaching all students on their learning level as well as encouraging the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, and performance skills. Each day, teachers must plan their lessons according to the different types of learners in their classroom to ensure that they are reaching all children on their own individual levels.  The subject being taught should be executed in a way that reaches all different kinds of learners.  Along with differentiated instruction, teachers must teach for mastery, because by doing this students will know what you want them to learn and accomplish, and they will be thoroughly involved in the learning process. 

–The fourth objective is to create a learning environment that promotes positive social and/or group interaction, active engagement in learning, and self-motivation.  To be an effective teacher, I must give my students a reason to do assignments, and group work is one of the most effective ways for students to learn because they are surrounded by people to support and educate them.  Group work essentially teaches students important life lessons such as responsibility and accountability because they are helping one another to learn the concepts. 

-The fifth objective is to plan and manage instruction based on student's current knowledge of the subject matter and curriculum goals. Research suggests that new learning is shaped by the learner's prior knowledge.  Learning is closely related to particular situations and students will understand and use the information in a meaningful way if the lessons are in some way connected to their previous knowledge or experiences. 

-The sixth objective is to create a positive and warm classroom environment where students feel welcome and that they are an essential part of the learning community. By creating a warm and inviting classroom environment, students will be able to thrive and feel like they can take risks without being scared.  Also, if the classroom provides a stress-free and encouraging environment for the students, they will be able to concentrate, be active participants in the lesson, and learning will increase. 

-Finally, the seventh of objective is to utilize new technology in the classroom so that learning and development can be facilitated in different ways.  Because our world is enabled by information technology, it is important to make sure that students understand how to use different technologies to get important information that is essential to learning and the learning environment.  Also, students must be taught computer skills in order to connect globally and to learn about other culture around the world.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''ABOUT ME ;-)'''

I am a 26 year old currently living in Norfolk, Virginia. I have a B.S. degree in nutrition from Virginia Tech. After working as a dietitian for 4 years, I decided that what I really want to do is teach. I am currently getting my master's degree in physical education from ODU. I love to exercise and think it is very important for children to learn at a young age the importance of regular physical activity. Physical education is just as important as other core subjects like math and science. The childhood obesity rate is continually growing in our country. The way to change this is to teach children that exercise is great for your body, and it can be FUN! 


'''My Teaching Philosophy'''

I hope to promote lifelong fitness by teaching students to love physical activity as much as I do. I think it is important to have at least 75% of a physical education class moving at all times in order for it to be affective. Also, if the students are constantly busy then they will not have time to &quot;act up&quot; as much. My teaching strategy in order to achieve constant movement will be to divide the class up into smaller groups and have each group doing a different activity. After 5-10 minutes at one activity, the groups will rotate to a different activity. The students will continue rotating until everyone has completed every activity. I also have several quick games that can be played to take up 2-3 minutes if needed. Students will never be standing around waiting in my class. Students will not have to be athletes in my class in order to pass. I hope to have a large variety of activities that will appeal to everyone. I hope to have some students begin the year hating gym/sports and end the year realizing that they do enjoy at least one sport or activity. I plan on working closely with classroom teachers as well. I want to try and encorporate as many core subjects (math, readiing, science) into my activities as possible. An example of this would be getting a copy of the week's spelling words and having the students play basketball games using these words. I also hope to use a lot of technology in my class, but I think this depends on the school where I work and the budget. If possible, I would like to use an ipod in order to have music in the background while the students are moving. Also, pedometers and exercise equipment (treadmills) would be great to have. Finally, XBOX has a game called &quot;Dance, Dance Revolution&quot; and the Wii has many games that would be new and exciting ways to get the students moving. All of the great teachers that I have had in the past have clearly loved children and have been sincerely passionate about what they teach. This is the kind of teacher that I hope to be one day.</text>

== '''About Me''' ==

Hi there!

My name is Elizabeth, but most people call me Betsy.  I am just beginning Education courses at ODU for the [http://education.odu.edu/eci/elementary/pk6lisc.shtml/ PreK-6 licensure only program.]  I completed my undergraduate degree at the [http://www.colorado.edu/ University of Colorado at Boulder.]  I also have a master's degree in Psychology from [http://sci.odu.edu/psychology/ ODU]. I enjoy spending my spare time outside hiking in FLSP, relaxing at the beach, fishing and crabbing with my family, and working in my garden.  I am married to a wonderful Navy man, and lucky for us, I LOVE to travel.  The photo below is from our latest trip.

== '''Teaching Philosophy''' ==

Having never written a teaching philosophy, or a teaching statement before, I would like to start with a general description of what I believe a teaching philosophy is:  


To me, a teaching philosophy is a set of individual goals and objectives for the dissemination of knowledge.  Furthermore, the philosophy includes a teacher’s specific guidelines and standards for achievement of the stated educational goals and objectives.'' 


Currently I do not have a specific or thorough set of my goals and objectives, or a description of the guidelines and standards that I will use to implement my teaching philosophy.  However, based upon my limited previous instructional experiences, the paragraphs that follow include the initial elements of the teaching philosophy I hope to develop further. 


My philosophy of teaching involves many components, that when combined, will hopefully enhance the educational experience of students through continuous learning on my behalf.  I firmly believe that for students to acquire developmentally appropriate knowledge and meet educationally accepted standards, the learning process must be reciprocal.  Thus, as the teacher, I aspire to enhance the educational experience of my students by ensuring that my individual learning process never stops.  By dedicating myself to the process of learning as both a teacher and a student, I will continually refine, improve, and expand my knowledge base.  With a strong commitment to flexibility and keeping an “open-mind”, I aim to constantly improve my instructional methodologies by incorporating new and fresh ideas that will allow my students to successfully achieve, and exceed, their educational standards and goals.'' 


In addition to implementing reciprocal learning, I also aim to create a classroom environment that fosters and develops tolerance and acceptance of differences.  Thus, part of my teaching philosophy concerns creating an atmosphere in which students are encouraged to explore individual and cultural differences.  It is my view that one of the most successful methods for learning involves understanding knowledge from a multi-faceted perspective.  The personal and experiential differences of students and teachers will be recognized, acknowledged, and incorporated into the learning process to ensure a wide spectrum of background knowledge and application.  


To reinforce multi-faceted educational learning, my instructional strategies will rely on several methods.  Thus, lecture-based instruction will be balanced with group work.  Individual learning and achievement will be emphasized in topic areas where personal growth and development mark mastery of concepts (e.g., reading and writing acquisition).  Additionally, I aim to vary my methods for instruction.  For example, I recently became aware of a “newer” form of instruction titled “Power Teaching”.  The methods involved in implementing Power Teaching are not suitable for every classroom or individual.  However, there are specific elements of the method that can be applied in diverse settings, for different ages, or for various topics in classroom education.


At the heart of my teaching philosophy is a desire to ensure successful transfer of knowledge and learning strategies from the teacher to the student.  Differentiated forms of technology, communication, and instruction will be used to accomplish this goal.  In addition, assessment of students’ educational background, current status, and future progress will comply with all state and federal regulations for standardized assessment.  And finally, to encourage student mastery of the educational knowledge and learning strategies acquired in the classroom, I will include an open, warm, and frequent teacher-parent relationship.


In conclusion, it is my view that a teacher’s highest level of achievement can only be attained by ensuring that all students are given the necessary opportunities to reach their educational goals.</text>

Black does what White has not, by controlling the center. This may be used in an attempt to close in the freed White rook rather than an attempt to prevent its development outright.

White continues to push the rook pawn, in order to create space for the rook. Black should respond with [[/2...Bd7/]] to prevent 3. Ra4.

Black has moved the bishop in order to prevent 3. Ra4; however, 3. Ra3 is now playable. Other options include d4, Nc3, Nf3, and b4.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Shape file viewers are applications used to open and view meshes created in 3D modelling software such as GMAX, 3DS Max or Blender. In Trainz, the shape file will be in Auran's Jet file format—either &lt;code&gt;.im&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.pm&lt;/code&gt;. 

== Trainz Object Explorer ==

'''Trainz Object Explorer (TOE)''' is a stand-alone utility for viewing &lt;code&gt;.im&lt;/code&gt; files exported from 3D modelling software. It was created by Adam Wojcieszyk and is still considered a work in progress, although an update has not been available since 2003 and it has been reported to have compatibility issues with recent developments.

Integrating TOE into the content creation workflow allows the content creator to save time when it is necessary to view 3D models as they would appear in Trainz. As a content creator, you may need to see how your model appears in Trainz several times an hour. In Windows, TOE can be set as the default program for opening &lt;code&gt;.im&lt;/code&gt; files with. The program is also useful due to the lack of renderer in the Trainz Asset Creation Studio. 

Trainz Object Explorer is available for free download on [http://trainz.luvr.net/projects-view.php?pid=476&amp;tab=f the Trainz Luvr website here.]

== FileViewer ==

'''FileViewer''' can open both &lt;code&gt;.im&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.pm&lt;/code&gt; files (among others). The screen-capture function can automatically create a 240x180 pixel image called &lt;code&gt;$screenshot$.bmp&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$screenshot$.tga&lt;/code&gt; and places it in the same folder as the active mesh file. These features make it very useful to associate FileViewer with TrainzObjectz (simply open TrainzObjectz, click the Menu button, choose Program Locations, Trainz Object Explorer and browse to &lt;code&gt;FileViewer314.2.exe&lt;/code&gt;). Trainz &lt;code&gt;.im&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.pm&lt;/code&gt; files cannot be exported from the FileViewer application.

For more information and downloads go to: [http://users.bigpond.net.au/Creator3D/ FileViewer by Steven Katic].
FileViewer is also available for download at [http://www.gaurc.us/index_files/software.htm The Great American Underground Railway Company website.]

2. e4 is erroneous move, as it allows [[/2...dxe4/]] with advantage for Black. White is not lost, but must play for a quick win rather than a long battle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About Me==
Hi! My name is Connie and since you are looking at my user page you are probably at a similar point in your life where you have decided that a career in teaching might be for you. Unlike one of my best friends from childhood, I did not know at the tender age of eight that I wanted to be a teacher. I have come to this conclusion over many years and several walks off the beaten path. After following several &quot;rabbit trails&quot; in my life (some I would call God's divine appointments/perfect timing; others just plain human ignorance &amp; dumb choices, on my part), I have concluded that teaching is where I am meant to be professionally. 
 
I was born in North Carolina, raised in TN, and after telling a friend &quot;The man God has for me MUST be in another state because he's sure not in Tennessee!&quot; married a man, with two children, from Virginia who (for the time being at least) refuses to live anywhere else. So here I am! I've loved kids (most) all my life and LOVE to see light bulbs come on for them when they learn new things. That's SOOO exciting for me, especially the younger ones. I love horseback riding, reading, &amp; (most) furry animals. I also like to travel and can see myself teaching overseas some day (maybe on a short term mission trip). 

I was raised Southern Baptist, but saved by the grace of God. &lt;Please don't take this opportunity to edit my user page because you don't agree with anything I have said thus far. If you don't believe in God, that is your choice, but this is MY user page &amp; it's all about ME!!!&gt; Gee! As a wife &amp; (step)mother of two I don't get to say &quot;It's all about ME&quot; very often. That felt GOOD!!!

I would like to say that you will find my user page neat and exciting (with lots of cool pictures &amp; quotes), but I'm also a realist with two jobs, two kids, a wonderful husband, one ''very'' energetic dachshund and more household responsibilities than I sometimes want to manage while taking graduate courses for a Master's in Education. So! Chances are, words will be about all you get (unless of course our prof. &quot;requires&quot; pictures in here &amp; then by golly I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN!). Even as I'm creating this page, my son (8) runs into the house with sister (11), a neighbor's kid, and a caterpillar on a leaf asking for a container to keep it in so he can watch it grow into a butterfly. What a ''perfect'' reminder of what learning is really all about... to see the transformation of an unsuspecting caterpillar (child) into a beautiful butterfly (an informed adult who is not afraid to fly out of their comfort zones because of the foundations laid by those before them). This leads into my thoughts on education. [[Image:Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg|right|thumb|200px|]]


==My Philosophy of Education==
My philosophy of education is that each child deserves our five senses to the fullest   
(not listed in order of importance): 
&lt;li&gt;First, to '''hear'''. I want to hear each child (not as the annoying student who refuses to be quiet in class, but as the child who has a reason/unmet need to be heard at a deeper than surface level). 
&lt;li&gt;Two, to '''touch'''. I want to touch the very heart and soul of each child who enters my classroom in such a positive and supportive way that he/she will have fond memories of me when they are forty. 
&lt;li&gt;Three, to '''see'''. I want each of my students to see me as one who does not act one way ''in'' the classroom and another ''outside'' the classroom. I want them to see me as a ''genuine'' person of good character, someone they would like to model their life after.
&lt;li&gt;Four, to '''smell''' (and ''no'', we're not talking about body odor here). I want students who have come from my class to be able to see situations in their life as through a microscope of understanding and wisdom that I helped to impart in them. Much like picking up a flower and being able to smell the very essence of who and what it is, I would like to somehow impart a decerning nature into my students to be able to smell a &quot;rosey&quot; situation from a &quot;pile of poo&quot; situation (''before'' stepping into it!). 
&lt;li&gt;Five, to '''taste'''. I want my students to get a positive and rewarding taste of what having knowledge can bring to them. I want them to see my desire for them to want something good for their lives and to reach for it themselves.&lt;div&gt;                                                                

Now some of you reading this have probably already formed the opinion that I am living in a fantasy world, so to those of you critics I would say...I know how badly I ''want'' for each of my students to experience my five senses through education, but I also know that if I reach ''just one'' of them in this way then I will have achieved much.

Being a realist, I know there will be &quot;problem&quot; students and those who will test the farthest limits of my patience. I also know that God has uniquely designed each and every one of them and they are all deserving of a chance (whether that be one chance or twenty-one chances). I realize that I am only one person and can only do so much with my limited abilities. In other words, I know I can't change the world, but my own life experiences have taught me that I can at least make a difference (even if only for one).

==My Plan==
I picture my future classroom to be open. Open to diversity. Open to various learning styles and abilities. Open to different languages (and the barriers they may initially present). Open to a variety of personalities.

I plan to assess my students' personal interests starting the first day of class to give me a better understanding of each child. Academic testing would be performed using state standards and practices. 

I plan to have more group oriented lessons than lecture-style because I believe students learn well from their peers.

I plan to collaborate with other teachers as much as possible to glean from others' experiences in reaching a variety of students.

I plan to have as much communication with parents as possible because, as the teacher, I am only a small part of the greater whole when it comes to the many adults that will have an area of influence in a child's life.

I plan to use positive reinforcement (Check out the book &quot;1-2-3 Magic for Teachers') and will try to be as consistent as possible because all children need stability and consistency in their life, especially if/when they do not get it at home.

Technology will be a '''huge''' part of my instruction plans, with the use of Smartboards, digital cameras, etc. I would like to offer at least two computers in the classroom for student use of programs I have approved (i.e. Typing Tutors for early learners, Oregon Trail for critical thinking practice, limited access to the internet for subject content help, and/or topic research, etc.) 

Technology should not be seen as a hinderance, but as a stepping stone to further one's knowlege. Teachers who are not as proficient with technology should take whatever steps necessary to improve in that area, in order to stay one step ahead of their students. Unfortunately, the amount of technology used in the classroom will be based on the financial ability of the school where I will be employed, as many Christian schools do not have the funding available for much of the newer technology in the public classroom setting.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Italian Offensives==

===Egypt===

Italy felt that the best time to attack in Africa was when the British were busy with the Battle of Britain. Mussolini ordered Marshal Rodolfo Graziani, to launch an attack into Egypt immediately. 

On September 13, a large element of Graziani's Italian Tenth Army crossed the border between Libya and Egypt, and advanced into Egypt as far as Sidi Barrani. Sidi Barrani was about 100 kilometers(60 Miles) inside Egypt from the Libyan border. The Italians then stopped and began to entrench themselves in a series of fortified camps.

At this time, Britain had only 30,000 troops available to defend Egypt against 250,000 Italian troops. However, the Italians were not concentrated in one place. They were spread out from the Tunisian border in western Libya, to Sidi Barrani in Egypt. 

On December 8, 1940 the British Operation Compass began. General Richard O'Connor pressed the attack forward and succeeded in reaching El Agheila (an advance of 500 miles) and capturing tens of thousands of enemies. The Allies nearly destroyed the Italian army in North Africa, and seemed on the point of sweeping the Italians out of Libya. The Italian managed to halt the British advance in February of 1941. German General Erwin Rommel now became the Axis commander in North Africa, however the bulk of his forces consisted of Italian troops.

===East Africa===
As in Egypt, the Italian forces with ~70,000 Italian soldiers and ~180,000 native troops outnumbered their British opponents. But Italian East Africa was isolated and far away from the Italian mainland. The Italian forces in East Africa were thus cut off from re-supply. This severely limited the operations that they could seriously undertake.

The initial Italian attacks in East Africa took two different directions, one into the Sudan and the other into Kenya. The Italian forces advanced into the two countries, but not very far. Most units only advanced a few miles, occupying the border posts. 

In August 1940, the Italians advanced into British Somaliland. On August 14, the Italians began to encircle the British defenders from their eastern positions, and the defenders' situation started to look critical.

After three days of battle, early on August 15, Godwin-Austen (fearing encirclement) concluded that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile. He contacted the British Middle East Command headquarters in Cairo, Egypt and requested and received permission to withdraw his forces from British Somaliland. By August 17, the entire colony had fallen into Italian hands.

==British Advances==

===East Africa===
After the fall of British Somaliland, General Archibald Wavell's plan for the counter-offensive by British and Commonwealth forces included a &quot;northern front&quot; led by Lieutenant-General William Platt and a &quot;southern front&quot; led by Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham. A third front would be created by the forces which would re-take British Somaliland by sea.

In January 1941, British forces launched a counter offensive. From Sudan in the north, Platt advanced into Eritrea on 19 January. Battling through mountainous territory, his forces reached the heavily garrisoned town of Agordat, 160km (100 miles) from their start. On 28 January it fell after two days of bloody fighting.

Platt now made for the town of Keren, 80km (50 miles) away and the gateway to Eritrea's central plateau. The route lay through the Dongolaas Gorge, a wild, craggy area where progress was only possible after enemy forces were dislodged from the commanding heights. RAF units based inside Eritrea provided air support. Platt's forces fought to the coast at Massawa, 160km (100 miles) away, and took it on 8 April. Within the next few days, Eritres had been occupied.

At the same time, Italian East Africa was also attacked from the south. In Kenya, Cunningham assembled a force of three divisions, one South African and two composed of Nigerian and Ghanaian troops under British officers.

On 10 February, Cunningham led part of his force east from Kenya into Italian Somaliland, while the remainder marched north into Abyssinia. The Italian Somali capital of Mogadishu fell on 26 February and by 5 March the Italians were routed. The town of Jijiga in north eastern Abyssinia, 1,600km (1,000 miles) from Cunningham's Kenyan starting point, fell on 20 March. On 6 April Cunningham's reunited forces entered the Abyssinian capital Addis Ababa. The Duke of Aosta surrendered on 16 May, but some isolated Italian forces fought on until 27 November.

Emperor Haile Selassie, along with British troops , crossed the border from Sudan on 20 January and made for Addis Ababa, harassing the Italians and enlisting support from local rebel groups. Their advance was outstripped by Cunningham's, however: Wingate and the Emperor first entered Addis Ababa in a victory march on 5 May, about a month after Cunningham. After the fall of Addis Abba the British mopped up the remaining Italian resistance in the area. Although organized Italian resistance was halted, a guerrilla war would carry on until 1943.

===North Africa===
A seesaw war began in North Africa. The Axis forces pushed the British back into Egypt under Rommel, but they were soon forced back into Libya. In 1942 the Axis forces once again advanced, pushing within just 60 miles of Alexandria. The Axis in spring 1942 seemed on the verge of sweeping the British out of Egypt, however at the First Battle of El Alamein (July 1942) General Claude Auchinleck halted Rommel's advance and the Allies assumed the offensive with the Second Battle of Alamein (October/November 1942) under General Bernard Montgomery. The Axis forces began a long retreat all the way back to Tunisia.

== READER RESPONSES ==


==Hi Elizabeth,==

I enjoyed reading your teaching philosophy. I know you said you're still forming it, something I'm sure we'll all be doing throughout the teaching program and our careers, but I think you have an impressive start!

I agree with maintaining an open mind as a teacher and enforcing tolerance and appreciation for differences. I believe our students will take cues from us as teachers and anything we can do to set a positive and tolerant example is helpful. 

I also agree with the need for continuing education among teachers. We need to stay abreast of new material we can use in our classes and new technologies to implement. Keeping things fresh is one way to keep interest among students. 

I'm interested in learning more about the &quot;power teaching&quot; method you mentioned. Thanks for sharing your great ideas!

== Hi Betsy! ==
  
That is a great pic!  That must have been an amazing trip!  Congratulations on all your degrees...it sounds like you are going to be the epitome of a lifelong learner.  I commend you on wanting to continue that throughout your teaching career.  What made you choose to teach, or have you always known you wanted to do that?  Also, considering your personality and learning specialties in psychology and such, is there any type of program your would especially want to participate in at a school where you teach, or a program that you want to start?

Sincerely,
Brandie  ([[User:Bthom039|Bthom039]] ([[User talk:Bthom039|talk]]) 02:56, 2 June 2008 (UTC))</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many assets in Trainz require other assets to function correctly. The assets required are known as 'dependencies' and are referenced in the kuid table within an asset's config.txt. A complicated locomotive may have many dependencies including the cab, horn sounds, doors, coronas and bogeys. A map/route may have hundreds of dependencies.  

Finding missing dependencies should start with a search on the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Trainz/DLS_and_FCT DLS] in case it is easily available for download. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Trainz/CMP CMP] allows for searching via kuid numbers.

Searching in [http://www.google.com Google] could also reveal the location for the download of missing dependencies as many assets are available on 3rd party sites only. Remember to reduce the search down to just the numbers. 

Thirdly, publicly requesting for the dependencies on a Trainz related forum may also help. If you are able to identify the creator of the asset via their unique user-kuid then you may be able contact them via e-mail or PM for more information. 

Lastly, the asset may simply not be available, i.e. it may never have been distributed by the creator. It may also be available only via payware sites.

If you are not able to locate missing dependencies, you can easily replace dependencies via the config.txt of the asset concerned, i.e. a missing cab could be swapped for a present cab in order to drive your locomotive with no errors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Part 1: Syllabaries===

One might expect that a syllabary is going to have thousands of characters: in fact Chinese has some 47,000.  But only about 4,000 are necessary for native speakers. The rest are specialized, limited use terms. And there are morphographic mappings of letters such that, upon gaining familiarity with basic symbols, a native speaker can approximate what a unknown related symbol would be.  4,000 is a high water mark in the syllabary languages: there are only 142 in use in [[w:Katakana|katakana]], of which only 103 are for non-loanwords. In [[w:Hiragana|hiragana]] only 69 make up the primary school table and only about '''46''' are used in introductory texts for students of the language.

Looking at these numbers, over a hundred for Japanese syllabaries, and still only 47,000 for Chinese, one realizes a common thread of syllabaries: a restricted use of syllables. (Compare to the &gt;1.6 million possible syllables in English.) This either comes from the isolating, analytic nature of the language, or from the dominance of consonant-vowel pairing which is often characterized by rapid, machine-gun like speech (a non-syllabary with this character is Spanish). There are very many syllables, very many exceptions, but there is a small core of '''simple syllables''' that are atomic, in much the same way that the simplyfied alphabet below would do almost as a drop-in-place system for English speakers.

Japanese as a whole, makes a very sticky example. It is ''the most complicated'' written form of language; which commonly weds three distinct and complete writing systems (one of which, kanji, basically is a ligaturization of all of Chinese, in the sense that it is some 50,000 symbols that show morphological divergence, while only 1,000 are oft-used) along with liberal, and frequent, transliteration (the [[w:Romanji|romanji]]) and borrowing of loan words in their proper native writing system.

&lt;!-- if we are moving away form an only-english presention at first to an english centric one, come back and do the charts --&gt;

===Part 2: Segmentals===
====The English alphabet====	 	
{{main|Wikipedia:English alphabet}}

As used in modern [[w:English language|English]], the Latin alphabet consists of the following [[w:grapheme|characters]]
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin:0 auto; width:90%; border-collapse:collapse;&quot;
|- 	 
!bgcolor=&quot;#EFEFEF&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;26&quot; | [[w:Capital letters|Majuscule Forms]] (also called uppercase or capital letters)
|-
|[[w:A|A]]||[[w:B|B]]||[[w:C|C]]||[[w:D|D]]||[[w:E|E]]||[[w:F|F]]||[[w:G|G]]||[[w:H|H]]||[[w:I|I]]||[[w:J|J]]||[[w:K|K]]||[[w:L|L]]||[[w:M|M]]||[[w:N|N]]||[[w:O|O]]||[[w:P|P]]||[[w:Q|Q]]||[[w:R|R]]||[[w:S|S]]||[[w:T|T]]||[[w:U|U]]||[[w:V|V]]||[[w:W|W]]||[[w:X|X]]||[[w:Y|Y]]||[[w:Z|Z]]
|- 	
!align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;26&quot; | [[w:Lower case|Minuscule Forms]] (also called lowercase or small letters)
|-
|a||b||c||d||e||f||g||h||i||j||k||l||m||n||o||p||q||r||s||t||u||v||w||x||y||z
|}

In addition, the [[w:ligature (typography)|ligatures]] ''[[w:Æ|Æ]]'' of ''A'' with ''E'' (e.g. &quot;[[w:encyclopedia|encyclopædia]]&quot;), and ''[[w:Œ|Œ]]'' of ''O'' with ''E'' (e.g. &quot;[[w:body cavity|cœlom]]&quot;) may be used, optionally, in words derived from Latin or Greek, and the [[w:umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis mark]] is sometimes placed for example on the letter ''o'' (e.g. &quot;coöperate&quot;) to indicate the pronunciation of ''oo'' as two distinct vowels, rather than a long one. 

Outside of professional papers on specific subjects that traditionally use ligatures in [[w:loanword|loanword]]s, however, ligatures and diaereses are seldom used in modern English. Also, any letter from the extended latin alphabet (that is, the latin alphabet in all the languages which use it), will sometimes be used when that word is or used as a loanword such as ''naïve''.

====Simplifying====
The [[w:Alphabets_derived_from_the_Latin|extended latin alphabet]] is a good deal more letters than this: comprised of 53 distinct alphabets, some with diacritics (''naïve'') and others with ligatures (''beißen''). There is not a one-to-one correlation between [[w:Phoneme|phonemes]] and [[w:Segment_(linguistics)|letters]]: There are about 50 distinct sounds just within the English language, or about two for every letter (though it doesn't quite distribute evenly that way). And just as we group sounds together in letters, other languages endorse their own groupings.  In [[w:Japanese_language|Japan]], the &quot;l&quot; and the &quot;r&quot; are ''really'' the same sound; it is just that we make a funny distinction.  Likewise, to English speakers, the elle &quot;LL&quot; of [[w:Spanish_language|Spanish]] is (in neutral accent) to us really just the same sound as our &quot;y&quot;, and the Irish Eth &quot;ð&quot; is really just &quot;th&quot;. Therefore, it makes sense to group letters into abstracted families when transferring from one language to another.  

The letters can be grouped together in more than one way, and someone learning english is likely to choose a grouping that maps well onto their own writing system. A transfer from english to english would be how we group letters when teaching our own children, something like the following:

'' * &lt;small&gt;Though not officially ligatures, these characters as used in English are in fact single glyphs representing the combination of two distinct letters. The &quot;X&quot; is a &quot;ks&quot; digraph, and the &quot;Q&quot; a &quot;ku&quot; digraph. Of course in the case of Q, the trailing &quot;u&quot; is almost always explicit in the spelling of the word.&lt;/small&gt;''

Of particular interest to technicians (and probably very natural to mothers, family and teachers of young children) is the use of &quot;C&quot; instead of &quot;k&quot; and &quot;E&quot; in place of &quot;i&quot;. This sort of selection represents the letter-choice bias of English, and if the target language was another latin alphabet, the historic symbols like &quot;k&quot; would likely be a better choice. Review what we just did again.  We took our alphabet in a standard, complete form, and abstracted out the '''simple letters''' of our language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Use ==
This tag is used for embedding plugins onto a web page such as movies, applets and music. Unlike the embed tag, the designer has to specify a plugin using a hexadecimal number.

== Example ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;object id=&quot;flagMovie&quot; classid=&quot;CLSID:05589FA1-C356-11CE-BF01-00AA0055595A&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt;
  &lt;param name=&quot;fileName&quot; value=&quot;flags.avi&quot;&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Required attributes ==
====classid====
This attribute identifies the plugin or control the designer wants to use. The value is a hexadecimal number.

== Optional attributes ==
====height====
Declares the height of the object

====width====
Declares the width of the object

== More info ==

A link to a page with more info, then the name of the site the info came from (i.e. W3Schools).

== HI! ==

Hay, I'm a writer too! Though, I don't think I could ever handle journalism. My heads too far into other worlds. I bet it will prove to be a great skill for teaching and getting students more into current events.

Hi
I enjoyed getting to know you a little bit through your about me section and your educational philosophy.  While I am not one for brief comments normally, the only thing that I feel to mention is that I am in 100 percent agreement with you on your statement that &quot;every mistake will be an oppurtunitt to learn.&quot;  There are too many people in society who do not focus on the fact that people make mistakes its what we take from them that matters the most.[[User:Sthur002|Sthur002]] ([[User talk:Sthur002|talk]]) 23:42, 31 May 2008 (UTC)


Hi Mary, 
I enjoyed reading about you and I found that we have something in common...I also just graduated from college (JMU) and like you, am back to school already.  I feel like it's a little stressful, especially during the summer, but at least we're getting it over with! I thought your philosophy of education was really interesting and I totally agree with you that it is important to teach students applicable lessons that will help them to succeed in the future.  Too often I think we learn things in school that we never have any reason to use, so trying to make lessons applicable to life I think is a great teaching strategy. I also agree with you on the importance of communication.  I think that kids today with their addiction to technology (like the computer and video games) are not learning how to effectively communicate with adults and their peers and I think that it is something that will hinder them in the future...it's definitely necessary that we teach our students how to communicate in order to be successful in the real world.  Good luck to you this semester!

==Quick Facts==
*&lt;b&gt;Born:&lt;/b&gt; July 29, 1883
*&lt;b&gt;Died:&lt;/b&gt; April 28, 1945
*&lt;b&gt;Leader Of:&lt;/b&gt; Italy
**&lt;b&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; October 31, 1922 
**&lt;b&gt;To:&lt;/b&gt; July 25, 1943

Benito Mussolini was the leader of the Italian National Fascist Party. He became the Prime Minister of Italy in 1922 and appointed himself to head of the military.

Mussolini first thought that he would fight alongside France against Germany, but he changed his mind. In 1940, he declared war on Britain and made Italy part of the &quot;Axis&quot; powers with Germany. Mussolini tried to make himself important in Hitler's eyes by fighting the British in North Africa and invading Greece. But both times his armies were heavily beaten and had to be rescued by the Germans.

In 1943, the Allies invaded Italy and the Italians switched sides, joining the Allies. Mussolini was overthrown and put in prison. But German special forces rescued him and put him back in charge of the parts of Italy that hadn't been captured by the Allies.

In April 1945, when it was clear that the Allies were winning, Mussolini tried to run away to Switzerland. But he was caught by the British and executed by Italian partisans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Legacy (along with [[Magic: The Gathering/Vintage Format|Vintage]]) is considered an eternal format because the card pool never rotates. This means that all the sets that are currently legal will continue to be legal and any new sets will automatically be included in the legal card pool. (Except of course for cards on the banned and restricted list)

It evolved from Type 1.5, a format defined by a banned list that merely consisted of all banned and restricted cards in the old Type 1. In 2004, the format was revitalized by separating the banned list from the rechristened Vintage and banning many old, powerful, and expensive cards such as Mishra's Workshop, Mana Drain, and Bazaar of Baghdad. The result is that Legacy has a lower power level than Vintage, which makes for longer games, and is considerably more affordable. The DCI has attempted to promote the format with the addition of a Legacy Grand Prix circuit. In 2007, the company announced that this format had selected for the final individual portion of the World Championships prior to the fixing a problem that they had made after moving the championships from summer/fall to fall/winter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &quot;if&quot; or &quot;only if&quot; ==
Do we mean &quot;if&quot; or &quot;only if&quot; when we describe the relationship of a predicate to its associated predicates?
&lt;div class=&quot;PrettyTextBox&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;a :- b, c, d.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This says that a is true, '''[[if]]''' b, c and d are true. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Does this mean &quot;if (b and c and d) then a&quot;? Would that be logically the same as &quot;a only if (b and c and d)&quot;.
: The first option. If (b and c and d) is true, then a is true. If (b and c and d) is not true, we don't know if a is true or not. In this case prolog will discard the rule. If it finds another rule a :- e, where e is true, a will still be true. If :- meant 'only if', and thus a would be false because (b, c, d) was untrue, the fact that a was made true by a :- e would cause a conflict (a would be both true and false).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Booster Drafting is a method of constructing decks in [[Magic: The Gathering]]

This format is sanctioned by DCI and occurs at almost every prerelease. Many stores also make the last Friday Night Magic Tournament of the month a booster draft.

== The Process ==

Each player is given three booster packs.&lt;br&gt;
Each player opens one pack and removes one card for themselves.&lt;br&gt;
They then take the remaining cards and pass them to the player on their left.&lt;br&gt;
They subsequently receive cards from the player on their right.&lt;br&gt;
They remove a card from the new set of cards and pass it to their left.&lt;br&gt;
This process continues until there are no more cards.&lt;br&gt;
Players then open their second booster pack.&lt;br&gt;
They repeat the process, this time passing cards to their right.&lt;br&gt;
When there are no more cards, they open their final booster pack.&lt;br&gt;
They repeat the process, this time passing cards to their left again.

After exhausting all three booster packs, each player should have selected and obtained 45 cards.

They combine as many or as few cards from the ones they just selected with any amount of basic lands they desire. This becomes their deck. This deck must have a minimum of 40 cards.

Players then compete tournament style to win a prize of some sort (normally additional packs).

At informal/casual drafts, a rule can be set in place that forces players to return all of the rares they drafted into one center pile after the tournament is over. The player who came in first selects a rare to keep, then the player who came in second, and so on. After the last player picks a rare, it starts over again with the player who came in first. Playing a match like this does two things, it gives the winner a prize without having the players to spend money on additional packs, and it prevents rare drafting to make the matches more competitive and fun.&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes the rule is adjusted to make players return all rares and uncommons. This makes the tournament more competitive, but the cards-to-keep selection process afterwards is much longer.

== Strategy ==

'''Deck Building Strategy'''&lt;br&gt;
Because the decks are only 40 cards and most of the cards in a booster pack are small creatures or spells with small mana costs, it is a generally good idea to build a fast deck. Also, because you will rarely get more than one or two of a good card, it is not a good idea to build the deck around it, featuring complex combos and whatnot. If a combo requires 3 cards, and you only have one of each, you cannot rely on drawing it every game.

'''Card Picking Strategy'''&lt;br&gt;
Often it is difficult to decide what tribe and/or colors to run. At first you only see 7 of the 84 cards you can choose from. It is normal to begin thinking you want to play one color and then switch to another color part way into drafting. This normally happens when you see a particular good card in another color or notice that many players are not drafting cards from a particular color. If you notice that most of the cards passed to you are blue and there are never any good white cards, chances are a large number of people are running mono white, white/green, etc. This a good sign you should switch from white to blue. The less people who want blue cards, the better chance you have of getting good blue cards.



'''Rare drafting'''&lt;br&gt;
In this act, players select a rare card from the set of cards handed to them, not because it will benefit their deck, but because the card is worth a large amount or because the card would go well in another deck of theirs at a later date. 


'''Hate drafting'''&lt;br&gt;
In this act, players select a powerful card from the set of cards handed to them, not because it will benefit their deck, but because the card is exceptionally powerful and they don't want anyone to use it against them. Even if the card is worthless to them, making sure no one else has it could mean the difference between winning or losing the tournament.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{XML-MDE|prev=RPC|next=RDF - Resource Description Framework}}
The '''JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library''' (Short Form: '''JSTL''') is a collection of four custom-tag libraries which extend the JSP specification. As a component it is allocated in the Java EE Web application development platform.
The JSTL is administrated in the setting of the Java Community Process (JCP) 052. Within the Jakarta-Project there are reference implementations to these specifications.


==Components==
In version 1.1 the following libraries were intended:

*core: iterative, conditional, URL-specific  and general Tags
*xml: Tags from the field XML and XML-transformation
* sql: Tags for direct data base administration
*i18n: Tags for formatting and internationalization

==History==
In its original Version 1.0 an „Expression Language“ was intended  in comparison to Version 1.1. With JSP 2.0 JSP-EL was taken up in the JSP-specifications itself.  Therefore the primary goal of JSTL 1.1 is the adaption of the libraries to the JSP-EL for JSP 2.0. With the libraries in version 1.2 the JSTL is up to date concerning the unification of the Expression Language by the JSP 2.1 and JSF-1.2-specifications. Furthermore the JSTL in Version 1.2 is part of the Java-EE-5-Platform.

==Usage of JSTL 1.1==
As for the use of  JSTL 1.1 the JSP-EL  is required, a servlet-container has to be conform to at least  the JSP-2.0 specifications in order to be be used on this. The reference implimentation is made up of two JAR – archives „standard.jar“ and „jstl.jar“. In most containers  they usually need to be located in the lib-path of the web application only. To ensure  backwards compatibility the JSTL 1.1 is referenced by the URI „http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt“  whereas „http://java.sun.com/jstl/fmt“  is used for JSTL 1.0.


'''Example JSP-page in XML-notation (JSPX):'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;jsp:root
  xmlns:jsp=&quot;http://java.sun.com/JSP/Page&quot;
  xmlns:c=&quot;http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core&quot;
  xmlns:fmt=&quot;http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt&quot;
version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;

&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;JSTL 1.1&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Iteration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;c:forEach var=&quot;num&quot; begin=&quot;1&quot; end=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Number&lt;c:out value=&quot;${num}&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/c:forEach&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Formatting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Currency: &lt;fmt:formatNumber value=&quot;10000&quot; type=&quot;currency&quot; currencyCode=&quot;EUR&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/jsp:root&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Code-Explanations:'''

In the ''jsp:root'' – element the usage of the basis- und the I18N-Taglibs (core and fmt) from the JSTL is indicated and linked to the according XML-namespace. Under the headline ''Iteration'' the ''forEach-Tag'' from the core-library is used:  It displays the tag-body (i.e., the content of the Tag) ten times.  In this loop with ''&lt;code&gt;${num}&lt;/code&gt;'' you can find JSP – Expression.  With every loop cycle the current data from ''num'' is displayed here. Under the headline ''Formatting'' the ''formatNumber''-tag from the fmt – library of JSTL is used. Depending on the adjusted lanuage (this can be set by fmt:setLocale for example) the number 10000 will be formated (e.g. in german as „EUR 10.000,00“ and in english as „EUR 10,000.00“)

== Alternatives to the JSTL ==
'''Struts vs. JSTL: '''
There are in fact many instances where a Struts tag and JSTL tag will perform equivalent functions. Unlike the Struts-Framework the JSTL is not linked to a certain architecture–paradigm, like the ''Model–View–Controller'' separation. JSTL tags are more powerful compared to struts tags, because JSTL is a more standard part of the J2EE specification, while at the same time many options are available like condition checking, comparing strings, triming white spaces, converting upper case or lower case, etc. Both libraries own tags with identical name. So if these libraries are mixed in applications, what is possible, it needs to be attended to use unique prefixes(JSP) or namespaces (JSPX).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Autodesk GMAX ==

Setting up GMAX is important for consistency in producing digital models. Before you start a model make sure GMAX is set up correctly. It is is still possible to work in imperial measurements if you wish. 

* Launch GMAX using the Trainz Asset Creation Studio. GMAX can be launched normally if preferred, but the exporter function is only availble if you have set up the plugins correctly. 
* From the main file menu go to ''Customize&gt;Units Setup'' and in the dialogue box choose ''metric''.
* From the main file menu go to ''Customize&gt;Preferences'' and set the units to your choice. Most creators now use meters, because Trainz basic units of calculations are metres and they'd have to convert back and forth all the time. This is the units your model will be constructed in.

== Autodesk 3DS Max ==

Make sure you have the latest updates for your version of 3DS Max. Recent updates have fixed compatibility with Windows Vista, Window 7 and Windows 8. 3DS Max has a many options, including all that are available in GMAX plus many more.

==Blender==
{{TL|Blender}} by {{plain link|http://www.blender.org/| Blender.org}} is a community Freeware and {{wp|open source}} {{wp|3D Modeling software|3D graphics modeling}} software package (similar in development by world wide contributors to Mozilla ({{wp|Firefox}}) and {{wp|Open Office|Open Office.org's}} office suite attacking the monopoly of big money software developers) developed expressly for animated 3D modeling. It has become quite popular in the Trainz community as the Commercial 3dsMax software is pricey (A full version priced in March 2014 retailed at $3,645.00 US dollars&amp;mdash;a bit high for a hobbyist to shell out. see [http://www.amazon.com/Autodesk-Design-Includes-Subscription-Version/dp/B007MF766M Today's Amazon.com price]].)

There are now many pages in this Trainz book on how to use Blender to make {{TL|Trainz assets}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Midnight Baseball is a variant of 7 card stud in which all players cards are dealt face down, and players are not allowed to look at their hands prior to playing. In addition, as a variant of Baseball, 3s and 9s are wild, and players can get another card when dealt a 4.
After all players have 7 cards, the dealer will turn over 1 card from the deck, and then the player to the dealers right will turn over cards from their hand until they have a higher ranking hand than what was turned over. Once they have a higher hand, they have the option of checking or betting. Once all players have called or checked, the next player to the right will turn over cards until they either bmake a higher hand, or turn over all their card. The betting process is again repeated and the game ends when all players have turned their cards over or folded. the winner is the player with the highest ranking 5 card poker hand.

      <comment>/* Greetings */ changed 'salut' meanings to more accurate versions</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This week we will learn:
*the verb ''être'', &quot;to be&quot;
**how to conjugate ''être'' in the present tense only
**use ''être'' and its inflections in sentences with basic vocabulary
*the verb ''avoir'', &quot;to have&quot;
**how to conjugate ''avoir'' in the present tense only
**use ''avoir'' and its inflections in sentences with basic vocabulary
*the verb ''habiter'', &quot;to live&quot;
**how to conjugate ''habiter'' in the present tense only
**use ''habiter'' and its inflections in sentences with basic vocabulary

==Basic vocabulary==
===Greetings===
*''salut'', &quot;hi&quot; or &quot;bye&quot;
*''bonjour'', &quot;hello&quot; or &quot;good morning&quot;

===Pronouns===
*''je'', &quot;I&quot;
*''tu'', &quot;you&quot; (singular)
*''il'', &quot;he&quot; or &quot;it&quot;
*''elle'', &quot;she&quot;
*''nous'', &quot;we&quot;
*''vous'', &quot;you&quot; (plural)
*''ils'', &quot;they&quot;
*&quot;elles&quot;, &quot;they&quot;

==être==
*The verb &quot;to be&quot;
*Is an [[GCSE French/Glossary#irregular verb|irregular verb]]

===Conjugating être in the present tense===
*First person singular &amp;mdash; ''je suis'', &quot;I am&quot;
*Second person singular &amp;mdash; ''tu es'', &quot;you are&quot;
*Third person singular &amp;mdash; ''il/elle est'', &quot;he/she is&quot;
*First person plural &amp;mdash; ''nous sommes'', &quot;we are&quot;
*Second person plural &amp;mdash; ''vous  êtes'', &quot;you are&quot;
*Third person plural &amp;mdash; ''ils/elles sont'', &quot;they are&quot;

==avoir==
*The verb &quot;to have&quot;
*Is an [[GCSE French/Glossary#irregular verb|irregular verb]]

===Conjugating avoir in the present tense===
*First person singular &amp;mdash; ''j'ai'', &quot;I have&quot;
*Second person singular &amp;mdash; ''tu as'', &quot;you have&quot;
*Third person singular &amp;mdash; ''il/elle a'', &quot;he/she has&quot;
*First person plural &amp;mdash; ''nous avons'', &quot;we have&quot;
*Second person plural &amp;mdash; ''vous  avez'', &quot;you have&quot;
*Third person plural &amp;mdash; ''ils/elles ont'', &quot;they have&quot;

==habiter==
*The verb &quot;to live&quot;
*Is a regular verb

===Conjugating habiter in the present tense===
*First person singular &amp;mdash; ''j'habite'', &quot;I live&quot;
*Second person singular &amp;mdash; ''tu habites'', &quot;you live&quot;
*Third person singular &amp;mdash; ''il/elle habite '', &quot;he/she lives&quot;
*First person plural &amp;mdash; ''nous habitons'', &quot;we live&quot;
*Second person plural &amp;mdash; ''vous habitez'', &quot;you live&quot;
*Third person plural &amp;mdash; ''ils/elles habitent'', &quot;they live&quot;

==Useful notes==
*When conjugating verbs there are usually rules which can be used to determine how a certain verb should be conjugated. The verbs &lt;em&gt;avoir&lt;/em&gt; &quot;to have&quot; and &lt;em&gt;&amp;ecirc;tre&lt;/em&gt; &quot;to be&quot;, are irregular and do not follow any of these rules. Their inflections must therefore be remembered. &lt;em&gt;Habiter&lt;/em&gt; &quot;to live&quot; is a regular -er verb, however.
*The ''first person singular'' of avoir is ''ai''. As it starts with a vowel, when combined with ''je'', the phrase &quot;I have&quot; becomes ''j'ai'' '''not ''je ai''''' which would be tedious to pronounce.
*Similarly to the ''first person singular'' of avoir, ''ai'', the ''first person singular'' of habiter, ''habite'', when combined with ''je'' forms ''j'habite'' '''not ''je habite'''''. This is because the ''h'' in habite is silent making the first sound of habite a vowel sound, &quot;a&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''This article needs attention from experts!'''

By default Prolog does a top-down logic inference.

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
clever(joe).
handsome(joe).

hasgirlfriend(X):-
    clever(X),handsome(X).
&lt;/source&gt;

We run this as &quot;'''hasgirlfriend(X).'''&quot; to get the people who have a girlfriend.

Bi-directional inference:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
clever(joe).
handsome(joe).

rule([handsome(joe),clever(joe)],(hasgirlfriend(joe))).

run:- call(rule(X,Y)),findall(A,(member(A,X),call(A)),L),
	length(X,Rulelength),
	length(L,Rulelength),
	assert(Y),print(Y).
&lt;/source&gt;

We run this as &quot;'''run.'''&quot;. 

We don't have to directly ask who has a girlfriend, it gives us all results that can be implied. The benefit of bidirectional inferencing is the speed gain.

== re:[[GCSE French]] ==

I saw your message, and I moved the &quot;Week 1&quot; page to [[GCSE French/Week 1]]. I also removed the cleanup tags from that page. Please take a look at the changes I made to the [[GCSE Page]]: I Fixed the links so they will point to subpages, not new books. When you create a link, you need to either write:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[GCSE French/PAGENAME]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

or you need to write:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/PAGENAME/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

(notice the forward-slashes on either side of the page name). This can be a little bit confusing at first. You might want to read our pages on [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. If you need any help, please let me know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:32, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

== Greetings from another author==
Hi! It's nice to see some more activity in French! I have been working on [[French_For_Football]] for the last year or so, concentrating mostly on vocabulary notes before I start writing formal lessons. It is targeted at a different audience, but if you want to copy anything from there you are most welcome. That is a basic principle here anyway. I am just an amateur really, so I'm also hoping you might help fix some of my mistakes and give me some tips on the best way to combine grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary. As far as I can tell work on [[French]] has stalled, and I haven't heard from any of the authors of that book. Usually I visit the [http://forum.wordreference.com Wordreference] site if I have questions to ask. There's always someone on line to comment on your questions, although the high traffic level does mean your topic soon gets buried under a heap of more recent postings.

I am creating a new wikibook teaching French. Specifically aiming at getting the reader up to a GCSE level. It should be renamed however to &quot;GCSE French/Week 1&quot; --[[User:RMFan1|RMFan1]] ([[User talk:RMFan1|talk]]) 14:26, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

== Grammar reference or course? ==

Hey, are you planning to make this a reference kind of book, e. g. &quot;All grammar you need to know for the GCSE&quot;, or will you be teaching all parts of the language? If all parts, I strongly recommend the use of dialogs, vocabulary lists or literal dialog translations and exercises.

'''Cider''' is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented juice of specially cultivated &quot;cider apples&quot; that can be used to add flavor and moisture to various meat and fish dishes. In French cooking dishes from Normandy (&quot;Normande&quot;) often contain apples and may be moistened with cider. It may be used in place of white wine in many recipes.

In North America (USA and some, but not all, parts of Canada) cider is unfiltered unfermented (non-alcoholic) apple juice and the alcoholic version is known as &quot;hard cider&quot;

For uncooked usage of cider, see the numerous warnings on the [[Cookbook:Alcoholic_Drink|alcoholic drink]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Candi Whitehead. I currently attend Old Dominion University. I will receive my Bachelors degree in education in spring 2009. I want to teach either third, forth, or fifth grade.  I live in Virginia on Chincoteague Island. If no one knows about Chincoteague, it is known for its annual pony swim the last Wednesday in July. My island is a tourist trap. I work full time at a restaurant called The Village. I don’t have much time to do anything other than work and go to school. If I ever get any spare time I’ am usually at the beach, but that is very rare. The winter time is when I travel. This picture is my last vacation we were on a cruise ship in the Carribean.
[[Image:Dinner.jpg]]

I wish to teach third, forth, or fifth grade because I fell that those are the grades that kids learn the most that they will need later in life. Everything you learn in those grades you need for everyday life. Also, I have a lot of patience but I do not want to teach ABC’s, 123’s, and nap time.
I have done two internships one with a fifth grade class. I really enjoyed the way the teacher taught. She would put the notes on an overhead and give each kid a copy. They would glue it to one side of their notebook. The teacher would then go through each paragraph and ask which words they didn’t know and ask the subject and predicate of each sentence. She would then get the kids to draw a picture for each paragraph. For instance in Science, they would draw flowers and explain the stem, leaf, root, and stamen. I feel that this way of teaching keeps the interest of the students and keeps them focused. This is how I wish to teach my classes. I hope to make learning fun and interesting.

''Teaching Philosophy''

''Diversity:'' I believe that girls and boys should work together on projects and when doing group activities there should not be groups of just boys or girls. Students should be taught that boys and girls are equal. Kids should be grouped with students of their same learning ability. Kids with special needs should have a special education teacher; if they do not then the teacher needs to explain things more in-depth to the child.
''Instructional strategies:'' I explained some of my instructional strategies in my about the author paragraph. I think that classes should be half lecture and half activities. If a class is just taught by lecture kids are not going to pay attention. They loose interest fast so the teacher’s responsibility is to keep them entertained while teaching the material that they need to know
''Classroom environment:'' When I organize my classroom I will have pictures on the walls to keep the room home(y). I will have bulletin boards with the students work to show accomplishments.
''Technology:'' In my classroom I will have activities that will have to be done on the computer to teach the students more about computers and how they work. Students will learn how to complete math problems without calculators and then be taught how to check their answers with a calculator so they will know how to use them. 
''Assessment:'' At the beginning of the year I will have a reading assignment that will have to be completed by everyone. Then I will see how well they all did. I will then separate the kids into different reading groups. Then I will be able to know which kids are better readers than the others. This will also help with spelling.

[[User:Kmorr038|Kmorr038]] ([[User talk:Kmorr038|talk]]) 03:25, 2 June 2008 (UTC)
Candi,
I really enjoyed reading about you and your teaching philosophy.  I, also, enjoy the beach and the islands, and completly understand your love for them!  I think it's great that you want to vary your instruction by allowing students to do activities in addition to your lecturing.  I think thats a very important part of teaching, due to the fact that it does indeed keep their attention and interest better.  Good luck with everything! I'm sure you will make a wonderful teacher.</text>

A [[Cookbook:Venison|venison]] sauce for pasta. I have made this successfully with [[w:Roe Deer|roe deer]], [[w:Muntjac|muntjac]] and [[w:Springbok_%28antelope%29|springbok]].

==Ingredients==
*250[[Cookbook:g|g]] (½[[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*250[[Cookbook:g|g]] (½[[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) finely chopped [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]]
*2-5 cloves of finely chopped [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] 
*30[[Cookbook:ML|ml]] (2[[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]]) [[Cookbook:Olive_Oil|olive]], [[Cookbook:Corn_Oil|corn]] or [[Cookbook:Sunflower_Oil|sunflower oil]] (according to taste)
*500[[Cookbook:g|g]] (1.1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) minced (ground) stewing venison (minced lean leftovers from trimming are ideal)
*500[[Cookbook:ML|ml]] Dry [[Cookbook:Cider|cider]], or red or white wine, or [[Cookbook:Stock|beef stock]] (how much you will need depends on how fast it boils away)
*60[[Cookbook:ML|ml]] (4[[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]]) [[Cookbook:Tomato_Paste|tomato purée]]
*250[[Cookbook:g|g]] (½[[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) finely grated [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]]
*5 [[Cookbook:Bay_Leaf|bay leaves]]
*30[[Cookbook:ML|ml]] (2[[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]]) [[Cookbook:Herbes_de_Provence|Herbes de Provence]]
*1 stock cube (optional - see procedure), salt, freshly ground black pepper
*300[[Cookbook:g|g]] (¾[[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) [[Cookbook:Pasta_of_Italy|penne, spaghetti]] or whatever other pasta you prefer

==Procedure==
#Sauté the onions, mushrooms and garlic in the oil until well softened.
#Add the venison and stir well until it has all (more or less) changed colour.
#Add sufficient dry cider or wine (red or white as preferred) or stock, to cover, but not too deeply.
#Add the stock cube (only if you are using wine or cider), bay leaves, grated carrot and tomato purée, and stir well.
#Simmer very gently for at least three hours, stirring occasionally and replenishing the liquid (with more cider/wine/stock or just water) if it gets too dry. The ideal is to have the sauce with little separate liquid when it is served - but not dry enough to scorch. It may be simmered on top of the stove, or in a very low oven, or in a slow cooker. The sauce is edible after about 40 minutes but is infinitely better flavoured and textured after three or four hours. In a slow cooker it can be cooked for eight hours. The flavour is even better if it is cooked, allowed to cool overnight, and reheated for 30 or 40 minutes but this is a council of perfection and not really necessary.
#About 30-40 minutes before serving remove the bay leaves, add the herbes de Provence, and adjust the salt (i.e. taste it and add more salt if you think it needs it).
#Just before serving add freshly ground black pepper.
#Serve over spaghetti (or whatever other pasta shape you prefer) cooked al dente (well-cooked, but not too soft) and sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese.</text>

'''1. INTRODUCCIÓ'''
----

Les tecnologies de la informació i la comunicació (TIC) han experimentat en els darrers anys un desenvolupament espectacular, i han transformat la nostra societat i, en particular, l’àmbit educatiu. 
Representen en el món de l’educació un lent però progressiu cessament dels sistemes tradicionals  basats en les coordenades espai i temps, i des d’un punt de vista educatiu, centrats exclusivament en el docent.

Aquestes tecnologies, juntament amb els nous enfocaments educatius sobre el mètode d’ensenyament i l’atenció a la diversitat, ofereixen una major participació i col·laboració dels alumnes en el procés ensenyament-aprenentatge. L’alumnat passa a tenir un paper més actiu, col·laborant juntament amb el professor en el disseny dels materials educatius.

La introducció d’aquestes tecnologies a les aules fa possible, doncs, el desenvolupament de noves estratègies pedagògiques de metodologia activa que atorguen a l’alumne una major implicació en el procés d’ensenyament-aprenentatge, i que es basen en un aprenentatge de caràcter fonamentalment autònom i col·laboratiu. L’alumne aprèn significativament, de forma que l’aprenentatge esdevé per a aquest alumne un procés de construcció del seu propi coneixement i l’ensenyament el mitjà de suport a aquest aprenentatge.  

Des d’una perspectiva global, emmarquem el projecte en l’àmbit d’aquest aprenentatge autònom i col·laboratiu a partir de l’aplicació de les TIC a l’educació.

Des d’un punt de vista més específic, el treball se centra en les possibilitats que ofereix l’aplicació concreta d’una de les noves eines, el wikibook, en l’ensenyament de la literatura a secundària.

A continuació, presentem l’estructura formal del nostre projecte, format per quatre parts diferenciades, a més d’un apartat on es recullen les conclusions extretes de tot el procés d’anàlisi i elaboració realitzat, i d’un seguit d’annexos.  

En la primera part, formada per l’apartat 2, s’analitzen els avantatges que suposen en el context educatiu l’aplicació de les noves tecnologies i les noves propostes tecnològiques d’aprenentatge. Es defineix la realitat que ha fet possible l’aparició de noves possibilitats en el camp del coneixement, particularment en el món educatiu, posant una especial atenció a la importància del treball i l’aprenentatge col·laboratius. Es defineix una de les eines més representatives en el camp del treball col·laboratiu, el wiki, així com les principals característiques dels llibres basats en aquesta eina wiki: el wikibook.

La segona part, formada per l’apartat 3, descriu de manera global l’aplicabilitat i l’aprofitament dels wikibooks en el camp educatiu en general, tant el procés d’edició com el de l’administració.

La tercera part, centrada en l’apartat 4 del projecte, tracta específicament l’ensenyament i l’aprenentatge de la literatura mitjançant els wikibooks. S’hi expliquen els principals avantatges i inconvenients des del punt de vista dels docents i dels alumnes en el cicle de l’educació secundària obligatòria, i es mostren alguns exemples de wikibooks per a secundària.

Finalment, la quarta part, que correspon a l’apartat 5, mostra l’aplicació dels coneixements adquirits mitjançant la plasmació del nostre propi wikibook.

La cita següent, extreta de la conferència inaugural del curs de doctorat de la UOC “La societat de la informació i el coneixement” impartida per Manuel Castells, representa el nostre punt de partida:   

“''Internet és el teixit de les nostres vides en aquest moment.
No és futur. És present''.”


'''2. L'EINA WIKI'''
----

'''2.1. 	Definició i presència en el món de les TIC'''

'''2.1.1. Web 2.0'''

El terme web 2.0 fou creat per O’Reilly Media i MediaLive Internacional en el marc d’una conferència impartida per Tim O’Reilly l’octubre de 2004, en què s’exposà una nova tendència en la forma d’utilitzar i de concebre el web.

Actualment, el web 2.0 es percep com a un concepte, una idea, o fins i tot una nova filosofia. Hi ha una infinitat de definicions o formes de concebre aquest nou terme, atès que no s’han pogut definir els límits de la que –deien– n’era la característica principal: l’aprofitament del web com a plataforma. És, en definitiva, un terme que admet diverses definicions i derivacions, en funció de la visió o les necessitats dels usuaris, però que podríem resumir segons els seus trets principals:

-	Segona fase d’Internet: el Web 2.0 evoluciona a partir del tradicional web 1.0, basat en un sistema de documents d’hipertext i d’hipervincles de caràcter estàtic i predeterminat, fins que es converteix en un espai fonamentat en programes de codi obert que es caracteritzen en el compartiment, la modificació i la millora de continguts.

-	El web com a plataforma: els avenços tecnològics aplicats a la informació i la comunicació han possibilitat la creació de noves aplicacions per a la xarxa que han transformat el model tradicional de comunicació lineal emissor – canal – receptor en un model de comunicació circular, interpersonal i amb una retroalimentació constant entre els usuaris. Es tracta d’una interacció sense límits geogràfics que permet compartir la informació col·lectivament i de manera asincrònica, sense la necessitat d’instal·lar programes específics, ni d’adquirir habilitats informàtiques especials.

-	Democratització de la informació i del coneixement: possiblement, les repercussions principals d’aquest nou web siguin més socials que no pas tecnològiques. A partir del web 2.0 hi ha hagut una explosió de llocs socials basats en el compartiment de la informació i del coneixement, de forma que l’usuari ha passat a ser el principal subjecte actiu en la creació de serveis i continguts, a favor de la ja coneguda intel·ligència col·lectiva.

De les tres característiques exposades fixem la nostra atenció en la darrera, és a dir, en la creació d’una intel·ligència col·lectiva a partir de la lliure elaboració de continguts i del compartiment de la informació i del coneixement.

És precisament en aquesta característica on rau la principal àrea d’oportunitat de l’aplicació d’aquesta nova plataforma a l’àmbit educatiu, ja que aquest nou concepte web, de caràcter clarament constructivista, permet entendre Internet no tan sols com una font d’informació, sinó com una plataforma on treballar amb aquesta informació, proporcionant espais de treball i d’aprenentatge col·laboratius.

'''2.1.2. Aprenentatge col·laboratiu en l’entorn virtual'''

Un dels principals potencials de la realitat 2.0 és la facultat que atorga a les TIC aplicades al camp educatiu d’actuar com a instruments cognitius, facilitant l’aprenentatge col·laboratiu, així com el procés de desenvolupament i transformació conceptual dels estudiants. Salinas (2000:200) defineix breument el terme i assenyala que ''aprenentatge col·laboratiu'' és “l’adquisició de destreses i actituds que es donen com a resultat de la interacció en grup”. 

En la pràctica educativa, aquest aprenentatge col·laboratiu és un dels mètodes més fructífers i estesos del món. És un model que es fonamenta en els principis constructivistes de l’aprenentatge i que permet als estudiants aprendre de forma significativa, que se centra en la transmissió del coneixement i en els diferents processos de pensament, com ara el crític, el creatiu o l’analític.
La plataforma ofereix la possibilitat de realitzar treballs col·laboratius en xarxa. Aquest fet, a part de les possibilitats educatives que representa, està provocant una transformació del model educatiu tradicional. El nou paradigma, nascut a partir dels principis bàsics de l’educació activa d’inicis de segle XX, provoca dos fets importants:

a) Està transformant els diferents rols dels docents i dels alumnes. En aquest sentit, els alumnes, mitjançant aquest nou model d’aprenentatge, veuen que conceptes com ara individualitat, passivitat o memorització van deixant pas a termes com cooperació, comunicació o autoavaluació, entre d’altres. Prenen un paper molt més actiu en la construcció del seu propi coneixement, fet que representa una repercussió directament proporcional en el rol de la figura del professor. 

Així doncs, el concepte tradicional de professor també es transforma i adopta un rol clar de mediador. Esdevé un tutor-consultor que requereix unes noves habilitats tècniques i didàctiques, així com una nova planificació curricular. 
Aquest nou paper del professor-mediador es basa fonamentalment en tres fases: “1- Fase preactiva: planifica, a partir de les característiques dels estudiants. 2- Fase activa: presenta objectius i continguts, proposa activitats, proporciona les eines, orienta, motiva... 3- Fase postactiva: avalua amb els estudiants.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

b) Està provocant el trencament de la clàssica jerarquització del model educatiu. La possibilitat de l’alumne de participar en el procés educatiu altera considerablement l’estructura de l’arquitectura del coneixement tradicional. En aquest sentit, es produeix un progressiu traspàs del procés d’ensenyament, concentrat fins ara en la figura del professor com a instructor cap als alumnes.

'''2.1.3. Wiki'''

Un dels formats del web 2.0 per a la construcció cooperativa per excel·lència és el wiki. 
Es defineix com una de les eines més rellevants de la construcció social del coneixement i com un dels responsables principals de l’impressionant i ràpid procés de sociabilització de la xarxa esmentat.

Sobre els orígens del terme, se’n coneixen principalment dues dades. En primer lloc, i quant al significat, ''wiki'' és una paraula que prové del hawaià i que significa ‘ràpid’ (es pot establir fàcilment una relació amb el concepte ''ràpid'', amb relació a la rapidesa de què es caracteritza l’eina wiki en el seu tractament); i de l’altra, es tracta d’un terme emprat pels remers, un col·lectiu caracteritzat, sens dubte, pel seu esforç col·laboratiu.

Ward Cunningham va crear el primer espai wiki, el WikiWikiWeb, l’any 1995, i el va definir com “la base de dades en xarxa més simple que pugui funcionar”. Actualment, aquests espais es coneixen com a servidors web amb administració de versions a Internet, en què qualsevol usuari sense coneixements previs d’HTML, pot crear, modificar i enllaçar pàgines web sense programari ni eines específiques.

L’avantatge principal dels wikis és, doncs, la possibilitat que ofereix per realitzar treballs de forma col·laborativa, possibilitat que, aplicada a les aules, té un valor incommensurable principalment per dues raons:  

a) En primer lloc, perquè el professor pot accedir en qualsevol moment al contingut del treball dels alumnes visualitzant mitjançant l’historial tot el procés de construcció del text, des del seu esquema inicial fins al producte final. Aquesta eina permet, per tant, avaluar dins d’un entorn grupal el treball i l’aprenentatge individual de cada alumne, com també una avaluació continuada de l’activitat. D’altra banda, possibilita al docent “ensenyar a aprendre” mitjançant unes activitats crítiques i aplicatives, de forma que promou el desenvolupament cognitiu i personal dels alumnes. 

2. En segon lloc, perquè la possibilitat que tenen els alumnes de crear, editar, modificar o esborrar els continguts de forma col·laborativa, asincrònica, senzilla i directa fa que el pes de la formació recaigui en ells mateixos, cosa que contribueix directament en la construcció del seu propi coneixement.

'''2.2.	Wikibooks'''

El projecte Wikibooks, neix l’any 2003, a càrrec de Wikipedia. Aproximadament cinc anys després de la seva creació, el maig de 2008, el projecte compta amb unes 265 pàgines de llibre editades en versió catalana, i amb unes 29.462 en versió anglesa.&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; 
	
Wikimedia, fundació sense ànim de lucre, portà a terme la creació d’aquest projecte mitjançant MediaWiki, wiki fet sobre la base de programari lliure.

El projecte consisteix en l’acolliment i la creació de llibres de text amb llicència lliure. L’objectiu principal de la fundació és la contribució a la lliure circulació i disposició de textos escolars, acadèmics, així com tots els textos considerats material educatiu i d’aprenentatge.

Els wikibooks compten amb les característiques pròpies de l’eina wiki i, per tant, amb els avantatges que la redacció col·laborativa de textos anteriorment descrits suposen per al camp educatiu.

En aquest sentit, el fet que els alumnes elaborin textos amb un caràcter públic i obert, representa un element de motivació afegit que influeix directament en la reflexió, la revisió i el seguiment de l’estructura i el contingut del text. D’altra banda, aquest fet té una incidència directa en l’atenció comunicativa, lingüística i textual que l’alumne diposita durant el procés d’elaboració del text. 

És una eina, per tant, que obre una nova perspectiva en l’ensenyament i l’aprenentatge de diferents textos, i, per tant, és excel·lent en el camp de la literatura. 

Quant a termes d’aprenentatge, és mínimament necessari que els alumnes disposin d’un cert nivell d’expressió escrita, la qual cosa fa que el seu àmbit educatiu idoni sigui la secundària. D’altra banda, tot i que les eines d’edició són força elementals, el fet que sigui necessària una certa habilitat informàtica, fa, així mateix, que el seu camp idoni d’aplicació sigui l’educació secundària.

'''3. PROCÉS D'ELABORACIÓ D'UN ''WIKIBOOK'' PER A L'ÀMBIT EDUCATIU'''
----

'''3.1. L'edició de ''wikibooks'''''

Els motius pels quals s’editen ''wikibooks'' són diversos, però, en general, el denominador comú rau en el fet de compartir el coneixement amb altres persones sobre una matèria concreta. En el cas que ens ocupa, aquesta edició ha de tenir en compte, d’una banda, l’adequació a la gramàtica, és a dir, l’adequació del text a les normes gramaticals, utilitzant els materials lingüístics –diccionaris i gramàtiques– corresponents i altres fonts de consulta, i de l’altra, l’adequació a la situació comunicativa, tenint en compte l’emissor, les característiques del missatge i el tipus de destinataris. Alhora, des d’un punt de vista tècnic, cal decidir quina eina wiki serà la base sobre la qual crearem un ''wikibook'' o en modificarem un d’existent.

'''3.1.1. Procés d'edició'''

Des d’un punt de vista lingüístic, abans d’escriure un ''wikibook'', hem de fer una anàlisi de la situació comunicativa. Primer, cal tenir en compte els destinataris i decidir tenint en compte quin ha de ser el grau de formalitat; la tria lèxica i terminològica cal fer (no és el mateix escriure per a alumnes de primària que de secundària), entre d’altres. Segon, cal considerar què és el que volem comunicar amb el text. Quin és el missatge o tema. Tercer, hem de saber quin l’objectiu del text (es tracta d’un text descriptiu, explicatiu, narratiu, informatiu, etc. Finalment, hem de tenir en compte la manera en què ho volem escriure segons els paràmetres citats, i per això és rellevant l’extensió (a vegades, hem de fer un esforç de síntesi i de condensació; d’altres de desenvolupament d’idees i d’argumentació), i l’estructura, que variarà segons el tipus de text i ha de facilitar-ne la lectura.

En concret, quan escrivim en suport wiki, hem de valorar que la informació ha de ser breu (descartar elements superflus); adequada (amb estil, plantejament i to homogenis); ordenada (l’usuari l’ha de captar sense gaire esforç); i al mateix temps, correcta, atractiva (ha d’atreure l’atenció i orientar); completa i fiable. En aquest tipus de suport, és important buscar la claredat i la concisió; el text ha de ser fàcil de consultar; els enllaços han de ser vius; cal reduir les càrregues cognitives i buscar la màxima correcció possible.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  

Des del punt de vista tècnic, des de la creació del WikiWikiWeb, s’han desenvolupat moltes eines wiki, normalment de codi obert, cosa que ha permès els administradors de webs crear les seves propis wikis. Aquestes eines wiki varien pel que fa a les seves característiques, facilitat d’instal·lació, i també pel que fa a la sintaxi i a la semàntica.
Els wikis són una eina fàcilment aplicable en el camp de l’ensenyament perquè només no requereixen grans coneixements de programació, i és fàcil utilitzar-les. Els usuaris poden crear contingut (articles, manuals i altres documents) independentment de la resta d’usuaris. El format del text és fàcil d’usar, normalment tenen un llenguatge de marques (''markup language'') que pot ser HTLM o una sintaxi alternativa, que ajuda a evitar el vandalisme i també que l’edició sigui més fàcil. Normalment és possible utilitzar diferents tipus de lletra (negreta, cursiva, etc.) de manera que el format és senzill.
Les pàgines wiki van identificades en el llenguatge de marques per un identificador, format per paraules juntes, sense espais separades per inicials majúscules (''camel case''). Qualsevol d’aquests identificadors de la pàgina crea enllaços a altres pàgines internes del wiki, de manera que navegar-hi és fàcil. La majoria d’eines wiki també tenen un botó de cerca per cercar les seves pàgines. Si se segueix l’enllaç a una pàgina no existent sovint això permet editar el contingut de la pàgina, i crear per tant una altra pàgina. Alhora també és possible la connexió amb altres wikis, per mitjà d’enllaços externs a documents o altres URL. Els wikis són un mitjà d’hipertext, que tenen estructures de navegació no lineal. Cada pàgina conté un gran nombre de vincles a altres pàgines, i normalment hi ha pàgines de navegació jeràrquica.

Algunes eines wikis permeten inserir-hi imatges o baixar-se fitxers directament al wiki. Un altra característica és la versió de control que permet als usuaris guardar i recuperar versions prèvies de les pàgines editades (vegeu l’apartat 3.1.2). D’altra banda, una característica molt necessària en el wiki com a sistema col·laboratiu és protegir automàticament de les edicions simultànies del mateix document, propietat que disposen la majoria de wikis. També és molt útil rebre un avís automàtic per correu electrònic quan un usuari modifica un document per veure’n les diferències amb la versió anterior.

Tenint en compte que ens situem en el marc escolar, el programari wiki que s’adequa més a aquest àmbit hauria de ser lliure i de codi obert (moltes wiki són de codi obert i n’hi ha algunes de gratuïtes), perquè puguem utilitzar el programa amb qualsevol finalitat i adaptar-lo a les nostres objectius; i sobretot perquè, gràcies a l’accés al codi font obert podem fer modificacions. De l’altra, el programari ha de ser gratuït. En l’àmbit de l’escola pública, aquest requisit és indispensable.

Hi ha alguns llocs web que ofereixen comparacions de programari wiki segons diferents paràmetres com ara Wikimatrix &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, així com una taula compartiva que hi ha a Wikimedia.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;small&gt;3. Vegeu l'article &quot;Algunas claves para escribir en la web&quot;: http://www.emergia.net/investigacion/articulos/001001.htm.
4. http://www.wikimatrix.org.
5. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_software.&lt;/small&gt;

'''3.1.2. Seguiment de les edicions'''

A fi de fer el seguiment de les edicions, hi ha una llista que guarda els canvis recents i el nom dels editors, que es tracta d’una relació de canvis ordenada amb els canvis més recents al capdavant, de manera que el professorat no ha de demanar a l’alumne que activi cap casella especial en començar un document nou, com passa amb l’ofimàtica.

El codi font del projecte s’ubica en un servidor centralitzat, el qual gestiona un programari de gestió de versions. Aquests sistemes de control de versions són la columna vertebral del projecte: són sistemes que assenyalen les diferents versions del codi font per identificar-les posteriorment, faciliten la feina en paral·lel de grups d’usuaris, indiquen l’evolució dels diferents mòduls del projecte i disposen d’un control detallat dels canvis que s’hi han fet. Totes aquestes funcions són indispensables durant la vida del projecte, i especialment en l’àmbit escolar (vegeu l’apartat 4.2.). Aquestes sistemes no solament tenen aplicació en el desenvolupament del programari, sinó que, a més, són àmpliament utilitzats en la creació d’aquesta eina col·laborativa, que pot requerir treballar de manera simultània amb diverses persones. El CVS (''concurrent versions system'')&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; és el programa més utilitzat en programari lliure per al control de versions de programari, i l’utilitzen projectes com ara Mozilla, l’Oppenoffice.org, el KDE o el GNOME, per esmentar-ne només uns quants.

&lt;sup&gt;6. http://www.cvshome.org&lt;/sup&gt;
	
'''3.1.3. Contribució a un wikibook existent i creació d’un nou wikibook'''

Tot i que en general el primer impuls dels docents és editar un ''wikibook'' de bell nou, és possible que ja hi hagi un ''wikibook'' amb una matèria i uns objectius similars al projecte que volem desenvolupar amb els alumnes i que només hàgim d’editar mínimament per adaptar-lo als nostres destinataris. Per tant, abans crear un ''wikibook'', cal que ens assegurem que no n’hi ha cap que puguem fer servir.

Actualment hi ha molts llocs web, per exemple, Wikibooks, que disposen de molts llibres sobre diferents matèries adreçats a diferents edats. El problema és que la versió catalana encara no disposa de prou matèries ni de cap validació qualitativa en comparació amb l’anglesa (vegeu l’apartat 2.2). Així que probablment un professor de literatura catalana a secundària haurà d’iniciar la creació d’un nou ''wikibook'' (vegeu l’apartat 5).
		
'''3.1.4. Localització de wikibooks'''

A fi que altres persones puguin localitzar fàcilment el ''wikibook'' que hem editat, cal que la informació estigui emmagatzemada correctament perquè sigui fàcilment recuperable. Així, Wikibooks, per exemple, ha creat diverses maneres de cercar els llibres de text que es creen mitjançant el botó de cerca, de manera que es fa una valoració col·lectiva de la qualitat dels llibres de text en què la comunitat sencera hi té la última paraula.

'''3.2.	L’administració de wikibooks'''

Els administradors són antics usuaris o editors de ''wikibooks'', que han adquirit l’experiència suficient i s’han centrat no només en el seu propi projecte, sinó que han col·laborat  activament en els diversos projectes de llibres basats en l’eina wiki; per tant, són persones que s’han guanyat la confiança de la tota la comunitat d’usuaris de ''wikibooks''. Com es pot veure, s’apica un sistema meritocràtic mitjançant el qual els responsbles són escollits segons la feina que han aportat al projecte.

Els responsables del projecte en l’eina wiki han de prendre la decisió com ara acceptar o no una contribució externa concreta a un projecte –com ara la correcció d’un error de contingut o de forma– o decidir quins errors és imprescindible corregir abans d’alliberar una nova versió.

'''3.2.1. Supressió i recuperació d’informació'''
L’última decisió d’esborrar o recuperar una pàgina o un llibre concrets recau exclusivament en la figura de l’administrador. Ara bé, algunes decisions se sotmeten a votació prèvia de tota la comunitat que, si bé no són vinculants, si que donen compte del parer de la comunitat.

 3.2.1.1. Supressió d’informació

La supressió d’informació és una tasca que ha d’haver passat per un procés previ de reflexió. Hi ha dues maneres per tal de suprimir informació: d’una banda, quan el llibre o una pàgina concreta no compleixen els criteris del projecte de què es tracti, la comunitat discuteix la conveniència d’esborrar-les. Encara que la comunitat voti a favor del manteniment d’una pàgina, l’administrador pot optar per esborrar-la si hi ha uns motius sòlids al darrere. De l’altra, hi ha les supressions de pàgines per la via ràpida, les que no estan sotmeses a votació, sinó que s’han d’esborrar ràpidament perquè infringeixen de manera flagrant els objectius del projecte.

 3.2.1.2. Recuperació d’informació

Hi ha mecanismes per recuperar la informació en cas que una pàgina s’hagi esborrat per error, o algun membre de la comunitat vulgui tornar a sotmetre a debat perquè es revisi la decisió d’esborrar una pàgina concreta. Si la comunitat decideix, per mitjà del sistema de vots, recuperar una pàgina o un ''wikibook'' sencer, normalment l’administrador té l’opció de recuperar-la si ho jutja pertinent.

'''3.2.2. Fiabilitat i detecció d’errades'''

Atesa la finalitat i els destinataris que tenen els ''wikibooks'' en el nostre projecte, és molt important que siguin fiables, atès que serà un material d’aprenentatge per als alumnes. Per garantir que els ''wikibooks'' siguin fiables, s’esmentaran una sèrie de criteris per avaluar-ne la fiabilitat.

a) autoria

b) procedència de la font

c) objectivitat (punt de vista)

d) públic al qual s’adreça (en el cas dels professors, cal que verifiquin que s’adrecen a alumnes de secundària)

d) correcció del contingut (possibilitat de verificació de les dades)

e) correcció lingüística (sovint la descurança en l’escriptura genera desconfiança envers el contingut)

f) referència a altres fonts

g) data d’actualització

Un aspecte central en qualsevol projecte de ''wikibooks'' basats en programari lliure és la gestió i el seguiment dels errors. Cal disposar d’una aplicació de gestió via web que permeti la interacció entre usuaris i desenvolupadors. Bugzilla&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, que inicialment va ser els sistema de gestió i seguiment d’errors de Mozilla, però amb el temps ha estat adoptat per projectes lliures com ara KDE, GNOME i Oppenoffice.org, entre d’altres. Bugzilla permet als usuaris enviar errors i en facilita la classificació, l’assignador a un desenvolupador perquè els resolgui i fa el seguiment de totes les incidències relacionades.

Els ''wikibooks'' normalment disposen de documentació com ara manuals d’ús o recopilatoris de preguntes més freqüents.

'''4. APLICABILITAT DELS WIKIBOOKS EN L'ENSENYAMENT I L'APRENENTATGE DE LA LITERATURA A SECUNDÀRIA'''
----

'''4.1. Avantatges'''

Les eines relacionades amb el treball col·laboratiu, com els ''wikibooks'', faciliten l’adquisició de l’aprenentatge significatiu que tant reclama l’ensenyament actual. És en aquest sentit que els ''wikibooks'' poden oferir grans possibilitats a l’aula de literatura de secundària (ESO i batxillerat), ja que els alumnes poden intervenir de forma activa junt amb el professor, tant en la realització de tasques com en la creació de continguts. A més, cal tenir en compte que l’eina emprada, Internet, és un gran atractiu de la nostra societat, i això permet que predisposi l’alumnat, i també el professorat, a participar enèrgicament en el procés d’ensenyament i d’aprenentatge.

Per entendre millor els avantatges de l’aplicació dels ''wikibooks'' en aquest àmbit cal centrar-se en els aspectes següents: 

a)	&lt;u&gt;Treball i aprenentatge col·laboratiu&lt;/u&gt;
El procés actual d’ensenyament i aprenentatge cada cop es distancia més del que és clàssic o repetitiu, i es basa en la transmissió de contingut de forma més aviat memorística. Els avenços en la metodologia d’ensenyament donen molta importància a l’aprenentatge significatiu, que considera fonamental que l’alumne estigui motivat.

L’ús dels ''wikibooks'' a l’aula pot contribuir a motivar l’alumnat, ja que aquest sol estar molt familiaritzat amb les noves tecnologies durant el seu temps d’oci. Es tracta, doncs, d’extrapolar l’ús de l’ordinador i d’Internet més enllà del joc i atribuir-los una capacitat educativa a l’aula, que pot resultar més atractiva per a l’alumnat que altres mètodes més tradicionals, com per exemple, els treballs individuals fets a casa o activitats amb fotocòpies, entre d’altres.

El professor pot crear un ''wikibook'' de l’assignatura per tal que els alumnes hi desenvolupin diferents tipus d’activitats; treballs en grup de forma asincrònica, edició de la informació sobre el tema de literatura que s’està treballant simultàniament a classe, etc. Aquesta eina permet dur a terme un treball col·laboratiu en què els alumnes es poden implicar en l’elaboració de continguts i responsabilitzar de diferents tasques mitjançant rols atribuïts pel professor o triats per ells mateixos.

Per tant, pot esdevenir una bona eina interactiva, gràcies a la qual els coneixements del professor i dels alumnes estan a disposició de tothom i en què cadascú pot participar segons les seves capacitats individuals: “Las Web 2.0 son sitios web, que desde el punto de vista educativo, permiten crear un espacio de trabajo colaborativo y participativo, rompiendo así la jerarquización y la unidireccionalidad del aprendizaje. Se supera el espacio reducido del aula donde se había desarrollado hasta ahora la educación posibilitando la idea de la escuela en Internet. Favorecen un tipo de aprendizaje colaborativo donde el conocimiento se construye entre todos los participantes, y donde los profesores y los alumnos adoptan nuevos roles.”&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;

b)	&lt;u&gt;Espai lliure per escriure&lt;/u&gt;
Aquesta eina permet disposar d’un espai en què tant els alumnes com els professors poden crear el contingut a partir dels seus coneixements. A més, un avantatge molt interessant i productiu és el fet que es pugui debatre lliurement sobre el tema que s’està tractant a classe. Exposar dubtes, fer aclariments o suggeriments sobre la literatura, fer comentaris sobre les lectures, compartir fonts d’informació o ampliar continguts a partir de l’experiència pròpia permet facilitar l’aprenentatge i crear un contingut didàctic molt dinàmic i atractiu. Per tant, la figura principal de l’assignatura no només és el professor, sinó que els alumnes prenen un paper molt actiu i, d’aquesta manera, s’impliquen més en la matèria i és més fàcil que duguin a terme un bon aprenentatge. 

D’altra banda, el professorat molts cops troba inconvenients en els llibres de text tradicionals (editats en paper), ja que el contingut és estàtic i de vegades no s’adapta a la metodologia que es vol aplicar a classe. El ''wikibook'' ofereix la possibilitat d’ampliar o complementar aquestes mancances, i així millorar el material de l’assignatura. 

c)	&lt;u&gt;Asincronia i revisió de l’historial&lt;/u&gt;
La asincronia que caracteritza els ''wikibooks'' permet que el treball col·laboratiu que s’hi du a terme, ensenyament-aprenentatge, no estigui limitat per horaris ni espais concrets. Així, l’alumnat també pot fer consultes i aportacions fora de l’espai i l’horari de classe.

Atès que totes les modificacions queden registrades a l’historial, el professor pot utilitzar el ''wikibook'' com una activitat d’avaluació. Les intervencions dels alumnes, els continguts i els dubtes que aporten mostren part de l’aprenentatge que estan realitzant i, per tant, això es pot tenir en compte dins l’avaluació de l’assignatura. Per exemple, comentaris de poemes en què cadascun analitza les figures retòriques que hi troba, activitats relacionades amb moviments literaris o autors, etc.

d)	Atenció a la diversitat
Un altre aspecte molt important que cal tenir en compte és la diversitat a l’aula. Aproximadament un 2,2% de l’alumnat té necessitats educatives especials (NEE)&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;,  i això implica una adaptació curricular en tots els àmbits educatius. Molts cops els llibres de text tradicionals no s’adapten a aquesta situació o, si més no, no s’adapten als casos concrets de l’aula. Els ''wikibooks'', doncs, poden ajudar el professor a crear activitats específiques per a aquests alumnes i, d’aquesta manera, facilitar-ne l’aprenentatge. A més, “en el aprendizaje colaborativo los alumnos trabajan en grupos heterogéneos para apoyar el aprendizaje individual de los miembros del grupo.”&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

'''4.2.	  Inconvenients'''
        
Tot i que en un primer moment sembla ser que el ''wikibook'' és una eina que ofereix grans possibilitats dins el món de la docència, cal esbrinar també quins són els seus inconvenients i d’aquesta manera, el professorat pot decidir si vol treballar amb un ''wiki'' a l’aula o no.

Primerament, caldria diferenciar dos tipus d’inconvenients: els que tenen a veure amb la tecnologia ''wiki'', i que per tant són de caràcter tècnic i els desavantatges didàctics que comporta l’ús dels ''wikibooks'' en l’àmbit educatiu.

  INCONVENIENTS TÈCNICS
	
- A l’hora d’editar un ''wikibook'' ens adonem que un dels punts febles és pressuposar que cada alumne té ordinador amb Internet a casa, o que es disposa de suficients ordinadors connectats a la xarxa a l’escola.

- L’eina ''wiki'' no permet que els usuaris editin el ''wikibook'' alhora, per tant si molts alumnes treballen al mateix temps, es destorben, i això provoca molestos temps d’espera.

- Malgrat que es poden anul·lar resultats de vandalisme i que es pot usar un ''wiki'' protegit, no es pot evitar del tot el perill del vandalisme. Tot el que es publica en un ''wiki'' pot ser esmenat, ampliat, reutilitzat i, fins i tot, esborrat per qualsevol visitant anònim. Ara bé, hi sol haver una aplicació de gestió i seguiment dels errors (vegeu 3.1.2).

- Cal anar en compte amb el contingut que es publica en el ''wikibook'', ja que fàcilment es pot inserir material que violi els drets d’autoria.

- Els ''wikis'' són només gestors de text; i, a més, resulta força complex enllaçar-los amb altres projectes.


  INCONVENIENTS DIDÀCTICS

- El treball d’elaboració d’un ''wikibook'' requereix un gran esforç organitzatiu per part del professor. Pot donar-se el cas que el professorat consideri que aquest projecte tan innovador els suposa una sobrecàrrega i un excés de feina.

- La creació d’un ''wikibook'' a l’aula comporta que els continguts que s’editen poden estar farcits d’errors que els mateixos alumnes no reconeixen i que es graven a la memòria. D’aquí s’esdevé que els continguts del wikibook han de revisar-se i controlar-se permanentment, i això encara és més feina per al professor.

- Pel que fa al treball col·laboratiu que es desprèn d’un ''wikibook'' no ens oblidem que el fet de treballar de manera conjunta i participativa pot resultar caòtic, pel fet que cadascú té el seu propi estil i les seves pròpies idees; a més a més si la classe és nombrosa, posar-se d’acord i trobar una versió de conjunt pot ser una tasca força complicada.

- Podem trobar-nos amb alumnes que presenten mancances lingüístiques i/o mediàtiques que no gosen escriure en un ''wiki'' perquè els fa por que els seus errors siguin vistos per tothom.

- Ens trobem davant el fet que l’aplicació i l’ús del ''wikibook'' en l’àmbit educatiu es troba encara en una fase inicial i que falta molt de camí per recórrer. Actualment, hi ha poques propostes educatives fonamentades en la tecnologia ''wiki'', cosa que en dificulta encara més l’aplicabilitat dins l’aula.

Before moving on, we must be introduced to some basic structures at the heart of Hebrew grammar, without which we cannot proceed. This lesson is quite theoretic, so pay attention.

==Roots==

All nouns and verbs in Hebrew stem from sequences of consonants or radicals, known as '''roots'''. Adding letters before, after and between the consonants form the words. The roots would almost always have 3 consonants, although roots of 4 and 2 exist as well.

All the letters of the Hebrew alphabet can be radicals, even the vowels letters {{Hebrew|א ,ו}} and {{Hebrew|י}}.  

Hebrew has set “moulds” in which the roots may be inserted. One noun we learned, {{Hebrew|מספר}}, is stemmed from the root {{Hebrew|ס-פ-ר}} and is in the ''miqttal'' mould. The word {{Hebrew|מִגְדָּל}}, while also formed in the ''miqttal'' mould, is stemmed from the root {{Hebrew|ג-ד-ל}}. 

The more ancient and traditional nouns do not follow any structured mould. For instance, the word {{Hebrew|סֵפֶר}}, while also formed from the root {{Hebrew|ס-פ-ר}}, has no noun mould it fits. 

Roots have general meaning related to the words they form. For instance, the root {{Hebrew|כ-ת-ב}} has the general meaning of “writing”, so {{Hebrew|כְּתַב}} means “handwriting”, {{Hebrew|כַּתָּבָה}} means “[news] article” and {{Hebrew|מִכְתָּב}} means “[postal] letter”. Some roots have more than one meaning; the root {{Hebrew|ס-פ-ר}} could mean “count”, “tell” and “haircut”.

It is also important to maintain the correct sequence of the consonants, as these change the meaning altogether. The root {{Hebrew|ג-ד-ל}} means “grow”, {{Hebrew|ד-ל-ג}} means “skip”, {{Hebrew|ג-ל-ד}} means “heal [wounds]” and {{Hebrew|ד-ג-ל}} means “supporting [an idea]/raising a banner”.

==Prefixes==

In the previous lesson we learned the definite article, {{Hebrew|הַ}}, and that it is attached directly to a word. In modern Hebrew there are 8 prefixes, of which only 6 are used. We have learned one already, the definite article. For all of them there are grammatical rules as to which vowel following the prefix should be used, but they are ignored by Israelis.

The sixth prefix, {{Hebrew|שֶׁ}}, will be discussed in future lessons.

===Conjunctions===   

====Vav====

The conjunction “and” appears in Hebrew as Vav with shva na‘ {{Hebrew|וְ}}.

'''Examples'''
* A number
: {{Hebrew|מספר}}
* Peace (''shalom'') &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;and&lt;/font&gt; a number
: {{Hebrew|שלום}} &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;{{Hebrew|וְ}}&lt;/font&gt;{{Hebrew|מספר}}

===Prepositions===

====Bet====

The preposition “in” appears in Hebrew as Bet with shva na‘ {{Hebrew|בְּ}}.

'''Examples'''
* A number
: {{Hebrew|מספר}}
* &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;In&lt;/font&gt; a number
: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;{{Hebrew|בְּ}}&lt;/font&gt;{{Hebrew|מספר}}

====Lamed====

The preposition “to” is denoted as Lamed with shva na‘ {{Hebrew|לְ}}, just as “in”. 

'''Examples'''
* A number
: {{Hebrew|מספר}}
* &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;To&lt;/font&gt; a number
: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;{{Hebrew|לְ}}&lt;/font&gt;{{Hebrew|מספר}}

====Mem====

The preposition “from” is formed by the prefix Mem with tsere or ħiriq {{Hebrew|מֵ/מִ}}.

'''Examples'''
* A number
: {{Hebrew|מספר}}
* &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;From&lt;/font&gt; a number
: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;{{Hebrew|מִ}}&lt;/font&gt;{{Hebrew|מספר}}

===Prefixes + Definite Article===

The prefixes {{Hebrew|בְּ}} and {{Hebrew|לְ}} are contracted with the definite article to form {{Hebrew|בַּ}} and {{Hebrew|לַ}}, respectively. The other prefixes are added normally.

'''Examples'''
* In a number
: {{Hebrew|בְּמספר}}
* In &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;the&lt;/font&gt; number
: {{Hebrew|בּ}}&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;{{Hebrew|ַ}}&lt;/font&gt;{{Hebrew|מספר}}
* And &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;the&lt;/font&gt; number
: {{Hebrew|וְ}}&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;{{Hebrew|הַ}}&lt;/font&gt;{{Hebrew|מספר}}

==Introduction to Plurals==
You've already learned Hebrew has two genders: masculine and feminine. But so far you have only learned singular nouns.

Generally, the plurals are formed by adding {{Hebrew|-ִים}} to masculine nouns, and {{Hebrew|-וֹת}} to feminine nouns. 

'''Examples'''
* A number
: {{Hebrew|מספר}} ''m''
* Number&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;s&lt;/font&gt;
: {{Hebrew|מספר}}&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;{{Hebrew|ִים}}&lt;/font&gt;

There are some irregulars, however:

{| {{Hebrew table|Vocabulary|דִּקְדּוּק בְּסִיסִי|Pluralization|רִבּוּי|3}}
! English
! עִבְרִית sg.
! עִבְרִית pl.
|-
| Day
| {{Hebrew|יוֹם}}
| {{Hebrew|'''יָ'''מִים}}
|-
| Girl
| {{Hebrew|בַּת}}
| {{Hebrew|בָּ'''נ'''וֹת}}
|-
| Woman
| {{Hebrew|אִשָּׁה}}
| {{Hebrew|'''נָ'''שִׁ'''ים'''}}
|}

We will learn how to make complex pluralizations in future lessons, and the irregular nouns.

==Summary==
In this lesson, you have learned:
* Roots.
* Prefixes in Hebrew ({{Hebrew|בְּ}}).
* Basic pluralization.
Practice what you've learned in the [[Hebrew/Exercises/Basic 3|exercises]].

Throughout my life I have found myself explaining things and teaching others by request of the teacher or by pure chance of the situation. When I realized that I needed a profession to back up my passion for writing, becoming a teacher was the first thin that came to mind. Through the various child related jobs I have had since I started on my quest to become a teacher I have also learned that I tend to relate better to them and thus can communicate concepts to them better than other adults I have worked with… I actually tend to be able to communicate with the children much better than I can with the adults -_-!

Either way, I am somewhat of a Humanism/ Existentialism with a little Constructivism and Essentialism thrown in. I believe that students should have some control of what they learn, but they also need to learn a set of basics so that they can critically think about what they encounter in the world, understand the history of things, and of course communicate. I like the idea of Project Based Learning, but also understand that this learning style isn't for everyone and that the classroom will most likely be an uncontrollable element. Thus, I believe in striving to utilize as many different techniques as I can so I can better teach a variety of students and also help them learn how to handle different teaching styles because not all teachers they face in life will probably teach using the method they learn best from.</text>

Another [[Cookbook:Venison|venison]] chili (see also [[Cookbook:Pedernales_River_Chili|Pedernales_River_Chili]]). I have made this successfully with [[w:Roe Deer|roe deer]], [[w:Muntjac|muntjac]] and [[w:Springbok_%28antelope%29|springbok]].

==Ingredients==
*250[[Cookbook:g|g]] (½[[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*0-5 cloves of finely chopped [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] (to taste)
*1-5 tsp Cayenne Pepper (to taste - 5 is quite hot) &amp; 4 tsp Paprika or other milder powdered chile
(or your own choice of hot and/or mild fresh chiles deseeded and finely chopped)
*5 Tsp Ground Cumin
(Possibly small quantities of cinammon, ground cloves and/or mace - experiment for yourself)
*30[[Cookbook:ML|ml]] (2[[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]]) [[Cookbook:Olive_Oil|olive]], [[Cookbook:Corn_Oil|corn]] or [[Cookbook:Sunflower_Oil|sunflower oil]] (according to taste)
*500[[Cookbook:g|g]] (1.1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) minced (ground) stewing venison (minced lean leftovers from trimming are ideal)
*500[[Cookbook:ML|ml]] Dry [[Cookbook:Cider|cider]] or [[Cookbook:Stock|beef stock]] (how much you will need depends on how fast it boils away)
*60[[Cookbook:ML|ml]] (4[[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]]) [[Cookbook:Tomato_Paste|tomato purée]]
*250[[Cookbook:g|g]] (½[[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) finely grated [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]]
*150[[Cookbook:g|g]] (6[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]]) finely chopped [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
*5 [[Cookbook:Bay_Leaf|bay leaves]]
*30[[Cookbook:ML|ml]] (2[[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]]) [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
*350[[Cookbook:g|g]] (¾[[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) red [[Cookbook:Kidney_Bean|kidney beans]] (1 can - drained - not if you're a Texan)
*1 stock cube (optional - see procedure), salt

==Procedure==
#Sauté the onions, chiles (if used) and garlic in the oil until well softened.
#Add the powdered spices and cook for about 60 seconds.
#Add the venison and stir well until it has all (more or less) changed colour.
#Add sufficient dry cider or stock to cover, but not too deeply.
#Add the stock cube (only if you are using cider), bay leaves, chopped celery, grated carrot and tomato purée, and stir well.
#Simmer very gently for at least three hours, stirring occasionally and replenishing the liquid (with more cider/wine/stock or just water) if it gets too dry. The ideal is to have the sauce with little separate liquid when it is served - but not dry enough to scorch. It may be simmered on top of the stove, or in a very low oven, or in a slow cooker. The sauce is edible after about 40 minutes but is infinitely better flavoured and textured after three or four hours. In a slow cooker it can be cooked for eight hours. The flavour is even better if it is cooked, allowed to cool overnight, and reheated for 30 or 40 minutes but this is a council of perfection and not really necessary.
#About 30-40 minutes before serving remove the bay leaves, add the oregano and the beans (if you're not Texan) and stir well. [Dried kidney beans are so indigestible as to be considered poisonous unless they are boiled briskly (a slow cooker will not do) for at least twenty minutes to destroy the indigestible [[W:Phytohaemagglutinin|phytohaemagglutinin]] that they contain. If you do use dried kidney beans they must be soaked overnight and then boiled by themselves for at least twenty minutes. They are then added to the chili early enough to cook for at least two hours. All this is tedious - it is therefore much better to use tinned ones as suggested in this recipe.]
#Adjust the salt (i.e. taste the chili and add more salt if you think it needs it), stir well and cook for another 40 minutes.
#Serve with long-grain rice, or however else you like to serve chili.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you've worked through the previous tutorial this one is fairly simple.  If you haven't go back and do the previous one since this tutorial will use many of the same steps.

The first part is do the research.  How high should the box be on a three plank wagon?

Having found out this critical nugget of information the rest is fairly easy.  For the moment we will assume this to be 2'3&quot;.

We open the basic plank wagon in GMAX.

[[Image:wagon1.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:wagon1.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

The box currently is the wrong height but GMAX allows us to select parts and scale them.  So our first task is to create a box the correct height to measure the wagon against.  Note this image is quite busy.  First we need to be in a top view so click off the model in top (1).  We may need to bring the wagon into view so use the button at the end of arrow 2.  To increase the size click on the button at the end of arrow 3 then draw a square around the detail you wish to see.  First verify we are using the creation tab 4 .  To create the box click on box at the end of arrow 5, and enter the dimensions by keyboard entry (6) and make sure we put the height in correctly (7) before clicking on the create button below.

[[Image:wagon4.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:wagon4.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Having created our box we need to move it upwards to the height of the wagon floor so we can see how far to scale our existing wagon top.

[[Image:wagon3.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:wagon3.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

We press H to select the Wagon group.  Ungroup it and use H again to select [top].  Now right click the scale button at the top and we'll adjust the Z value to reduce the height.  The original wagon was four feet high and we want to lower this to two feet three inches so we can get a calculator out or just make approximate guesses.

[[Image:wagon2.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:wagon2.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Unfortunately the scaling has also raised the top from the base.  So we use the move button, the one with the four arrows on it to lower the top to the base.  We may find we need to adjust the scale once more.  Finally delete the box we created.

[[Image:wagon5.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:wagon5.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

We now have a wagon that is the correct height for a three plank wagon.  Note we still have to adjust the textures, create your three plank wagon textures then resize them so they are the size of the sides in the CS_skin.tga file. Then copy them over.

The export etc has already been covered in the previous tutorial that moved the wagon numbers.

We can use the same basic technique to make the wagon longer or wider note if you make the wagon twice as long the textures will be a better fit if you change the cs-skin.tga to be twice the width.  Note when making the wagon longer one technique is to group everything then scale everything longer.  The buffers usually need tidying up and you should adjust the position of a.limfront and a.limback so that they just touch the buffer plates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The sound of the word GMAX often strikes terror into the hearts of those who have struggled through tutorials then given up.  This tutorial takes you through the necessary steps and only the necessary steps to do modify the position of the numbers on the reskin of the basic plank wagon.

If you have any intention of doing serious work in GMAX please set up GMAX as per Paul Hobbs first GMAX tutorial.

To work in GMAX we need three files.  These are the GMAX source file and two texture files, one for the wagon and one for the numbers.  GMAX will want to know where they are so normally I keep all the files for a project together in one folder under the GMAX\mesh folder.  This part will use a Highland Railway loco coal wagon to demonstrate how to move the numbers.

The first step is to create a folder with the correct name under the GMAX\mesh folder.

[[File:v create folder.jpg]]

Now we need the GMAX source file so we need to extract it from cmp, note it is unusual to find the GMAX source files supplied in the model files on the DLS.  First we edit in explorer.

[[File:v edit in explorer.jpg]]

This gives us access to the files.

[[File:v basic wagon folder.jpg]]

The first file we want is the zip file containing the source.  Note Auran does not permit files of type .zip to be stored so it has been renamed to .txt file extension.  First we copy the file.

[[File:v copy.jpg]]

Then paste it into the new folder.

[[File:v paste.jpg]]

Repeat to get the texture.tga files form the body folder.

[[File:v body folder.jpg]]

Note we can collect two files at once by highlighting them both.

[[File:v textures.jpg]]

Then paste them into the new folder.

[[File:v paste.jpg]]

At this point you may wish to copy in your new cs_skin.tga file. 

[[File:v hr coal folder.jpg]]

To unzip the GMAX source first rename the file to a .zip extension.

[[File:v coal rename.jpg]]

Then unzip the file.

[[File:v unzipped.jpg]]

Now we open the GMAX source file in GMAX.  GMAX has two ways to show an object, one is wire mode, the other is Smooth Plus Highlights.  We need the Smooth Plus Highlights.  To change from one to the other right click the word in the top left hand corner then select the appropriate one.

[[File:gmax1a.jpg]]

It is probable that the texture file has not been found.

[[File:gmax1.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:gmax1.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

So we tell GMAX where the file is with the GMAX Material Navigator.  1 Click on the GMAX Material Navigator button, 2 then check the applied button, 3 finally click on the file we want to change. 

[[File:gmax2.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:gmax2.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Use the &quot;select bitmap image file&quot; window to select the image file we wish to use.

[[File:gmax3.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:gmax3.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Repeat for the other instances of the file name.

[[File:GMAX4.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:GMAX4.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Now we have our correctly textured wagon showing in GMAX.

[[File:gmax5.jpg]]

To show more detail select the quadrant we are interested in then press the &quot;W&quot; key.

[[File:gmax6.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:gmax6.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

For clarity a brown ssa.tga has been used.  We'll change it to the proper ssa.tga texture later on.  Now we want to select the number panel before moving it.  To do this press &quot;H&quot; then highlight the item (1) in this case number1 and press the select button (2).  You can click on the item directly but GMAX can interpret a mouse click as a command to both select and to move the object with unwanted results so use the H selection method to avoid this.

[[File:gmax7.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:gmax7.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Click on the blue arc tab to show which item we have selected.  This will also allow us to resize the panel with the wagon number on if required.

[[File:gmax8.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:gmax8.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

The next step after selecting the panel is to move it.  We click on the move icon with four arrows on it.  If you look carefully to the right of the icon you can see the letters X Y Z and xy these constrain movement in the those planes.  Z is up and down, Y is side to side, X is in and out.  With the xy constraint set as it is here we can move the panel about without fear that it will move further into or away from the wagon.  The panel can be moved either with the mouse or by changing the values in the Y and Y boxes at the bottom of the screen.  Do not touch the value in the X box, a value of 0 in the Y box means the number will be centered on the Y axis.

[[File:gmax9.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:gmax9.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Here we can see the panel has been moved into position note the value of Y.

[[File:gmax10.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:gmax10.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

In this case the wagon number panel wants to be slightly longer so we click on Plane, then adjust the value in width to 18&quot;.  This is often easier to see with the correct texture file.

[[File:gmax10a.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:gmax10a.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

The wagon with the correct texture file copied in place.

[[File:gmax11.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:gmax11.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Repeat using the Left view to adjust number2.

Finally we come to the export.  Trainz has its own preferred file format so to get Trainz to recognise our wagon we need to export it.  '''Make sure nothing is selected''' Then locate the export entry on the file menu.

[[File:gmax12.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:gmax12.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

We need to tell GMAX to create a file called body.im, one way is to simply type &quot;body.im&quot; in the save box.  This file is the close up or high detailed one for the lod.

[[File:gmax13.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:gmax13.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

After that we copy the .im files and tetxure.txt files into the appropriate folder in CMP.  Normally if you sort the folder by time you will want to copy the most recent files but not the .GMAX source.

[[File:w importing files into Trainz.jpg]]

[[File:w importing files into Trainz 2.jpg]]

We need to double check that the wagon points to our new texture group by editing the config.txt file if you haven't already done so.

[[File:bodytextures.jpg]]

Commit the changes and open up Trainz and we should find our new model.  View it from close up to view the detailed mesh and texture file.  Note the three different wagon numbers on display.

[[File:HR loco coal.jpg]]

This model uses lod or level of detail to assist performance.  Trainz selects the appropriate version depending how far away you are form the model.  You can control this but for the moment we'll simply create the lower detailed meshes and point them at smaller versions of the texture files.  So first double check we have the smaller versions of the texture file available.  

[[File:resize1a.jpg]]

[[File:resize2.jpg]]

[[File:resize3.jpg]]

And save as cs_skin_med.tga.

[[File:resize4.jpg]]

== Level of Detail steps ==

Then back into GMAX and open up our wagon.  The first step is to save the source under a different name.

[[File:lod 1.jpg]]

We add the letters &quot;med&quot; onto the end of the name.

[[File:lod 2.jpg]]

We are going to both reduce the polys and point to a smaller texture file but the first step is to ungroup group B which contains one of the details that we are going to detail. So use H to bring up the Select Objects and highlight B.

[[File:lod 3.jpg]]

Here we can see that there is buffer detail that can be seen close up but not from further away.  Note the vertical and horizontal arrows that show the centre of the object and the white lines around the object.

[[File:lod 4.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click to [[Media:lod 4.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

After the ungrouping we can see the buffer collar and buffer collar01 in the Select Objects which we will delete for the medium level of detail.  For the low level of  detail we will also delete the carriage bit and carriage bit 01.

[[File:lod 5.jpg]]

Select and press the delete key.

[[File:lod 6.jpg]]

Here you can see a minor detail has been deleted which won't be noticeable in the med lod.

[[File:lod 7.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:lod 7.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Now we need to point the mesh to the smaller texture file.  Click on the three balls for the GMAX Material Navigator.  reduce the selection by clicking Applied in browse form scene, (on the left), click on the first cs_skin to bring up the Material Editor and finally click on the bitmap to change the name of the file.  The same steps as we used when opening up GMAX for the first time to get the texture.

[[File:lod 8.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:lod 8.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Open the cs_skin_med.tga.  Repeat this step for the other two references to the CS_Skin.tga file file in the GMAX material editor.

[[File:lod 10.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:lod 10.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Finally we export the body_med.im file.

[[File:lod 11.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:lod 11.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Repeat these steps for the low version of the lod.

Copy the 
body_med.im
cs_skin_med.texture.txt
body_low.im
cs_skin_low.texture.txt
ssa.texture.txt
files from the mesh folder into the zrb_body folder as you did for the body.im file earlier.

Commit and your reskin is now complete.

== Reskinning Example ==

The example used here will take you through both reskinning and modifying the GMAX source of an existing model.

The basic wagon kuid2: 86627:1654:1 is more than just a basic wagon, it also contains a renamed zip file with alternative texture files and the GMAX meshes to enable to move the wagon numbers and to change it to a 2 plank, 3 plank, 6 plank etc. very easily.  It is also designed to be easy to change the length or change the bogey to one that uses a different height.  It has couplings, changeable wagon numbers, it can take air pipes or vacuum pipes, it can carry visible loads or bulk loads.  It is slightly more complicated to reskin but not that much.  You need to do six things, first clone the item and the texture group, second point the item to the new texture group, third do the reskin, fourth reskin the texture group, fifth adjust the wagon number position, finally do the lods.  It takes me about ten minutes once the reskin is done.

It one relies heavily on textures rather than the shape of the mesh for its effect.  All the textures are in one file which is good for performance and it has lod.   It is also scripted for couplings, Chameleon for the wagon numbers and is capable of using vacuum pipes.  The texture file is modified from one created by Paul Hobbs.  The GMAX source and some alternative tga files are included in wagonzip.txt, just change the file extension to zip and unzip it, this allows you to make modifications to the wagon or adjust the position and size of the wagon numbers.

First step is to download kuid 86627:1654 with its texture group kuid 86627:1657 from the DLS. Please note these kuids may still be in the process of being uploaded.  

Then if using TC we clone the item in CMP.

[[File:clone.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:clone.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

This basically assigns one of your kuids to the cloned item.  Now we open the file in edit in explorer.

[[File:edit in explorer.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:edit in explorer.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

In this example we can see a number of folders and by convention we are interested in the body folder.

{{center|[[File:bodyfolder.jpg]]}}

We can see a number of .tga files and generally speaking we are interested in the largest one, cs_skin.tga.  Note that this particular model as a couple of alternative cs_skin.tga files that have had their colours changed in a recent version of PaintShop Pro are available in the wagonzip.txt file in the parent folder.  To use them overwrite the cs_skin.tga with the appropriate one.
  
'''N.B. Do not unzip this file without copying it out of Trainz first or CMP will get upset.''' 

There are two other associated files with similar names in this example cs_skin_med.tga, and cs_skin_low.tga which are used by the two lower level lod.im files.

When we edit the file notice the two different sides and ends.  Also note the two squares in the top right that are used to colour parts of the buffers, if you are changing the colour then these must be changed also.

[[File:Paint shop pro shot 1.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:Paint shop pro shot 1.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

If you open the cs_skin_reskin.tga in the zip file you can see the sizes of these sides and ends.  For a photo reskin simply resize the side photo and end photos to these sizes and position them appropriately.  You will still need to change the colour of the two squares in the top right corner.

[[File:cs_skin_reskin.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:cs_skin_reskin.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

To change the colour of the wagon in Paintshop Pro Xi or later use the colour changer tool.

[[File:colour changer.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:colour changer.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

To add lettering use the letter tool seen here adding white lettering to the grey version of the cs_skin.tga file.

[[File:add text.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:add text.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

There are two other associated files with similar names in this example cs_skin_med.tga, and cs_skin_low.tga which are used by the two lower level lod.im files.  When you have finished your reskin resize the image by 50% and 50% to make the med then once again to make the low versions for the lod meshes.

[[File:resize1.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:resize1.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

[[File:resize 50%.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:resize 50%.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

This gives you the basic reskin.  This particular reskin uses changeable wagon numbers.  If they stay in the same place we just need to  reskin the numbers, if they need to be moved we will need to invoke GMAX.  To reskin the wagon numbers we edit the files in the texture group or kuid 86627:1657. The wagon numbers themselves are on a plane roughly one tenth of an inch above the model and this plane uses a separate texture file called in this case ssa.tga. 

The following example uses the texture files from a US Army boxcar to illustrate this found in &quot;25647 ssa.tga&quot; in the zip file.  Note the files ssa1.tga through ssa15.tga are used by Chameleon wherever ssa.tga is referenced.  So since we textured the wagon number with ssa.txt Chameleon replaces the wagon number texture with the appropriate ssa?.tga.

[[File:edit in box textures.jpg|center]]

One difficulty with wagon numbers is matching the typeface used so one technique is to crop them number off a photograph and then edit that to give a set of wagon numbers.  When we crop use the largest initial photograph available and if possible crop on a power of two so resizing is not required.  64 pixels by 16 pixels etc.  The planes can always be resized so that the cropped image matches the wagon.

[[File:ssa1.jpg|center]]

The first step is to copy the crop to a new image.

[[File:ssa2.jpg|center]]

Then paste a new copy twice to give us two images to play with.

[[File:ssa3.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:ssa3.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Next we cut a single digit out using the crop tool.

[[File:ssa4.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:ssa4.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

[[File:ssa5.jpg|center]]

Copy this, then activate the ssa1.tga image by clicking on the blue stripe above and paste as a new layer. 

[[File:ssa6.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:ssa6.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

[[File:ssa8.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:ssa8.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Now use the move tool (1) to position the digit where we want it to be (2).

[[File:ssa7.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:ssa7.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Finally we save the edited file using save as.

[[File:ssa9.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:ssa9.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Repeat the process to create ssa2.tga, ssa3.tga etc. each with a different number.

Moving the wagon numbers will be covered in the GMAX part.

There already is another [[Hebrew]] Wikibook. This book is a stub and hasn't been edited for more than half a year. [[User:Etams|Ētamš]] ([[User_talk:Etams|Talk]]  • [[Special:Contributions/Etams|Contribs]]) 19:26, 14 May 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' - Wikibooks allow more than one book on a subject to exist.

Yes there's nothing wrong with this book per se and there's no reason why two books on a particular topic can't coexist on Wikibooks but there is nothing really in this book and no reason why it needs to be separate.

The goal of this book is to create an open and freely editable manual and training guide for '''[[w:Autodesk Inventor|Autodesk Inventor]]'''.
 


Autodesk Inventor is a geometric modeling program that is used in Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) and is commonly used to teach students engineering principals in the PLTW curriculum.

'''The Basics'''
&lt;/big&gt;

I am a native of Virginia and love living here!  There are not too many areas where you can access the beach, the mountains, the city, and the country within only a few hours. I am an only child, but have a step-family that has given me wonderful nephews and neices with whom I love to spend my time. I have been working with children since I was 13 years old and still love to stimulate my imagination and that of others through play! 


&lt;big&gt;
'''Education Background'''
&lt;/big&gt;

I received a bachelor's degree in Human Services from Virginia Tech in 2004.  Following graduation, I began working for non-profit organizations as a child services coordinator/family case manager at homeless and domestic violence shelters.  I earned a master's degree in PreK-6 Education at [http://www.odu.edu Old Dominion University] in Dec. 2008. Now I am persuing a PhD in Curriculum and Instruction from ODU. I also work as a graduate assistant where I help to research, develop and implement student-written textbook efforts like [[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education|Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]], [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment|Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment]], and [[Foundations and Assessment of Education|Foundations and Assessment of Education]].  



[[File:Foundations team.jpg|500px]]

&lt;big&gt;

'''Hobbies and Interests'''
&lt;/big&gt;

I have been an active member of the American Poolplayers Association (APA) since 2003. I have played in the southwestern, northern, and southeastern regions of Virginia. 

Another passion of mine is live music and I have traveled the country to make this happen. I love taking road trips with friends especially on our way to a concert or music festival.</text>

My name's Tiffany and I am an ODU junior studying history education and political science. I hope to one day teach high school history and government. I love to travel and feel that those experiances are far more valuable than any book or class can teach.

I'm a very hands on person and feel I learn better when thrown into something and able to work it out myself rather than lectured. This translates over to my teaching style...

Especially in History, making the subject material fun and interesting is important to have successful students. Also, having students actively participate in activities and projects makes them feel more engaged in the classroom. Student-centered learning in which students are involved in every phase of their education is an important aspect of teaching, as traditional and routine lecturing doesn’t encourage social and educational growth. I feel students can learn best from each other and when I am a teacher, I hope to encourage such learning and activities.

You are a child of God: Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There is nothing enlightening about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.” – Nelson Mandela

== About Me ==
|-
|My name is Joseph and I am currently a student at Old Dominion.  I am studing Music Vocal Education and Music Composition.  I hope to teach at the collegiate level.  I love music and can't imaging my life without it, but at times I don't know why I choose to make music my life.
|-
| I have been involved in music since before I enter pre-school.  I started to sing at church in the third grade.  I performed my first solo in fifth grade and start playing musical instruments.  And started to write music around this time too.  [I use the term music loosely here as there was little notation and my hand writing was horrid]  I began my formal vocal training in my junior year of high school.  During this year I wrote and my first complete musical score.  My senior year I wrote a jazz piece for the jazz amsemble at my high school.  Unfortunately there was not time to perform it before the year ended.
|-
|Although music comsumed my life and my thoughts, I applied and was excepted to ODU as a biochemistry major.  Science has always fascinated me.  Before the end of the first semester, I knew that biochem. was not the science was not were I was ment to be.  I struggled with changing my major for the majority of the semester.  I remember and will always remember what made the decision for me.  When I asked my band teacher my senior why he made music his profession, he said that his high school teacher once asked him if he could ever imagine his life without music or ever imagine going through even a single day without playing a note.  My teacher, Mr. Noë, told me that his answer was and is no, he couldn't and can't imagine his life without music.  After he told me this he asked me if I could ever imagine my life without music.  I told me I didn't know. 
|-
|When I decided to change my major this question weighed on my mind heavily.  Finally i sat down and really tried to picture my life without music.  I could not do it.  Because of this I know that, in the words of Duke Ellington, &quot;music is my mistress&quot; (Ellington 1973).  My decision to become a teacher came later after I discovered teaching would allow me to help other people understand, appreciate, and hopefully share my passion, music. 
|-
|Since then, I have written non-stop and grown more excited about the start of my teaching career.  My only fear, so far, about becoming a teacher is my patience or my lacking of patience.  I hope that it will grow with my excitement over the next couple of years so that I will be able to be the type of teacher I've come to appreciate and admirer.

|-
|My teaching philosohpy does not involve any proper theories or anything like that and it is no where near formal.  I believe that my philosophy is simple.
|-
|~ Appeal to as many sense as possible incorporating the subject matter. (Sight, Sound, Touch, etc.)
|-
|When trying to engage more then one of the senses in the learning process, the issues such as gender, class size (to some extent), and background can be addressed because you teach in more then one approach. 
|-
|~ Focus on teaching concepts.
|-
|Although I do not especially like test a lot of the time because they test the ability of the student, it is hard to test in other wise especially in music.  In performance class there are few ways to test other then to test the abilities of the students playing their instruments.  However, if the instructor teachs the concepts of good musicianship (counting, posture, etc.), the studenst abilities will be directly affected.  In other areas, concepts are what drive the learning process also.  Math is a great example being that the more the students understand the concepts/formulas, the easier it will be to solve the equations.
|-
|~ Try to make learning fun (as much as possible).
|-
|Life in general is better when it is fun.
|-
|In other aspects of teaching, techology for instance, I think the more the better.  Use the internet to research, use computers for compositional(musical notation) purposes, use LCDs, videos, recordings, use everything and anything that will help the student(s) learn.  This more is better applies to parent involvement, student teacher-interation, pretty much everything.  One note about teacher-student interation.  It should be well established that teacher is the teacher and is not a friend.  Not that the teacher can't be a friend but during class, class is all that there is.
|-
|One area that the more is better idea doesn't apply is classroom design and management.  The class should be kept simple, or rather just not to busy.  When it comes to class management, again just try to keep it simple.  A couple of clear rules and a few procedures to keep class flowing are all that a need.
|-
|The whole reason behind teaching, to me atleast is to help others understand more of the world and more of themselves.  I simply want to find the best way to do this.

The notion of integration is one of fundamental importance in advanced analysis. The idea of integration is expanded so as to be applicable to sets more general than subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Interested readers may refer to the Wikibook ''[[Measure Theory]]''. Here however, we will discuss two important generalizations of integration which are still applicable only to real valued functions.

==Riemann-Stieltjes integral==
The '''Riemann-Stieltjes integral''' (or '''Stieltjes integral''') can be seen as an extention of the idea behind the [[Real analysis/Darboux Integral|Darboux integral]]
===Upper and Lower sum===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha (x)&lt;/math&gt; is strictly increasing over &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; be a partition over &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;x_i,x_{i-1}\in\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Upper Sum''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;U(f,\mathcal{P},\alpha)=\sum_{i=1}^n M_i\left( \alpha\left( x_i\right) -\alpha\left( x_{i-1}\right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; is given as in the previous chapter

The '''Lower Sum''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;L(f,\mathcal{P},\alpha)=\sum_{i=1}^n m_i\left( \alpha\left( x_i\right) -\alpha\left( x_{i-1}\right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; is given as in the previous chapter
===Definition===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha (x)&lt;/math&gt; is strictly increasing over &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''Riemann-Stieltjes integrable''' on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; if and only if 

&lt;math&gt;\sup_{\mathcal{P}} \{L(f,\mathcal{P},\alpha)\}=\inf_{\mathcal{P}} \{U(f,\mathcal{P},\alpha)\}&lt;/math&gt;, where the supremum and the infimum have been taken over the set of all partitions.

&lt;math&gt;L=\sup_{\mathcal{P}} \{L(f,\mathcal{P},\alpha)\}=\inf_{\mathcal{P}} \{U(f,\mathcal{P},\alpha)\}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be the integral of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)d\alpha (x)&lt;/math&gt; or as &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b fd\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that putting &lt;math&gt;\alpha(x)=x&lt;/math&gt;, we get the Darboux integral, and hence, the Darboux integral is a special case of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral.
==Henstock Kurtzweil integral==
While calculating the [[Real analysis/Riemann integration|Riemann integral]], the &quot;fineness&quot; of a partition was measured by it ''norm''. However, it turns out that the norm is a very crude measure for a partition. Thus, by introducing the clever notion of ''gauges'', we can extend the idea of the Riemann integral to a larger class of functions. In fact, it turns out that this integral, called the ''Henstock-Kurtzweil integral'' (after [[w:Ralph Henstock|Ralph Henstock]] and [[w:Jaroslav Kurzweil|Jaroslav Kurzweil]]) or ''Generalised Riemann integral'' is more general than the Riemann-Stieltjes integral and several other integrals on real intervals.

===Gauges===
A '''Gauge''' is said to be a function &lt;math&gt;\delta:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the range of &lt;math&gt;\delta(x)&lt;/math&gt; includes only positive reals

A tagged partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}=\{(t_i,\{x_{i-1},x_i\})\}_{i=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''δ-fine''' for a gauge &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,
 

&lt;math&gt;[x_{i-1},x_i]\subseteq \left(t_i-\delta(t_i),t_i+\delta(t_i)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
===Definition===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;L\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''Henstock-Kurtzweil integrable''' on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if, for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a gauge &lt;math&gt;\delta:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; is a δ-fine partition of &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Plasma: A Neo-Introduction ===


Plasma is an uncommon name for an uncommon concept which offers a user common services. 
What does that all mean? It will all be revealed but first let us introduce to you the common services that Plasma offers. 


== Plasma is ==

- A place to put common files

- A place to put commonly needed information

- A way to organize tasks

- A way to control your work (or play!) area to your exact specifications

- A way to move from any type of work environment the very large to the very small, the option filled to the very constrained and still have control over the same data with much of the same power.

- A thing of Beauty


==Plasma's Role==

Plasma is both the replacement for the Desktop metaphor in KDE4 as well as a framework for creating interfaces. We will be focusing on what Plasma does for users. 

Plasma offers widgets, a place to put them, panels which can be hidden and themes. Many of the things that you are used to from KDE3 and other desktop software are now available as widgets so you can build a desktop as you see fit. By default it is setup as a traditional desktop so you will recognize many things right off.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics) Rendering] is the process whereby a high quality image of a 3d model is produced, with the customizable use of lighting, reflection and texture effects. 

Rendering cannot be carried out in the Trainz Asset Creation Studio in Gmax, but is available in 3DS Max. In relation to Trainz, its main uses are to check the resemblance of a model to a photo of the real thing. Renders are also a popular way of exhibiting content creations for example, on the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Trainz/Using_the_Trainz_Discussions_Forums Trainz Discussion Forums].

== Introduction ==

Sometimes, for personal preference or technical reasons, an assets dependencies may need to be replaced. Described here is an example of how to change a Locomotive's hornsound relatively easily and quickly by using CCP or editing the config.txt file.



== TRS2006 And Above ==
[[Image:CCP_Hornsound.jpg|thumb|right|1024px|CCP Screen, tag is highly controlled, so CCP limits edit flexibility. Good for this sort of task.]]

* Open Content Manager Plus (CMP) via the Trainz launch screen. 
* Search for the locomotive you are wishing to change.
* Right-click on the item, go to 'Edit in Content Creator Plus'.
* You may be asked if you want to continue due the content item being from a different Trainz version. It is usually safe to continue, but there are warnings that this can cause a faulty asset. Backup or clone the asset if you are unsure. 
* In CCP scroll down and you will see the line 'hornsound' amongst other things, e.g. 'enginesound', 'enginespec', 'description' etc. 
* Click on the '...' button that allows you to scroll through your entire collection of assets. Narrow it down using the drop down menu filter and locate a new hornsound of your choice.
* Exit CCP, saving as you go.
* Commit the asset before you return to Trainz.
If you wanted to, or if the instability of CMP/CCP forces you to, you could always use the manual method, which is just as easy.

== TRS2004 And Below ==

* Locate the Custom folder in your TRS2004 installation directory. 
* Find your locomotive and open its config.txt file with a text editor, e.g. notepad. 
* Scroll through until you see the 'hornsound' tag and replace its kuid with one of your desired hornsound.
* Save the file upon exit and test in Trainz.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prolog programs are rarely used standalone, they are usually embedded in imperative programming languages like in Java, C or C++. It's usually easier to embed it in languages, which support OOP than in C, because the Prolog types are very different from the ones used in imperative languages, and objects can encapsulate their specific behaviour quite well. (e.g. the  &quot;not instantiated&quot; state of a variable)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Parallel flows: Poiseuille flows ==

For parallel flows along axis &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; the velocity writes:
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}=u_x(y,z) \mathbf{e}_x&lt;/math&gt;.

The Stokes equation in the permanent regime therefore write, when projected along axis &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu (\frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial y^2}(y,z)+\frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial z^2}(y,z))=\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;
and along axis &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0=\frac{\partial p}{\partial y},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0=\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}.&lt;/math&gt;
These last two equations implie that pressure is a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; only, &lt;math&gt;p=p(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore the right-hand term on the equation along &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is only a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, 
and the left hand term is only a function of &lt;math&gt;y,z&lt;/math&gt;, both are equal to a constant.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}=\mathrm{cst}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Circular tube ==
[[Image:Tube.svg|thumb|200px|right|Coordinates on a tube]]

We consider a tube of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.
The boundary condition is &lt;math&gt;u_x=0&lt;/math&gt; on the tube surface of equation &lt;math&gt;1-\frac{y^2}{R^2}+\frac{z^2}{R^2}=0&lt;/math&gt;.
The trial function &lt;math&gt;u_x(y,z)=u_0(1-\frac{y^2}{R^2}+\frac{z^2}{R^2})&lt;/math&gt; satisfies automatically the boundary condition, and is a solution of Stokes equation, with a constant &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; such that the:
:&lt;math&gt;u_x=-\frac{R^2}{4\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\left(1-\frac{y^2}{R^2}+\frac{z^2}{R^2}\right)=-\frac{R^2}{4\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\left(1-\frac{r^2}{R^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, 
with &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the distance to the tube axis.
The flow rate is the integral of the velocity on a cross section
&lt;math&gt;Q=\int u_x(y,z)dydz&lt;/math&gt;, and here we obtain:
: &lt;math&gt;Q=-\frac{\pi R^4}{8\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}.&lt;/math&gt;
If the pressure drops by &lt;math&gt;\Delta P&lt;/math&gt; along a tube of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, the pressure gradient is &lt;math&gt;\partial p/\partial x=-\Delta P/L&lt;/math&gt;.
There is a huge dependance of the flow rate as a function of the tube radius! Reducing by a factor 10 the tube diameter, reduces by a factor 10000 the flow rate for a given pressure gradient.

== Rectangular cross-section ==
[[Image:Tube.svg|thumb|200px|right|Channel of rectangular cross-section]]

The boundary conditions are 
:&lt;math&gt;u_x(y=\pm w/2)=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u_x(y=\pm h/2)=0&lt;/math&gt;
An expansion in Fourier series along &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; provides the solution (not derived here) as an infinite sum:
:&lt;math&gt;u_x(y,z)=-\frac{4}{\mu w}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{\beta_n^3}\left[  1-\frac{cosh(\beta_n z)}{cosh(\beta_n z/2)} \right] cosh(\beta_n y), &lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\beta_n=(2n-1)\pi/w&lt;/math&gt;.
The flow rate, following from the integration of the previous flow field along the cross section provides:
:&lt;math&gt;Q=-\frac{8h}{\mu w}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\beta_n^4}(1-\frac{2}{\beta_n h} tanh(\beta_n \frac{w}{2}) ). &lt;/math&gt; 
Even if this series converges rapidly (it is in &lt;math&gt;1/n^5&lt;/math&gt; and is calculated with a few terms, an approximate relation is much useful (when &lt;math&gt;h&lt; w&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;Q\approx \frac{wh^3}{12\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} \left(1-0.630 \frac{h}{w}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
It is accurate at 10% when &lt;math&gt;w=h&lt;/math&gt;, and at 0.2% when &lt;math&gt;w=h/2&lt;/math&gt;!

== Drag force on a sphere ==

Assuming a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; fixed in a flow of velocity &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, 
it is possible to show that the drag force is exterted along the axis of the flow with strength
:&lt;math&gt;F_{drag}=6\pi \mu R U.&lt;/math&gt;
Note the linearity of the formula in velocity. This formula is valid for small Reynolds numbers.

This formula is much different at large Reynolds numbers:
&lt;math&gt;F_{drag}=C_x \pi R^2 \frac{1}{2}\rho U^2, &lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;C_x&lt;/math&gt; a drag coefficient and &lt;math&gt;\pi R^2&lt;/math&gt; the apparent surface, while &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\rho U^2&lt;/math&gt; is the inertial pressure.

Exercise: compute the free fall velocity of small sphere in liquid.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">We present here simple tools to compute the flow in complex network of channels, just knowing the applied pressure.

== Hydrodynamic resistance ==

We have seen in the previous chapter that flow rate &lt;math&gt; Q&lt;/math&gt; in a channel is proportional to the applied pressure drop &lt;math&gt;\Delta P&lt;/math&gt;.
This can be summarized in 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P=R_h Q,&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;R_h&lt;/math&gt; the '''hydrodynamic resistance'''.
This expression is formally the analog of the electrokinetic law between voltage difference and current, &lt;math&gt;U=R I&lt;/math&gt;.

The expression for the hydraulic resistance is:
* channel of circular cross-section (total length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;R_h=\frac{8\mu L}{\pi R^4}&lt;/math&gt;

* rectangular cross-section (width &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;R_h\approx \frac{12 \mu L}{w h^3(1-0.630 h/w)}&lt;/math&gt;

In a network of channels, equivalent resistances can be computed (as in electrokinetics):
* two channels ''in series'' have a resistance &lt;math&gt;R_h=R_{h1}+R_{h2}&lt;/math&gt;,
* two channels i''n parallel'' have a resistance &lt;math&gt;1/R_h=1/R_{h1}+1/R_{h2}.&lt;/math&gt;

These laws provide useful tools for the design of complex networks. Actually Kirchhoff's laws for electric circuits apply, being modified in:
* the sum of flow rates on a node of the circuit is zero
* the sum of pressure differences on a loop is zero

== Hydrodynamic capacitance ==
The volume of fluid in a channel can change just because of a change in pressure: this is  due either to fluid compressibility or either channel elasticity.
This behavior can be summarized with 
:&lt;math&gt;Q=C_h \frac{d\Delta P}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;C_h&lt;/math&gt; the hydrodynamic capacitance. It is the microfluidic analog of the electrokinetic law &lt;math&gt;I=C\,dU/dt&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Compressible fluid in a container ===
A pressure increase can compress the fluid in a container. The compressibility is measured by 
:&lt;math&gt;K_{fluid}=-\frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}.&lt;/math&gt;
For water its value is &lt;math&gt;K=4.6\times 10^{-5}/bar&lt;/math&gt; which is usually negligible since pressure are usually less than a bar.
For air it is &lt;math&gt;K=1/P=1/bar&lt;/math&gt; which considerable if pressure attain a bar.

The flow rate entering a tube of volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, because of fluid compression &lt;math&gt;d\Delta P/dt&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;Q=-\frac{dV}{dt}=V\left(-\frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right) \frac{d\Delta P}{dt}=K_{fluid} V \frac{d\Delta P}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

The hydrodynamic capacitance is therefore:
:&lt;math&gt;C_h=K_{fluid} V&lt;/math&gt;

=== Elastic tubes ===

We define the tube dilatability as 
:&lt;math&gt;K_{tube}=\frac{1}{V_{tube}}\frac{\partial V_{tube}}{\partial P}&lt;/math&gt;
It has a positive sign, since the tube volume increases with pressure.

The tube dilatability is approximately the inverse of the Young modulus &lt;math&gt;K\simeq 1/E.&lt;/math&gt;
The following table gives  order of magnitude of this dilatability for different materials
{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
|-
|-
| 
| &lt;math&gt;K_{tube}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| steel
| &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 0.5\times 10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;/bar
|-
| plastic
| &lt;math&gt; 0.01&lt;/math&gt;/bar
|-
| rubber
| &lt;math&gt;0.1&lt;/math&gt;/bar
|}
This value can be interpreted in the following way: if the pressure is increased by 1 bar the relative volume increase is &lt;math&gt;K_{tube}&lt;/math&gt;

''Assuming a uniform pressure in the tube'' (which is not true in long tube where pressure decreases subtantially) ,
we find a flow rate entering the tube to inflate to be
:&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{dV_{tube}}{dt}=K_{tube}V\frac{\Delta P}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

The hydrodynamic capacitance is therefore 
:&lt;math&gt;C_{h}=K_{tube}V.&lt;/math&gt;

== Modelisation of an elastic long tube with a substantial pressure drop ==

We consider a tube of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; on which a pressure difference &lt;math&gt;\Delta P&lt;/math&gt; is applied.
In the tube, the pressure decreases along the tube coordinate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;P(x)=P_0+(1-x/L)\Delta P&lt;/math&gt;.
The dilatation is therefore not homogeneous: larger near the entrance.
The volume increase of the tube (compared to the rest situation at pressure &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt;) is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V=\int_0^L \left(1-\frac{x}{L}\right)\Delta P \; K_{tube} \frac{dx}{L} V_{tube}=\frac{\Delta P}{2}K_{tube} V.&lt;/math&gt;
We have integrated the inflation of small volumes &lt;math&gt;dx/L\times V_{tube}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:ElasticTubeModelisation.svg|thumb|200px|left|Equivalent circuit to a long elastic tube]]
We obtain that the flow due to dilatation is 
:&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{d\Delta V}{dt}=C_{tube}\frac{d\Delta P/2}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
meaning that only half the pressure difference loads the volume ''capacitor''. The capacitor is placed in the middle of the channel, where the overpressure is half, see figure.


== Application: syringe injection in a microchannel ==

The syringe is has a tube diameter &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and a volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, while the (cylindrical) microchannel has a diameter &lt;math&gt;r\ll R&lt;/math&gt; and a volume &lt;math&gt;v\ll V&lt;/math&gt;, and a length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.
The resistance of the microchannel is much larger than that of the syringe &lt;math&gt;R_v=8\mu l/\pi r^4  \gg R_V&lt;/math&gt;.
However the capacitance of the syringe is much larger &lt;math&gt;C_V \gg C_v&lt;/math&gt;, because of the larger volume.

The equivalent circuit is therefore 
[[Image:SyringeMicrochannelModelisation.svg|thumb|200px|left|Equivalent circuit to a long elastic tube]]
The total flow is distributed in the microchannel branch and the capacitor branch:
:&lt;math&gt;Q_{piston}=\frac{1}{R_v}\Delta P+C_V\frac{d\Delta P}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
If the piston is suddenly started, initially water or tube elasticity will absorb the flow, and the flow is stationary only for time larger tha a characteristic transient time  
:&lt;math&gt;\tau=R_v \,C_V=\frac{8\mu l}{\pi r^4} V K,&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; the compressibility of either water or the syringe tube.

As an example, we take a microchannel of radius 10 micrometers, length 1 cm and a syringe of volume 1cc: the characteristic time is 10 seconds, if the syringe is rigid (glass) and &lt;math&gt;K=K_{water}&lt;/math&gt;, while it takes up to 1000 seconds if the syringe is in plastic &lt;math&gt;K=K_{plastic}&lt;/math&gt;!

As a conclusion, for practical realization of microfluidic networks:
* avoid flexible tubes and prefer metallic tubes for a faster equilibration
* avoid flexible glues in contact with the liquid: they will compress
* avoid bubbles in the system, their compressibility is extremely high compared to plastic!
* impose pressure with a valve, instead of piston velocity: the pressure equilibrates at the speed of sound in the liquid and changes in pressure are very rapidly applied to the whole system.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The SRS article is somewhat unintellegable. I have a meeting with my oncologist tomorrow to discuss WBR vs Stereotactic.  As I'm one of a typical group that would find the article useful, I wonder if someone could clarify the abbreviations, and their implications, bringing them down to a layman level without losing information.
For example,

&quot;Median OS: 14.2 months &quot;   &quot;OS&quot;??  ....average survival after treatment??  If so how much longer is that than without any treatment?

and 
&quot;1-year LC: renal cell 64% vs. melanoma 47% vs. sarcoma 0% (SS). &quot;
LC = Lung Cancer?

and
&quot;Median OS: renal cell 40% vs. melanoma 25% vs. sarcoma 22% (SS) &quot;
OS again?  And what do the persentages mean in months?

and
&quot;Median OS: 8.3 months, 32% died from CNS death.&quot;
OK. What is central nervous system death. I thought dementia was a risk, but not sure what the mechanism of cns death would be.

and
&quot;Predictors impacting survival: age, KPS, [...]&quot;
What is KPS?


The wayne state explanation is good. Clear. I'd like it if it had a 3rd category comparing stereotactic alone. I'd be really grateful if anyone's keen and available, if you could rewrite the section in that format, and perhaps email me at   tonyjeffs at tonyjeffs dot com.

ThanksTony

:The [[Radiation_Oncology|Radiation Oncology textbook]], of which this is a subpage, is targeted primarily at radiation oncologists, and secondarily at cancer specialists. It is also designed to serve as a repository of the evidence, sometimes with brief summary, but without interpreting the evidence. There are textbooks and other sources such as [www.nccn.org] and [www.cancer.gov] that provide treatment recommendations and standards of care. As far as we (the authors) are concerned, each radiation oncologist interprets the evidence and applies it to their particular patient as appropriate. As a result, this textbook is highly technical and is ''not'' meant for lay population. Having said that, I am happy to explain some of the abbreviations.
:*WBRT = whole brain radiation therapy
:*SRS = stereotactic radiosurgery = Gamma Knife Surgery or linear-accelerator based radiosurgery
:*Median OS = median overall survival = average survival of all patients in the study after treatment; this means 50% survived more and 50% survived less and this number is the average survival given in months. Median survival without any treatment of patients who develop brain metastases is ~1-2 months (please [[Radiation_Oncology/Palliation/Brain_Metastases#Natural_history_.28no_treatment.29|see here]]), but that is highly dependent on what is the original tumor histology (renal, lung, breast, etc). In comparison, 1-year OS is percentage of patients who are alive 1 year after their treatment 
:**I have updated the MD Anderson paper to reflect 1-year survival (rather than median OS with %); thank you for pointing this inconsistency out
:*LC = local control = control of that given brain metastasis treated with SRS
:*LRC = loco-regional control = control within brain, including other metastases
:*CNS death = death due to the metastasis/metastases progressing (growing) in brain, affecting normal brain function, and ultimately leading to death. For the purpose of treating the brain, this distinction is important compared with the tumor elsewhere in the body continuing to grown and ultimately leading to non-CNS death.
:*Dementia = side effect of radiation therapy, but also of continued metastasis growth in the brain
:*KPS = [[Radiation_Oncology/Karnofsky_scale|Karnofsky Peformance Scale]] shows to what degree is the patient affected by his disease
:As for interpretation, the oncologist is best qualified to interpret this information/evidence [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] ([[User talk:Tdvorak|talk]]) 20:57, 22 May 2008 (UTC)</text>

You sound quite determined and on your way where you need to be, good for you, Candi! 
I teach ESL at an elementary school in VA. I do agree with your stance that &quot;Students should be taught that boys and girls are equal&quot;. I'd also suggest - make sure you help them realize how very different they are, and how much they compliment each others! Re. grouping in accordance to their levels, it sometimes does wonders for the weaker kids to be encouraged and inspired by the more proficient classmates: certain activities could be routinely incoprorated into teaching strategies.</text>

Focaccia is derived from the Latin word focus so I doubt so much that it originated in Greece that I have removed the pertaining statement. [[User:Maikel|Maikel]] ([[User talk:Maikel|talk]]) 21:57, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

==Cups==
Cups are not a universal kitchen measure but mostly used in the USA.  I'd prefer the metric system! [[User:Maikel|Maikel]] ([[User talk:Maikel|talk]]) 21:57, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

:Indeed. In fact, for baked goods, it is better to measure ingredients by weight, not by volume. So this should really be in grams (or ounces) to be most useful. [[Special:Contributions/128.197.81.180|128.197.81.180]] ([[User talk:128.197.81.180|talk]]) 17:41, 28 October 2008 (UTC)

==Errors==
The ingredients call for 3 and 1/2 cups of all purpose flour but the direction use 4 and 1/2 cups.  I don't know which is right but this recipe is inconsistent.

:The recipe indeed is 4 1/2 cups of flour.  It should possibly read something like, &quot;Mix in as much of the remaining flour as you can knead in by hand&quot;, as is common in bread recipes.

::Agreed. Amounts of flours in bread recipes are best judged by kneading. If I get the chance to try this recipe, I'll see if I can measure.

==Re: Portfolio Assessments==
Joseph, thanks for reading and responding to my article about portolio assessments. I wanted to let you know that the Portfolio vs. Standardized Testing list came from an article listed in the reference section:

Birgin, Osman and Adnan Baki. (2007). The Use of Portfolio to Assess Student's Performance. Journal of Turkish Science Education, vol. 4 (2), 75-90.

I didn't want you to think this was just my opinion. I selected to leave my personal opinions out of this article to remain in line with the neutral point of view. I may move the reference around a bit to make sure it's more visible. The reference appears before the &quot;chart&quot; - I put quotes there because I couldn't figure out how to turn the list into a chart in time for deadline. 

Thanks again for your response!  [[User:Mworr002|Mworr002]] ([[User talk:Mworr002|talk]]) 17:40, 29 July 2008 (UTC)

==Peer Reviews==
Any One? ;)

Hi Joseph (roughcopy)!
Thank you for the very positive &quot;About the Author&quot; response! I'm sorry it's taken me so long to answer your questions, but as you mentioned earlier about me &quot;flirting with insanity&quot;...well, I guess you could say I'm married to it (and NO, I don't mean my husband. He's quite sane. Opposites attract, I guess). Here were your questions, since it's taken me so long to respond, I thought you may have forgotten some of them... I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind. 
Why do you want the student to see you as the same person in and out of the classroom? I mean I understand wanting the student to look up to you as a person, but shouldn't there be a destinction between you as the teacher and you as another adult or friend? Would this affect your sense of professionalism? '''I think to be someone you're not, outside of the classroom, would affect ''my'' sense of professionalism. I guess I put that statement in there b/c I get so tired of teachers acting so prim &amp; proper at school, just to hear them talking who knows what about their latest escapades in the breakroom. It just gives me a deflated feeling to realize they are not who they want others to see them as &amp; I don't want that for myself. I want others to see me as someone who is genuine &amp; someone who tries, but who is not perfect at the same time.'''

How do you feel about the standardized tests. '''I'm not a fond advocate of the SOLs. I'm sure there are other appropriate ways of gauging our students' strengths &amp; abilities. They do not take into consideration that each child is different. Learns different &amp; tests different. Administrators in many schools do make allowances for these differences, though, by setting aside different test locations, etc. to help meet those students' needs. It just seems like we're cramming a set amount of data down our kids' throats &amp; aren't able to give more time to other educational instruments that are just as important (like learning a second language, music, or art experiences). I'm VERY fond of field trips &amp; other ways of teaching kids outside the every day classroom. One of the positives that comes from the SOLs is that they keep teachers accountable, which is very much needed in today's lazy society.'''

I have one final question for you. Since you plan to work in a private school, are there any programs you know of that can help meet your desired technology wishes. I did not know of any but I didn't know if you had looked into it.'''Each school district/county should have a technology &quot;guru&quot; who offers training throughout the year, for the public schools at least. If you're planning on teaching in a public school, I would seek out whomever that person is for your county &amp; stay informed about upcoming training they may offer throughout the year &amp;/or summer. As for a private school setting, I plan to continue taking classes at the university level, to keep me fresh. This would be probably be at my own expense (not that I would have the money to take very many!) or many Christian schools offer training to keep their teachers &quot;fresh&quot;, so I would definitely jump on that band wagon. I have based our family expenses on what I am making with my current two jobs. I estimate that I would make a certain amount more once I become a teacher (whether in a private OR public school setting) &amp; plan to set that additional money aside to pay for classes (&amp;/or replace my car). My husband is VERY supportive of most of my decisions in this area. I'd say any fundraisers I would want to do with my classes would go toward field trips or other &quot;fun&quot; learning experiences for the students. Hope this helps clearify a few things! :-) Thanks again for your wonderful comments!'''

== Hi Joseph! ==

What a fascinating background in and with music you have!  I think that that kind of passion for music will enable you to become an excellent teacher.  When I think back on my educational experiences as a student, and what has helped shape my interests today, I can vividly remember my teachers who truly loved the subjects they were teaching.  Also, by &quot;making learning fun&quot;, you will certainly inspire more than just the students who are musically talented.

Very insightful userpage!

==Author Respone [[User:Jmetc001|Jmetc001]] ([[User talk:Jmetc001|talk]]) 20:43, 15 June 2008 (UTC)==
Hey Joseph,

Thanks for the comment.  I hope you've had a good summer so far.  In reply to your earlier post:

'''Well hello Jessica, again. Did your musical dabbling spill over into teaching or what? why do you want to me a teacher? And by the way, you are an amazing cellist (is that the right word). Any way your teaching philosophy, as I understand is the focus on the student right? I agree with everything that you have said. Especially the emotion part when it comes to music ed. I guess we have one up on the rest... just kidding. I did want to ask, how would you give the individual opporutinities for each student to succeed? What types of opporutinites are we talking about here? And one last thing, I know you at least a bit and it is driving me crazy (for some odd reason) but how would your &quot;decorate&quot; your classroom. and oh what level do you want to teach? Roughcopy (talk) 20:48, 1 June 2008 (UTC) '''

Of course my music and teaching philosophy cross over...I'm going into music education.  :-)  Honestly, I still don't completely know what I want to do in the future, but, the more I study music and education, the more I love the idea of teaching music.  I have always loved people and loved helping others to the best of my ability.  Thus, teaching seems to follow naturally.  

Yes, I want to focus on the individual student.  Every person in the world is different, and so, is every student.  This means that I must be flexible in my teaching styles in order to meet the needs of each student.  It is difficult to say how I would best help each student to succeed, since I haven't met my future students.  However, I would work to give the students each the opportunity to shine.  One way I might do this through activities that encourage confidence, leadership, and creativity.  For example, I might do a review session with the students where each student answers a different question or explains an answer to the entire class.  If the student is struggling, I would allow another student to help the first student explain the answer.  This way, each student is allowed the opportunity to speak in front of the class and be known.  This also teaches the students that there peers are available for support, rather than criticism.  The opportunities for individual success may be small scale or large scale, depending the group of individuals being taught.

As for my classroom decorations, I would have fun decorating.  I love arts and crafts.  I would include classroom management information and subject material information in the decorations because this would help direct the classroom focus to the class subject, most likely music.  The decorations would need to be colorful and catchy, without being distracting.  Being a RA in the Quad, I decorate the residence hall for my residents.  I would imagine the concept of decorating would be the same, only a difference in the decoration audience.  Like giving a speech, you must always consider your audience.

I have decided what age level I want to teach.  I'd actually prefer to try teaching all levels before making a decision.  I would like to start with the younger students and work my way up, the basics through the advanced.  The advantage of this would be that I could better learn to teach the fundamentals, basically forcing me to learn to break everything down to it's simplest form so that even the youngest students may understand the concepts.  If the students understand the basics with a firm foundation, adding more information and making connections between concepts becomes easier.  Better to start simple, like in your classroom management philosophy.  :-)

I hope that answers your questions.   I'm curious, how much longer before you graduate?  Do you plan to go straight to graduate school?  Did you have a college in mind where you'd like to teach?  Well, take care, and don't work too hard this summer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">                                   Dinosaurs.
Dinosaurs are ancient reptiles that lived between 239-70 million years ago in a long,long,long,
time age called the mesozoic.  Some dinosaurs were long like diplodocus and argentinosaurus.
The largest dino I know is the argentinosaurus he is also the heiviest dinosaur!  He is 125 tons
and 155 feet long!  The smallest dino was microraptor.  Microraptor was 19.5 inches long and 
1.7 pounds!  But a tragic day came 70 million years ago when somthing probably killed off the 
dinosaurs!  It killed off the plants, then the plant-eating dinosaurs, then the meat-eating dinos such as the large tyrannosaur appalachiosaurus!  But 70 million years later we can find the same appalachiosaurus in the rock and sand then he will be mounted in a museum.  Then the appalachiosaurus will be studyed and stared at for a very,very,very long time.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Base64}}

The traditional (MIME) base64 encoding and decoding processes are fairly simple to implement.  Here an example using JavaScript is given, including the MIME/etc required line breaks at particular line lengths.  It is worth noting however, that many base64 functions (e.g. in [[PHP]]) return base64 encoded strings without the line breaks, as the line breaks can be inserted easily after encoding, and many times the base64 encoding is desired only for safely transferring data via [[XML]] or inserting into a database, etc. &amp;mdash; times when the line breaks are known to be unnecessary and therefore undesirable.  The newline inserting and removing in these functions here can easily be commented out (they are each only one line in the respective functions) if they are not needed.

An array of the base 64 characters is necessary for encoding, such as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;
 var base64chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/'.split(&quot;&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
And decoding will require the inverse list (swap the indices for the values), such as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;
var base64inv = {}; 
for (var i = 0; i &lt; base64chars.length; i++) 
{ 
  base64inv[base64chars[i]] = i; 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that in real implementations, it is better to explicitly list the entire array/hash for each list above &amp;mdash; the one-liners here are given to demonstrate the concept as directly as possible, rather than being the ideal in practice.

==Encode==
===Javascript===

The base64 encoding function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;
function base64_encode (s)
{
  // the result/encoded string, the padding string, and the pad count
  var r = &quot;&quot;; 
  var p = &quot;&quot;; 
  var c = s.length % 3;

  // add a right zero pad to make this string a multiple of 3 characters
  if (c &gt; 0) { 
    for (; c &lt; 3; c++) { 
      p += '='; 
      s += &quot;\0&quot;; 
    } 
  }

  // increment over the length of the string, three characters at a time
  for (c = 0; c &lt; s.length; c += 3) {

    // we add newlines after every 76 output characters, according to the MIME specs
    if (c &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (c / 3 * 4) % 76 == 0) { 
      r += &quot;\r\n&quot;; 
    }

    // these three 8-bit (ASCII) characters become one 24-bit number
    var n = (s.charCodeAt(c) &lt;&lt; 16) + (s.charCodeAt(c+1) &lt;&lt; 8) + s.charCodeAt(c+2);

    // this 24-bit number gets separated into four 6-bit numbers
    n = [(n &gt;&gt;&gt; 18) &amp; 63, (n &gt;&gt;&gt; 12) &amp; 63, (n &gt;&gt;&gt; 6) &amp; 63, n &amp; 63];

    // those four 6-bit numbers are used as indices into the base64 character list
    r += base64chars[n[0]] + base64chars[n[1]] + base64chars[n[2]] + base64chars[n[3]];
  }
   // add the actual padding string, after removing the zero pad
  return r.substring(0, r.length - p.length) + p;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Java===
The base64 encoding function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
class Base64Encode {
    private final static String base64chars = &quot;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/&quot;;

    public static String encode(String s) {

	// the result/encoded string, the padding string, and the pad count
	String r = &quot;&quot;, p = &quot;&quot;;
	int c = s.length() % 3;

	// add a right zero pad to make this string a multiple of 3 characters
	if (c &gt; 0) {
	    for (; c &lt; 3; c++) {
		p += &quot;=&quot;;
		s += &quot;\0&quot;;
	    }
	}

	// increment over the length of the string, three characters at a time
	for (c = 0; c &lt; s.length(); c += 3) {

	    // we add newlines after every 76 output characters, according to
	    // the MIME specs
	    if (c &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (c / 3 * 4) % 76 == 0)
		r += &quot;\r\n&quot;;

	    // these three 8-bit (ASCII) characters become one 24-bit number
	    int n = (s.charAt(c) &lt;&lt; 16) + (s.charAt(c + 1) &lt;&lt; 8)
		    + (s.charAt(c + 2));

	    // this 24-bit number gets separated into four 6-bit numbers
	    int n1 = (n &gt;&gt; 18) &amp; 63, n2 = (n &gt;&gt; 12) &amp; 63, n3 = (n &gt;&gt; 6) &amp; 63, n4 = n &amp; 63;

	    // those four 6-bit numbers are used as indices into the base64
	    // character list
	    r += &quot;&quot; + base64chars.charAt(n1) + base64chars.charAt(n2)
		    + base64chars.charAt(n3) + base64chars.charAt(n4);
	}

	return r.substring(0, r.length() - p.length()) + p;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

An alternate implementation could use Java Streams. For example one could create a Base64EncoderStream, inheriting from FilterOutputStream.

===Ruby===

Ruby version, implemented as a tool that encodes the file specified on the command line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
BASE64_CHARS = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/'
File.open(ARGV[0], 'rb') do |file| # read file name passed on command line
	c = 0 # count outputted characters
	while (buf = file.read(3)) != nil do # read up to 3 bytes at a time
		pad = '' # padding for this group of 4 characters
		while buf.length &lt; 3
			buf &lt;&lt; &quot;\0&quot;
			pad &lt;&lt; '='
		end
		group24 = (buf[0] &lt;&lt; 16) | (buf[1] &lt;&lt; 8) | buf[2] # current 3 bytes as a 24 bit value
		encoded = BASE64_CHARS[(group24 &gt;&gt; 18) &amp; 0x3f, 1] # read the 24 bit value 6 bits at a time
		encoded &lt;&lt; BASE64_CHARS[(group24 &gt;&gt; 12) &amp; 0x3f, 1]
		encoded &lt;&lt; BASE64_CHARS[(group24 &gt;&gt; 6) &amp; 0x3f, 1]
		encoded &lt;&lt; BASE64_CHARS[(group24 &gt;&gt; 0) &amp; 0x3f, 1]
		encoded[4 - pad.length, pad.length] = pad # add the padding
		print encoded
		print &quot;\r\n&quot; if (c += 4) % 76 == 0 # output newline ever 76th character
	end
end
&lt;/source&gt;

===C===

C version of the base64 encoding function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int base64encode(const void* data_buf, size_t dataLength, char* result, size_t resultSize)

         result[resultIndex++] = base64chars[n2];
      }

      /*

       * out over four characters
       */
      if((x+2) &lt; dataLength)
      {
         if(resultIndex &gt;= resultSize) return 0;   /* indicate failure: buffer too small */
         result[resultIndex++] = base64chars[n3];
      }
   }  

   /*

   result[resultIndex] = 0;
   return 1;   /* indicate success */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

==Decode==
===Javascript===
The base64 decoding function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;
function base64_decode (s)
{
  // remove/ignore any characters not in the base64 characters list
  //  or the pad character -- particularly newlines
  s = s.replace(new RegExp('[^'+base64chars.join(&quot;&quot;)+'=]', 'g'), &quot;&quot;);

  // replace any incoming padding with a zero pad (the 'A' character is zero)
  var p = (s.charAt(s.length-1) == '=' ? 
          (s.charAt(s.length-2) == '=' ? 'AA' : 'A') : &quot;&quot;); 
  var r = &quot;&quot;; 
  s = s.substr(0, s.length - p.length) + p;

  // increment over the length of this encoded string, four characters at a time
  for (var c = 0; c &lt; s.length; c += 4) {

    // each of these four characters represents a 6-bit index in the base64 characters list
    //  which, when concatenated, will give the 24-bit number for the original 3 characters
    var n = (base64inv[s.charAt(c)] &lt;&lt; 18) + (base64inv[s.charAt(c+1)] &lt;&lt; 12) +
            (base64inv[s.charAt(c+2)] &lt;&lt; 6) + base64inv[s.charAt(c+3)];

    // split the 24-bit number into the original three 8-bit (ASCII) characters
    r += String.fromCharCode((n &gt;&gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 255, (n &gt;&gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 255, n &amp; 255);
  }
   // remove any zero pad that was added to make this a multiple of 24 bits
  return r.substring(0, r.length - p.length);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The above implementation is best with a language like JavaScript that handles string concatenation of arbitrary length strings very efficiently.  Other languages (e.g. C) will work much more efficiently by allocating memory for a new string/array of the appropriate size (the output string length is easily calculated from the input string at the very beginning) and then simply setting each character index, as opposed to concatenation.

===Java===
The base64 decoding function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
class Base64Decode {
    private final static String base64chars = &quot;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/&quot;;

    public static String decode(String s) {

	// remove/ignore any characters not in the base64 characters list
	// or the pad character -- particularly newlines
	s = s.replaceAll(&quot;[^&quot; + base64chars + &quot;=]&quot;, &quot;&quot;);

	// replace any incoming padding with a zero pad (the 'A' character is
	// zero)
	String p = (s.charAt(s.length() - 1) == '=' ? 
		(s.charAt(s.length() - 2) == '=' ? &quot;AA&quot; : &quot;A&quot;) : &quot;&quot;);
	String r = &quot;&quot;;
	s = s.substring(0, s.length() - p.length()) + p;

	// increment over the length of this encoded string, four characters
	// at a time
	for (int c = 0; c &lt; s.length(); c += 4) {

	    // each of these four characters represents a 6-bit index in the
	    // base64 characters list which, when concatenated, will give the
	    // 24-bit number for the original 3 characters
	    int n = (base64chars.indexOf(s.charAt(c)) &lt;&lt; 18)
		    + (base64chars.indexOf(s.charAt(c + 1)) &lt;&lt; 12)
		    + (base64chars.indexOf(s.charAt(c + 2)) &lt;&lt; 6)
		    + base64chars.indexOf(s.charAt(c + 3));

	    // split the 24-bit number into the original three 8-bit (ASCII)
	    // characters
	    r += &quot;&quot; + (char) ((n &gt;&gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF) + (char) ((n &gt;&gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF)
		    + (char) (n &amp; 0xFF);
	}

	// remove any zero pad that was added to make this a multiple of 24 bits
	return r.substring(0, r.length() - p.length());
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

An alternate implementation could use Java Streams. For example one could create a Base64DecoderStream, inheriting from FilterInputStream.

===C===
Counterpart C decoder for the encoder above. This code is also public domain.
This solution has been optimized using pointer math and a look-up table.  This algorithm handles multiple encoding formats:
with and without line breaks, with and without whitespace, and with and without padding characters.

===C++===
Counterpart C++ decoder for the encoder above. This code is also public domain.
While a more general solution is possible by using a table similar to that in encoding, and then finding the index of the character we want in that table, and while that solution is much simpler, this version with the if-else-if ladder is faster because it does not need to run as many character comparisons to find the right character to use. The alphabet specific parts of this code are pretty much the same across most base64 alphabets however.

Items that need changed to accommodate the base64url encoding are commented as such.

A large predotory dinosaur around 35.00-39.68 feet long and weighed 6.88 tons.  T-rex was a cretaceous dinosaur.  It lived 73.99-70.00 million years ago.  Tyrannosaurus had 50 7.7 inch teeth. The front 5 teeth in its 4.98 foot mouth were scooping meat,skin, and organs while the rest of its teeth were for crunching bone out of its victim!  T-rex ate bugs and lizards 
while it was young, at teen age it consumed duck-billed dinos and when it was old it barly hunted but when it did it would hunt triceratops and scavenged.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you add want to use the same piece of code in multiple programs (i.e. a sensor board interface, or a common algorithm), it may be useful to create a module. Such a module can be included and used in all your programs.

The Khepera III Toolbox provides you with a module template and a Makefile.

== Preparing the Environment ==

Make sure that you have a working development environment as described in [[Khepera III Toolbox/Writing your Own Programs|Writing your Own Programs]].

== Creating a New Module ==

To create a new module, type
 cd my_khepera3_module_directory
 k3-create-module my_new_module
where ''my_new_module'' denotes the name of your module. This creates a folder ''my_new_module'' with a header and an implementation file (''my_new_module.h'' ,''my_new_module.c''). A Makefile is created as well.

To check if everything is all right, try to compile the new module:
 cd my_new_module
 make
This should create an archive ''my_new_module.a''.

You can now edit the files ''my_new_module.h'' and ''my_new_module.c''. In case your module is more complex, you can of course create additional ''my_new_module_*.c'' and ''my_new_module_*.h'' files (note the prefix ''my_new_module_''!). All these additional files will automatically be compiled and available to the programs including the module.

== Testing the Module ==

A module cannot be executed by itself. To test a module, you must [[Khepera III Toolbox/Writing your Own Programs|create a program]] that includes this module. To include your module, add the following line to the ''Makefile'' of your program:
 MY_MODULES := path/to/my_new_module
This will tell the compiler to look for the ''*.h'' files of that module, and to integrate the ''my_new_module.a'' archive into the program. (If your program needs multiple modules, simply add them on the same line. Note that all module folders must reside at the same location.)

Now, you can use the functions of the module in your program, and test them therewith. Note that whenever you change code in your module, you need to first recompile the module, and then recompile the program.

== Miscellaneous ==

=== Renaming a Module ===

The name of the binary executable can be changed in the ''Makefile'' by modifying the line
 ARCHIVE := my_new_module.a
Note that the archive should always have the same name as the project folder, suffixed by '''.a'''.

=== Including Modules in a Module ===

A module can include other modules. To include [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Modules|standard modules]], add the following line (with the modules you want to add, of course) to the Makefile:
 MODULES := khepera3 commandline i2cal
To include other modules that you wrote on your own, add
 MY_MODULES := path/to/my_other_module_1 path/to/my_other_module_2
to the Makefile.

=== SVN / Versioning System Issues ===

Just as for [[Khepera III Toolbox/Writing your Own Programs|programs]], we strongly suggest using a versioning system such as [http://subversion.tigris.org SVN (Subversion)] to store your Khepera III modules. SVN is probably the most prominent system today, and easy to set up and use.

If you are using a versioning system, you should check in the following files of your module:
* All source files (*.c, *.h)
* The Makefile
* The compiled archive (*.a) (such that a compiled copy is available for those who don't have a compiler set up)
* Any additional files that the program needs

You should '''not''' check in:
* Intermediate compilation files (*.o, *.d)

      <comment>/* XHTML 2.0 */ reworded since its no longer being developed</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== XHTML 1.0 ==
This was the first XHTML standard to be released. It was created to redesign HTML 4.0 to act more like an XML file. To make the change from HTML 4.0 to XHTML 1.0, there was three standards: '''strict''', '''transitional''' and '''frameset'''.
*Strict was the standard that accepted the full XHTML standard.
*Transitional was used by developers to either make it easier to migrate over from HTML 4.0 or to allow certain standards from HTML version 4.01 Transitional in the XHTML file.
*Framset was very simply the standard that allowed frames in the XHTML file.
XHTML has the capability to be used with XML files and applications that work with XML files.

== XHTML 1.1 ==
XHTML 1.0 was made with the intention of allowing developers to move from HTML standards to XHTML standards more easily.

== XHTML 2.0 ==
XHTML 2.0 was drafted between August 2002 and July 2006. It was designed to supersede HTML 4.0 and XHTML 1.1. In July 2009, World Wide Web Consortium announced plans to discontinue work on XHTML 2.0 by the end of the year in order to focus its effort on HTML 5. HTML 5 is expected to include a XML scheme in place of XHTML 2.0 currently called XHTML 5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello All!!

My name is Martin, you TA's know me as Charles, and I am currently teaching band and music theory at Woodside High School in Newport News.  Woodside is especially dear to me because I was fortunate enough to go there as a student!    Everyone asks me, &quot;Isn't it weird to teach where you once sat in class?&quot;.  I tell them it's actually preferable - I have never gotten lost in the building :-)  

I am working under a provisional license because my major in college was music performance, rather than education.  My first love will always be performing (trombone), but I felt it was more important to come back to this area and teach young people how to be good performers.


This leads me to my philosophy on education, which at the moment seems more like a philosophy on living in general.  Having already taught for almost 2 years now, I can see the divide that exists between students of different cultures.  The main effect of this divide, in my opinion, is that most students are not coming to high school prepared mentally for the amount of study required to be successful.  Many highly talented students do just enough to barely &quot;get by&quot; in everything they do!  It is my philosophy that the classroom atmosphere must be as organized and calming as possible because that atmosphere can likely be absent at the students' homes.  

In this organized environment that is suitable for learning, some creativity must come into play for students to remain engaged.  It is through varied instructional practices that this is accomplished.  Some musical subjects lend themselves to the lecture format of instruction (music history/appreciation), while units on keyboard and aural skills require a hands on/ears on approach.  Many students develop these particular skills only through self-discovery, which can be an instructional model itself if guided by a competent teacher.  

Technology implementation in the music classroom is a necessity for 21st century learners.  Because of the adolescent addiction to websites like Myspace and YouTube, many students learn more naturally through the use of computers.  Music education software is an expensive but important part of the music classroom.  In a band class, technology must be utilized to record and playback student performances.  Through self-critique and listening to professional recording, mastery of an instrument can increase exponentially.  In the theory classroom, ear training software and the keyboard-computer midi links can be used to put the theoretical side of music into sound.  

Assessment in the music classroom is quite simple.  A student must be able to play the music or write the music required of him or her.  I have sometimes found recitation to be another form of assessment useful.

This is first philosophy I have ever been asked to write, and I am extremely curious to know what I would have written had this been a requirement two years ''before'' I began teaching!</text>

I really enjoyed reading all about you and your philosophy.  You seem to be very passionate about your goal to be a P.E. teacher and that is just what our students need!  I know my two favorite things in school were recess and PE, especially when I was in Elementary school.  I firmly believe that in order to be a good teacher you must have passion and that will, in turn, fall over onto the students.  The will then feel important, loved and energized.  I ran track in college and always felt PE should be every day and not just 2 days a week as it is here in No. VA.  Not only are you correct about the obesity concern, but the students always come back form PE more chilled out, better able to focus and healthier on top of that!  You already know what is important to be a good teacher and that, to me, seems to be half the battle some teachers struggle with every year.  I don't have to wish you luck as I feel things will go very well for you when you become a teacher.  Your positive attitude will let you soar in hard times.

I really think you have a great outlook on waht you want to do and we need more people like you in today's schools.  Someone like you may get kids a lot more intrested in their own health.  You seem to really have a passion for making a difference and i wish the best of luck to you

Good evening!
It's exciting to see a pre-service P.E. teacher with such a love and concern for student wellness.  As a current teacher, I have noticed that the subject you hold in such high regard is not appreciated like it should be.  Many students do not have a teacher that inspires them or makes them feel that physical education is a course that should be required in school.  Inserting technology and literacy into your classroom are sure to make your students, and sometimes just as importantly, your administrators take you seriously.  I wish you the best of luck!

The Landau notation is an amazing tool applicable in all of real analysis. The reason it is so convenient and widely used is because it underlines a key principle of real analysis, namely ''estimation''. Loosely speaking, the Landau notation introduces two operators which can be called the &quot;order of magnitude&quot; operators, which essentially compare the magnitude of two given functions. 

==The little-''o''==
The '''little-''o'' ''' provides a function that is of lower order of magnitude than a given function, that is the function &lt;math&gt;o(g(x))&lt;/math&gt; is of a lower order than the function &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Formally,

===Definition===
Let &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;c\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f,g:A\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=0&lt;/math&gt; then we say that 

&quot;As &lt;math&gt;x\to c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x)=o(g(x))&lt;/math&gt;&quot;

===Examples===
*As &lt;math&gt;x\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, (and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;x^m=o(x^n)&lt;/math&gt;
*As &lt;math&gt;x\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, (and &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\ln x=o(x^n)&lt;/math&gt;
*As &lt;math&gt;x\to 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin x=o(1)&lt;/math&gt;

==The Big-''O''==
The '''Big-''O'' ''' provides a function that is at most the same order as that of a given function, that is the function &lt;math&gt;O(g(x))&lt;/math&gt; is at most the same order as the function &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Formally,

===Definition===
Let &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;c\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f,g:A\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

If there exists &lt;math&gt;M&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\left| \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right| &lt;M&lt;/math&gt; then we say that 

&quot;As &lt;math&gt;x\to c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x)=O(g(x))&lt;/math&gt;&quot;

===Examples===
*As &lt;math&gt;x\to 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin x=O(x)&lt;/math&gt;
*As &lt;math&gt;x\to \tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin x=O(1)&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
We will now consider few examples which demonstrate the power of this notation. 

===Differentiability===

Let &lt;math&gt;f: \mathcal{U} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x_0 \in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if 

There exists a &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that as &lt;math&gt;x\to x_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x) = f(x_0) + \lambda(x-x_0)+o\left( |x-x_0|\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Mean Value Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,x]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Then,

As &lt;math&gt;x\to a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x)=f(a)+O(x-a)&lt;/math&gt;

===Taylor's Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,x]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be ''n''-times differentiable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Then,

As &lt;math&gt;x\to a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x)=f(a)+\tfrac{(x-a)f'(a)}{1!}+\tfrac{(x-a)^2f''(a)}{2!}+\ldots+\tfrac{(x-a)^{n-1}f^{(n-1)}(a)}{(n-1)!}+O\left( (x-a)^n\right)&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <comment>using &amp;mdash; instead of template</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The ability to sharpen an edge is of utmost importance in woodwork.  Without it, the woodworker is destined to hours of frustration, hard work, and ultimately a poor result; luckily, there are many techniques for sharpening that are easy to learn, require no expensive machinery, and with practice will produce exceptionally sharp edges.  The key here, however, is ''practice'': you can not learn to sharpen an edge properly by reading a book or even being shown how to do it.  These will help, and are even necessary to begin, but it is relentless repetition&amp;mdash;many hours spent at the bench, improving at an almost imperceptible pace&amp;mdash;that will ensure that you can sharpen tools properly.  Thankfully, this is 'all' it will take!

When we say that expensive machinery is unnecessary, we do not mean to imply that a good-quality grinder (for shaping chisels, plane blades, etc.), or specialised honing system, would not be a valuable addition to the workshop.  It is however quite possible to produce the same (or better) results with lower-cost tools that are much more convenient for the small workshop, and easier to obtain for the amateur woodworker.

To sharpen all of the standard, straight-edged tools (and saws are included in this category, because their actual cutting edges are straight), one needs a surprisingly small number of tools and materials.  These are as follows, and their purchase, preparation, use, and storage will be elaborated upon below.

* Saws:
*# files, flat and triangular, of assorted sizes and coarseness;
*# saw set;
*# &amp;hellip;
* Plane blades, chisels, etc.:
*# three medium-density water stones;
*# a higher-density final honing stone;
*# a range of small triangular angle gauges (made of plastic, wood, or something else non-corrosive);
*# &amp;hellip;
* &amp;hellip;

== Blade tools ==

Sharpening of all edge tools is much the same: shape the edge (with a file or grinder); hone it (with an oil- or water-stone); then strop it (with a leather strop, MDF polishing board, or even the flabby bit of the hand).  With good steel and flat stones, this process will yield the sharpest of edges every time&amp;mdash;sharp enough to shave the hairs off your head with feather-like pressure.

=== Flattening Stones ===

All stones, be they waterstones or oilstones, are required to be of the utmost flatness before they can be used for sharpening.  Thankfully, there is a simple and utterly reliable method for accomplishing this.

== Saws ==

''This section is concerned with traditional English-style handsaws that cut on the push stroke (as opposed to, for example, Japanese saws).''

All work on saws should be done with the saw held firmly in a saw vice, to stop blade flex and chatter; these are annoying and shorten the life of the files.  There are many different types of vice, from commercial cast-iron cam-operated models, to the simplest method of two pieces of timber held either side of the blade.  Clamp the saw blade in the vice about with about 3 or 4mm of blade showing (below the gullets of the teeth).

===1. Jointing===
Jointing is the process of filing all of a saw's teeth down to a common line, and needs be done only when the teeth are uneven or incorrectly shaped.

===2. Shaping===
Correcting the profile of the teeth.

===3. Setting===
Bending the teeth out to each side of the blade about &amp;frac14; the thickness of the blade.

===4. Filing===
Actually putting the cutting edge to the teeth, working from alternating sides and filing towards the handle.

&lt;hr /&gt;

==Syntax==
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;User:Willscrlt/ForMoreSeeWP|title= |type= |site= |wiki= |what= }}

# '''title''': the article title at the other wiki to which you wish to link; defaults to the current SUBPAGENAME (that would be &quot;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&quot; for this page)
# '''type''': defaults to &quot;this topic&quot;, but could be &quot;this recipe&quot;, &quot;these photos&quot;, or &quot;Magicians&quot;
# '''site''': defaults to &quot;The English Wikipedia&quot;, but could be &quot;Wikimedia Commons&quot;, &quot;Die deutschsprachige Wikipedia&quot;, &quot;Wikispecies&quot;, etc.
# '''wiki''': defaults to &quot;w&quot; (as in &quot;w:Magician (fantasy)&quot;), but could be &quot;commons&quot; (for &quot;commons:Category:Magicians&quot;) or &quot;m:de&quot; (for &quot;m:de:Zauberkünstler&quot;)
# '''what''': defaults to &quot;has more information about&quot;, but could be &quot;includes a biography on&quot;, &quot;has photographs of&quot;, etc.

==Notes==
A note on ''wiki'': if you are using a language-specific wiki (e.g., ''en'', ''de'', ''es'', ''fr'', etc.) you must add an &quot;m:&quot; in front of the language code. If you do not, the link will not work. To link to the English Wikipedia, leave ''wiki'' empty or use &quot;w&quot; (you could use &quot;m:en&quot;, but &quot;w&quot; avoids an unnecessary redirect of the user's browser and is gentler on the servers). For MetaWiki, use &quot;m&quot; without a colon or any special language codes. For Wikimedia Commons, use &quot;commons&quot;.

''site'' is the human-readable name of the wiki to which you are linking. ''wiki'' is the special wiki-markup prefix for the wikilink to the desired resource.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am an undergraduate college student who is majoring in math education.  My plan is to become a teacher (hopefully without having to go another semester on top of the four years). My mother is also a teacher and I her work has inspired me to do the same.

I have been doing my student observation hours, which has helped form my philosophy of education.  I want my students to understand the material and the applications of it.  Activities are a good way of keeping a student's attention.  I believe that is the teacher's job to make the students learn the material.  I think student's should be grouped by ability.  That way those that need extra help can get it, while those who understand it will not have to wait for the slower learners.  I think my instruction will have both lecture and group problem solving.  I think groups are important, because students can learn through sharing their knowledge.  I want my stdents to feel free to ask questions.  I think that the classroom should be a relaxed environment.  Parents should have up to date progress reports.  If the student is not motivated, the parents should be able to see that and do something about it.  My students should learn how to use a TI-83 calculator, which will make their work easier. Also, m students should be familiar with some math programs on the computer.  At the beginning of the year, I plan on giving them a quiz to see what information they remember from their previous math courses.  This will give me an idea on what material we should spend more time on.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Answer to Question # 3.
Harry didn't get his uncle to sign the permission slip. The book never says he does and, later on, he tries to get Professor McGonagall to sign it, but she won't. Then, at the end of the book, Professor Dumbledore says that Sirius gives him permission to go.
:Thank you for not answering the study questions in the book proper. Yes, that is mostly correct (Sirius provides his own permission letter, Dumbledore has nothing to do with it); but this being a textbook for students, we want to leave the questions for the students to work on.

= Sicilian with 2.e5 =
This rarely seen move has some logical basis. The pawn on e5 prevents Black playing Nf6 and so the Black Kingside is cramped for a while. White can support the e5 pawn with Nf3. The drawback for White of 2.e5 is no added pressure to brought to the center, especially on d4 or d5 and the extra tempo allows Black various options, the main one is play Nc6 which hinders White's d4 move as well as attacking the as yet undefended e5 pawn.

Hello Martin/Charles,

It is great to have an in-service teacher in the class. I know we will all benefit from your experience. I am curious about the role music class can play in illuminating students' different intelligences or talents. In most classes, linguistic and mathematical and of course interpersonal intelligence/talents are rewarded and recognized. In my experience, I have valued courses that are considered vocational such as art, music or even drama for the opportunity they provide for &quot;other&quot; kids to &quot;shine&quot;. By &quot;other&quot; I mean the students who often do not get recognition in regular classes because they may not be the best reader or math student or because they are shy. Music, art and other such classes give these kids a chance to showcase their talents and earn a little admiration from their peers. I have never asked a music or art teacher about this phenomenon and I am curious to know if you see this also. Or, perhaps, you are accustomed to seeing these music stars and would be surprised by the scholars of the regular classroom. What has been your experience?

Hi Martin,

I have also observed highly talented students doing enough to just get by. I am also on provisional license teaching
computer networking at the Aviation Academy.  Interestingly enough, my first job with NNPS was as a long term substitute
teach guitar at DHS. (I am a classic guitarist and bassist).  I have discovered this year (my 2nd at AA) that in order
to get students performing at or near peak, I have had to spend a lot of time getting to know them better by talking one
on one.  On one occasion I have had to conference with a student and their parent together.  I am now getting better
results. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not work as well as I would like.

A normed space is called a ''pre-Hilbert space'' if for each pair &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; of elements in the space there is a unique complex (or real) number called an ''inner product'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, subject to the following conditions:
* (i) The functional &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is linear.
* (ii) &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle = \overline {\langle y, x \rangle}&lt;/math&gt;
* (iii) &lt;math&gt;\langle x, x \rangle &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; for every nonzero &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; 

The inner product in its second variable is not linear but antilinear: i.e., if &lt;math&gt;g(y) = \langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g(\alpha y) = \bar{\alpha} y&lt;/math&gt; for scalars &lt;math&gt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt;. We define &lt;math&gt;\| x \| = \langle x, x \rangle^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; and this becomes a norm. Indeed, it is clear that &lt;math&gt;\| \alpha x \| = | \alpha | \| x \|&lt;/math&gt; and (iii) is the reason that &lt;math&gt;\| x \| = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the triangular inequality follows from the next lemma.

'''3.1 Lemma (Schwarz's inequality)''' ''&lt;math&gt;|\langle x, y \rangle| \le \|x\|\|y\|&lt;/math&gt; where the equality holds if and only if we can write &lt;math&gt;x = \lambda y&lt;/math&gt; for some scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.''

If we assume the lemma for a moment, it follows:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\| x + y \|^2&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \| x \|^2 + 2 \operatorname{Re} \langle x, y \rangle + \| y \|^2 \le \| x \|^2 + 2 | \langle x, y \rangle | + \| y \|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\le (\| x \| + \| y \|)^2&lt;/math&gt;
|}
since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(\alpha) \le | \alpha |&lt;/math&gt; for any complex number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; 

Proof of Lemma: First suppose &lt;math&gt;\|x\| = 1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \overline {\langle x, y \rangle}&lt;/math&gt;, it then follows:
:&lt;math&gt;0 \le \| \alpha x - y\|^2 = | \alpha |^2 - 2 \operatorname{Re} (\alpha \langle x, y \rangle) + \|y\|^2 = -| \alpha |^2 + \|y\|^2&lt;/math&gt;
where the equation becomes &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x = \lambda y&lt;/math&gt;. Since we may suppose that &lt;math&gt;x \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, the general case follows easily. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3.2 Theorem''' ''A normed linear space is a pre-Hilbert space if and only if &lt;math&gt;\|x - y\|^2 = 2\|x\|^2 + 2\|y\|^2 - \|x+y\|^2&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: The direct part is clear. To show the converse, we define
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle = 4^{-1} (\|x+y\|^2 - \|x-y\|^2 + i\|x+iy\|^2 - i\|x-iy\|^2)&lt;/math&gt;.
It is then immediate that &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle = \overline{\langle y, x \rangle}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\langle -x, y \rangle = -\langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle ix, y \rangle = i \langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, since the calculation:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|x_1 + x_2 + y\|^2 - \|x_1 + x_2 - y\|^2&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=2\|x_1+y\|^2 - 2\|x_1-y\|^2 - \|x_1 - x_2 + y\|^2 - \|x_1 - x_2 - y\|^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\sum_{j=1}^2 \|x_j+y\|^2 - \|x_j-y\|^2&lt;/math&gt;,
|}
we have:
&lt;math&gt;\langle x_1 + x_2, y \rangle = \langle x_1, y \rangle + \langle x_2, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a real scalar and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of rational numbers converging to &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, then by continuity and the above, we get: &lt;math&gt;\langle \alpha x, y \rangle = \lim_{j \to \infty} \langle \alpha_j  x, y \rangle = \alpha \langle x, y \rangle. \square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3.3 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; be a pre-Hilbert. Then &lt;math&gt;x_j \to x&lt;/math&gt; in norm if and only if  for any &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\|x_j\| \to \|x\|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle x_j - x, y \rangle \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;j \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: The direct part holds since:
:&lt;math&gt;| \|x_j\| - \|x\| | +  |\langle x_j - x, y \rangle| \le \|x_j - x\|(1 + \|y\|) \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;j \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.
Conversely, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\| x_j - x \|^2 = \|x_j\|^2 - 2\operatorname{Re} \langle x_j, x \rangle + \|x\|^2 \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;j \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3.4 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; be a non-empty convex closed subset of a Hilbert space. Then &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; admits a unique element &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\| z \| = \inf \{ \|x\|; x \in D \}&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: By &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; denote the right-hand side. Since &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty, &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;n = 1, 2, ...&lt;/math&gt;, there is some &lt;math&gt;x_n \in D&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;0 \le \|x_n\| - \delta \le n^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;\delta = \lim_{n \to \infty} \| x_n \|&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is convex,
:&lt;math&gt;{ x_n + x_m \over 2 } \in D&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\delta \le {1 \over 2} \|x_n + x_m\|&lt;/math&gt;.
It follows:
:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\|x_n - x_m\|^2&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 2\|x_n\|^2 + 2\|x_m\|^2 - \|x_n + x_m\|^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\le 2 \|x_n\|^2 + 2 \|x_m\|^2 - 4 \delta^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|

|}
This is to say, &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is Cauchy. Since &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subset of a complete metric space, whence it is complete, there is a limit &lt;math&gt;z \in D&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\|z\| = \delta&lt;/math&gt;. The uniqueness follows since if &lt;math&gt;\|w\| = \delta&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;\|z - w\|^2 = 2\|z\|^2 + 2\|w\|^2 - \|z+w\|^2&lt;/math&gt; 
where the right side is &lt;math&gt;\le 0&lt;/math&gt; for the same reason as before.
&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

The lemma may hold for a certain Banach space that is not a Hilbert space; this question will be investigated in the next chapter.

For a nonempty subset &lt;math&gt;E \subset \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;E^\bot&lt;/math&gt; to be the intersection of the kernel of the linear functional &lt;math&gt;u \mapsto \langle u, v \rangle&lt;/math&gt; taken all over &lt;math&gt;v \in E&lt;/math&gt;. (In other words, &lt;math&gt;E^\bot&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; that is orthogonal to every &lt;math&gt;y \in E&lt;/math&gt;.) Since the kernel of a continuos function is closed and the intersection of linear spaces is again a linear space, &lt;math&gt;E^\bot&lt;/math&gt; is a closed (linear) subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, if &lt;math&gt;x \in E \cap E^\bot&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;0 = \langle x, x \rangle = \|x\|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''3.5 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be a linear subspace of a pre-Hilbert space. Then  &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\| z \| = \inf \{ \| z + w \| ; w \in \mathcal{M}\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: The Schwarz inequality says the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;| \langle z, z + w \rangle | \le \|z\| \|z + w \|&lt;/math&gt;
is actually equality if and only if &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z + w&lt;/math&gt; are linear dependent. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; (TODO: the proof isn't quite well written.)

'''3.6 Theorem (orthogonal decomposition)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; be a Hilbert space and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \subset \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; be a closed subspace. For every &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; we can write

Proof: Clearly &lt;math&gt;x - \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is convex, and it is also closed since a translation of closed set is again closed. Lemma 3.4 now gives a ''unique'' element &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\|x - y \| = \inf \{ \|x - w\|; w \in \mathcal{M}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;z = x - y&lt;/math&gt;. By Lemma 3.5, &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt;. For the uniqueness, suppose we have written:
:&lt;math&gt;x = y' + z'&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;y' \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z' \in \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt;. By Lemma 3.5, &lt;math&gt;\|x - y' \| = \inf \{ \|x - w\|; w \in \mathcal{M}\}&lt;/math&gt;. But, as noted early, such &lt;math&gt;y'&lt;/math&gt; must be unique; i.e., &lt;math&gt;y' = y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3.7 Corollary''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be a subspace of a Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Then

*''(ii) &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^{\bot\bot} = \overline{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt;.''
Proof: By continuity, &lt;math&gt;\langle x, \overline{\mathcal{M}} \rangle \subset \overline{\langle x, \mathcal{M} \rangle}&lt;/math&gt;. (Here, &lt;math&gt;\langle x, E \rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the image of the set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; under the map &lt;math&gt;y \mapsto \langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.)
This gives:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^\bot = \overline{\mathcal{M}}^\bot&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H} = \overline{\mathcal{M}} \oplus \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt;
by the orthogonal decomposition. (i) follows. Similarly, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H} = \mathcal{M}^\bot \oplus \mathcal{M}^{\bot\bot} = \mathcal{M}^\bot \oplus \overline{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, (ii). &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3.8 Theorem (representation theorem)''' ''Every continuous linear functional &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on a Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; has the form:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; with a unique &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|f\| = \|y\|_\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} = f^{-1} ( \{0\} )&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is closed. If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} = \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;, then take &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If not, by Corollary 3.6, there is a nonzero &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. By replacing &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;z \|z\|^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; we may suppose that &lt;math&gt;\|z\| = 1&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;zf(x) - f(z)x&lt;/math&gt; is in the kernel of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and thus is orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \langle z f(x) - f(z) x, z \rangle = \langle z, z \rangle f(x) - \langle f(z)x, z \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
and so:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \langle x, \overline{f(z)} z \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
The uniqueness follows since &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y_1 \rangle = \langle x, y_2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;y_1 - y_2 \in \mathfrak{H}^\bot = \{0\}&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, we have the identity:
:&lt;math&gt;\|y\| = |\langle {y \over \|y\|}, y \rangle | \le \|f\| \le \|y\|&lt;/math&gt;
where the last inequality is Schwarz's inequality. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3.9 Exercise''' ''Using Lemma 1.6 give an alternative proof of the preceding theorem.''

In view of Theorem 3.5, for each &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;, we can write: &lt;math&gt;x = y + z&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, a closed subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt;. Denote each &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, which is uniquely determined by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, by &lt;math&gt;\pi(x)&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; then turns out to be a linear operator. Indeed, for given &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2 \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;, we write:
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 = y_1 + z_1, x_2 = y_2 + z_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_1 + x_2 = y_3 + z_3&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;y_j \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_j \in \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j = 1, 2, 3&lt;/math&gt;. By the uniqueness of decomposition
:&lt;math&gt;\pi(x_1) + \pi(x_2) = y_1 + y_2 = y_3 = \pi(x_1 + x_2)&lt;/math&gt;.
The similar reasoning shows that &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; commutes with scalars. Now, for &lt;math&gt;x = y + z \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt;), we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\|^2 = \|\pi(x)\|^2 + \|z\|^2 \ge \|\pi(x)\|^2&lt;/math&gt;
That is, &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is continuous with &lt;math&gt;\|\pi\| \le 1&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, when &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is a nonzero space, there is &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\pi(x_0) = x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|x_0\| = 1&lt;/math&gt; and consequently &lt;math&gt;\|\pi\| = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Such &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''orthogonal projection'' (onto &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;).

The next theorem gives an alternative proof of the Hahn-Banach theorem.

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be a linear (not necessarily closed) subspace of a Hilbert space. Every continuous linear functional on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; can be extended to a unique continuous linear functional on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; that has the same norm and vanishes on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is a dense subset of a Banach space &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt;, by Theorem 2.something, we can ''uniquely'' extend &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; so that it is continuous on &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;g = f \circ \pi_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}}&lt;/math&gt;. By the same argument used in the proof of Theorem 2.something (Hahn-Banach) and the fact that &lt;math&gt;\|\pi_\mathcal{F}\|= 1&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain &lt;math&gt;\|f\| = \|g\|&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;g = 0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt;, it remains to show the uniqueness. For this, let &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; be another extension with the desired properties. Since the kernel of &lt;math&gt;f - h&lt;/math&gt; is closed and thus contain &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f = h&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, for any &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;h(x) = (h \circ \pi_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}})x = (f \circ \pi_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}})x = g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
The extension &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is thus unique. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_n&lt;/math&gt; be an increasing sequence of closed subspaces, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be the closure of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_1 \cup \mathcal{M}_2 \cup ...&lt;/math&gt;.

Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = \{ x \in \mathcal{M}; \pi_{\mathcal{M}_n}(x) \to x (n \to \infty) \}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Indeed, if &lt;math&gt;x_j \in \mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_j \to x&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\|\pi_{\mathcal{M}_n}(x) - x \| \le 2\|x - x_j\| + \|\pi_{\mathcal{M}_n}(x_j) - x_j \|&lt;/math&gt;
and so &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \subset \overline{\mathcal{N}}&lt;/math&gt;, the proof is complete. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{H}_j, \|\cdot\|_j = \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_j)&lt;/math&gt; be Hilbert spaces. The direct sum of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_1 \oplus \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:
let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_1 \oplus \mathfrak{H}_2 = \{ (x_1, x_2); x_1 \in \mathfrak{H}_1, x_2 \in \mathfrak{H}_2 \} &lt;/math&gt; and define
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x_1 \oplus x_2, y_1 \oplus y_2 \rangle = \langle x_1, y_1 \rangle_1 + \langle x_2, y_2 \rangle_2&lt;/math&gt;.
It is then easy to verify that &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{H}_1 \oplus \mathfrak{H}_2, \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle)&lt;/math&gt; is a Hilbert space. It is also clear that this definition generalizes to a finite direct sum of Hilbert spaces. (For an infinite direct sum of Hilbert spaces, see Chapter 5.)

Recall from the previous chapter that an isometric surjection between Banach spaces is called &quot;unitary&quot;.

'''3 Lemma (Hilbert adjoint)''' ''Define &lt;math&gt;V: \mathfrak{H}_1 \oplus \mathfrak{H}_2 \to \mathfrak{H}_2 \oplus \mathfrak{H}_1&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;V(x_1 \oplus x_2) = -x_2 \oplus x_1&lt;/math&gt;. (Clearly, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a unitary operator.) Then &lt;math&gt;(V\operatorname{gra}T)^\bot&lt;/math&gt; is a graph (of some linear operator) if and only if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is densely defined.''&lt;br &gt;
Proof:
Set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} = (V\operatorname{gra}T)^\bot&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;u \in (\operatorname{dom}T^*)^\bot&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \langle 0, -Tv \rangle_2 + \langle u, v \rangle_2 = \langle 0 \oplus u, -Tv \oplus v \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.
That is to say, &lt;math&gt;0 \oplus u \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a graph of a ''linear'' operator by assumption. Thus, &lt;math&gt;u = 0&lt;/math&gt;. For the converse, suppose &lt;math&gt;f \oplus u_1, f \oplus u_2 \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \langle f \oplus u_j, -Tv \oplus v \rangle = \langle f, -Tv \rangle_2 + \langle u_j, v \rangle_1 \qquad &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(j = 1, 2)&lt;/math&gt;
and so &lt;math&gt;\langle u_1 - u_2, v \rangle_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in the domain of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, dense. Thus, &lt;math&gt;u_1 = u_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is a graph of a function, say, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. The linear of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can be checked in the similar manner.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Remark: In the proof of the lemma, the linear of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; was never used.

For a densely defined &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, we thus obtained a linear operator which we call &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt;. It is characterized uniquely by:
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \langle f, -Tu \rangle_2 + \langle T^*f, u \rangle_1 = \langle f \oplus T^*f, V(u \oplus Tu) \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;,
or, more commonly,
:&lt;math&gt;\langle Tu, f \rangle_2 = \langle u, T^*f \rangle_1&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;.
Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;T^*f&lt;/math&gt; is defined if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;u \mapsto \langle Tu, f \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
is continuous for every &lt;math&gt;u \in \operatorname{dom}T&lt;/math&gt;. The operator &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''Hilbert adjoint'' (or just adjoint) of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is closed in addition to having dense domain, then
:&lt;math&gt;(V'\operatorname{gra}T^*)^\bot = (V' (V\operatorname{gra}T)^\bot)^\bot = \operatorname{gra}T^{\bot\bot} = \operatorname{gra}T&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;V'(x_2, x_1) = -x_1 \oplus x_2&lt;/math&gt;. By the above lemma, &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; is densely defined. More generally, if a densely defined operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has a closed extension &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gra}T \subset \operatorname{gra}S = \overline{\operatorname{gra}S}&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S^*&lt;/math&gt; are both densely defined. It follows: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gra}S^* \subset \operatorname{gra}T^*&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; is densely defined and &lt;math&gt;T^{**}&lt;/math&gt; exists. That &lt;math&gt;S = T^{**}&lt;/math&gt; follows from the next theorem.

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T: \mathfrak{H}_1 \to \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; be a densely defined operator. If &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; is also densely defined, then

for any closed extension &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: As above,
:&lt;math&gt;(V'\operatorname{gra}T^*)^\bot = \operatorname{gra}T^{\bot\bot}&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the left-hand side is a graph of &lt;math&gt;T^{**} &lt;/math&gt;. For the second identity, since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gra}S&lt;/math&gt; is a Hilbert space, it suffices to show &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{gra}T^\bot \cap \operatorname{gra}S = \{0\} &lt;/math&gt;. But this follows from Lemma 3.something.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

The next corollary is obvious but is important in application.

'''3 Corollary''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_1, \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; be Hilbert spaces, and &lt;math&gt;T: \mathfrak{H}_1 \to \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; a closed densely defined linear operator.

Proof: &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is in either the left-hand side or the right-hand side if and only if:

In particular, a closed densely defined operator has closed kernel. As an application we shall prove the next theorem.

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T: \mathfrak{H}_1 \to \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; be a closed densely defined linear operator. Then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is surjective if and only if there is a &lt;math&gt;K &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that

Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is surjective. Since &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has closed range, it suffices to show the estimate for &lt;math&gt;f \in (\operatorname{ker}T^*)^\bot = \operatorname{ran}T&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;u \in (\operatorname{ker}T)^\bot&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;Tu = f&lt;/math&gt;. Denoting by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; the inverse of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; restricted to &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{ker}T)^\bot&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|^2_2 \le \|T^*f\|_1 \|Gf\|_1 \le \|T^*f\| \|G\| \|f\|_2&lt;/math&gt;
The last inequality holds since &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is continuous by the closed graph theorem. To show the converse, let &lt;math&gt;g \in \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; be given. Since &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; is injective, we can define a linear functional &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;L(T^*f) = \langle f, g \rangle_2&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt;.,
:&lt;math&gt;|L(T^*f)| = |\langle f, g \rangle_2| \le K\|T^*f\|&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;f \in \operatorname{dom}T^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on the range of &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt;. It follows from the Hahn-Banach theorem that we may assume that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is defined and continuous on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, by Theorem 3.something, we can write &lt;math&gt;L(\cdot) = \langle \cdot, u \rangle_1&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}_1&lt;/math&gt; with some &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;L(T^*f)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous for &lt;math&gt;f \in \operatorname{dom}T^*&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;L(T^*f) = \langle f, g \rangle_2 = \langle T^*f, u \rangle_1 = \langle f, T^{**}u \rangle_2&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;f \in \operatorname{dom}T^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, &lt;math&gt;Tu = T^{**}u = g&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Corollary''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T, \mathfrak{H}_1, \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; be as given in the preceding theorem. Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ran}T&lt;/math&gt; is closed if and only if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ran}T^*&lt;/math&gt; is closed.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Define &lt;math&gt;S: \mathfrak{H}_1 \to \operatorname{ran}T&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;S = T&lt;/math&gt;. It thus suffices to show &lt;math&gt;S^*&lt;/math&gt; is surjective when &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has closed range (or equivalently &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is surjective.) Suppose &lt;math&gt;S^*f_j&lt;/math&gt; is convergent. The preceding theorem gives:
:&lt;math&gt;\|f_j - f_k\|_2 \le K\|S^*(f_j - f_k)\|_1 \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;j, k \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, &lt;math&gt;f_j \oplus S^*f_j&lt;/math&gt; is Cauchy in the graph of &lt;math&gt;S^*&lt;/math&gt;, which is closed. Hence, &lt;math&gt;S^*f_j&lt;/math&gt; converges ''within'' the range of &lt;math&gt;S^*&lt;/math&gt;. The converse holds since &lt;math&gt;T^{**} = T&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

We shall now consider some concrete examples of densely defined linear operators.

'''3 Theorem''' ''&lt;math&gt;T:\mathfrak{H}_1 \to \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. Moreover, when &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is continuous,
:&lt;math&gt;\|T\|^2 = \|T^*T\| = \|TT^*\| = \|T^*\|^2&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: It is clear that &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; is defined everywhere, and its continuity is a consequence of the closed graph theorem. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, then &lt;math&gt;T^{**}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous and &lt;math&gt;T = T^{**}&lt;/math&gt;. For the second part,
:&lt;math&gt;\| T^*f \|^2_1 = | \langle T T^*f, f \rangle | \le \|T\| \|T^*f\|_2 \|f\|_2&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; is continuous with &lt;math&gt;\|T^*\| \le \|T\|&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;T^*T&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, and so:
:&lt;math&gt;\| T^*f \|^2_1 \le \|T T^*\| \|f\|_2^2&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.
That is to say, &lt;math&gt;\|T^*\|^2 \le \|T T^*\| \le \|T\|^2&lt;/math&gt;. Applying this result to &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; completes the proof.

The identity in the theorem shows that &lt;math&gt;B(\mathcal{H})&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;-algebra, which is a topic in Chapter 6.

'''3 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;S, T \in B(\mathfrak H)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\langle Tx, x \rangle = \langle Sx, x \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;S = T&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;R = T - S&lt;/math&gt;. We have &lt;math&gt;0 = \langle R(x + y), x + y \rangle = \langle Rx, y \rangle + \langle Ry, x \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 = i\langle R(x + iy), x + iy \rangle = \langle Rx, y \rangle + i^2 \langle Ry, x \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Summing the two we get: &lt;math&gt;0 = 2\langle Rx, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x, y \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking &lt;math&gt;y = Rx&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;0 = \|Rx\|^2&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;R = 0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Remark: the above lemma is false if the underlying field is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Recall that a isometric surjection is called unitary.

'''3 Corollary''' ''A linear operator &lt;math&gt;U: \mathfrak{H}_1 \to \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; is unitary if and only if &lt;math&gt;U^*U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;UU^*&lt;/math&gt; are identities.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
Since &lt;math&gt;(U^*Ux \mid x) = \|Ux\|^2 = (x \mid x)&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;U^*U&lt;/math&gt; is the identity. Since &lt;math&gt;UU^*U = U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;UU^*&lt;/math&gt; is the identity on the range of ''U'', which is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; by surjectivity. Conversely, since
&lt;math&gt;\|Ux\|^2_2 = \langle U^*Ux, x \rangle_1 = \|x\|^2_1&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is an isometry. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Curiously, the hypothesis on ''linearity'' can be omitted: 

'''3 Theorem''' ''If &lt;math&gt;U: \mathcal{H}_1 \to \mathcal{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; is a ''function'' such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\| U(x) - U(y) \|_2 = \|x - y\|_1&lt;/math&gt;
for every ''x'' and ''y'' and &lt;math&gt;U(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a linear operator (and so unitary).''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Note that ''U'' is continuous. Since &lt;math&gt;\|U(x)\| = \|U(x) - U(0)\| = \|x\|&lt;/math&gt;,
we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\|x - y\|_1^2 = \|U(x) - U(y)\|_2^2 = \|x\|_1^2 - 2\operatorname{Re} ( U(x) \mid U(y) ) + \|y\|_1^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(x \mid y)_1 = \operatorname{Re}(U(x), U(y))_2&lt;/math&gt;
It now follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\|U(\alpha x + y) - \alpha U(x) - U(y)\|_2^2 = \|U(\alpha x + y) - U(\alpha x)\|_2^2 - 2\operatorname{Re} (y \mid y) + \|U(y)\|_2^2 = \|y\|_1^2 - 2\|y\|_1^2 + \|y\|_1^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for any &lt;math&gt;x, y \in \mathcal{H}_1&lt;/math&gt; and scalar &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

There is an analog of this result for Banach space. See, for example, http://www.helsinki.fi/~jvaisala/mazurulam.pdf)

'''3 Exercise''' ''Construct an example so as to show that an isometric operator (i.e., a linear operator that preserves norm) need not be unitary. (Hint: a shift operator.)''

A densely defined linear operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is called &quot;symmetric&quot; if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gra}T \subset \operatorname{gra}T^*&lt;/math&gt;. If the equality in the above holds, then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is called &quot;self-adjoint&quot;. In light of Theorem 3.something, every self-adjoint is closed and densely defined. If &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric, then since &lt;math&gt;T^{**}&lt;/math&gt; is an extension of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gra}T \subset \operatorname{gra}T^* \cap \operatorname{gra}T^{**}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T_j: \mathfrak{H}_j \to \mathfrak{H}_{j+1}&lt;/math&gt; be densely defined linear operators for &lt;math&gt;j = 1, 2&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gra}T_1^* \circ T_2^* \subset \operatorname{gra}(T_2 \circ T_1)^*&lt;/math&gt; where the equality holds if &lt;math&gt;T_j^{**} = T_j&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(j = 1, 2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_1^* \circ T_2^*&lt;/math&gt; is closed and densely defined.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;u \in \operatorname{dom}(T_1^* \circ T_2^*)&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\langle T_2 \circ T_1 v, u \rangle = \langle T_1 v, T_2^* u \rangle = \langle v, T_1^* \circ T_2^* u \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;v \in \operatorname{dom}(T_2 \circ T_1)&lt;/math&gt;.
But, by definition, &lt;math&gt;(T_2 \circ T_1)^*u&lt;/math&gt; denotes &lt;math&gt;T_1^* \circ T_2^* u &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;(T_2 \circ T_1)^*&lt;/math&gt; is an extension of &lt;math&gt;T_1^* \circ T_2^*&lt;/math&gt;. For the second part, the fact we have just proved gives:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gra}T_1^* \circ T_2^* \subset \operatorname{gra}(T_2 \circ T_1)^* = \operatorname{gra}(T_2^{**} \circ T_1^{**})^* \subset \operatorname{gra}(T_1^* \circ T_2^*)^{**}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T:\mathfrak{H}_1 \to \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; be a Hilbert spaces. If &lt;math&gt;T:\mathfrak{H}_1 \to \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; is a closed densely defined operator, then &lt;math&gt;T^*T&lt;/math&gt; is a self-adjoint operator (in particular, densely defined and closed.)''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: In light of the preceding theorem, it suffices to show that &lt;math&gt;T^*T&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Let &lt;math&gt;u_j \in \operatorname{dom}T^*T&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence such that &lt;math&gt;(u_j, T^*T u_j)&lt;/math&gt; converges to limit &lt;math&gt;(u, v)&lt;/math&gt;.
Since
:&lt;math&gt;\|T u_j - T u_k \|_2 \le 2 (\|T^*T (u_j - u_k) \|_1 + \|u_j - u_k\|_1)&lt;/math&gt;,
there is some &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; such that: &lt;math&gt;\|Tu_j - f\|_2 \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. It follows from the closedness of &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;T^*f = v&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\|u_j - u\|_1 + \|Tu_j - f\|_2 \to 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is closed, &lt;math&gt;T^*Tu = T^*f = v&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a symmetric densely defined operator. If &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is surjective, then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is self-adjoint and injective and &lt;math&gt;T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is self-adjoint and bounded.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: If &lt;math&gt;Tu = 0&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\langle Tu, v \rangle = \langle u, Tv \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u = 0&lt;/math&gt;
if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has a dense range (for example, it is surjective). Thus, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is injective. Since &lt;math&gt;T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is closed (by Lemma 2.something) and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ran}T = \mathfrak{H}_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T^{-1}: \mathfrak{H}_2 \to \operatorname{dom}T&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous linear operator. Finally, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gra}T^{-1} = V \operatorname{gra}T \subset V \operatorname{gra}T^* = \operatorname{gra}(T^*)^{-1} = \operatorname{gra}(T^{-1})^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Here, &lt;math&gt;V(x_1 \oplus x_2) = x_2 \oplus x_1&lt;/math&gt;, and the equality holds since the domains of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt; coincide. Hence, &lt;math&gt;T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is self-adjoint. Since we have just proved that the inverse of a self-adjoint is self-adjoint, we have: &lt;math&gt;(T^{-1})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is self-adjoint.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is an orthogonal projection onto &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\pi = \pi^* = \pi^2&lt;/math&gt; and the range of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: The direct part is clear except for &lt;math&gt;\pi = \pi^*&lt;/math&gt;. But we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle \pi(x), x \rangle = \|\pi(x)\|^2&lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;\pi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x - \pi(x)&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is real and so self-adjoint then. For the converse, we only have to verify &lt;math&gt;x - \pi(x) \in \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. But we have: &lt;math&gt;\pi (x - \pi(x)) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker} (\pi) = \operatorname{ker} (\pi^*) = (\operatorname{ran} (\pi))^\bot = \mathcal{M}^\bot&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

We shall now turn our attention to the spectral decomposition of a compact self-adjoint operator. Let &lt;math&gt;T:\mathfrak{H} \to \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; be a compact operator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fool's Paradise''' is an accumulation card game where certain cards have different point values and each player should try to get as many points as possible. This card game is best played with 4 to 5 players. At least 2 players are required and there is no upper limit, however as more players are playing in the same game, the game becomes less interesting and too slow.

== The Deal ==
Given a dealer (one of the players), the dealer will deal out one card to each player face down plus one card to the center face up a total of five times. All cards dealt to the center will be placed in a horizontal row (still face up). Players receiving their cards may look at their cards as soon as they are dealt (as they are being dealt). The remainder of the deck is to be place in the center face down, these cards will become the draw pile. Once each player has five cards and there are five cards face up in the center, the game begins.

== The Game ==
The player to the left of the dealer starts first.

=== A Player's Turn ===
When it is a player's turn, the player may collect cards according to the rules (read the next section). Once the player has collected his cards (if the player is able to), the player must draw one card from the draw pile into his or her hand. Upon drawing a card, the player's turn is over and the next player to the left may being his or her turn.

=== Collecting Cards ===
Collecting cards is the essence of this game. There are some complexities to collecting cards, so be sure to pay attention.

To collect a card or multiple cards, a player must first choose a card from his or her hand, and then find a card or multiple cards that sum up to a multiple of the chosen card's value, where each single card collected is less than or equal to the player's card. Card suit does not play any roll in collecting cards, only in point value (discussed later).

This is best explained with an example:

&lt;pre&gt;
Given a players hand: 2, 3, 9, K, A (of any suits)
Given the center displays: J, 2, K, 5, 6 (of any suits)

The player could play a 2 and collect a 2
The player could play a K and collect a K
The player could play a K and collect a K + (J, 2)
The player could play a K and collect a K + (5, 6, 2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the example above, here are the 4 plays explained:
# Player plays a 2, and can collect any cards that sum to a multiple of 2. Only the center 2 can be collected. The 6 cannot be collected, even though it is a multiple of 2 because the 6 is greater than 2 and no card collected can be greater than the player's card (the 2).
# The player plays a king and collects a king from the center. This would be a waste since a king is valued at 13 and other cards can be summed to create 13.
# The player plays a king and collects the king, plus the jack and the two. Since the jack and the two together make 13, they can be collected with the king.
# Finally, the most efficient play, the king collects the king, along with the 5, 6, and 2 which sum to 13 as well. This play would acquire 4 cards from the center leaving only the jack.

All cards collected by a player are placed face down in a pile next to the player.

=== Not Collecting Cards ===
There are two instances where cards will not be collected on a player's turn. 

The first is if the player cannot use any of his or her cards to collect any cards in the center. If this happens, the player must choose one card from his or her hand and lay it down in the center, then subsequently draw a card from the draw pile.

The second is if the player wishes to leave cards that would otherwise be collected in the center to be collected next round when it is the player's turn again. This can be beneficial since it allows for the player to clear the board. However, the player also opens up the opportunity for another player to steal the cards that he has left. This move is the '''Fool's Paradise'''.

=== Clearing the board ===
When a player collects the final card that is face up in the center, the player is said to have cleared the board. When this occurs, after the player collects his card from the draw pile, the dealer must deal out five cards face up to the center.

Every time a player clears the board, the player is awarded one point immediately.

=== Ending ===
The game ends when all players are without cards. The player to play the last card, whether or not he or she collects any cards with the last card, is given all remaining cards in the center. After the game ends, collected cards are inspected and counted for points.

=== Card Values ===
* Two through ten is face value
* Ace may be one or fourteen
* Jack is eleven
* Queen is twelve
* King is thirteen

== Points ==
At the end of a game, everyone must count how many points they have. Here is the break down for how to count your points.

* '''Spades''': Any spade is worth one point.
* '''Twos''': Each two is worth two points.
* '''Jack of Clubs''': The Jack of Clubs is worth '''5''' points.
* '''Most Cards Collected''': The player who collects the most cards during the round is awarded one point.

'''''NOTE''''': the '''Two of Spades''' is actually worth '''3''' points, one for '''Spades''' and two for a '''Two'''

== Winning ==
To win at Fool's Paradise, you have to be the first player to reach a certain number of points. This number should be decided upon before the game starts. A good normal number to play with is 50 points.

==Foreword==
===What is Analysis?===

Prof. Elliot Lieb of Princeton University defines analysis as the &quot;art of taking limits&quot;, and further adds that &quot;estimates are the heart and soul of analysis&quot;.  Mathematics is often roughly subdivided into analysis, algebra and topology, so the coverage of each of these fields is quite broad.  This book is concerned in particular with analysis in the context of the real numbers &amp;mdash; there are many other fields of analysis, such as complex analysis, functional analysis and harmonic analysis. It will first develop the basic concepts needed for the idea of functions, then move on to the more analysis-based topics.

===Analysis or Calculus?===
Analysis is concerned with primarily the same topics as [[Calculus]], such as limits, derivatives, and integrals, but in a mathematical way rather than in a simply practical way.  Before you study analysis, you may want to study calculus; you will end up repeating much of the same material when you come back to analysis, but you will understand its practical significance.  It may seem like a wasteful duplication of effort, but you will feel much more comfortable with many of the basic concepts of analysis.

On the other hand, when studying calculus you may be dismayed at the frequent statement of rules for performing various operations with little or no justification.  The study of analysis puts all these on a formal basis and provides that justification.

===Preliminaries===
In much of analysis, arguments must be constructed very carefully, and it must be possible to make statements very precisely.  To this end, it is important to be familiar with the notation of mathematical logic, in particular the 'for all' ( &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; ) and 'there exists' ( &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; ) notations.  This notation will be used in definitions and proofs throughout the book, and it is essential to understand what these symbols mean and how they relate to each other before attempting to understand the material presented.

The core of real analysis uses very little from other areas of mathematics. Some general fundamentals that will be useful include [[Set Theory]], especially the sections on infinite sets and [[Set Theory/Cardinals|cardinality]].  In many places, but particularly for work on Sequences, an understanding of induction and recursion (on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;) is important; however, nothing will be required that goes beyond a [[Mathematical Proof|standard introduction to proof technique]]. For some of the more advanced topics, some knowledge of [[Topology]] may be helpful. Familiarity with the concepts of Calculus will make this book easier to get through, but not necessary as all relevant concepts will be defined in the text when needed.

Note also that some minimal background in Linear Algebra is assumed in the chapter on Multivariable analysis, but this is optional as no other chapter is dependent on this one.

===Advice for Readers===
Like all math Wikibooks, [[Real Analysis]] is encyclopedic. Unlike most print books, it has not been designed to supplement any course or instruction. As such, it contains several ideas and concepts stacked together which might baffle the uninitiated reader. We plan to have a major reorganisation of the contents and also to provide a guide to readers so as to make the best use of this book. Also a major problem with this book in particular is the lack of comprehensive exercises, especially in the later chapters.

Editors are invited to contribute towards any of these improvements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Describing World Religions

Religion is a multifaceted subject area. Religions differ in their histories, what their adherents believe, their geographic range and statistical characteristics, their art and literature, philosophies, medical traditions, practices, and so on. How would you go about describing religions?

It would have something to do with why you want to describe the religion. Two of the three resources I've given below approach the issue from a position of understanding other religions for the purpose of effectively evangelizing them. I won't be doing that here and the reason that I included those two resources is that they happen to be accurate and informative. Instead of emphasizing the negative characteristics of the religions (as a similar work might have done, say, a century ago), they strive to be accurate.

I intend to proceed systematically and will include the following sections under each religion:

Names and meanings of the names: There is often confusion related to the names of a religion. For instance, what does &quot;Jewish&quot; mean. Is it the name of a race, a nationality, or a religion?

Adherents: What is the geographic range and makeup of the adherents of each religion at the time of posting?

History: When, where, and by whom was the religion founded and who did it become as it is now? Religions are dynamic systems and almost never stand still over time.

Major scriptures. Most of the sources of world religions are available on the Internet for free so that it's easy to find out specifically what a religion says about any particular thing - at least, as far as the orthodox position.

Denominations: Few religions come in only one flavor. I will describe the major branches of each religion.

Specific beliefs: What do the adherents of each religion thing about God, Humanity, Animals, the primary problems of Humanity and their solutions, the spirit, death, and the afterlife, morality, proselytizing, and society.

Glossary: Finally, I will present a glossary of terms specific to each religion.

The major religions appeared over a period of 3000 years - from 1500 BC to 1500 AD. Two periods of time saw the appearances of many religions. In the Axial Age, between 800 and 200 BC, Buddhism, Taoism, Shinto, and Confucianism were founded along with Greek philosophy and the rise of the major prophets in Israel. Then again, the last two centuries saw a proliferation of new religions and return of ancient religions long dead.

Major milestones were:

c. 1500 BC The rise of Hinduism in the area of present day India.
c. 1440 BC Proposed date of the Exodus, the initial event in both Judaism and Jewish nationalism
c. 660 BC reign of Jimmu Tenno, the traditional beginning on Shinto
c. 600 BC The life of Lao Tze, traditional founder of Taoism
563 BC  Traditional date of the birth of the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama
551 BC Traditional date of the birth of Confucius
c. 30 The crucifixion of Jesus
622  Mohammad arrived in Medina
1440 Birth of the Indian mystic Kabir, founder of Sikhism

Objects of art, as forms of communication of deeper meaning than is possible with technical writing and speech, are important in most religion. Inspired writing (writing thought to be produced under the direct guidance of deity) form the scriptures of the great religions, but creeds, commentaries, devotional literature, and educational materials are also important. Most religions also have a hymnology of music which conveys ideas central to the religions. Added to those, relics, architecture of holy places, recorded sermons form a rich heritage of the religions.

Few religions exist in a pure form - most have branches resulting from internal disagreements and variational interpretations of scriptures and denominations. There are thousands of denominations  today but we will look at the major branches of the world religions.

World religions form a kaleidoscopic tapestry of tradition and society that would (and does) fill encyclopedias. Hopefully, this work will give more than a superficial introduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Religions, denominations, sects, and cults

Before we begin describing the individual religions, we need to be clear on a few general terms. &quot;Religion&quot;, &quot;denomination&quot;, &quot;sect&quot;, &quot;cult&quot; - these terms do not have commonly agreed upon meanings. The best we can do when using them is to define what we mean before hand, so let me do that here.

I will use the definition already in use in the other books of this series for &quot;religion&quot;. Religion is &quot;the study and/or practice of what is generally considered to be religion - personal or organized.&quot; (From Theology 1: Philosophy of Religion - What is religion?). An adherent is a person who accepts the basic tenants of a religion. Every adherent has a slightly (or much more than slightly) different take on their religion and that makes for a great deal of complexity when talking about specific religions. For instance, I can say that all Catholics believe that the wine of the Eucharist is changed into the blood of Christ but I'm sure that a Catholic can be found that doesn't believe this. Just keep in mind that, when I talk about religions, I am overgeneralizing by necessity and am sticking to the main &quot;party line&quot; while describing some (but by no means all) major variations.

An orthodox belief is a belief that is supported by the primary tradition of a religion. A heterodox belief is one that is not. A heresy is a heterodoxy that is condemned by the authoritative clergy of a religion.

The word &quot;creed&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;credo&quot; which means &quot;I believe&quot;. A creed, then, is an authoritative statement of the central beliefs in a religion. A doctrine is a body of beliefs about a particular topic in a religion - particularly a collections of concepts which are actively taught within that religion. A dogma is a belief that is so established in a religion that it is accepted without question.

Almost all religions have variations that result from different interpretations of fundamental scriptures, traditions, or teachings. those variations are called &quot;denominations&quot;. They are &quot;spin-offs&quot; of a parent religion. The term &quot;sect&quot; will apply to a denomination that is considered by the parent religion to be extreme or heretical but which becomes firmly established over time.

The term &quot;cult&quot; is difficult but important. It was originally a synonym of &quot;denomination&quot; but has evolved to have a darker usage. I do not want to use it in its most extreme sense of a dangerous or destructive body of religious beliefs but I will use it in its milder sense as a specific religion which is characterized by a central, authoritative, charismatic leader that exerts considerable power over the adherents of the religion.

Most of these definitions seem to be quite in line with what most people mean when they use the words. It's most important that you know what I mean when I use them.

The original religion among denominations may or may not exist currently but it can often be approximately described by original scriptures and by comparing commonalities among the denominations. For instance, much of Buddhism today is drastically different from the Buddha's original intention but there is a conceptual &quot;core&quot; Buddhism. Also, the range of variation in shamanism is vast but a core shamanism can be recognized by looking at the more &quot;primitive&quot; Siberian forms and by comparing the other forms.

The term &quot;core&quot; does not seem to be commonly used but it will come in handy here and I will use it occasionally. Also see it's use in the reference cited below.

I am Italian and I live in Italy.

I wrote a book about computer programming in Italian, and on the May 3rd 2008 I published it in my Web site: [http://digilander.libero.it/carlmila/cpp_ottimizzato.html C++ Ottimizzato].

On May 11th 2008 I published it as the Italian wikibook [http://it.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ottimizzare_C%2B%2B Ottimizzare C++].

On May 24th 2008 I started to translate it from Italian into the English wikibook [[Optimizing C++]].

== Preface ==
[[File:C++Stopwatch.png|right]]
=== Audience ===
This book is for intermediate C++ programmers (i.e. studying C++ for at least one year) who want to improve the performance of the software they develop.

=== Subject ===
This book contains guidelines and advices on how to write efficient software using the C++ language.  Software correctness and maintainability are taken into account, but are not the primary concerns of the guidelines.

Most of the guidelines presented  are not platform specific, and so are applicable to every processor, to every compiler, and to every operating system; the few platform specific advices try to cover most platforms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Optimizing C++}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

One of the main reason for preferring '''C++''' over simpler, higher-level programming languages is that C++ allows the construction of complex software in a way that makes more efficient use of hardware resources than when using these other languages. The language does not guarantee efficient code automatically, but provides a toolchest that aids programmers in the pursuit of efficiency. Sloppy C++ code may be no more efficient than higher-level implementations of the same algorithms, but a good C++ programmer with knowledge of the language can write software that is efficient from the first cut and then '''optimize''' the code further. This book provides techniques for writing efficient code and for optimizing existing software.

Often, there is no single solution to a programming problem that is optimal for all cases. Thus, [[:w:Optimization (computer science)|optimization]] generally does not mean writing optimally performing software; rather, it means incrementally changing ([[:w:Code refactoring|refactoring]]) software to increase it's performance, bringing it closer to optimality.

Such optimization requires that the software source is written in a sufficiently modular way that performance critical parts can be isolated. With suitably written code, it then requires the use of tools, libraries, knowledge and time to change those parts in a way that increases the overall execution speed of the software.

Nowadays, many optimizations are already performed by compilers and are no longer the programmer's burden. This book discusses higher-level optimizations that present-day compilers are not (yet) able to perform.

This book is aimed at readers already familiar with the C++ language, who want to use it to develop high performance application software or software libraries.

Almost all of the optimization techniques presented are platform independent and, therefore, there will be few references to specific operating systems, processor architectures or compilers.
However, some of the presented techniques may be ineffective or inapplicable in some combinations of operating system/processor/compiler.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Optimizing C++}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The construction of an efficient application should adhere to the following development process:
# [[w:Software design|'''Design''']]. Firstly, the algorithms and data structures are designed in a way that makes sense for the application logic and that is reasonably efficient, but without considering optimization. When designing a widely used data structure the optimal implementation of which is not obvious (for example, it is debated whether it is better to use an array or a linked list), an [[w:Abstract data type|abstract structure]] is defined for which the implementation may be changed at the optimization stage.
# '''Implementation'''. Secondly, the code that implements the designed algorithms is written, following guidelines to avoid inefficient operations and encapsulating operations that are likely to require optimization.
# [[w:Software testing|'''Functional testing''']]. The resulting software is then tested to increase the probability that it doesn't have crippling defects.
# [[w:Optimization (computer science)|'''Optimization''']] (aka ''Tuning''). After having completed the development of a correctly working application, the optimization stage begins, with the following sub-stages:
## [[w:Software performance testing|'''Performance testing''']]. Commands with inadequate performance are detected. These are commands that, when processing typical data, require more resources (CPU time, storage space, etc) than are available.
## [[w:Performance analysis|'''Profiling''']] (aka ''Performance analysis''). For every command with inadequate performance, a profiler is used to determine which portions of code are the so-called [[w:Bottleneck (engineering)|''bottlenecks'']] for that command. Bottlenecks are parts of code where a disproportionate amount of time is spent or memory space is allocated.
## '''Algorithmic optimization'''. For each bottleneck, optimization techniques are applied that are largely independent of the programming language and totally independent of the platform. Such techniques can be found in algorithm theory textbooks. This optimization involves  attempting to reduce the number of executed machine cycles. In particular it involves reducing the number of calls to costly routines or transforming expensive operations into equivalent but less costly operations. For example, the [[w:Quick_sort|''quick sort'']] sorting algorithm is chosen instead of the [[w:Selection_sort|''selection sort'']] algorithm. If this makes the program fast enough, the optimization stage is complete.
## '''Platform independent optimization'''. For each bottleneck, optimization techniques are applied that depend upon the programming language and its standard library but that are independent of both the software and hardware platforms. For example, integer operations are used instead of floating point operations or a more appropriate container class is chosen from those available in the standard library. If this makes the program fast enough, the optimization stage is complete.
## '''Software platform dependent optimization'''. For each bottleneck, optimization techniques are applied that depend upon both the programming language and the software platform but that are independent of the hardware platform. For example, compiler options, ''pragma'' compiler directives, language extensions, non-standard libraries, direct calls to the operating system are exploited. If this makes the program fast enough, the optimization stage is complete.
## '''Hardware platform dependent optimization'''. For each bottleneck, optimization techniques that depend upon the hardware platform are applied.  This can involve using machine instructions that are specific to a processor family or using more generally available high level features that are particularly advantageous on some processor types.

This development process follows two criteria:

* '''Principle of diminishing returns'''. Optimizations that yield big results with little effort should be applied first, as this minimizes the time needed to reach the performance goals.
* '''Principle of diminishing portability'''. It is better to apply optimizations applicable to several platforms first, as they remain applicable on changing platform and are more understandable to other programmers.

In the rare case of software that must be used with several compilers and several operating systems but just one processor architecture, the stages 4.5 and 4.6 should be swapped.

This stage sequence is not meant to be a one-way sequence, in which once one stage is reached, the preceding stage is no longer used. In fact, every stage may succeed or fail.
If a stage succeeds, the next stage is applied, while if a stage fails, the previous stage is repeated, in a sort of backtracking algorithm.

In addition, a partial performance test should be performed after every optimization attempt, just to check whether the attempt was useful and, if so, to check whether more optimizations are needed.

Finally, after having completed the optimization, both the functional testing and the complete performance testing must be repeated to guarantee that the newly optimized version of the software is still functionally correct and has suitable performance.

This book is about only three of the above stages:
* Stage 2, specifically the usage of the C++ language, in the chapter &quot;Writing efficient code&quot;.
* Some general techniques for stage 4.3, with examples in C++, in chapter &quot;General optimization techniques&quot;.
* Stage 4.4, specifically the usage of the C++ language, in the chapter &quot;Code optimization&quot;.

== Conventions ==

By [[w:Object (computer_science)|'''object''']], it is meant an allocated region of memory.
In particular, a piece of data associated to a variable of a fundamental type (like &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unsigned long&lt;/code&gt;, or a pointer) is an object, as it is such the data structure associated to an instance of a class.
With every variable an object is associated, whose size is given by the &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt; C++ operator, but an object could have no variable associated with it, or several variables associated with it.
For example, a pointer is an object, but it can point to another object; this pointed object is not associated with any variable.
On the other hand, in the following code, both the variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and the variable &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are associated with the same object:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int a;
int&amp; b = a;
&lt;/source&gt;

Arrays, structs, and class instances are objects which, if not empty, contain sub-objects.
Therefore, they will be called ''aggregate'' objects.

We say that an object '''owns''' another object when the destruction of the former object causes the destruction of the latter.
For example, a non-empty &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; object typically contains a pointer to a buffer containing all the elements; the destruction of the &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; causes the destruction of such buffer, and therefore we say that this buffer is ''owned'' by the &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; object.

Some optimizations are useful only for short data sequences, others for longer sequences.
Later on, the following classification will be used for objects sizes:
* '''Tiny''': No more than 8 bytes. It fits in one or two 32-bit registers or in one 64-bit register.
* '''Small''': More than 8 bytes, but no more than 64 bytes. It doesn't fit in a processor register, but it fits in a processor data cache line, and it can be wholly referenced by very compact machine instructions using an offset from the start address.
* '''Medium''': More than 64 bytes, but no more than 4096 bytes. It doesn't fit in a processor data cache line, and it cannot be wholly referenced by compact machine instructions, but it fits in the processor first-level data cache, it fits in a virtual memory page, and it fits in a mass storage cluster of blocks.
* '''Large''': More than 4096 bytes. It doesn't fit in the processor first-level data cache, it doesn't fit in a single virtual memory page, and it doesn't fits in a single mass storage cluster of blocks.

For example, an array of &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;s is considered ''tiny'' only if it contains exactly one element, ''small'' if it has 2 to 8 elements, ''medium'' if it has 9 to 512 numbers, ''large'' if it has more than 512 of them.

Because there are very different hardware architectures, the given numbers are only an indication.
Though, such numbers are rather realistic, and can be taken as serious criteria to develop software covering the main architectures in a rather efficient way.

== [[Methods Manual for Salt Lake Studies]] ==

Looks like you got a great start on this book. I just wanted to remind you that all the modules of the book (all the [[Special:PrefixIndex/Methods Manual for Salt Lake Studies/|subpages]]) should be categorized into [[:Category:Methods Manual for Salt Lake Studies]] by adding &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Methods Manual for Salt Lake Studies|{{SUBPAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the bottom. This will help you keep things organized in the long run. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:05, 25 May 2008 (UTC)

== A note on recent uploads ==

I've noticed your good work on the [[Methods Manual for Salt Lake Studies]] book, and your recent uploads. Regarding your diagrams, I wanted to bring the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format to your attention. [[Inkscape]] is an excellent, free program to create SVG images.

You also uploaded GIF images of equations. You can actually generate equations with [[LaTeX]] markup. See [[meta:Help:Displaying a formula]] for more. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:20, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

: Hi Swift, Mmmmm, I did take  quick look at the page on Tex and even tried to write one of the formulas in it but I must be thicker than the average bear because it looked terrible in the preview, so I quickly ran away and hid. I may try again when I pick up courage. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction[[User:Peri Coleman|Peri Coleman]] ([[User talk:Peri Coleman|talk]]) 07:32, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

:: You're welcome. Remember that you can always request assistance in the [[Wikibooks:reading room|reading room]]s.
:: Would something like &lt;math&gt;\text{plancton} = \frac\text{no of plancton}\text{no of cells} \times 10^3&lt;/math&gt; help? Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:06, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

Ta muchly, Swift! I have spent some time messing around, based on the formula you demonstrated, and I think I have both of them set out correctly now. [[User:Peri Coleman|Peri Coleman]] ([[User talk:Peri Coleman|talk]]) 23:22, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

: Glad to hear! If you don't plan to use the images any more, and don't think they will be of use for other Wikibookians, you can tag them for deletion. See the welcome message above for instructions. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:32, 3 March 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for reminding me - I had forgotten that an uploaded file had an existence outside the page it was displayed on. I have hunted down the files and I think I have put the deletion request in, but it looks a bit odd. I guess I will see if they disappear or not![[User:Peri Coleman|Peri Coleman]] ([[User talk:Peri Coleman|talk]]) 07:13, 3 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Capillary effects are very important at small scales (see previous chapter [Physics_at_smaller_scales]).

They appear at interfaces between a liquid and another material liquid, gas, or solid.

The interfaces give rise to a '''surface tension''' that rules the dynamics of this interface.



Creating a new interface costs a work
:&lt;math&gt;E=\sigma \, A,&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; the surface tension (in N/m) and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the area of the interface. For water/air interface the value of surface tension at 20°C is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sigma=73\times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;N/m.

This surface tension gives rise to a common phenomenon: liquid droplets tend to become spheres in order to minimize their surface.

== Origin: internal adhesion energies ==
[[Image:CreatingNewInterface.svg|thumb|300px|left|Creating a new interface in two steps]]
Because of '''Van der Waals forces''', liquid molecules are attracted by their neighbours, which gives rise to an adhesion energy of the liquid to itself.

The value of surface tension in between two immiscible liquids (labeled 1 &amp; 2) can be understood by dividing the creation of a new interface in steps
* Step 1:  separation of free surfaces within each liquids
It costs 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E=\gamma_{11}\frac{A}{2}&lt;/math&gt; in fluid 1, with &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{11}&lt;/math&gt; the adhesion energy of the fluid to itself. 
The origin of this adhesion in a liquid is Van der Waals attraction. We cut here only half of the final surface.
Cutting the same surface in the other liquid costs: 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E =\gamma_{22}\frac{A}{2}&lt;/math&gt; in fluid 2. 
* Step 2:  assemble free surfaces
Flattening the free surfaces produces a new surface &lt;math&gt;2 \times A/2=A&lt;/math&gt;. Their assembly generates a work
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Delta E =-\gamma_{12}A,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is the adhesion energy of liquid 1 on liquid 2.

In total we obtain a total work &lt;math&gt;\Delta E=\gamma_{11}\frac{A}{2}+\gamma_{22}\frac{A}{2}-\gamma_{12}A.&lt;/math&gt; 

The value of surface tension is thus
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\frac{1}{2}\gamma_{11}+\frac{1}{2}\gamma_{22}-\gamma_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

== Young-Laplace law: how surface tension creates pressures ==
[[Image:Young-LaplacePressure.svg|thumb|100px|left|Sphere]]
At mechanical equilibrium a small change in sphere radius &lt;math&gt;dR&lt;/math&gt; does not create any work (forces are balanced):
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W=-\Delta P dV+\sigma dA=0&lt;/math&gt;
From this equation we obtain that pressure is higher in a sphere by
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P=\frac{2\sigma}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

As a numerical example, we compute the capillary pressure in a bubble of radius 1 micrometer in water: it is 1.4 atm!

This formula can be generalized for arbitrary curved surfaces:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P=\sigma (\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}),&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; the radii of curvature in the principal planes.

== Surface tension can break cylindrical jets ==
 Write a section about the capillary instability ??

== Wetting on solid surfaces ==
[[Image:DropletOnSurface.svg|thumb|400px|left|Droplet on a surface]]

Near the '''contact line''', three interfaces meet:
* the liquid-gas interface, which has a surface tension &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{liquid-gas}&lt;/math&gt;, which was noted &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; previously
* the solid-liquid interface, of surface tension &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{solid-liquid}&lt;/math&gt;
* the solid-gaz interface, of surface tension &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{solid-gas}&lt;/math&gt;

The equilibrium of forces, is vectorial sum of forces that vanishes.
Along the horizontal axis it provides the '''Young-Dupré relation''' at the contact line:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{solid-liquid}+\sigma \cos \theta=\sigma_{solid-gas},&lt;/math&gt;
where we have introduced the '''contact angle''' &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.
Along the vertical axis we have
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma \sin \theta= N,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; being the reaction from the solid. This shows clearly that the droplet is pulling the surface. This effect can be seen if a droplet is deposited on fresh paint: the contact line will pull a rim that will remain.

The contact line exists only if 
:&lt;math&gt;-1&lt;\cos \theta =\frac{\sigma_{solid-gas}-\sigma_{solid-liquid}}{\sigma}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; 

There are therefore three cases:
[[Image:Wetting.svg|thumb|400px|left|Different wetting states of a droplet]]
=== Total wetting ===
The liquid spreads, and form a film coating the surface.
It happens when  &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_{solid-gas}-\sigma_{solid-liquid})/{\sigma}&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{solid-gas}&gt;\sigma_{solid-liquid}+\sigma&lt;/math&gt;,  it costs a lot of energy to have a bare solid.   

=== Partial wetting ===
The contact line existence condition is satisfied, &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;(\sigma_{solid-gas}-\sigma_{solid-liquid})/{\sigma}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. 
Two cases can be distinguished:
* hydrophilic surface: &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\theta &lt;90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
* hydrophobic surface: &lt;math&gt;90^\circ&lt;\theta &lt;180^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

=== No wetting ===
The liquid droplet pearls, and assumes a perfectly spherical shape. It occurs on surfaces such that &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_{solid-gas}-\sigma_{solid-liquid})/{\sigma}&lt;-1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{solid-liquid}&gt;\sigma_{solid-gas}+\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the solid does not like to be covered.

These surfaces can be found in Nature: observe what happens a on droplet falling on a lotus leaf. Microscopically these surfaces are covered with little pillars.


== Driving droplet on surfaces with surface tension gradient ==

 Drawing Cartoons showing a droplet on a surface with a heater or an electrode on one side ??
External modifications of the solid-liquid surface energy will provide forces to move small droplets.
A droplet direction can be imprinted using gradients in surface energy.

=== Thermowetting ===

The solid-liquid surface energy increases with temperature.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\sigma_{solid-liquid}}{dT}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
If the heating is very local, the hoter side of droplet will becomes more expensive in terms of surface energy. The drop will tend to minimize its surface energy by going to the cooler side. 

=== Electrowetting ===

A voltage can be applied on a droplet, if the surface is an electrode and an other electrode is in contact with the liquid droplet. 
A voltage difference &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; changes the surface energy by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^{EW}_{solid-liquid}=\sigma_{solid-liquid}-c\frac{V^2}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the surfacic capacitance.

If only one side of the droplet is sitting on an electrode, the droplet will move towards the electrode, since surface energy is lower there.

Note that electrodes can be insulated to prevent electrolysis of liquids: the technique is called electrowetting on a dielectric (EWOD).

== Driving droplets or bubbles in channels acting on surface tension ==
 Draw a Cartoons showing droplet or bubbles in a channel ??

It is possible to move droplet or bubbles squeezed in microchannels, 
even if there liquid is totally wetting the solid.
The method is to modify the liquid-gas surface tension (instead of the solid-liquid surface tension).

===  Thermocapillary forcing ===
Heating a liquid decreases its surface tension (it is the reverse with the solid-liquid surface tension). 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\sigma_{liquid-gas}}{dT}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;
A long drop or bubble  with a side hotter than the other will move towards the hotter places to reduce the total energy.

=== Electrocapillary forcing ===

If the droplet/bubble is charged on its surface after having been in contact with an electrode, it can be moved afterwards if is submitted to a voltage gradient. 
The electric potential of the droplet decreases when charges are closer to the electrode carrying the opposite charge.

== Surfactants ==

=== Molecules ===

'''Surfactants''' are molecules that have an affinity with surfaces. They change the surface tension, and are therefore named '''tensio-active''' molecules. 
Usually they are amphiphilic molecules. Amphi- is a Greek prefix, also found in the word amphitheater, meaning dual. Indeed they have both an hydrophilic part and an hydrophobic  part. For instance soap molecules have a carboxylic (hydrophilic head) and a long lipidic (hydrophobic chain). At low concentration they all go at the interface, while at high concentration they tend to form micelles.

 Draw a cartoon with surfactants at surface and in a micelle ??


=== Effect on surface tension ===

They lower the surface tension compared to that of water. A free surface has a tension &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;=73 mN/m. Surface tension decreases down to a plateau, when the surface is fully covered with surfactant molecules, presenting their lipidic tail to the gas. At this point surface tension is close to that of a lipid surface, around 30 mN/M. The saturation occurs at the critical micellar concentration (CMC), when  surface is full and addition of molecules creates new micelles in the liquid.

=== Detergent ===

Surfactants have a detergent effect: they cover the surface of lipid droplets, which helps the detachment by favoring formation of a water film in between the droplet and substrate (cloth!).

 Draw a cartoon with around a droplet partially wetting a substrate ??

=== Stabilizer ===

 Draw  a cartoon showing a liquid film in between two droplets/bubbles ??
Surfactants prevent the break-up of thin liquid films separating droplets in an emulsion or bubbles in a foam. They stabilize the thin liquid films of a soap bubble!

== Droplet and bubble formation in microfluidic circuits ==

The inkjet printer involves the formation of tiny droplets of inks. Tiny droplet or bubbles are promising nanoliter containers: they do not have real walls, contain a very small amount of liquid. It is possible to create them, transport them and finally coalesce them with other. 

A first basic operation is droplet formation.

=== Human scale ===
 Drawing of a droplet detaching from a tap ??

We all have seen the formation of a liquid drop at the exit of a tap. If you slowly open the tap, the droplet volumes increases until its weight is larger than the capillary force. The droplets then detaches and falls. 
The forces in presence are:
* the capillary force of magnitude &lt;math&gt;2\pi R_{tap} \sigma,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;R_{tap}&lt;/math&gt; the tap exit radius
* the gravity force of magnitude &lt;math&gt;4\pi r_{droplet}^3/3,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the droplet size.
The droplet detaches when the radius &lt;math&gt;r_{droplet}&lt;/math&gt; is such that gravity force is at least equal to capillary force. We obtain that:
:&lt;math&gt;r_{droplet}\sim \left( \frac{R_{tap} \sigma}{\rho g}\right)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;
reducing the tap radius does not decrease quickly the drop radius, and droplets are getting very large in front of the tap radius at small scales.
We see again that gravity forces become ineffective in front of capillary forces at small scales.

Another strategy, that does not involve gravity, should be considered.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== mktime ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
time_t mktime( struct tm *time );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The mktime() function converts the local time in ''time'' to calendar time, and returns it. If there is an error, -1 is returned.

      <text xml:space="preserve">School Psychology is the specialty of applying psychological theories, methods and interventions to children and the school community system. Within school psychology, there are several areas of application. 

''Assessment''
There is the area of assessment of intelligence, emotional functioning and educational/learning needs. This application is one reason that school districts maintain school psychologists. This is an area that is mandated within special education law.

''Counseling''
School psychologists provide individual and group counseling in schools as part of their role in meeting the needs of children both who are classified and mandated for counseling as part of their special education needs and for children who may be at risk for developing problems and would benefit from counseling as a preventive intervention.

''Consultation''
The school psychologist often functions as a consultant with parents, teachers and administrators to help develop or modify educational programs and approaches, behavior management methods, and other interventions to meet the social, emotional, behavioral and educational needs of students. This approach is one of the most cost-effective and efficient methods of utilizing the expertise of a psychologist in a school system and community.

School psychologists are also able to provide expertise in areas of school development such as research, program development, committee projects, staff development, classroom workshops and parenting classes among other possible roles.

A key role of school psychologists is to work within the special education system and help administer assessments and individualized education within the legal framework of the special education law, Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, often referred to as IDEA. Within IDEA, there are thirteen disability categories which have specific criteria within the law.

&lt;u&gt;Disability Categories under IDEA
&lt;/u&gt;

1. Autism
2. Deaf-Blindness
3. Deafness
4. Emotional Disturbance
5. Hearing Impairment
6. Mental Retardation
7. Multiple Disabilities
8. Orthopedic Impairment
9. Other Health Impairment
10. Specific Learning Disability
11. Speech or Language Impairment
12. Traumatic Brain Injury
13. Visual Impairment Including Blindness

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &lt;u&gt;Introduction&lt;/u&gt; ==
Behavior analysis is the science of behavior, consisting of basic research and an applied technologies.  The focus is on observable, measurable behavior and the role of the environment in establishing and maintaining behaviors.

&lt;u&gt;[[Behavior Analysis/Table of Contents]]&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Brief History&lt;/u&gt;

The foundations for Behavior Analysis are found in the experimental psychologies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially the work of Ivan Pavlov (&quot;The Conditioned Reflex&quot;) and Edward Thorndike.  Methods of experimental psychology established by these researchers for approaching the subject of behavior were based on these researchers.

&lt;u&gt;Assumptions of Behavior Analysis&lt;/u&gt;

1.  Behavior is not random, but is rather governed by lawful principles.&lt;br&gt;
2.  Principles of behavior apply to all species.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Research in Behavior Analysis&lt;/u&gt;

1.  Single subject design versus statistical analysis of group differences.&lt;br&gt;
2.  Generalization across species, settings, and subjects.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Examples of Applied Behavior Analysis&lt;/u&gt;

1. By observing and interviewing people who interact with an individual with disabilities, it is possible to hypothesize that the individual is hurting himself in order to get other people's attention. Following this assessment and hypothesis, the individual is taught a simple picture communication system which is easier to use than words for him. By then providing attention to the individual when he points to the appropriate picture card that communicates need for attention, the self-injury behavior stops.

2. A student creates disruption and is sent out of the classroom frequently. A behavior analysis indicates he is probably acting disruptively in order to be sent out of the room. Instead of sending him out of the room, he is asked to continue working if he wants to get a positive consequence later (e.g., get to go to recess). Now, he would rather work and get recess than have to stay in the class during recess. The disruptive behavior no longer served the function of allowing escape and the required behavior ended up serving the function more effectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Number properties ==
There are several sets of numbers:
# Counting or Natural numbers are numbers that can be used to count real things: 1, 2, 3,...
# Integers (including 0) include the natural numbers and their opposites: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3
#* Even integers are divisible by 2, and can be given by 2n, where n is any integer: 0, 2, 4, 6,...
#* Odd integers are not divisible by 2, and can be given by 2n-1, where n is any integer: -1, 1, 3, 5,...
# Rational numbers can be expressed as a fraction: -2, -1/2, 3/5, 7/15,...
# Irrational numbers are non-repeating, non-terminating decimals: π, ''e'', &amp;radic;2
# Real numbers include all of the above.

Numbers can be ''prime''. That is, they are divisible by themselves and one, only. 1 is not considered a prime number, and 2 is the only even prime number. The first eight prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19,...

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Kendallpic.jpg|right]]Thank you for visiting my user page!!  My name is Kendall Miller, and I am currently residing in Williamsburg, VA. Dancing is my passion, although never having professional training, and I love going to hear live music. In the previous year, I enjoyed my position as a Recreation Leader for the before and after school program in James City County Schools. My involvement with the program continues, and obviously I view it as a precursor to a lifelong career in teaching.  My grade level preference is ranging between 3rd and 6th grade, even realizing the spectacular variances among the span.  

I firmly support the notion that each child embodies innate and purposeful qualities, which upon discovering, makes him or her a valuable contributor in the learning process.  I often witness that students' confidence level parallels their learning capabilities in elementary and middle school, therefore I place much importance on enabling students to see themselves as individuals with specific positive abilities.  With the basic understanding that no two children learn in exactly the same manner, it is the teacher's responsibility to  help students relate to the material.  

I believe that those with special needs deserve to be considered on a 'case-by-case' premise to ensure the best fitting circumstances are put-forth.  The inclusion of special needs students with the majority of the class is valuable, because sensitivity can increase on the part of the non-special needs children. This integration encourages them to view disabled or challenged students similarly to themselves. Of course challenging scenarios will arise, yet as long as the educator promotes positive interactions and respect, the benefits can be tremendous.  Right now, since I do not have experience teaching, my opinion on grouping according to skill level wavers.  In segregating and labeling, students come to know themselves as having a particular level of intelligence.  On the other hand, working within different comfort levels serves to ease pressure. I expect to be formulating more precise ideas on these and other topics, so stay tuned!</text>

RE: Reader Response

Hi Stacy!

Thank you for taking the time to read and respond to my article on including GLBTQ students in the classroom. It was a very interesting topic to explore and an important one. I agree with your sentiment these students should be taken care of and treated the same as any other student. My hope is, as more students decide to come out at younger ages, that teachers will learn more and come to accept them. [[User:Mworr002|Mworr002]] ([[User talk:Mworr002|talk]]) 00:56, 30 June 2008 (UTC)

Hi Stacy.  My name is Jessica, and I'm a music education major.  Although social studies has never been my favorite subject, one of my favorite teachers taught the subject.  :-)  You discussed that you wanted to include non-biased multicultural information and activities in your teaching, are their any specific cultural subjects you feel teachers tend to ignore or show bias toward?  Have you or do you intend to study or teach abroad?  If so, where did you go and how was the experience?  If you could teach anywhere in the world, where and what would you teach?  
[[User:Jmetc001|Jmetc001]] ([[User talk:Jmetc001|talk]]) 02:49, 2 June 2008 (UTC)

Hey Stacy.  You have a great user page.  I agree, 100%, that a classroom should be a democracy with the teacher acting as the president.  It is vital that the students have a voice and feel like they matter in their class.  It helps ease any apprehension about asking questions and so forth.  Good luck with everything :)

Stacy!  I love the fact that you can identify with and take parts from different philosophies.  The way you plan to run your classroom sounds idealistic but very possible with organization.  Everything you mentioned in your teaching philosophy is absolutely necessary for students to become more than just little people, for them to learn how to be responsible citizens and effective learners.  You mentioned multiculturalism and exposing students to different views; do you think differentiation will be hard to achieve in your larger classes?  Also, I'm subbing too, right now, to meet some administration.  What has been your biggest challenge, just out of curiosity?  Good luck with the class.  Have a great one!

Hey Stacy, 

It's Jessica again responding to your last post:

'''Jessica, Hi this is Stacy you reviewed my article, Educational Milestones of the 21st Century. First off I wanted to say that I really appreciate the time and effort that you put into reading my article and making notes on areas to which I could improve I really appreciate it. I next wanted to respond back to a comment that you had made about one of the possible answers to a multiple choice question of mine. In my research for the article my husband and I started talking about Darpanet and how it is associated with what he does in the air force. I put down that possible answer just as a goofy thing that I do, there are no more classrooms that use darpanet. I did not want you to think that I was crazy or anything. Sthur002 (talk) 21:06, 14 June 2008 (UTC)'''

I didn't think you were crazy.  :-)  I had actually never heard of Darapnet, until I read it as one of the question answers.  I had to look it up online.  I think it's great to include things outside the box.  It made me learn something new.  I'm curious though, does anybody use darapanet?  And what is the basic difference between that and the internet network we use today?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anaphora subscription''' is the process by which one (the narrator) may unambiguously refer a sumti or bridi/selbri by using a cmavo instead (such as a pro-sumti or pro-bridi, respetively), but in some manner other than the default of the pro-sumti/pro-bridi.  This method employs Lojban numerals and the entire cmavo-subscript-numeral reference is usually written as one word.

== Vocabulary ==

 xi               &lt;u&gt;(cmavo)&lt;/u&gt; with sub(script)/further previous reference &lt;u&gt;(numeral)&lt;/u&gt;
              Where any of the above word(s) is/are enclosed in parenthesis ()
               and is/are &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt;, replace the said word with that intended

== Additional Notes and/or Examples ==

*[lo smuci .i lo forca .i la rik. pilno rixire .i la .alis. pilno riximu] 
:=  A spoon.  A fork.  Rick uses (ri-sub-two = repeat penultimate = &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;'''a fork'''&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;).  Alice uses (ri-sub-five = repeat fifth-from-last/second from antepenultimate = &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;'''a spoon'''&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;).
*[go'ixire] is the same as [go'e].
*[faxixa] refers to the 6th sumti position of a brivla.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Scope and Introduction==
Salt lakes provide an excellent opportunity to study systems that are relatively unstudied.  The unique features of these lakes - the arid environments in which they occur, the varied ionic composition of their brines, and the ephemericity of many of these lakes, provide challenges for the researcher.

Methods developed for use in freshwater environments may not provide usable, or reliable, results in saline systems. Many analyses require dilution of samples to reduce salt effects, and this reduces the sensitivity of the analysis, sometimes to the point of uselessness. The challenges of measuring the characteristics of saline and hypersaline systems have been addressed by many authors over the years, however the modified methods they have proposed are scattered throughout the literature.

It is hoped that this manual will provide researchers and students of salt lakes with a comprehensive reference to methods used in salt lake studies.

'''TARL, the topic of this page is beyond obsolete''', it is now defunct. The private individual, Steve Forget hosting and running the Trainzhaven website, at &lt;nowiki&gt;
http://trainz.ws/tarl/&lt;/nowiki&gt; was doing so as a Greater Trainz Community service despite becoming relatively disinterested in regular Trainzing due to the time demands of a busy life. Unfortunately, after over three years of good citizenship Steve's site (TARL MK1) fell victim to a lightening strike&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?52447-Notice-of-Intent-on-Project-TARM Lightning Strike documented], February 11th, 2010, 08:02 PM, accessdate=2014-0317&lt;/ref&gt;, which also took out many of  the backups.  He and all contributors certainly earned all our thanks; especially valuable hard work was put in by Ianwoodmore, Bob Weber, Pencil42 and Spruce&amp;mdash;who among others such as Pcas1986 are behind TARDIS (or parts of it), the current replacement. 

Steve Forget advised the community he was pulling the plug on efforts to reconstitute the services (known as TARL MK2) August 17th, 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?15040-Future-of-the-TARL-amp-Trainzhaven Future of the TARL &amp; Trainzhaven ], August 17th, 2007, 03:51 AM, Accessdate=2014-0317&lt;/ref&gt;, though there was an interval when some others tried to manage the load while he continued to host it. 
 
Subsequently, TARL six years after TARL began brightening the day of Trainzers it was superseded by {{plain link|http://forums.auran.com/trainz/entry.php?698-TARDIS-3-7-A-Trainz-Asset-Repair-Management-Tool-Part-1|TARDIS}} (newset upgrade release is 3.7) scripts running on {{TA|Asset-X}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://trainz.shaneturner.co.uk/tutorials/index.php/en/home/utilities/3rd-party-trainz-utilities/pevsoft-trainz-tools Downloads link for Asset-X and PEVtools&lt;/ref&gt;, again community efforts spear-headed by a few determined Trainz lovers.  There is a full description at [http://forums.auran.com/trainz/entry.php?698-TARDIS-3-7-A-Trainz-Asset-Repair-Management-Tool-Part-1 this N3V Blog page]&lt;ref&gt; (link valid as of July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;.'''

==History==
{{TrainzTip|To the new reader, it might be helpful to first understand that most errors can be fixed by edits to the config.txt file to fix up a path, or a file copy, transfer, or other easy edit. With a little experience the great majority can be fixed in a couple of minutes.
}}
TARL begun back in the Trainz boom days before TRS2006 was the place to find out what to do to fix a config.txt file, or to find a missing asset.  People could and would also post your fixes to a {{TA|config.txt file}} for other people. TARL MK1, in the 3 years it was available, hosted some 8,000 repairs from ~500 authors' assets. Only one author declined to participate and his creations were regrettably excluded to the detriment of the Trainz Community in the opinion of many.

TARL was undergoing a thorough repair, upgrade and review back in 2007, but TARL MK2 never fully recovered the library amassed in TARL MK1. TARL was corrupted during a severe electrical storm in 2007. Many fixits were lost and some of the functionality. We hope to resume uploads by the end of 2008, but first we have to determine what's missing.

As an adjunct to the database, more detailed instructions on how to use TARL will be provided.

{{TRS-byline|The Yesterdayz-Trainz group|url=http://yesterdayztrainz.federalproductions.com/}}

If you begin exploring Trainz as a building tool, crafting or modifying a route, or venture boldly forth onto the {{TL|DLS}} and acquire one of the 2500+ routes uploaded in the last decade&amp;mdash; ''you will indubitably end up facing the learning curve of ''''fixing assets''''.'' If you are going to make headway fixing assets, you will need to understand where to look things up. The [[Trainz/Hierarchy Of Assets|Hierarchy Of Assets]] and {{TL|config.txt files}} Asset fixing is something of a misnomer except in rare cases&amp;mdash;most widely used assets need fixing by updating to new technology levels&amp;mdash;because they have become out of date relative to updates in the game engine's data needs. Alas, there are some actual errors in downloadable content from not only the {{TL|DLS}} but from otherwise reputable 3rd party content creators such as {{TL|TrainzProRoutes}}.com {{TG|Mocrossing}} pack (zip file) pack&amp;mdash;the fixing of which is covered in a forthcoming tutorial. Many times these are simple typos, some are misspellings (not every contributor speaks English as a native tounge, nor as their first language) and pre-TS08 error checking was far more lenient... leading to the fatal crash of Trainz or worse, {{wp|Blue Screen of Death}} errors.

{{-}}
Some small numbers of &quot;Bad Assets&quot; can (with decreasing frequency of occurrences thanks to the systematic efforts to 'Clean Up the DLS'), and when these are found in a route many of their ills can also be fixed. Most can be graded as misuse of key words, and misspellings, missing quotes and the like. Minor repairs anyone can fix with a text editor like {{wp|Notepad}} or {{wp|Notepad++}}. An occasional asset will be missing a component&amp;mdash;either a texture or a mesh (the wire frame which gets 'decorated' by textures to make a virtual object. The one is a surface, the other the skeleton of the underlying shape.)
 
Various techniques have been adopted requiring different data, or a difference in the way data is organized. Most of these changes are handled automatically within the software. When they cannot be, they generate an error, a good thing. Having an error appear in an asset is far better than having a flaw in an asset create a program crash&amp;mdash;an all-too-frequent occurrence in the early days of {{TL|TRS2006}} when the first elevated measure of basic error testing was built into the {{TL|CMP|CMP software}} with its Service Pack 1.

==Acquiring and Installing PEVs tools==
[[Image:PEVs TRAINZ asset modification tools in Downloads (October 2013 versions shown).png|right|thumb|330px|PEVs tools in a power-users C:\Downloads folder (Yours will likely be somewhere else).]]
 
PEV's tools will be maintained by the community on one website or another as they are invaluable. Peter V. is a real programmer situated on the opposite (or Sydney) side of Australia from N3V/Auran's small town location on the Gold Coast near Brisbane, but ceased hosting his tools on his own website in mid-2013 when the task was taken over by Trainz fan Shane Turner on {{plainlinks|http://trainz.shaneturner.co.uk/tutorials/index.php/home/utilities/pevsoft-trainz-tools|his help site here}}.
# Locate PEVs tools on Shane's site and their accompanying manuals where given. 
# See [[Trainz/AM&amp;C/Setting up PEVtools|PEVtools]] for a procedure and tips on where to put things.
# See [[Trainz/AM&amp;C/PEVtools|PEVtools]] for some operating tips, tutorial links, and advanced setup in a local

==List of one-to-one replacements==

# Engine spec  &lt;kuid:35837:51002&gt; can be replaced by &lt;kuid:44090:51016&gt;
# 
==Content Manager Warning Messages==
;and what to do about them...
Content Manager validates assets when they are committed, and also includes an option to display the errors and warning for any installed asset.   Below are set out some of the error messages that CM will display when it validates an asset, with a brief description.   This list is based on CM v3.7.

===Warning: Aliased meshes cannot currently be verified by Trainz.===

The asset does not contain its own mesh but refers to another asset as the source of the mesh.  CM is advising that the other asset is not validated as part of the process of validating this asset, and therefore this asset cannot be confirmed as error free. This asset might not work in game even though it is listed as available.

===Warning: Required tag '&lt;tag name&gt;' was missing and has been set to default.===

The tag should be added to config.txt with a suitable value.

===Warning: This asset uses an obsolete trainz-build number. Trainz-build numbers below &lt;build number&gt; are no longer supported.===

The validation tests applied to an asset depend on the asset's build number.  This message is indicating that the asset is considered obsolete and therefore the latest standards have not been applied.  If the build number of the asset is updated, there may be more errors detected.

===Warning: Tag '&lt;tag name&gt;' in the container '&lt;container name&gt;' is obsolete.===
That tag is no longer supported and will be ignored.  It is possible that the tag function has been replaced by a container, as in the case of the tags 'category-era-n' which are replaced by the container 'category-era'.

===Warning: Required container 'thumbnails' is missing.===

A thumbnails container should be added to config.txt

===Warning: This asset requires a shadow mesh, but the mesh table does not contain one.===

A shadow mesh should be created for the asset and the mesh table updated.

===Warning: The texture '&lt;texture name&gt;' is a uniform color.===

Uniform textures should not be used for new assets, but for older assets that would require a change to the mesh.  In this case the textures should be resized to 4x4, or at least one pixel changed to a varying colour (however slight the variation). Large uniform textures are a waste of resources: do not adjust the image colour to avoid the warning without also resizing it to a suitable small size - 16x16 or smaller.

===Warning: An asset must be specified for tag 'texture-kuid'.===

The texture-kuid tag is used by some containers (eg, a corona effect container) to reference a texture name.  If it is used, the texture name should be specified.

===Warning: Progressive meshes are no longer supported by Trainz===
;Full message: Warning: Progressive meshes are no longer supported by Trainz. Though these meshes may work in Trainz, it is recommended that you switch to a LOD mesh.
;Related message: Warning: Progressive meshes are no longer supported by Trainz. Though these meshes may work in Trainz, it is recommended that you switch to a IM mesh. (Until 2008's publication of {{TL|TC3}} introduced the {{TG|L|LOD technology}}.)

Progressive meshes (.pm) can be converted to a {{TG|G|Indexed mesh}} (.im) using the {{TA|PEVtools}} utilities. LOD meshes do not currently have a tool which can scale a mesh to the set of meshes in an LOD series (typically four meshes with less and less polygons, the farther from the camera locus the face of the object. This mimics loosely the way the eye-brain sees less details the farther an object is from the eye. In computing terms, LOD meshes reduce the processing for most objects, but preserve the ability to build fine details into an object seen up close where there can be denser polygons and mesh pairings defining surface feature details.

==Content Manager Error Messages==
Acquiring assets means running a gauntlet of error in older content, and these faults can usually be fixed with a series of simple edit changes and PEVtools. This is a guideline to do such, and why such and such an error is occurring. {{TA|Asset-X}} and {{TA|TARDIS}} scripts can be used to automate fixing many of these, but this page is about the bare knuckles approach when only Pev's tools are at hand.

&amp;nbsp; 
=== Error: Unable to read config file for asset at &lt;location&gt;===
;{{TL|Unable to read config file for asset at &lt;location&gt;}}
The config.txt file could not be found or could not be read.   This usually indicates that the asset is corrupted, or that it does not exist at the location where it was expected.  This can happen if the asset is deleted but the cache has not been updated. The asset should be restored from a backup source, or reverted.

&amp;nbsp; 
=== Error: This asset has a trainz-build number which is not recognized by this tool===
{{TRS-byline|tn1=fabartus|wn1=fabartus}}

{{TR|S|trainz-build}} or asset version numbers are built into every Trainz item as a mandatory entry in the a|p=Trainz-build tagsssets {{TR|r|TrainzBaseSpec}} data definitions in it's {{TL|config.txt file}}. 

''As a mandatory data field'', it literally defines to the {{TL|Content Manager|CMP/CM}} reading the file the tech level of the asset allowing the game software to appropriately translate data from older dated formats to newer more demanding technologies.
* It is the secret which keeps Trainz compatibility version to version and why Trainz 1.3 assets are still found in new routes and session content.
* If the asset is properly defined, the trainz-build code tells the software how to interpret the data, if the data structures are older.
*  This message was generated because the data item just imported had a tech level over the head of the v3.2 Content Manager.
;Solution
: {{TL|TS2010|TS2010-SP3}} allowed Fabartus to degrade the Trainz-build tag value, so drop it back and annotate the description with a notation you've done so. Afterwards, the asset committed fine.
:* MOST assets will work fine, unless they take advantage of newer software advances. Specifically, beware assets involving scripts... these may need the newer trainz-build versions to work properly. Meshes, Textures, kuid references, and other such guts elements should render fine from Trainz 2009 (SP0) and up if taken backwards. Some assets &amp;mdash; e.g. those with AlphaMask= statements in their texture.txt files &amp;mdash; will need that line deleted if the asset is taken back to TRS2006 versions. (TC3 introduced?{{TRS-check|fact check and verify}}).

===Error: Unable to load mesh file: '&lt;mesh filename&gt;'===

The mesh file could not be loaded.  Perhaps it is misspelled in config.txt, perhaps it is missing, perhaps it is the wrong format, or perhaps it is corrupted and unreadable.

===Error: Attachment point 'numeric_name' in 'container-name' was not found.===
{{TRS-byline|tn1=fabartus|wn1=fabartus}}
{{text-box|
;Examples:
Error: Attachment point 18 (a.passoff) in 'queues\passengers_off_0\attachment-points' was not found. 
Error: Attachment point 61 (a.passoff112) in 'queues\passengers_on_1\attachment-points' was not found.
}}
[[File:Error= Attachment point 'numeric_name' in 'container-name' was not found.png|thumb|'''Error: Attachment point 'numeric_name' in 'container-name' was not found'''{{bullR
}}These are manufactured errors (by adding 3 lines of false data to the container), after fixing the first error message.{{bullR
}} BOTH instances give the same error message syntax... one missing correct name, the others missing the attachment points.]]
There are two possible causes for this error
# The attachment point name is wrong, so the mesh and container listing the data point mismatch.
# The attachment point is missing, so again the mesh and container listing the datum mismatch.

'''Interpretation:'''
# The ''nineteenth attachment point '''named '18'''' ''in the mesh referenced by the {{TR|c|queues container}} in the sub-container '''passengers_off_0''' is missing. ('18' is a placeholder reference and could be 'xy', 'glops' or anything, so long as it occurs on the 19th line of the container (data table). By convention, sub-elements in Trainz are normally given number placeholders.)

;There are three common fixes...
#* An attachment point might be added to the platform using the {{TG|P|PEVsoft}} tool {{TA|Attachment Maker}} with the name ''''a.passoff'''', if is truly missing.
#* However, on the basis of the name &quot;a.passoff&quot;, the line likely has a missing suffix&amp;mdash;nobody wastes time giving a generic attachment point on a train platform (of which there may be hundreds) a fancy name&amp;mdash;''such are usually numerically suffixed''; so the message is probably issued because the container name is missing its numeric suffix, and since the placeholder sequence is: &lt;br/&gt;00 &amp;rarr; a.passoff01, &lt;br/&gt;01 &amp;rarr;a.passoff02, &lt;br/&gt;02 &amp;rarr; a.passoff03, ... &lt;br/&gt;No-1 &amp;rarr;a.passoffNo, adding 19 to the line of the #18 placeholder should fix the problem. ''(This was indeed the case for three such assets by the same creator when documenting this error.)''
#* If failing the rename, the line can just be deleted.

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: Attachment point '&lt;attachment point name&gt;' in '&lt;effect name&gt;' must be found in mesh '&lt;mesh name&gt;'.===

An attachment point is referred to in config.txt but it does not exist in the default mesh &lt;mesh name&gt;.  This can often happen when a config.txt has been copied from another asset, and the attachment deleted from the mesh. For instance, a crossing gate has had a lamp attachment removed from the mesh, but the corona effect &lt;effect name&gt; still refers to the missing attachment point. 

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: The attachment point '&lt;attachment point name&gt;' must belong to the parent mesh of the effect &lt;mesh name&gt;.===

This often occurs in conjunction with the previous message.   Not only was the attachment point not found in the mesh, it was not found in the parent mesh to which the effect is attached.  It occurs for the same reasons as the previous message.

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: The *.texture.txt file is missing for texture resource '&lt;texture name&gt;'.===

A texture name used in a mesh file cannot be found, or could not be loaded. A valid texture.txt file should be created with a suitable associated image file.  It is possible to search the user data folder for a texture of the same name, which might or might not be suitable for the asset. It is also possible to create a new texture.txt file and an arbitrary image - this might reveal what the image needs to be, or it might reveal that the texture doesn't matter and any image will serve to get rid of the error.

If the missing file is a 'digit_xx.texture' then any image can be used to remove the error.  These files are not actually used because they are substituted with the selected digit image as part of the running number creation.

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: The texture 'graphics_file_name' failed to load===
{{TRS-byline|tn1=fabartus|wn1=fabartus}}
'''Example= Error: The texture 'column1.bmp' failed to load.'''
Clearing this error may be extremely simple. The texture file is likely not a square patch sized by a power of 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; bytes.
* If MS Paint or other graphics application can load the file, this is the most likely case. Resize the image to one of 8x8, 16x16, 32x32 pixels. Re-save and retest the errors and warnings.

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: Unable to load image file '&lt;image filename&gt;' for texture '&lt;texture filename&gt;' while validating mesh '&lt;mesh filename&gt;'===
{{TRS-byline|tn1=fabartus|wn1=fabartus}}
;Note this and the following error (unable to load Primary Texture) often occur together...
The image referred to in the texture.txt file could not be loaded.  It might be missing, the name might be misspelled in the texture.txt file, the image file might be the wrong format (for instance, compressed TGA), the image sizes might not be a power of two (where required) or the image file might be corrupted.
It is possible that the image file is not really missing, but the texture file exists, and is not required.  Check the required lists of textures using Assetx - if the texture name is not listed then the texture.txt file can be removed and the error will disappear.
'''example:''' Error: Unable to load image file 'shadow.bmp' for texture '' while validating mesh ''
* Solution: ...''See narrative following''...

&amp;nbsp;
===Error: Unable to load primary texture '&lt;image filename&gt;' for texture file '&lt;texture filename&gt;'.===
;Note this and the preceding error (Unable to load image file) often (if not always will) occur together...
The primary image referred to in the texture.txt file could not be loaded.  It might be missing, the name might be misspelled in the texture.txt file, the image file might be the wrong format (for instance, compressed TGA) or the image file might be corrupted.
'''example:''' ''Error: Unable to load primary texture 'shadow.bmp' for texture file 'shadow.texture.txt'.''
* Solution: Used a shadow.bmp archived in folder textures library built while fixing assets.
:* Alternative. Could have taken a black.tga, or made a new dark tga file of 4x4, 8x8, or 16x16 to serve as this shade.

&amp;nbsp;

===Image file '&lt;image filename&gt;' is incorrectly used as both a texture.txt source file and a raw image file.===
The asset includes a texture.txt file that refers to an image file, but that image file is referred to directly from config.txt.   This applies to image files that are used as thumbnails.  Either change the thumbnail reference to the texture.txt file, or (preferably) delete the {{TG|T|texture.txt}} file.

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: Binary conversion failed for texture resource '&lt;texture filename&gt;'.===

The image referred to in the texture.txt file could not be processed for some reason.  See previous.

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: The Tag '&lt;tag name&gt;' is not permitted within a container of type '&lt;kind&gt;'.===
;Example: &quot;Error: The Tag 'thumbnail' is not permitted within a container of type 'scenery'.&quot;
The tag is not recognized as valid for this type of asset. The tag might be a comment (earlier versions of CM ignored comments) in which case it can be deleted. It might be misspelled, in which case it can be changed to the correct spelling.  It might be a valid tag that was meaningful and useful for the asset, but is no longer valid.  An example is the tags used by some scripts to provide information, such as running number range.  These custom tags are no longer allowed as top-level tags in config.txt - they must be moved to a container within the extensions container, and the script must be modified to find them at their new location in the file.  The details depend on the script.

&amp;nbsp;

===Error: The tag 'tag name' in '&lt;container name&gt;' points to a nonexistent file: '&lt;filename&gt;'.===

This error occurs when a tag references a file and the file cannot be found.

For instance, named subcontainers in the thumbnails container have an 'image' tag that can point to a texture.txt file or to an image file.  If the image file is not found - perhaps the name is misspelled, or the file is missing - this message will be logged.  Similarly, the 'info-page' in a 'maps' container should point to a {{wp|.htm file}}.  If the file cannot be found the error will be logged.

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: Incorrect number of values for the tag '&lt;tag name&gt;', expected &lt;x&gt; values, found &lt;y&gt;.===

Where a tag requires a list of values, there may be a required minimum or maximum number of entries in the list.   If the correct number of entries is not provided, this error will be logged. Add or remove entries from the tag list as required.

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: Unable to load animation file '&lt;animation file name&gt;' (no resource).===

The animation file was not found in the asset.   It may be possible to search for the file in user data and find it - a file of the same name might or might not work with this asset.  If the file has been left out of the asset because it's not actually needed, then any animation file will work.

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: Required container '&lt;container name&gt;' is missing.===

This can also be a warning in some cases, even though it says 'required'.  It indicates that the asset type requires a particular container but that container has not been included in the cofig.txt file.  The fix for this depends on the container (some containers can be easily created, some can't) and the asset type.

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: The kuid '&lt;kuid&gt;' specified in '&lt;container&gt;' is not of the correct type.===

When a kuid is required within a container it must be a kuid of the type that is appropriate for that container.  For instance, the allowed-categories container (within a queues container) requires one or more product-category assets.  A different type of asset (such as a product) will generate this error.

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: Failed to load sound file '&lt;sound file name&gt;', please ensure this is a valid wav file.===

The sound file could not be loaded.  Perhaps the file is missing - it may be possible to search for the file in user data and find it.  It might be corrupted or in the wrong format.  If the file has been left out of the asset because it's not actually needed, then any sound file will work, at least to get the asset installed so that the function of the sound file can be determined and a suitable replacement located.  For historical reasons this error can also occur in assets that are upgraded from an earlier build number - the file exists and the config.txt file entry appears to match the filename, but the warning persists.  In this case ensure that the file name in config.txt is enclosed in quote marks (&quot;) - trailing spaces or tabs can confuse CM when quotes are not used.

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: Script class does not match asset kind (&lt;kind&gt;).===

A script is identified as a class with the isclass statement.  This class must match the kind of the asset that the script is used with. It is possible that the script should not be part of the asset at all (for instance, if the asset definition has been copied from an asset of a different kind) in which case the script references from config.txt can be deleted.  Or, possibly, the asset kind was changed without changing the script or selecting the correct script for the asset.  

&amp;nbsp; 
===Error: Unable to commit changes to asset &lt;kuid:xxx:yyy&gt; as the config file contains the wrong KUID===
{{TRS-byline|tn1=fabartus|wn1=fabartus}}
This is a DRM policing error (and an attempt to force users to update assets via Content Creator Plus, versus manual edit) that is generated because a kuid was manually adjusted. For example, an asset is upgraded to newer standard data type forms. 
* Further, this error will ONLY happen when an attempt is made to commit the asset with a changed kuid. 
  
The solution is straight forward:

:&amp;nbsp; 0. Validate the asset to check for errors and warnings. (Should have been completed, since an attempt was made to commit)
#  Copy the entire asset folder to a nearby utility directory (e.g. from ..\UserData\editing to \UserData\temp)
# Select the asset in CM/CMP and type {{kp|CTRL|R}} 
# '''To be completed with photos'' 'sometime later today''''''//[[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 13:54, 13 April 2014 (UTC)

===Overview===
Salinity is the result of the dissolved ions present in water. Measuring salinity is complicated by the fact that the species of dissolved ions are not the same in every salt lake. The ionic composition and concentration of seawater is fairly constant around the globe, however salt lakes vary considerably, with some being chloride dominated, while others are carbonate dominated. 

[[File:Salinitytable.jpg|right|thumb|250px]]

===Methods typically used to measure salinity===
The main approaches to estimating the salinity of salt lake brine include:
*[[/measuring brine density/]]
*[[/measuring electrical conductivity/]] 
*[[/measuring refractive index/]] 
*[[/measuring chloride concentration/]]
*[[/evaporating brine and weighing the residue/]] (gravimetry)


Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, discussed on the respective method pages.


===Relationships between different salinity measures===

&lt;b&gt;Conversion table&lt;/b&gt; This table is based on information collated by Prof. Bill (WD) Williams of Adelaide University. He presented the information at the 6th International Symposium on Saline Lake Research, Beijing, 1994, and argued strongly for the use of a standardised approach to measuring salinity. He felt that the use of mass-derived measures such as density (either w/w or w/v) would enable scientists to more simply discuss and compare the properties of their lakes.


The table presented here allows comparisons of various brine salinity measures between 22 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C and 25 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. 


As the different approaches to measuring salinity all actually measure different properties of salinity (its mass, its conductivity, its effect on the density of water, its effect on how water bends light, etc), the various measures do not all have a linear relationship with each other. In the [[Methods_Manual_for_Salt_Lake_Studies/References|References]] section of this manual there are details of several papers that provide an excellent understanding of the various salinity measures and their relationships to each other (Williams &amp; Sherwood 1994, Williams 1986, Baseggio 1974)

My name is Elizabeth. I live in Chesapeake Virginia, but I enjoy every bit of the hampton roads area. Im a part time waitress, and a full time assistent coach for the Hickory Highschool Field Hockey team. I have (and have had) an undying passion for field hockey for ten years now. It has always been my dream to coach and teach. So as of right now, Ive got one down and one to go :) Last year our team finished out the season being second in the district and making it to regionals. I have always had a love for sports ever since I was young.[[Image:Family.JPG|thumb||300px|right|Mom, Dad, Me, &amp; Lauren. Easter '08]] I guess I owe that to my father, for believing that he could make boys out of his little girls. My famiy is my pride and joy. I hold them higher than anything else in my life, because without them I would have nothing to be so thankful for. I'm a huge people person. I love to talk and be sociable. I enjoy making new friends all the time. Most people would call me outgoiong, crazy, or loud, but all of those in a good way of course :).


I am a current student at Old Domionion University studying to become a highschool history teacher. There are a couple important traits that I want to have when I become an educator. I want to be extremly educated in my area of teaching. I believe that a good teacher is not one who only teaches their subject, but one who also teaches there students life lessons as well. I want to be the educator who opens their students eyes to things that they didnt know. I guess you could say that I want to have a personal connection with each and everyone of my students.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The valuation of a bond can be broken down into two basic tasks: the valuation of the stream of coupon payments, and the valuation of the repayment of the face value of the bond.

Valuing the stream of coupon payments is no different than valuing any other basic annuity. 

PV&lt;sub&gt;coupons&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C\left[\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{r\left(1+r\right)^t}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where C = coupon payment, t = years to maturity, and r = required rate of return.

Valuing the principle is even simpler, just use a basic present value formula:

PV&lt;sub&gt;principle&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{F}{(1+r)^t}&lt;/math&gt;

where F is the face value, r is the discount rate, and t is the number of years to maturity.


----
And so, to find the present value of the entire bond, we put these two formulae together to get:

PV&lt;sub&gt;bond&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C\left[\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{r\left(1+r\right)^t}\right] + \frac{F}{(1+r)^t}&lt;/math&gt;


Now, let's suppose we are given the following problem: 
''A $1000 8% annual bond matures in 7 years and is yielding 5%. Find the price of the bond.'' 

The first thing we see is $1000. This is the face value of the bond, which is the amount of money the issuing party will pay on maturity. The next thing we see is 8% annual. This means that the company is paying 8% of $1000 every year as interest, which comes out to $80. Therefore, we shall use 80 in place of C in our equation. The time to maturity is 7, which is self explanatory. Finally, we see that the bond is &quot;yielding 5%&quot;. This means that we should use 5% as the discount rate in our equation. So, plugging in this information we see that:

&lt;math&gt;80\left[\frac{1}{.05}-\frac{1}{.05\left(1.05\right)^7}\right] + \frac{1000}{(1.05)^7} = $1,173.59&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that the price of this bond, $1,173.59, is higher than the face value of $1000. This means that the bond is selling at a '''Premium'''. If the price were lower than the face value, the bond would sell at a '''Discount''', and if the bond were selling for exactly the face value, the bond is said to be selling at '''Par'''. You can determine if a bond is selling at a discount, a premium, or par without actually valuing the bond. If the coupon rate is higher than the yield, the bond will sell for a premium. If the coupon rate is lower than the yield, the bond will sell for a discount. And, of course, if the yield equals the coupon, the bond will sell at par.

It is also possible to determine the price of a bond using a financial calculator, such as the Texas Instruments BA-II.

| FV
| 1000
| the bond's face value
|-
| N
| 7
| the time to maturity
|-
| PV
| ???
| the current price of the bond
|}


By pressing '''CPT''' followed by '''PV''', the calculator will compute the price of the bond. Given any 4 of the TVM variables, the calculator can compute the remaining variable. Note that in order to make the calculation work, the PV must be negative (since purchasing the bond is a negative cash flow to the buyer).

----
Most bonds in the real world pay semi-annual coupons, and this must be taken into account when valuing a bond. In the example above, let's suppose the bond paid semi-annual interest. In order to calculate the correct price, we divide the coupon payment in half to get $40, and double the time to maturity, to get 14. In order to find the appropriate yield, we must use the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;Effective Rate\ =\ \left[1+\frac{Annual Rate}{m}\ \right]^m-1&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''m'' is the number of compounding periods per year. In this case, it is two. So:

&lt;math&gt;0.05\ =\ \left[1+\frac{x}{2}\ \right]^2-1&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, x = 0.04939, and so by dividing this in two we can get the effective per period interest rate of 2.4695%.

Then we simply plug in the values into the bond valuation formula:

&lt;math&gt;40\left[\frac{1}{.024695}-\frac{1}{.024695\left(1.024695\right)^{14}}\right] + \frac{1000}{(1.024695)^{14}} = $1,179.31&lt;/math&gt;

All other things being equal, a bond will be worth more the more times per year interest is paid.

''In the table, the top row is the graph for the letter, in lowercase, the middle shows pronunciation of the name for the letter, and the botom row shows the main and sometimes secondary sound of the letter.''

===Digraphs===

The letters &lt;big&gt;y&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt;h&lt;/big&gt; are a special class of letters; when combined with another letter, they may form [[w:Digraph_(orthography)|digraphs]] and [[w:dipthongs|dipthongs]]. Each digraph with an alternate representation is accepted as having a minor form (rather like the &lt;big&gt;ß&lt;/big&gt; ligature of German). '''The capitals are still the IPA graphemes.'''

* The digraphs (&quot;h&quot;, and &quot;y&quot;) function in their special way by adding to the end of another letter. 
* The dipthongs (&quot;y&quot; only) instead come first, with the other letter modifying '''it''' (this functions much like the english '''Y''', becoming a vowel in dipthongs).  

All the dipthongs are ''rising'' sounds (like ''l'''ue'''go'' &lt;small&gt;(es)&lt;/small&gt; or '''''ye'''sterday'' &lt;small&gt;(en)&lt;/small&gt;). The stress comes at the initiation of the sound, thus the speaker's voice ''rises'' into the dipthong.  Contrast with '''''a'''corn'' (ai-dipthong) &lt;small&gt;(en)&lt;/small&gt; or ''rest'''au'''rante'' &lt;small&gt;(es)&lt;/small&gt;.

===Transliteration===

A target of this language is to simplify and sonorate english.  There is little better aesthetic resources for that than in other languages, and so particular care is taken to construct the alphabet accordingly.

In broad terms, there are three collective groups of consonant (or semivowel) articulations into which western languages crowd many ''distinct sounds'': that is to say, the features of these sounds are broadly the similar but the speakers distinguish.
{|
| &lt;big style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;'''First Group'''&lt;/big&gt;
| kgts ''sounds''
|-
| &lt;big style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;'''Second Group'''&lt;/big&gt;
| bvpd ''sounds''
|-
| &lt;big style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;'''Third Group'''&lt;/big&gt;
| hʝɰ ''sounds''
|}

In this analogy, in the various forms of spanish there is variety in the third group across the different dialects. In slavic languages there is a variety of intersections of the first with the second and third groups (particularly in polish. It might be difficult to determine which phoneme belongs to which letters between those intersections and within the third group, especially where this is not made deliberate in the digraphs section. Japanese blurs &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot;, and as well vocalizes the &quot;w&quot; sound, and germinates some consonants. Accounting for these differences require expanding Japanese to the phonetic diversity of the other languages, and equalizing the consonants. It is otherwise remarkably similar to any other language in this way.  

====Spanish Transliteration====

'v' is transliterated exactly like from english to spanish (b with /β/). 

To english ears, different spanish accents tend to have different sounds.

====Slavic Transliteration====

West slavic and east slavic sounds are accounted for, but the (especially highly gluttive) balkan sounds are excluded from coverage. Further, the hard/soft distinction is not maintained unless already present in the germanic (in other words, as you would expect, coming from english).

The spanish table does a good job of covering a lot of the non-obvious transliterations in the slavics.  '''All''' '''z-s''' and '''c-s''' fricatives are /z/ sounds of (casual, unspecified) '''s''' digraphs.

===Vowels===

English has 14 monotic vowels: simplicity itself. Whereas spanish has only 5. Nonetheless, outside of what ''feels like'' a complete lack of capital sounds and alternate &quot;u&quot; sounds, spanish will seem completely normal in a very short time. Despite &quot;ɑ&quot; being far more apt of a filler to the spanish vowel system in terms of how one positions the tongue, It is well replaced by a vowel already in spanish, /ä/. So I use the next most obvious filler, the /ə/, which ties down /ɜ ə/ and does a pretty good job with /o/ too.

==Phrasing, Stress==

Proper english is between mora-timed and stress-timed.  It is technically mora-timed, but all stress that does not change the timing by more than the rate of speaking is normal: about like a first year japanese student coming from english.  Like japanese, sequences of the form &lt;code&gt;(c*)v(c*)&lt;/code&gt; are counted as two morae anywhere except at the end of the word, where it is a single morae.  Unlike japanese, sequences like &lt;code&gt;v(c*)&lt;/code&gt; at the start of the word are there own mora, not two.  This creates a very pleasant ''sing-song'' quality to those words, but it also serves to ''fluidify'' japanese stress across the germanic words. This avoids the romanji-like intonation of many words, like:

|}
|}
'' ''* ''note that these examples represent how the person of the exotic language immitates the english word.''

While the above avoids the ugly ''over-syllabication'' of Romanji, missing vowel sounds and semivowels may be added ''or migrate'' where appropriate between fully stopped consonants:
* &lt;small style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;Migration&lt;/small&gt; 'actualmente' &lt;small&gt;(es)&lt;/small&gt; → ak.t̠͡ʃwe.la ̯.men.te
* &lt;small style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;Addition&lt;/small&gt; 'strengths' &lt;small&gt;(en)&lt;/small&gt; → st̠ɾeŋktʰ.ɪ ̯s

==Vocabulary==

This is an object-quality language.  In a strict sense every word is just an object — even verbs. All objects act as classes for other objects: the association of their nearness relations is rather like a thesaurus would detail the bulk of english. Verb objects denote events (in much the same way that &quot;kill&quot; denotes the event-death in some readings, more than it does a directed action). So, &lt;small style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;Event&lt;/small&gt; objects are used as verbs in the regular sense:
* Justin strives for greatness. ''(en)''
* Samantha owns a car. ''(en)''
But it allows for adjectival nouns and verbs:
* ''''typing''' is getting tiresome' (verb-as-noun)
* 'google' (noun-as-verb)
* 'swimmingly' (verb-as-adverb: brit, &quot;ok&quot; as in &quot;not drowning&quot;)
* 'she's not just beautiful, she's '''smoking'''' (verb-as-adjective)
* 'she's not just smart, she's '''bank'''' (noun-as-adjective)
* 'in a fight you have to go '''monster'''' (noun-as-adverb)
When you get into these grey areas, you notice the language starts to break down to a general sense of object-and-type anyway. There are lots of words that can modify other words this way, but just won't: What comes naturally is natural.

===NSM===

The rule of thumb is to always prefer english words, but not if their syllables are too complex. If it is a syllable with 3 consecutive consonants, it's time to look to spanish. Likewise, if the english word is arhythmic, or the spanish replacement is (including ending in -r), it is time to look to japanese.

#* their count are singular 
#* plural — &lt;small&gt;(suffix)&lt;/small&gt; -s /s/ (inflection on the pronoun)
* '''tense''' (periphrastic) ''makes this '''like''' an isolating language!''
# present - default ''immediate/imperative, approximate (spanish sense of 'at once')''
# past — ɰun /ʍon/
# future — ɰı̊l /ʍɪl/
* '''aspects''' (inflection)
*# perfect — &lt;small&gt;(suffix)&lt;/small&gt; -ı̊stı̊ /istʰe/ (past-oriented relative demarkation, context point is centered at some point in time)
*# continuous — &lt;small&gt;(suffix)&lt;/small&gt; -adu /ad̪o/ (through some moment, centered at some point in time)
*# momentane — &lt;small&gt;(suffix)&lt;/small&gt; -undu /unðo/ (at that very moment, centered at some point in time)
* '''moods''' (periphrastic)
*# imperfective — ı̊t /et/
*# cohortative — ɰı̊h /wiɣ/
*# '''counterfactual''' — ɰud /wʊd/
* '''voice'''
# active &amp; mediopassive - default
# passive —  upun /upon/  (periphrastic)
* '''narratival''' (Conjunctions, anti-conjunctions, interjections)
* '''honorifics'''
# regular speach is non-honorific
# to honorify, add &quot;-sama&quot; to the pronoun and to the verb append the periphrastic: gusaı̊ /gozaɪ/
# to humilify, add &quot;-wa&quot; (chosen for its similarity to the 2nd/3rd person) append to the verb: dufas /dufəs/
# the pronouns change with honorific
#* first, third person — no forms
# the pronouns also change with humilifics
#* second, third person — no forms
#* first person plural - this is effectively singular, despite itself. the person demotes his representation in the group, not the group itself; as it intrinsically accepts overall responsibility for that which is being discussed.

Notes:
* Tense is always first in verb formation.  Thus it is &quot;ɰı̊l ɰı̊h abgoogle&quot; for &quot;Let us google (tomorrow)&quot;.
* The counterfactual is used for both the precident and the antecedant.  It is for hypotheticals, expectations, inverse probabilities, and eventualities.  Thus, even though we know, factually, that tomorrow 1+1 will still equal 2, we use the future counterfactual to express that.
* The cohortative is such that in the present, it adds emphasis much like &quot;pretty please&quot;, in the future it is the same (&quot;may we? oh, would that we could&quot;), and it the past it expresses wishes, desires of past events (&quot;oh would that it were&quot;). Its purpose is to generally to gloss honorific with someone without actually being formal.  On a date, to impress and stress familiarity, you use cohortative. 
* momentane in its simple form is used to distinguish between  immediacy and approximacy. Imagine the example of someone at the door. In english you say &quot;I'll get the door.&quot;, and then you go to the door.  In spanish you say &quot;I open it.&quot; instead. Proper English is more like the spanish, both the next event and the current one are 'now'. To distinguish between (5 minutes from now) and (immediately), use the momentane.  Likewise, in past or future tenses, the momentane ties the action very precisely to the time (when the emphasis is needed).
* in-the tense formations (such as future in the past) are, like in english, formed by concatenation and informed by context.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello! My name is Courtney and I am junior at ODU. I am double majoring in Spanish and Education and I am minoring in Philosophy. Baisically, I will be a student here at ODU forever, because after I graduate I plan on getting my masters in Spanish. I want to teach spanish at the middle school level, or possible teach in a spanish speaking country. 

I currently substitute teach in the Virginia Beach City Public Schools. Being in the classroom has taught me a lot about how students learn, how they interact with each other, and what activities the students enjoy the most. I belive that classes need to be high energy with little time for gaps where teachers often assign busy work. Also, hour and a half class periods do not work to keep the students attention to the subject. After the first hour, the students  get restless and that can cause a disruption in the classroom. Bells should be short and sweet with high energy.

Since I will be teaching a language, I think that the most important part in my class will be oral communication. I want the students to be comfortable and excited to learn to speak a different language. Practice and repition are key in learning a language. I will also put an important emphasis on culture in spanish speaking countries. Learning about oher cultures will hopeflly allow my students to be more tolerant. What I really want is for my students to look forward to coming to my class, I want to make the class as enjoyable as possible with lots of fun and creative activities that will keep my students attention. I want them to go home and tell thier families about how much fun they had, and want to show family and friends what they have learned.</text>

Hi Courtney,

We share the same passion. I am a Spanish major also. I am an up and rising senior. I returned to ODU after sitting out for Twenty years and now I am close to having my dream. I just want you to know you will have your masters before you realize it.

Hi Courtney,

I have to agree with you about your opinion that 90 minute class sessions are long periods in which to keep a student engaged. I am currently teaching high school science at Granby and have found that the best way to keep a student 'entertained' for a full 90 minute block is to divide the class into two 'mini-sessions'. After briefly reviewing the previous lesson's materials (about 5 minutes), I will provide some kind of hook into the new topic of the day. I lecture or introduce new material for the remainder of the first half of class and then I have students do some kind of hand's on activity for the last portion. I find that this keeps them engaged, while allowing me to move around the room to access who &quot;get's it&quot; and who needs additional help. Anyway, hope that will be of a little help to you!

Hi Courtney,
My name is Shannon and I really enjoyed reading your page. I know from personal experience that I droped 2 Spanish classes before meeting a teacher who was passionate about teaching the languae. So I was very excited to hear about you teaching philosophy. I think it sounds great that you are a forever student (I am doing the same sort of thing) And I wish you the best of luck.[[User:Swrig020|Swrig020]] ([[User talk:Swrig020|talk]]) 11:54, 1 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, all!

My name is Sommer, and I am 21 years old.  This is actually my first semester at ODU.  I graduated from TCC last year with an Associate's Degree in General Studies and decided to pursue my education further as an English major with a minor in Secondary Education.  My plan is to become a high school English teacher; however, I'm not yet sure whether the profession would be right for me or not.  (I suppose I'll find out soon enough...)  I have quite a few interests: writing, reading, drawing, hiking, Egyptology, Archaeology, animals, painting, gardening, singing, travel, and on and on.  I also have an (unhealthy?) obsession with tea.  I don't have every variety yet, but I'm working on it.  :)  I also collect teacups, stamps, and coins.  (As you can imagine, my brain is all over the place, and I'm known for being absent-minded sometimes.) In addition, I work part-time as an assistant librarian at a local public library.  The job is so-so--patrons can be quite nasty at times--but I love the people I work with.  (Don't believe all that mess about crusty old librarians...they throw the best parties.)  ;) 

My philosophy on education:
*Teaching is a mixture of facilitating learning (teaching students how to find, understand, and analyze information on their own) and imparting the unique knowledge that one possesses as an instructor.  (There is no either/or.)
*Children should be taught at least one other language alongside English from a young age.  When children are young, it's easier for them to acquire and retain the knowledge because their brains are forming so rapidly and they usually have more interest in learning.  Bi-lingual education should start in kindergarten and continue throughout high school and college.
*The &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; Act is a hindrance to learning.  Children should be grouped by ability so as to reach their full potential.  Expectations should be high for every student, but those students who are struggling should be held back until they get it right, (rather than have the students who learn quickly held back until the slower-learning students get it right.)
*Technology should be used to a point in the classroom, and teachers should be fully educated in this area; however, I believe traditional methods of learning have much more merit.  Technology is not always reliable, and I can't tell you how many times I've been more focused on getting my computer to work correctly than on the assignment itself, or how often I've nearly gotten a not-so-wonderful grade on something not because I didn't know the material, but because technology failed me.  Also, young people stare at computer screens enough on their own during the day.  (I may be wrong about this, I admit, but it's my honest opinion.)
*Assessment is less cut-and-dry sometimes in the area of English, I believe--many things (aside from spelling, grammar, and punctuation) are open to interpretation--but I'll attempt to measure my students' mastery of the English language through writing samples.

THE END (for now...)

Wow Sommer, you have so many great ideas about teaching!!! That is so cool! I really agreed with you on the No Child Left Behind Act, it is not fair to expect advanced students to be contecnt with a slow pace because of less advanced students in their class.  We had &quot;tracks&quot; when I was in school that attempted to group students by their abilities - I always felt that these worked well. Also, I must say that I agree hands down with you about technology.  I cannot count the times that I have been scared I have lost an assignment or that I would not be able to submit it due to computer problems.  Also, some of the most notable minds of our time were not pushed by technology, but by a pure desire to learn and understand - something that can be provided by passionate teachers - like yourself.[[User:Mbiernot1979|Mbiernot1979]] ([[User talk:Mbiernot1979|talk]]) 21:21, 1 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

===Overview of measuring brine density===

The density, as specific gravity, of brine may be measured with a hydrometer or with a density meter such as those designed by Anton-Paar. The resulting measure (usually specific gravity, but some hydrometers measure baume) will be directly related to the mass of total dissolved salts in the water. The method may be tripped up where very high levels of extremely fine suspended particles are present in water – they will be included in the measure of density. In the field this may be avoided by only measuring clearwater samples, or by placing samples in tall tubes to settle, or by filtering the sample. While this method provides information on the mass of dissolved salts, it provides no information on the composition of the salts or their conductivity.

Compared to most other methods, the use of hydrometers has the advantage of cheapness. Hydrometers are calibrated by the manufacturer, and because they are simply weighted glass, they reveal any lack of calibration clearly (they break). The breakability of hydrometers may be considered a disadvantage for field studies, however they are reasonably robust if they are carried in a hydrometer box.

Hydrometers are available in several ranges, and the precision of the results depends on the range of the hydrometer. For salt lake studies, a set of three hydrometers will conveniently cover the entire range of specific gravities from freshwater (SG 1.000) through the crysatallisation point of common salt (SG 1.218) up to the approximate precipitation range of epsom salts (SG 1.300).

Hydrometer readings need to be corrected for temperature because warmer water expands and becomes less dense.

Densimeters are expensive but are available in versions that measure an extremely fine resolution. The fine glass capillary U-tube used in these machines may break if it is exposed to excessive heat. This can happen when carrying these items in cars in desert conditions. 


===Densimeter method for estimating brine salinity===

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[needs someone to write this method]&lt;/font&gt;?&lt;br&gt;


===Hydrometer method for estimating brine salinity as specific gravity===
The use of a hydrometer is the same, regardless of whether it is reading Baume, Brix, SG or some other measure. The instructions here are for a specific gravity (SG) hydrometer. If you use other types of hydrometers, a [[Methods_Manual_for_Salt_Lake_Studies/Salinity|table]] is available to convert the readings into SG or TDS (g/L or g/kg).


====Equipment required:====
*Measuring cylinder 
*hydrometer 
*thermometer 
*temperature correction chart 


====To determine brine specific gravity:====
*Fill a measuring cylinder with brine sample to the point of overflowing 
*Float a hydrometer in brine sample 
*Read and record density level on shaft of hydrometer to level of water 
*Insert thermometer in brine sample 
*Read and record temperature of sample 
*Add or subtract degrees of density according to the temperature of the sample (see Temperature Correction, below) 
*Record corrected reading in laboratory daybook 


====Things to keep in mind:====
*If the hydrometer either sinks to the bottom, or floats too high for a reading to be made, you are using an incorrect hydrometer. Select one with a differing range. 
*All hydrometer readings must be corrected from the temperature they were read at, to the temperature the hydrometer was designed for. Most hydrometers are calibrated at 15.6 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C (60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F). Some saltfields have hydrometers calibrated at 20&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. The calibration temperature is noted on the shaft of the hydrometer. Check any hydrometer prior to use! 
*Always record the uncorrected reading and the temperature, as well as the corrected reading. In the event of a miscalculation, there is no way of correcting a &quot;corrected&quot; reading unless the raw data is available! 


====Temperature correction:====
The following advice for temperature correction is based on the CRC Handbook of Physics and Chemistry and on Bonython's research for ICI (1948),

'''1. For brines between SG 1.000 and SG 1.100'''
The difference each degree of temperature makes to the SG is not constant, however very approximate corrections are:

For every 5 degrees the sample is above the hydrometer's calibrated temperature, add 0.001 
For every 5 degrees the sample is below the hydrometer's calibrated temperature, take off 0.001 
This is sufficiently accurate for temperatures between 0oC and 40oC, but should not be used outside this temperature range. A more accurate formula is:

Correction (to add on to raw hydrometer reading) = ''Raw SG + (0.00000359 x temp2 + 0.00006971 x temp - 0.00151687)'' 

'''2. For brines between SG 1.100 and SG 1.200'''
The difference each degree of temperature makes to the SG is not constant, however very approximate corrections are:

For every 3 degrees the sample is above the hydrometer's calibrated temperature, add 0.001 
For every 3 degrees the sample is below the hydrometer's calibrated temperature, take off 0.001 
This is sufficiently accurate for temperatures between 0oC and 40oC, but should not be used outside this temperature range. A more accurate formula is:

Correction (to add on to raw hydrometer reading) = ''Raw SG + (0.000012 x temp2 + 0.000016 x temp - 0.00288)''
 
'''3. For brines above SG 1.200'''
The difference each degree of temperature makes to the SG is not constant, however very approximate corrections are:

For every 2 degrees the sample is above the hydrometer's calibrated temperature, add 0.001 
For every 2 degrees the sample is below the hydrometer's calibrated temperature, take off 0.001 
This is sufficiently accurate for temperatures between 0oC and 40oC, but should not be used outside this temperature range. A more accurate formula is:

Correction (to add on to raw hydrometer reading) = ''Raw SG + (0.000009 x temp2 +0.000235 x temp - 0.005475)''
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

====Conversion from specific gravity to TDS (g/L):====

If you wish to convert '''temperature corrected SG''' to total dissolved solids (TDS g/L), a curve has been derived from Baseggio's paper on the composition of seawater derived hyperaline brines (Baseggio, 1974)

''TDS (g/L) = -91897 SG&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 403869 SG&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; - 663919 SG&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 485355 SG - 133408''


This curve is suitable for use with brines that have densities between SG 1.000 and SG 1.250. For specific gravity readings above this, the curve is not valid.


If you wish to convert directly from '''uncorrected SG and temperature''' to TDS (g/L), the table below provides a useful field conversion for the range from freshwater to SG 1.050, for temperatures between 5&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C and 33&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.

===Electrical conductivity overview===

Electrical conductivity is the most commonly used measure of salinity, however its relationship to the mass of dissolved salts is not constant. This becomes most noticeable as the salinity increases. In addition, the various ions that may be present in the brine of salt lakes may be more or less conductive than a simple sodium chloride salt solution.

Four pole conductivity meters are available that are capable of measuring from freshwater to nearly four times the salinity of seawater (from 0-200 mS/cm). Prices for conductivity meters that can measure this wide range are considerably more expensive than the two pole 'pocket testers' commonly available. The necessity to calibrate the meter regularly adds further to the cost of ownership.


===Electrical conductivity method for estimating salinity===
Calibrate the meter following the directions in the EC meter manufacturer's manual. Ensure your calibration solution is fresh. If your conductivity meter measures a wide range of conductivity, make sure you use a calibration solution with a similar conductivity range to the brine you plan to measure.

To measure your brine sample, insert the EC probe and temperature probe (if separate) into the brine sample and stir gently. 
Wait until the reading stabilises and record reading in the laboratory daybook or field book. 

Report the EC as mS/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Be aware that EC does not directly correlate to total soluble salts. An approximation useful for salinities up to seawater strength is to multiply the EC by 670, to obtain Total Soluble Salts in mg/L. Alternatively, use the salinity conversion [[Methods_Manual_for_Salt_Lake_Studies/Salinity|table]].

===Overcoming the limitations of EC in hypersaline situations===
Prof Brian Timms (Australia) recommends carrying volumetric flasks in the field (polypropylene ones do not break as readily as glass ones) to allow you to dilute your sample with distilled water. This allows you to measure the EC of very concentrated brines approaching the crystallisation point of common salt. Convert the EC to TDS mg/L (or g/L) and then correct the result for the dilution. 

When using an electrical conductivity meter that measures over 100mS/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, always aim to have your diluted sample reading in the 100-150 mS/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; range. Because the relationship curve between dissolved salts and electrical conductivity flattens out in the upper ranges, errors are larger in this area. If you are using a diluted sample, you will multiply the size of any error.

===Refractive Index===

Refractometers measure the deflection of light through a drop of water. This is affected by the amount of salts dissolved in the water. It is unknown what impact the varying salts in solution have on the refractivity of the brine, but it would seem logical that different ionic solutions may refract light differently, suggesting that, for example, specific gravity results obtained from a refractometer may not match those obtained from the same brine with a hydrometer.

Handheld refractometers cost in the region of $400 each. The instruments do not take kindly to being entirely immersed in salt water, but are reasonably easy to repair unless the prism is scratched or damaged, in which case the entire unit is usually replaced. Refractometers may be purchased that display a range of measures (specific gravity, salinity parts per thousand, brix and salinity percent). Use one that displays SG and/or salinity parts per thousand. The reading is affected by temperature. The instrument should come with a manual that explains how to correct the readings

===Chloride titration overview===

Chloride presence in waters may be determined by several methods. For freshwaters and acid waters spectrophotometers may be used with a range of analytical methods. For saline and hypersaline waters,  most commercially available spectrophotometric methods require dilutions in excess of those appropriate for good laboratory practice. For these waters titration is recommended. 

Chloride titration measures the chloride content of salt waters. This is useful if the brines are marine derived, as it is possible to compare the resulting chloride concentration against tables such as Gino Baseggio’s ''Composition of Seawater'' (Baseggio, 1974) to estimate the salinity based on the chloride reading. The limitations of the method relate to two aspects – the chloride titration itself, and the mix of ions in the brine.

Chloride titrations may be based on silver nitrate or a mercuric reagent. The latter is more accurate and has a clearer end-point. The former is safer to use and environmentally less damaging if some reagents are spilled. However the end-point is notoriously hard to determine. Practice at determining the end point, against a standard, is essential.

In saline lakes where the ionic mixture is not marine derived, the use of chloride as a surrogate salinity method could underestimate salinity significantly.


===Mohr's method for chloride titration===

Mohr's method, often called the argentometric method (Eaton ''et al'', 1995), determines the chloride ion concentration of a solution by titration with silver nitrate, and is suitable for highly saline brines. As the silver nitrate solution is slowly added, a white precipitate of silver chloride forms. The end point of the titration occurs when all the chloride ions in the sample are precipitated. Then additional silver nitrate ions from the titre react with the chromate ions of the indicator, potassium chromate, to form a red-brown precipitate of silver chromate. The same reaction occurs with bromide, so this analysis will provide: 
* chloride concentrations for waters with negligible bromide, 
* bromide concentrations for waters with negligible chloride and
* combined chloride/bromide concentrations for waters containing both elements.

Determine appropriate sample size and burette size before starting. Smaller burettes have a finer resolution than larger burettes. Choose a burette based on the resolution you will require. Given that 1mL 0.1M AgNO3 is equivalent to 3.545 mg Cl-,
estimate how large your sample size needs to be, to use no more than a full burette of titre. 

Should the sample size be very small, prepare a dilution instead and use a larger aliquot. 

In situations where the approximate range of chloride in the sample is unknown, measure the specific gravity of the sample to gain an estimate of its salinity. If the water has any marine derivation, use a reference table such as Baseggio's (1974) to determine the likely concentration range of chloride.


====Things to keep in mind====
* Test against a standard (made from AR grade NaCl) monthly. 
* Record standard results on the appropriate standards chart. 
* Analyse a blank (demineralised water) each run, record it and use in calculation. 
* Use disposable gloves. Take care not to splash chemicals. Any splashes should be immediately rinsed with water.
* Dilutions much above 1:10 introduce errors   
* Consider using a larger burette rather than a larger dilution. 
 

====Equipment and reagents required====
* Beaker and stirrer bar

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Tahirids ==

The Tahirid dynasty was established by Tahir ibn Husayn who was the Abbasid Governor of Khorasan in the early years of the 9th century AD. He was a native of Herat in Afghanistan and fought with Al Mamun against Al Amin. In 822, he proclaimed himself the independent king of Khorasan. However, he died the same night and was succeeded by his son Talha ibn Tahir.  

Talha consolidated the newly founded Tahirid kingdom. He waged a protracted battle against the Kharijites of Sistan. He was succeeded by his son Abdullah ibn Tahir ewho fought with the Samanids in the east and Tabaristan in the west. The most important event of Abdullah's reign was the rebellion of the Tabaristani prince Maziyar which was successfully put down by Abdullah with the support of the Caliph. Tabaristan was successfully incorporated into the Tahirid kingdom and Maziyar was captured and executed.  Abdullah died in Nishapur in 844 or 845 and was succeeded by his son Tahir II. Tahir II's reign was marked by the successful rebellion in Sistan which made itself independent of Tahirid rule in . Tahir II ruled for about eighteen years. On his death in 862, he wished his younger son Muhammad b Tahir to  succeed him. But as he was reluctant to occupy the throne, another son of Tahir II, Muhammad bin Tahir became the king. 

Muhammad bin Tahir ruled from 862 to 873 and was the last king of the Tahirid dynasty. Muhammad was young and inexperienced and could not stop the kingdom from disintegrating in front his eyes. In 864, Tabaristan rose in rebellion under the Zaydids and proclaimed its independence. In 867, war broke out between Muhammad and the Saffarids. The Saffarid chief Yaqub bin Laith as Saffar took Herat and imprisoned the Tahirid governor. The Samanid prince Ibrahim bin Ilyas tried to rescue him but was defeated. In 873, Yakub bin Laith successfully besieged the Tahirid capital Nishapur and captured Muhammad. Though, Muhammad was freed by the arrival of the troops of the Caliphate in 876, the Tahirid capital Nishapur remained with the Saffarids and Muhammads spent the last few years as a refugee in Baghdad. With Muhammad bin Tahir, the Tahirid dynasty came to an end.

== Saffarids ==

The Saffarid dynasty was established by an adventurer from the province of Sistan in Eastern Iran. Like the Tahirid kingdom, the Saffarid kingdom was dominated by ethnic Iranians and ruled Eastern Iran till the 11th century AD.

=== Yakub ibn Laith ===

The Saffarid dynasty was established by Yakub ibn Laith of Khorasan. According to popular reports, Yakub started his career as a bandit and rose to become a tribal chieftain. Being the son of a coppersmith, he, however, commenced his career as a coppersmith and hence earned the title &quot;as-Saffar&quot; or &quot;coppersmith&quot;.

Yakub ibn Laith was the son of a pewterer of Sistan. He started life as an coppersmith but dissatisfied with his earnings, he took to banditry and rose to become chief of highway robbers. A local chieftain sought Yakub's help to establish an independent state of his own. bin Laith obliged but on the success of the campaign, he immediately overthrew his master and established himself as the chief of Sistan. His power and influence reached its zenith when the Caliph of Baghdad recognised him as the independent ruler of Sistan and enlisted his service in conquering non-Islamic territories. He also offered to crown him as Emperor.

However, Yakub refused and sent him a rebuttal.

Tell the Caliph that I am already indebted to my sword for the territories he so generously bestows upon me. If I live, that sword shall decide between us - if  I die, he shall be freed from apprehensions.

Within a short time, he overthrew Abbasid rule in Khorasan. In 867, he established himself as an independent ruler with his capital at Zaranj in modern-day Afghanistan and began minting his own coins.  He ruled for twelve years during which he brought the whole of Afghanistan, Eastern Iran and Baluchistan under his control. He defeated the Tahirids and drove them out of Khorasan. He then seized control of the Iranian provinces of Fars and Ahvaz. In 878, he even launched an unsuccessful invasion of Baghdad.

Yakub died in 879 and was succeeded by his brother Amir.

=== Amir ibn Laith ===

Amir succeeded Yakub in 879 and commenced his reign by sending a letter of submission to the Abbasid Caliph Motaded. However, soon, his friendship began to whither away as the two powers had frequent territorial disputes. The Caliph invaded Sistan but was defeated. He instigated the Samanid chief Ismael to attack Sistan. Ismael successfully vanquished Sistan and captured Amir. He was taken to Baghdad and put to death in 901.

=== Abul Hasan Tahir ===
 
When Amir was captured in 900-01, his son Abul Hasan Tahir was crowned king at Zaranj jointly With his brother Abu Yusuf Yaqub. The Turkish slave Sebuk-eri wielded paramount authority in the kingdom during the early years of the brothers' reign.
 
In 900-01, Abul Hasan Tahir attacked Fars along with Sebuk-eri in order to recover the losses they had suffered during the reign of their predecessor. The province was successfully taken and ceded to Sebuk-eri who began to rule as if like a quasi-independent monarch. Soon, rebellions broke out in the provinces of the Saffarid kingdom by people discontent at the lavish lifestyle led by the brothers.

In 908, the Saffarid prince, Al Laith bin Ali invaded Zaranj and besieged the city. The brothers requested the help of Sebuk-eri who responded at once on receipt of their demand for help. However, the reinforcements were not as effective as expected and Zaranj fell. The brothers fled to Fars and sought protection with Sebuk-eri. But the brothers soon dissented with Sebuk-eri who captured them and handed them over to the Caliph of Baghdad.

=== Civil war and fall ===

On taking over Zaranj, Al Laith crowned himself king and ruled from 909 to 910. In February 910, Al Laith invaded Fars and defeated Sebuk-eri. But soon afterwards, Al Laith was captured through intrigue and sent to Baghdad as prisoner. Al Laith was succeeded by Muhammad bin Laith who launched an unsuccessful invasion of the Samanids of the north. The Saffarid capital Zaranj was invaded and captured by the Samanids in 911 forcing Muhammad to seek refuge in the town of Bust. However, Bust, too, was soon besieged by the Samanids. Muhammad tried to drive out the Samanids and ws successful for sometime. But as he entered the city, he was ambushed. The Saffarid army tried to escape and were pursued by the Samanid army. Muhammad was captured and imprisoned. Sistan was briefly conquered by the Samanids.

=== Abu Jafar bin Muhammad ===

A few months after Samanid occupation a rebellion broke out against the tyrannical rule of the Samanid governor. Samanid rule was overthrown and Abu Hafs Amir, nephew of Tahir I was crowned king on May 2, 912. This rebellion was successful due to the support of Muhammad bin Hormuz a former Samanid soldier and the Ayyarun. However, the Samanids soon organised a counter-attack on Sistan and retook Zaranj. Amir surrendered and was exiled to Samarkand. Sistan remained in Samanid hands till 923, when Abu Jafar Ahmad bin Muhammad who was of Saffarid lineage proclaimed himself king of Sistan. He overthrew the Samanid governor of Sistan Abdullah bin Ahmad who was highly unpopular due to his stringent taxes. Abdullah was captured in October 923. Following his capture, Abdullah's son  Aziz fought against Abu Jafar till 925 when he was finally vanquished and forced to flee.

Abu Jafar bin Muhammad consolidated the Saffarid kingdom and wiped out remnants of Samanid rule in Sistan. He ushered in a period of peace and stability. He expanded the Saffarid kingdom by conquering Kirman and other lands held by the Abbasid Caliphate. He had to wage a lifelong battle to bring peace and stability in Bust. But once the enemies were vanquished, there was perpetual peace and prosperity. Poets such as Rudaki and scholars such as  Abu Sulayman Muhammad al-Sijistani and Nasafi flourished in Abu Jafar's reign.


=== Khalaf ibn Abu Jafar ===

In the 950s, while Abu Jafar was busy fighting in Bust, a pretender tried to capture the throne in Zaranj. Abu Jafar hurried to Zaranj to meet the pretender and died fighting the rebels in 963. Upon hearing the news of his death, his son Abu Ahmad Khalaf rushed to Zaranj and drove away the rebels. Not long afterward, there was a rebellion by the Ayyarun which was put down by Khalaf. After his success against the Ayyarun, Khalaf made a pilgrimage to Mecca. On his way home, he stopped at Baghdad in 965. AT Baghdad, Khalaf had an audience with the Abbasid Caliph who recognised him as the independent ruler of Sistan who bestowed a robe of honour upon him. He returned to Zaranj and vanquished all rival claimants to the throne by 970. 

In 971, Zaranj was besieged by Husayn bin Abul Husayn Tahir, a Saffarid claimant whom Khalaf had killed. Khalaf was initially successful in driving him out. But Husayn returned with reinforcements from the Samanids and took the city. Khalaf was forced to surrender and shift his capital out of Zaranj. However, as soon as the Samanid forces left, Khalaf once again besieged Zaranj forcing Husayn to request the assistance of the Sabuktigin, the king of Ghazni. But as Sabuktigin arrived, Khalaf coerced the king to support him instead. Driven to dire straits, Husayn was left no option but to surrender. An agreement was eventually reached on December 25, 983. Husayn died soon afterwards.

Like his father before him, Khalaf promoted fine arts and scholarship. All through this time, Khalaf maintained a precarious friendship with the Ghaznavids.Khalaf took Bust by force when Sabuktigin was busy fighting the Hindu Shahis but returned the conquered lands soon afterwards. When a civil war broke out between Sabuktigin's sons, Ismail and Mahmud in 997, Khalaf saw his chance and captured Kohistan and Baghdis from the Ghaznavids. However, soon after the civil war came to an end, the new Ghaznavid king, Mahmud attacked Sistan and defeated Khalaf forcing him to surrender all his conquests. Khalaf broke the peace a few months later when his son Tahir invaded Kirman. He also rebelled against Khalaf. Tahir was captured and imprisoned. He died in 1002.

By late 1002, Khalaf's unpopularity anbd tyrannical rule had reached such proportions that the inhabitants of Zaranj invited Mahmud Ghaznavi to liberate them. Ghaznavi successfully besieged Zaranj and captured Khalaf. Khalaf was sent to  Farighunid Guzgan and then, Gardiz, where he died in 1009. With Khalaf's death, the Saffarid dynasty came to an end.

== The Samanids ==

The Samanid dynasty traces its ancestry to one Saman Khuda, a Zoroastrian convert to Islam who hailed from the village of Saman in Balkh, Afghanistan. At an early age, he moved to the town of Merv, the seat of the Abbasid Governor of Khorasan, converted to Islam and held an influential position in the court. Very little is known about Saman Khuda or about his past. While some sources claim that he was  a descendant of the Sassanian general Bahram Chobin and therefore a member of the Mehran clan which held  a position of influence in the Sassanid court others claim that he was a nobleman native to Balkh. However, it is well known that he lived in the first half of the 8th century AD. 

The Samanids rose into prominence when Saman's grandson Yahya was given authority over the town of Shash in Khorasan in the year 819. Following the death of his brother Nuh ibn Asad, the ruler of Samarkand, Yahya was also given authority over Samarkand by the Abbasid Governor of Khorasan. However, despite wielding considerable authority of his own, Yahya still acted as a feudatory of the Abbasid Governor of Khorasan. Yahya died in 855 and was succeeded by his son Nasr I who conquered the town of Bukhara in Central Asia. Nasr I ruled jointly with his brother Ismail who became the sole-ruler of Khorasan and Transoxiana on his brother's death in 892. During Ismail's reign, the Samanids wielded a great amount of power in Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia. Ismail expanded Samanid authority in the east taking Talas, the capital of the Qalugh Turks in 893 and put an end to the Ustrushana dynasty. He expanded the Samanid frontiers far into Central Asia, the homeland of the Turkish tribes.

In 898, a major conflict erupted between the Samanids and the Saffarids on the exercise of sovereignty over Transoxiana. The Saffarids under Amir invaded Samanid territory but were defeated on the banks of the Syr Darya in 900 and Amir was himself captured. Ismail handed Amir over to the Caliph of Baghdad who in turn  rewarded him with the provinces of Tabaristan, Ray and Isfahan. Ismail affirmed his authority over Isfahan by sending a large army to drive out the . Ismail was succeeded by his son Ahmad II who secured territorial rights over Sistan from the Caliph of Baghdad. Ahmad II then dismissed the Saffarid monarch and appointed his own loyalists on the throne. However, Sistan was soon gripped by a revolt and Ahmad II was killed in 914 while attempting to suppress the rebellion. Ahmad II was succeeded by his son Nasr II who assumed the throne at the age of eight. The administration of the state was under a regency council headed by the minister Abu ’Abd-Allah al-Jaihani until Nasr II attained adulthood.The early years of Nasr II's reign was plagued by rebellions by members of the royal family who wished to take advantage of sovereign's minority and capture the throne for himself. However, their attempts were thwarted by the loyal minister Jaihani. Vast parts of Samanid territory were lost due to this handicap. Sistan was reclaimed by the Abbasids while Ray and Tabaristan were conquered by Al-Utrush. Nasr II, however, managed to occupy Gurgan and re-establish his authority over Ray.      

During the reign of Nasr II, the Samanid capital Bukhara emerged as a major cultural centre. Nasr II's ministers were patrons of art and learning. Bukhara became an important meeting place for geographers, scientists and astronomers. Nasr II abdicated in 943 in favour of his son Nuh I, who put down a revolt in Khwarezm in 943 and another by Abu Ali Chaghani, the Samanid vassal of Chaghaniyan in 945. However, the most serious of the revolts was the one by Ibrahim ibn Simjur who besieged the capital Bukhara in 947 forcing Nuh I to seek asylum in Samarkand. However, Ibrahim's rebellion  failed as he was soon driven out of Bukhara.

Nuh I later pardoned  Abu Ali and appointed him governor of Khorasan. However, he removed Abu Ali from his post on receiving complaints from Ziyarids who were close allies of the Samanids that Abu Ali hd concluded friendly terms with Buyids who were staunch enemies of the Ziyarids. Abu Ali sought refuge in Ray, the principal town of the Buyids and conspired with the Buyids to recover Khorasan. However, Nuh I died before he could give a suitable reply and was succeeded by his son Abd Al Malik. Abd Al Malik, however, did not have the necessity of dealing with Abu Ali as he died shortly after Abd Al Malik had assumed the throne. 

Abd Al Malik ruled for seven years. During his reign, the kingdom was plagued by invasions from the Turks who firmly cemented their dominance in Khorasan. On Abd Al Malik's death in 961, the Turkish chief Alptigin tried to put his son on the throne but was thwarted by Faiq who made Al Malik's brother Abu Salih Mansur the king of the Samanids. Alptigin fled to Ghazni where he established the Ghaznavid kingdom.

Abu Salih Mansur or Mansur I ruled from 961 to 976. He was a feeble ruler who witnessed the rapid decline of the kingdom during his lifetime. The Buyids and Ziyarids defied the authority of the Samanid ruler, the faithful Buyids now refusing to pay him tribute. The Samanid infuence in Sistan, too, disappeared completely with the Saffarid rulers refusing to pay tribute. Mansur I died in 976 and was succeeded by his son Nuh II. Nuh II was still a minor when he ascended the throne and soon after his accession,the Karakhanids captured the upper Zarafshan valley where most of the kingdom's copper mines were located. 

An army was sent to fight the Karakhanids but was defeated. Similarly, Nuh II also failed to subdue the Buyids who inflicted a crushing defeat on Samanid attempts to established their dominance. COurt intrigues resulted in the fall in favour of Nuh II's grand vizier, Abul Husain Abdullah ibn Ahmad  Utbi who was subsequently assassinated. Soon after Utbi's death, an uprising broke out in the capital Bukhara. Nuh Ii was able to maintain order with the help of the general Tash but Samanid authority rapidly fell apart due to mutual jealousies. At the end of 991, Turkish principalities adjoining the eastern frontiers of the Samanid Empire, instigated by the Karakhanids, launched a full scaled invasion of the kingdom. A big Turkish force under Bughra Khan conquered Samarkand and marched on Bukhara in the spring of 992. Anticipating a defeat, Nuh fled to the west. However, Bughra Khan fell ill and died shortly after his arrival at Bukhara. Nuh II collected a mighty force and recovered Bukhara after defeating the Turks. Following the departure of the Turks, a civil war broke out. Nuh II's enemies at court conspired to overthrow him. Nuh II, on his part, requested the assistance of Sabuktigin and his son Mahmud of Ghazni. Sabuktigin arrived at the head of a mighty force and defeated the conspirators. Nuh II rewarded them with territories and titles for their help. He appointed Mahmud the governor of Khorasan.   

In 995, the conspirators drow away Mahmud from Nishapur. However, with aid of Sabuktigin, Mahmud was restored and the rebels were defeated and captured. With this victory, the Ghaznavids consolidated their hold over Khorasan and all the lands south of the Syr Darya while the Karakhanids held most of the land in the north-east. Nuh II died in 997. By the time of his death, the Samanid Empire had diminished to the region in and around Bukhara. Mansur II was young when he ascended the throne and soon after his accession, had to face a rebellion. Mansur II was, however, successful in crushing this mutiny. In 998, Mansur II tried to recover Khorasan from the Ghaznavids and allied with the Samanid general Bektuzun. However, Bektuzun distrusted Mansur II whom he blinded and replaced with his younger brother Abd Al Malik II in 999.
 
Abd Al Malik II was the last monarch of the Samanid dynasty. Soon after his accession, the Ghaznavid ruler Mahmud invaded and conquered the rest of Khorasan to avenge the overthrow and blinding of Mansur II. But when Bektuzun and Simjuri, the ruler of Kohistan stepped into the fray, Mahmud withdrew and proposed terms of peace. But shortly afterwards, Abd Al Malik II and his allkies violated the truce by attacking the rear of the Ghaznavid army. Mahmud, at once, resumed the war and inflicted a crushing defeat on the allies at Merv. With this victory, Mahmud became the supreme overlord of all lands to the south of Syr Darya. At this juncture, the Karakhanids broke into revolt. Mahmud grabbed this opportunity to besiege Bukhara which was successfully conquered. Abd Al Malik II was captured and taken prisoner. With the fall of Bukhara, the Samanid dynasty came to an end and  its territories became part of the Ghaznavid Empire.

I thought it was notable that you said you plan to make your lessons creative and interesting, but that you are also strict. I also hope to hold my students to high standards, but I wonder if that is harder to do in the real world? I'm curious because you said you have been teaching for several years. Do administrators support you when you feel you need to give a lower grade to a student who isn't working to his or her ability? Is it hard to maintain high standards when other teachers do not? I ask because I have seen low expectations in some schools and very high expectations in others. 

[[User:Lroth009|Lroth009]] ([[User talk:Lroth009|talk]]) 02:46, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

Your philosophy is great.  To exercise the mind and encourage the students to be creative at all times are skills that will last a lifetime.  It is not a crime to make students learn because they are applying the information, rather than memorizing and reciting.  I appreciate your philosophy and believe it will work wonderfully in your classroom.

I think you have a Great Philosophy and a creative approach is always a great idea.  The only thing that i think is that you may be a little to serious about being so strict.  It may just be because im younger than you are but i feel that i never learned as well in a strict setting as i did in a not so strict setting.  This week the teacher that im observiing told me that they are just kids and kids will be kids so let them have fun to some extent.  IM sure you will be a great teacher though and best of luck to you.

Wow, you are very ambitious. I love school personaly and I'am glad to see someone working toward a masters degree. I will be working toward my masters degree next fall. If ODU doesn't find another class that I have to take. I don't know where they keep finding classes I feel that I have taken everything possible.I think that now a days teachers need to be strict. Kids think they can get away with everything. I think knowing another language is great. Good luck with everything you do.

The Needs of Gifted Students
by Brandie Thomas

The label “gifted student” is one that requires special attention, no different than for a student labeled “learning disabled” or “ADHD.” There is no way to present every optional teaching method for dealing with gifted students in one article. I will simply attempt to present both sides to the question of whether gifted students can “take care of themselves.” There are many differing options on the subject with many reasons for each side. However, the beauty of this topic is that there are options for compromises, meaning a teacher may not have to choose one extreme (gifted students always independently teaching themselves and meeting their own needs) or the other (fully integrating them into a regular '''classroom).''' Let’s explore.

Learning Targets:
    Define differentiation and inclusion.
    Describe how inclusion and pull-out educational methods can be combined.
    Recognize appropriate methods to enrich streamlined lessons.
    Identify the pros and cons of both pull-out classes and '''integrated''' classrooms.
I will include a sidebar here of a link to reproducible print-outs to use with gifted children.

Inclusion
The first teaching method option supports the answer that yes, gifted students can take care of themselves. It is full integration of gifted students into a classroom. Before the details are discussed, it is important to note that 61% of teachers do not have formal training in teaching gifted children (National Association for Gifted Children, 2008). Inclusion is most commonly defined as “grouping of students in regular classrooms without regard to ability. It is based on social, not academic concerns” (Nordby, 2004). The fully-streamlined gifted student would be in a regular classroom all day with possibly only a few extra activities to occupy their minds. Another course of full integration is for children to enter kindergarten a year early or for first grade to be skipped altogether; that way, these gifted children are shooed onto the next level where learning in a regular classroom will theoretically be on their level. However, parents may choose not to do this when taking into consideration differences between their child and older children such as being too small for athletics or other concerns. Later, compromised versions of inclusion will be discussed. This teaching method of full integration holds the premise that gifted children can indeed take care of themselves, in the respect that they can keep themselves busy and on task on the many '''occasions''' when they finish their assigned tasks before other children. Enrichment in the regular classroom can be put into action with a variety of methods. Just a few of these are: grouping kids based on level of achievement (in reading, for example), called and discussed by Smutney et. al. as “tiered groups”; and having a gifted student become a “resident expert” in a subject of the teacher or student’s choosing.

Gifted students tend to think differently and often are plagued by other issues, just a few of which are feeling alienated for being “smarter” than friends, “super-high expectations” placed on them, and being “overwhelmed” by their '''over average''' skills (Delisle &amp; Lewis, 2003). Smutny, Walker, &amp; Meckstroth list several more major problems that are faced across the board by most gifted children. Some of these problems might be fairly difficult to identify or uncover like introversion, having difficulty finding a balance of control concerning independence and nonconformity, and being “deeply” concerned about the issues of the world and maybe feeling helpless about these situations. For any of these issues [and other issues that might come with being gifted] to be noted and addressed, teachers must have real time and pay special attention to their gifted students. In an inclusive classroom, it is extremely difficult to make that time. Also, a teacher might not have enough work to keep a gifted student actively learning and experimenting with new knowledge. Additional worksheets are neither a reward for finishing work early and correctly, nor are they effective learning tools all the time. These two issues are among the first discussed regarding why students should not be fully integrated into a classroom. Proponents of this stance claim that gifted students are not being allowed or coached to live up to their potential while they are taught with these methods.
There are some positives to the model of inclusion. Integrated gifted students are around other kids their age. In a regular classroom, teachers can make sure the students are getting the information they need for their end-of-grade tests, not just working on projects or missing details by teaching themselves. Gifted students are less likely to be singled out even if they do finish work early. In an integrated classroom other students are more likely to see the gifted students as leaders whereas if they are taken out of the classroom, a negative '''connotation''' is easily pinned on them. There is also no extra work from a separate class if there is no extra class. That is something most students would appreciate, even if the “extra work” were fun activities and exercises. Finally, in this situation, other students’ parents are less likely to claim that gifted kids are getting special privileges (Smutny et. al.).

Taking Care of Themselves: Pull-Out Classes
Delisle &amp; Lewis break down the different levels of pull-out classes and this breakdown is summed up in Figure 3.7 on page 67 which shows a triangular diagram of “appropriate pacing” of these levels: enrichment in the regular classroom to special classes up to special schools. (The first level, enrichment in the regular classroom, was discussed in the inclusion section of this article.) This diagram is not suggesting that all gifted students participate in all three levels but to instead find the level which is most appropriate for their learning needs. Of course, all school districts do not offer these choices. In my research, my experience as a teacher and gifted student and in talking with a mix of teachers, having special classes for gifted students is probably the most effective pull-out class route. Some schools offer as part of their gifted students’ enrichment program “extras” like seminars, or year-long projects that teach more about writing skills, go more in-depth, and maybe require a hands-on project, for example. All three of the year-long project components delve deeper into the learning realm that these students would be receiving in a regular classroom. Also in elementary and middle schools are classes that students attend, taking time out of their regular classes or classroom that expand on regular classroom lessons. Delisle &amp; Lewis also mention regional and national scholarly competitions that advocate creative thinking and/or problem-solving, such as Odyssey of the Mind (which I participated in and had a wonderful experience) and Science Olympiad. At the high-school level, Honors and AP classes are offered.

Some downsides to pull-out classes are more reasons that make them impossible to endeavor, not reasons why they are not an effective teaching choice. Funding is a top reason pull-out classes might be difficult to start and maintained, cited by principals and administrators across the country. Trips have to be paid for, a formally-trained teacher found and salaried, more supplies have to be bought for the many projects to be done, and parents have to be persuaded to participate in the extras of the gifted child’s pull-out education, just to name a few issues. When students have a routine pull-out class, it takes a great deal of coordination for the gifted teacher to coordinate the timing and content of her projects with those of the regular classroom teacher. Delisle &amp; Lewis also notes some tendencies I call lazy and just mean. These authors talk about the rare case where teachers punish pull-out kids by making them make up every single page of work they missed while they were out of the classroom, or by planning field trips or other fun activities during the pull-out class time. Having gifted students leave the room for special instruction may also be a pass for the regular classroom teacher to not challenge the gifted students while they are in the class.

The advantages of pull-out classes are myriad. In a pull-out class, children get to work with students who reason as they do and who are all on higher intellectual levels. There is often a creative and original curriculum in these classes so they keep students interested in school and teaches them more about the different ways to learn. Delisle &amp; Lewis point out that in this scenario, there is one central person per school district through whom all students, problems, questions, and curricula flow so it keeps the gifted program organized and with a good gifted teacher, this is the getting the job done efficiently.
The Compromise

There are many compromises between the two extremes. One is differentiated teaching methods and activities. Delisle &amp; Lewis introduce curriculum compacting which is skipping materials that gifted students already know. Why waste time, right? Independent study inside the classroom is also an option (becoming a “resident expert” is a good example). During research projects, while students are practicing their research strategies, teachers might take this time to expose the gifted students who already know those strategies new technologies and higher-level resources. The aforementioned year-long, multiple-pronged project is a great differentiation experience. A teacher can also provide more complex and in-depth centers using “tiered groups” (Smutny et. al.). While having computer lab time, gifted students can, after mastering regular curriculum, be introduced to advanced computer programs. Also having students think of real-life problems in the world or situations they come in contact with promotes creative thinking on a higher level as well, and can be done while in a regular classroom, after having finished assignments.

Teachers and administrators have serious considerations to mull over and plan for. Not meeting the needs of gifted students puts in jeopardy these kids’ learning potential and desire. Gifted students have minds that, if taught how to open them up, produce unbelievable creativity. Each school district must decide which program best meets the needs of their students: inclusion, pull-out classes as the meat of a gifted program, or a combination of the two. One study shows how specific this process is and offers some insight on how to go about making this decision. One key component is to identify goals for gifted students and for the teachers who teach them (Weber, Boswell, &amp; Smith, 2008) because every gifted program must be focused or it will end in chaos and the students will not learn what they need to.</text>

My name is Kathryn Morris.  I am enrolled in the PreK-6 teacher licensure program through ODU at the distance learning site located in Halifax County, Virginia.  I have the hopes of becoming an elementary school teacher in the school system in Halifax, my hometown. 

I just graduated from Virginia Tech in May of 2008 with my Bachelor’s of Science in Human Development with a concentration in Human Services.  The four years I spent at Virginia Tech were truly some of the best years of my life.  I must say that I absolutely love being a Hokie!  One of my favorite things to do is watch the Virginia Tech football team play in Lane Stadium, and now, as an alumni, I hope to be able to return to Blacksburg for some games this fall.  In addition to watching the Hokies play football, I also enjoy all other types of sports.  On any given day you can catch me watching football, baseball, basketball, and even Nascar racing.  

Throughout college, I worked with children in many different aspects.  I have experience working with elementary aged children through substitute teaching in Halifax.  I also worked with preschool age children at Virginia Tech by working at the on campus Child Development Center for Learning and Research.  [http://www.humandevelopment.vt.edu/CDCLR]Through my experiences, I have come to realize that children are my passion, and I have such a great desire to work with them and begin teaching.

== My Teaching Philosophy ==
I hope to be a teacher that interacts well with students, parents, and coworkers.  I picture myself teaching in a very open, welcoming classroom environment.  I want my students and their parents to feel welcome once they enter the room.  My hopes are that I will be able to maintain an open line of communication between home and school for my students.  I will work to do this by communicating with my student’s parents positive and negative behaviors by sending home notes, calling them, and interacting with them in person.

With the new laws put into place by No Child Left Behind requiring inclusion of special education children, I hope to become a teacher who is very knowledgeable about the different types of disabilities so that I will be able to meet those children’s needs to the best of my abilities.  I think that by having patience with the students who have special needs, they will have the opportunity to learn just as well as those other students, only at different rates.

I hope to vary my instruction throughout the school day depending on the needs of my students.  I feel as if students learn better when they are taught using various strategies and methods.  Each student is different, therefore they all learn differently.  I hope that by using multiple methods of instruction, that I will be able to connect each student with all of my lessons.  I hope that by varying each lesson using lectures, group work, supplemental work, and technological means, that all of my students will be able to grasp each concept in their own way.

In order to assess my student’s progress, I will use tests and quizzes to evaluate them.  My hopes are to use tests that are similar to the Virginia Standards of Learning’s tests, in addition to other types.  I feel that it is important for children to become familiar with the layout of the SOL’s prior to taking them.  By taking tests throughout the school year that are similar to these tests, I don’t think that the children will become as nervous about taking the test when that time comes.

I hope that I will become a great teacher eventually.  More important than anything else, I hope that I will be able to treat all of my students fairly, and give each and every one of them the quality education that they deserve.

I really loved reading your philosophy on education!  Especially the part when you discussed working with kids who had disabilites to make sure they were NOT left behind.  My wish is for all teachers to feel that way, don't you?  I know I don't want to just teach to the masses, but would like to break students up into groups based on their abilities.

You seem very passionate too about keeping the lines of communication open with parents. When the students see their parents openly and regularly talking with the teacher the students see a team work approach that can only help them.  You seem so positive and sure about teaching and it really shows too.  Students really need to see just how positive you are and just like you said..testing them and assessing  them to make sure they are on track with the VA SOLS.  You will do very well in the classroom as your vision is very clear and thought out.  Good luck with everything.

Hey! I agree with your thoughts on making parental involvement a key to a student's success. I believe that learning starts at home, and if parents are not active in their child's lives then the child will not succeed in school and later on in life. They need not only support from teachers, but their moms and dads as well. [[User:Tgibs007|Tgibs007]] ([[User talk:Tgibs007|talk]]) 17:49, 29 May 2008 (UTC)

Hey Kathryn,

I really enjoyed reading about you and your educational philosophy. I can tell you will be a good teacher. Your desire to keep parents involve in their children education is a plus. I can see you working very hard trying to find strengths in each student, especially those that need you the most. Other important point that you mention is the ability to work cooperatively with others in your department and faculty to me those are qualities that not many teacher have out there. I really think you are in the right track. [[User:Amort007|Amort007]] ([[User talk:Amort007|talk]]) 02:33, 2 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

like:
something: s m th n g

=== About Aleph... ===

The text says about Aleph that &quot;When at the beginning of a word, it means the word starts with a vowel.&quot; I don't think it's correct.

== Font size ==

The Hebrew letters in the exercises are too small to discern which niqqud is which: just a &quot;speck&quot; on the screen. Can something be done about this?

'''Miscellaneous'''
I have three kids. My eldest son, 6, is in 1st grade, my daughter, 3 is in pre-school, and Baby Jonah (5 months at the start of the semester) is currently attending Harvard Medical School :-). As any mom will tell you kids change the way you spend your time. In my past life I loved to travel internationally, go out dancing and tear up the town. (I absolutely recommend spending time aborad - especially teaching abroad. Check out the link to Superkids if you like little kids. They are always looking for good teachers!) Nowadays, I spend a lot of time talking about dinosaurs and Superheroes. I still love to throw crazy theme parties and I really enjoy being outside (unless there are mosquitos). 

This is my second year teaching full time at ODU and I am thoroughly enjoying it. I love working with pre-service teachers. Teachers' work is to shape the future. I am honored to be one of the many influences on the future teachers here at ODU. My goal is to help teachers contemplate how they will affect the future: to consider what kind of impact they will have on the students they teach.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome Sommer,

I couldn't agree more about the necessity for children to start learning a second language at an early age. Before I took this job teaching ECI 301 at ODU, I wanted to start a bilingual school for babies. Yes, babies. My plan was for Chinese. There's no denying China's emergence as a world power and I think American children who grow up being able to speak Chinese and having a fundamental understanding of the Chinese culture would have a tremendous advantage. I think learning both could be accomplished through a bilingual school/day-care. Babies and young children automatically learn the language and culture of their care-takers. Children enrolled in a program taught half the day by native Chinese speakers and half the day by native English speakers would have the benefits of both languages and both cultures. I saw this happen when I worked at a pre-school in Budapest, Hungary. Many of the children had one parent from one culture and the other parent from another. They entered our pre-school - often to learn a third language- fully bilingual.  [[User:Jenniferjkidd|Jenniferjkidd]] ([[User talk:Jenniferjkidd|talk]]) 17:58, 25 May 2008 (UTC)

Hi Sommer,

Sounds interesting to work in a library. I can imagine that the customers you receive can have a wide rang of personalities. The tea vice, well it can't be too bad since there are far worse addictions. Also, your not the only one with a &quot;wondering&quot; mind. Personally, I feel that people with interests which vary and change often make the most interesting people. It keeps you busy and provides a life full of excitement and wonder.

Your educational philosophy is GREAT! I think your experience has paid off well. I am interested in seeing more on the No Child Left Behind issue since it is very important. The politicians keep attempting to make it out as a great thing but every teacher I have spoken to seem to think it is horrible.

Thanks,

Sommer,
I agree with a lot of things that you have said in your educational philosophy. I agree that kids should be grouped with children of their ability. I agree that kids learn better through each other through group activities. I also liked that you are a librarian, I'am complete oposite of you. I'm not a very quiet person, I like to talk alot even if it is just with myself. :) I also have a wondering mind. I like the fact that you are a writter. I wish I could be more like you in that department. English and writting are not my forte.
Best of luck,
[[User:Cwhit107|Cwhit107]] ([[User talk:Cwhit107|talk]]) 23:15, 31 May 2008 (UTC)

Hi Sommer,
 I really agree with the fact that children need to learn a second language as soon as they can I work in a day care and we make sure not only are we teaching all the children english and spanish but we are also teaching them sign language. I also enjoyed reading your educational philosophy including your stance on NCLB. Good Luck this year[[User:Swrig020|Swrig020]] ([[User talk:Swrig020|talk]]) 11:44, 1 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Returning values ===
When declaring a function, you must declare it in terms of the type that it will return, this is done in three steps, in the function declaration, the function implementation (if distinct) and on the body of the same function with the {{C++ Programming/kw|return}} keyword.

; Functions with results :
You might have noticed by now that some of the functions yield results. Other functions perform an action but don't {{C++ Programming/kw|return}} a value. 

Other ways to get a value from a function is to use a pointer or a reference as argument or use a global variable

;Get more that a single value from a function
The return type determines the capacity, any type will work from an array or a std::vector, a struct or a class, it is only restricted by the return type you chose.
 
;That raises some questions:
*What happens if you call a function and you don't do anything with the result (i.e. you don't assign it to a variable or use it as part of a larger expression)? 
*What happens if you use a function without a result as part of an expression, like newLine() + 7? 
*Can we write functions that yield results, or are we stuck with things like newLine and printTwice? 

The answer to the third question is &quot;yes, you can write functions that returns values,&quot;. For now I will leave it up to you to answer the other two questions by trying them out. Any time you have a question about what is legal or illegal in C++, a first step to find out is to ask the compiler. However you should be aware of two issues, that we already mentioned when introducing the compiler: First a compiler may have bugs just like any other software, so it happens that not every source code which is forbidden in C++ is properly rejected by the compiler, and vice versa. The other issue is even more dangerous: You can write programs in C++ which a C++ implementation is not required to reject, but whose behavior is not defined by the language. Needless to say, running such a program can, and occasionally will, do harmful things to the system it is running or produce corrupt output!

For example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int MyFunc(); // returns an int
SOMETYPE MyFunc(); // returns a SOMETYPE

int* MyFunc(); // returns a pointer to an int
SOMETYPE *MyFunc(); // returns a pointer to a SOMETYPE
SOMETYPE &amp;MyFunc(); // returns a reference to a SOMETYPE
&lt;/source&gt;

If you have understood the syntax of pointer declarations, the declaration of a function that returns a pointer or a reference should seem logical. The above piece of code shows how to declare a function that will return a reference or a pointer; below are outlines of what the definitions (implementations) of such functions would look like:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
SOMETYPE *MyFunc(int *p) 
{ 
  //... 

  return p; 
} 

SOMETYPE &amp;MyFunc(int &amp;r) 
{ 
  //... 

  return r; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

==== {{C++ Programming/kw|return}} ====
{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/return}}
{{:C++ Programming/Code/Statements/Functions/Returning Values/Static Return}}
==== Return &quot;codes&quot; (best practices) ====
There are 2 kinds of behaviors :

{{NOTE|The selection of, and consistent use of this practice helps to avoid simple errors. Personal taste or organizational dictates may influence the decision, but a general rule-of-thumb is that you should follow whatever choice has been made in the [[w:Code_base|code base]] you are currently working in. However, there may be valid reasons for making a different choice in any particular situation.}}

===== Positive means success =====
This is the &quot;logical&quot; way to think, and as such the one used by almost all beginners. In C++, this takes the form of a boolean true/false test, where  &quot;true&quot; (also 1 or any non-zero number) means success, and &quot;false&quot; (also 0) means failure.

The major problem of this construct is that all errors return the same value (false), so you must have some kind of externally visible error code in order to determine where the error occurred. For example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 bool bOK;
 if (my_function1())
 {
     // block of instruction 1
     if (my_function2())
     {
         // block of instruction 2
         if (my_function3())
         {
              // block of instruction 3
              // Everything worked
              error_code = NO_ERROR;
              bOK = true;
         }
         else
         {
              //error handler for function 3 errors
              error_code = FUNCTION_3_FAILED;
              bOK = false;
         }
     }
     else
     {
         //error handler for function 2 errors
         error_code = FUNCTION_2_FAILED;
         bOK = false;
     }
 }
 else
 {
     //error handler for function 1 errors
     error_code = FUNCTION_1_FAILED;
     bOK = false;
 }
 return bOK;
&lt;/source&gt;  

As you can see, the else blocks (usually error handling) of my_function1 can be really far from the test itself; this is the first problem. When your function begins to grow, it's often difficult to see the test and the error handling at the same time.

This problem can be compensated by [[w:Source_code_editor|source code editor]] features such as folding, or by testing for a function returning &quot;false&quot; instead of true.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 if (!my_function1()) // or if (my_function1() == false) 
 {
     //error handler for function 1 errors

     //...
&lt;/source&gt;

This can also make the code look more like the &quot;0 means success&quot; paradigm, but a little less readable.

The second problem of this construct is that it tends to break up logical tests (my_function2 is one level more indented, my_function3 is 2 levels indented) which causes legibility problems.

One advantage here is that you follow the [[w:Structured_programming|structured programming]] principle of a function having a single entry and a single exit.

The [[w:Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library|Microsoft Foundation Class Library]] (MFC) is an example of a standard library that uses this paradigm.

===== 0 means success =====
This means that if a function returns 0, the function has completed successfully. Any other value means that an error occurred, and the value returned may be an indication of what error occurred.

The advantage of this paradigm is that the error handling is closer to the test itself. For example the previous code becomes:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 if (0 != my_function1())
 {
     //error handler for function 1 errors
     return FUNCTION_1_FAILED;
 }
 // block of instruction 1
 if (0 != my_function2())
 {
     //error handler for function 2 errors
     return FUNCTION_2_FAILED;
 }
 // block of instruction 2
 if (0 != my_function3())
 {
     //error handler for function 3 errors
     return FUNCTION_3_FAILED;
 }
 // block of instruction 3
 // Everything worked
 return 0; // NO_ERROR
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, this code is more readable (this will not always be the case). However, this function now has multiple exit points, violating a principle of structured programming.

The [[w:C_Standard_Library|C Standard Library]] (libc) is an example of a standard library that uses this paradigm.

{{NOTE|Some people argue that using functions results in a performance penalty. In this case just use inline functions and let the compiler do the work. Small functions mean visibility, easy debugging and easy maintenance.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Michael Mann

Hello. My name is Michael Mann. I live in Williamsburg, Virginia.  I am currently a Cisco Academy Networking
Instructor at the Aviation Academy.  Thw Aviation Academy is the magnet school that is a part of Denbigh High
School.  We are located in the former airport terminal for Williamsburg/Newport Airport.

In addition to core curriculum classes such as math, english, and geography, we teach electronics, aviation
maintenance, pilot ground school, A+ computer technology and my favorite, computer networking.



Philosophy of Education

I am a constructivist.  One definition of the constructivist point of view is as follows: &quot;learners are active participants in knowledge acquisition, and engage in restructuring, manipulating, reinventing, and experimenting with knowledge to make it meaningful, organized and permanent. Learning is an internal process and influenced by the learner's personality, prior knowledge and learning goals&quot; (Davidson, 1995).
In my opinion, students only learn when they are challenged to do difficult tasks with the appropriate level of teacher
scaffolding.  My goal is to always have my students working in what Vygotsky calls the &quot;zone of proximal development&quot;.



My views on Diversity, Instructional Strategies, Classroom Environment, Technology, and Assessment.

Diversity: 

At the secondary school level (ie: students are teenagers), I do not believe that students should be grouped by sex, ability, or any other &quot;categories&quot; that may cause anxiety over and above what teenage people are already experiencing due to biological changes.  I believe this type of &quot;grouping&quot; will inhibit learning to some degree.


Instructional Strategies:

I believe in using short lecture cycles (typically &lt;= 20 minutes).  I like to break the material down to short lecture cycles followed immediately by  some type of hands-on activities to help solidify the learning experience.  Strategies and techniques I have used include: cooperative learning through &quot;think-pair-share&quot; and a modified type of &quot;jigsaw&quot; strategy.


Classroom Environment:

My classroom environment contains a lot of inspirational posters along with technical information posters to help reinforce the technical vocabulary and graphical representations that make up a &quot;computer networking grammar&quot;.  Additionally, I try to make the environment as &quot;user friendly&quot; and &quot;technically non-threatening&quot; as possible.  I rely on my ability to create a rapport with my students.  In my opinion, this is the most important thing. If you cannot create a rapport with students, you will have a very difficult time getting them to cooperate.  I believe learning is a &quot;two way street&quot; and without mutual respect (one aspect of rapport), it will be next to impossible to achieve meaningful learning for your students.  &quot;To get respect, you must give respect&quot; (Mann, 1974).


Technology:

Being a technology teacher, I use many different types of technology including: network simulator programs (a favorite of students), real network appliances (switches, routers, etc.), projection systems, and one I am dying to use but don't have yet is the smartboard. This is without a doubt, one of the best technological innovations to come along. I hope to have one
in my classroom next school year (2008-2009).


Assessment:

I believe that assessment must be reflective of the lesson that has been taught.  It is too easy to try to &quot;push them a little&quot; especially if you make your own assessments (as opposed to using pre-created ones).  If you are going to assess problem solving as it relates to content or in general, then that is what you should have already modeled.  To do other than this becomes an exercise in futility and frustration for your students.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;u&gt;'''All About ME!'''&lt;/u&gt;

Okay, big world of EDUCATION here I am!  It feels so energizing, fulfilling and rewarding to finally be writing something just about '''ME'''!  That me is me...Amy B. Williams.  I am currently a student at ODU on the road to getting her PreK-6th grade teaching licensure.  I have a Masters Degree in Social Work from Cal State Long Beach(1991)and have lovingly worked with Pediatric Aids and Oncology patients for 15 years.  To help dying little one pass over into a better and more loving place is the most wonderful thing I have been blessed with for a career.  Helping families grieve, setting up their support system and listening with loving ears was a pleasure I will never forget.  Unfortunately, I lost me along the way and I believe I have found that person...that person that always stifled the love of teaching young children to love life and learning while exploring avenues they have yet to venture down in the path of life.

In my spare time (wish you could see my wink!)I take care of my three funny and loving children. James is 12, Hayden is 9 and Stella Mae is 7.  I am determined to raise them to ask questions about life, fuel their fire for finding the answers and to love one another equally in this big complicated world of ours.  To help in this endeavor, we live on 6 acres and have a small apple orchard.  Life is busy, but somehow, my husband and I manage.  Dave is a pilot for United so half the month he lives out of his suitcase and I put another hat on until he walks back in the door to unpack!  Somewhere along the way I am blessed to be able to purge my anxieties through tending to my wildflowers, garden and two dogs, Hand and Gus.  

My home here is in Stephens City, VA, which is just outside of Winchester, VA.  It is a good place to raise a garden and your kids really.  Life is simple and allows for time to ponder.  The cure for Aids and cancer just very well might be out here in the dirt of Frederick County!  Oh how I wish that were true so some of the horriffic suffering would cease to exist.  


&lt;u&gt;'''My Education Philosophy'''&lt;/u&gt;

My education philosophy is to listen to my students and get to know who they are and where they have come from before they entered my classroom.  I will validate their fears, wipe away their tears, and let them know that by working together as a team we will get through any and all of their hurdles.  My mission is to get to know them and who they are as a person, what their interests are and what they dream about accomplishing.  I will act as their guide to seek the questions they may silently ask themselves and light their desire to find out just what the answers to those questions are.  

My students will see how important learning is to me and they will also feel the desire to learn.  My classroom will not only be a safe place to learn, but it will also be a safe place to make mistakes.  My students will have fun in my classroom and will walk away from it looking at school and life in a whole new way; a way that makes them feel eager to gain the knowledge they are allowed.  My mission is to connect their experiences in the classroom with their experiences in their own lives so their retention is deeper and longer lasting.  

To actively listen to my students is a mission of utmost importance.  I will reassure them of my support and will guide them to understand their own inner strength that awaits them through life's journeys.  By talking with the students and getting to know their interests and dreams, I will be their personal guide that leads them through their education journey for that very small year in their life. Technology will be at the forefront in my lesson planning, daily instructing and student activities.  Powerpoints, SmartBoards and computers will be present and utiilized on a daily basis for motivation and instructional strategies.

I expect not only the very best of me, but also the very best of all my students both socially and academically.  My mission is to understand the academic level and diversity my students come to me with and assure them that I will teach to their level and incorporate different styles of teaching and group them appropriately for a better outcome.  My students will respect that not one other student will be like them or learn like them and unkind words will not be spoken within my classroom walls.  Only words of optimism, kindness and support are allowed.  

It is my philosophy to make the students feel like the classroom is a safe place that feels warm, colorful and full of life.  They will feel wanted and self-motivated through various levels of engagement, parental involvement and student to teacher interactions.  I will use positive reinforcement as classroom management and make each student feel responsible for their own behavior and actions, which will build cohesiveness and acceptance.  I expect my students to do the very best that they can do as I will too.  My students will see that I love to learn and having fun while working hard is what will carry them into their next school year with a more positive outlook on school and ability to do their best.




I understand and agree with you when you stated the students in your class will be eager to learn because they will see how important learning is to you.  When I was in school the teachers that I felt was getting something from us as well as what we were getting from them, made me wanted to participate even more and try harder so they could know that they made a difference.  I thank God for those teachers if it had not been for them I may not be in the profession I am trying to enter in now and I might not be the person I have become.  Some of my teachers really impacted my life in ways that I don't believe most of them knew. However, it wasn't really for them to know...I received the knowledge, power, strength, and determination from it and they will receive the blessing.  You are truly a gentle soul, the world really needs more people like you.  [[User:Pperk002|Pperk002]] ([[User talk:Pperk002|talk]]) 05:27, 31 May 2008 (UTC)

Hey Amy!
I love your outlook on teaching children to &quot;love life and learning&quot;. It seems like you will be the type of teacher that attracts young minds like a magnet and puts enough of that energy into each them that they in turn can become the type of students others will look to for help in their classes. I agree with you that classrooms absolutely should be &quot;safe places to make mistakes&quot;, especially since I am a parent myself and have seen some not so safe situations in the past year that made me start to question why certain people ever chose the teaching profession. I would be honored to have my own children in your future classroom and hope that your aspirations for your students to give you the very best that they have will be accomplished over and over again with each year you teach.

Hi Amy!!! I have really enjoyed reading about your life and your educational philosophy.  It is really wonderful to hear someone so passionate about their life and career. I hope that the energy you are showing for this project extends into your future classroom and enriches the live of your students. I really liked that you think of the classroom as a safe place that feels warm, colorful and full of life. I agree that this will foster trust and enrich students' learning.  Also, the part where you stree active listening is something I found quite interesting.It is so true - yet so sad - that teachers and adults alike tend to look through children instead of looking at them and seeing what is beneath the surface.  It  sounds like you will be a blessing to all of the little lives that will enter your classroom - good luck!!![[User:Mbiernot1979|Mbiernot1979]] ([[User talk:Mbiernot1979|talk]]) 21:07, 1 June 2008 (UTC)


Hello Amy :) I really enjoyed reading your philosophy of teaching. The teachers that truly care about thier students are the ones that motivate and activate our love for learnig. Those teacher inspiredme to do great things. I am sure you willbe the inspiration to many young pupils. [[User:Cojames|Cojames]] ([[User talk:Cojames|talk]]) 22:15, 1 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

I wanted to say (as a native speaker) that &quot;Geschäftsmänner&quot; sounds strange and is bad German even if you say that it's colloquial. The plural of &quot;Geschäftsmann&quot; is &quot;Geschäftsleute&quot;, as it is for &quot;Feuerwehrmann&quot; (pl. &quot;Feuerwehrleute&quot;).
By the way: The word &quot;Geschäftsfrauen&quot; as plural of &quot;Geschäftsfrau&quot; is more common because of political correctness but the right plural would also be &quot;Geschäftsleute&quot; --[[Special:Contributions/84.62.232.49|84.62.232.49]] ([[User talk:84.62.232.49|talk]]) 20:43, 25 May 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Hawaiian language''' (Ka ‘ōlelo Hawai‘i) is a member of the [[w:Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] family. This family is spread throughout the Pacific and Southeast Asia and stretches from Madagascar to Rapa Nui. The languages in this family are closely related to each other. 

The language takes its name from the Hawai'i archipelago.  Hawaiian, along with English, is an official language of the State of Hawaii (United States).

For various reasons, the number of native speakers of Hawaiian gradually decreased during the period from the 1830s to the 1950s. Hawaiian was essentially displaced by English on six of the seven inhabited islands. Nevertheless, from about 1949 to the present, there has been a gradual increase in attention to, and promotion of, the language. Public Hawaiian-language immersion pre-schools called Pūnana Leo were started in 1984; other immersion schools followed soon after. The first students to start in immersion pre-school have now graduated from college and many are fluent Hawaiian speakers.

As of 2000, native speakers of Hawaiian amount to under 0.1% of the statewide population. According to the recent U.S. Census, 27,160 speak the language at home.

Hawaiian grammar is relatively simple, and complex sentences can be created from combining simple rules. There are couple pointers to note, however, that make Hawaiian distinctively different in grammar from English:

*The common word order is [[w:Verb Subject Object|Verb Subject Object]] (e.g. ''Hele au i ka hale'', Go-I-to-the-house).
*Adjectives always follow nouns (e.g. ''ke kanaka pono'', the-person-good).
*All nouns (even abstract) take an article (e.g. ''ke'' Akua, ''ka'' po'e, ''the'' God, ''the'' people)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''All About Me...'''

My Name is Amada Morton but, everybody calls me Amy. I live in Yorktown, VA with my son Brandon who just turned 12, and my daughter Valerie who graduated from Virginia Tech on May 10, 2008. She is 21 yrs old. She is planning to go to medical school for four more years.
I received my under graduate degree from Sacred Heart University, Santurce, Puerto Rico.
I currently teach Spanish to high school students. Last year I taught Spanish at the Middle school and High School. I also used to help the Elementary School.
This is the hardest time of my life, I’m working two jobs, taking care of my son and I’m taking nine credits to be able to get my license before the new school year begins. I still enjoy life… I like scrapbooking, gardening and travel.




'''My Educational Philosophy'''
         

My educational philosophy centers on the idea of the wide range of learning style, needs and abilities that students have. The teacher has to address, and try to help them through a variety of means. I believe that all students can learn if provided and environment where they can feel safe and confident. The successful teacher can meet these needs in a widely diverse classroom. It's also very important to set the learning environment and performance expectations for the students.Be always ready to help the student set goals and monitor their own learning process.

'''A Good Teacher:'''

I think a good teacher is one who inspires students by demonstrating a love/passion for his/her subject matter. Also a good teacher learns from their student and keeps an open mind concerning instructional strategies. (What works for one group may not work for other) A good teacher should be knowledgeable in their subject area as well as other areas. Should be organized and present well prepared lessons and be aware of the diversity between students and try to tap into the individuality of the students. Find works, discussion topics relevant to them. Engage the students in as many activities for different learning style as possible. Be as fair as possible and treat students with respect. Create a respectful environment for both the teacher and the student through an organized and well- disciplined environment. A good teacher should encourage students to explore the internet for help on subject. (Watch videos, read the news, listen to the radio, explore the geography of the target language. I believe that assessment should be accurate frequent, effective, and fair. Should be completed as soon as possible after an activity. Finally a good teacher should establish a positive “safe” Classroom environment so that they feel “free” to ask questions and ask for help.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Static returns ====
When a function returns a variable (or a pointer to one) that is statically located, one must keep in mind that it will be possible to overwrite its content each time a function that uses it is called. If you want to save the return value of this function, you should manually save it elsewhere. Most such static returns use '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Scope/Variables|global variables]]'''''.

Of course, when you save it elsewhere, you should make sure to actually copy the value(s) of this variable to another location. If the return value is a struct, you should make a new struct, then copy over the members of the struct.

One example of such a function is the [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library|Standard C Library]] function [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/localtime|localtime]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In one sense, college is not that complicated, but on the other hand, there are some complexities to deal with. Depending on where you go and what your chosen field of study is, attaining an undergraduate degree can be a more or less difficult.

This book is about succeeding in undergraduate education, so that will be discussed. Depending upon where you go, your experience can be vastly different. If one goes to a community college for a couple of years and then goes to a four year college for another two years to complete their degree, they will have a different experience than if one goes to a four year college for all for years, or if one decides to complete two majors in three years. Luckily, in many respects, the basics will be the same wherever you go. 

==Classes==
Often each term, one will take anywhere between 3-5 classes if one attends college full time.

==Grades, Tests, Presentations, Papers, Participation and other Fun Stuff==
Grades are given on performance. There are myriad of ways performance can be measured. Tests can be given, and these can can consist of multiple choice, fill in the blank, matching, short answers, full out essays, and probably other formats. Teachers are often creative.  

Papers are often assigned in college. These will often become more complex and rigorous as you move along in your education. 

Presentations are required for some classes.

==The yearly cycle==
Some schools go on trimesters, and some go on a semester system. Presuming one takes summers off, this means that if one takes classes from Fall to Spring, then for a semester system, one will go through two cycles of classes, and if one is on a trimester system, one will experience three cycles of classes. On a trimester system, if one takes classes all year round, then they will experience four cycles of classes - Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer. Let it also be noted that classes may count for few credits if they are on a trimester system.

==Credits==
Many institutions have certain requirements to graduate. There will be prerequisite requirements, and then there will be requirements specific to the majors and minors that you choose. 

==Professors==
Each class will be taught by a professor, or maybe a teaching assistant (TA).

Well hello Jessica, again.
Did your musical dabbling spill over into teaching or what? why do you want to me a teacher?  And by the way, you are an amazing cellist (is that the right word).  Any way your teaching philosophy, as I understand is the focus on the student right?  I agree with everything that you have said.  Especially the emotion part when it comes to music ed.  I guess we have one up on the rest... just kidding.  I did want to ask, how would you give the individual opporutinities for each student to succeed?  What types of opporutinites are we talking about here?  And one last thing, I know you at least a bit and it is driving me crazy (for some odd reason) but how would your &quot;decorate&quot; your classroom.  and oh what level do you want to teach?

== My Response by: [[User:Sbart010|Sbart010]] ([[User talk:Sbart010|talk]]) 19:02, 10 June 2008 (UTC) ==



Hello Jessica I apologize that it has taken me a while but I wanted to respond to the post that you left me. Just to refreash your memory, here is your post.

'''Hi Sarah. My name is Jessica, and I'm a music education major. You seem like the kind of teacher, I always liked in school: structured, yet fun. :-) I agree with your ideas about the classroom look and management. It is important for students to feel welcome in a classroom for the moment they walk in the door. Though I have not begun teaching, I work as a resident assistant on the ODU campus, and I love to be creative in my hall decorations. It's amazing how even college students can enjoy and appreciate a colorful and inviting hall. It does make a difference in the attitude of the students and the atmosphere of the hall. I am curious as to how you incorporate your philosophies as a substitute teacher. Since the classrooms are not permanently yours, what adjustments do you make to your teaching style? For instance dealing with classroom management, how do your rules differ as a substitute from those you would use as a permanent teacher? And have you ever incorporated your bluegrass talents and knowledge in your teaching? If so, how?''' 

Now for my answers. 

First off, I want to thank you for your kind comments. And I am not an on-campus student but i wish i could see your hall. :) I am a very artsie-crafty person so i love the idea of a creative classroom. 

AS you probably know there is only so much you can do as a substitute. But i use my experience to gather information and ideas. If I see things in a classroom that I like I make note of it. As far as actually trying to incorperate my own ideas i have one example, I have tried it many times and the results have varied. I don't like yelling and screaming much. So instead of yelling to get the class quiet i simply turn off the lights to get thier attention. Like I said, Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. But if the classroom was mine I could establish the pattern of &quot;Lights out, mouths shut&quot; from the begining. I have seen another example with a third grade class I subbed for. The teacher started it, when she wanted quiet she would clap out the first part of a rhythm then the class would finish it and get quiet. This could be an idea for you as a music teacher 

Now to your question about whether i have incorperated music into my classroom. I love the idea of have music in the regular classroom. It would provide variety and make learning more fun for the student. 

As a substitute you can't stray too far from the teacher's plans however I do have an example of putting my music to use in the classroom.  As I said my mother is a teacher, she teaches seventh grade. One of the teachers came across something called the &quot;Bill of Rights Song&quot; which is the Bill of Rights sung to the tune of &quot;The Twelve Days Of Christmas&quot; My mom came and asked me if we could make a recording of it for the students to hear and practice with so that they could sing it at an assembly for the school. She gave me the words and we put the song on a CD. I even ended up going to the school to help to teach the kids the song. It turned out great.

ILove music and I strongly believe that music should remain a part of our schools. I am glad that you will keep music in classrooms through your career choice.

God Bless,
Sarah

==Article Author Response==
Jessica,  Hi this is Stacy you reviewed my article, Educational Milestones of the 21st Century.  First off I wanted to say that I really appreciate the time and effort that you put into reading my article and making notes on areas to which I could improve I really appreciate it.  I next wanted to respond back to a comment that you had made about one of the possible answers to a multiple choice question of mine.  In my research for the article my husband and I started talking about Darpanet and how it is associated with what he does in the air force.  I put down that possible answer just as a goofy thing that I do, there are no more classrooms that use darpanet.  I did not want you to think that I was crazy or anything.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello my name is David Baer.

I am currently a Business Education Teacher for Menchville High School in the Newport News Public School system.  This is my second year teaching, and although I feel like I have learned a lot since day 1, there is still so much I do not know.  You learn something every day (especially from kids today).

I teach the following courses:
Digital Input Technologies / Computer Applications
Design, Multimedia, and Web Technologies
Advanced Computer Information Systems
Business Management: Virtual Enterprise

I am also the Cross Country Coach and Assistant Track Coach.  This is my outlet from teaching every day and it really helps me connect with a lot of the student population who are interested/participate in sports.

I graduated from Christopher Newport University with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration.  I am currently working on my Teaching License at Old Dominion University.

After almost two years of teaching I have put together my own Philosophy of Education.


My Philosophy of Education:

After nearly two years of teaching Business and Marketing education I have had the following theories about how things have changed since I was in high school only 7 years ago.

Students have a smaller attention span with more distractions, more freedom yet with more rules, more activities and less time,  and still know everything but don't have a clue what they want to do when they want to graduate high school besides go to college or get a job (I guess that worked for me!?).

My teaching philosophy as a technology teacher is to keep the students hands on with teacher led demonstrations and student led activities.  Many students have a computer at home, but many only use it for personal needs such as MySpace or iTunes.  I teach practical skills that most jobs require or will require and almost all college students will need.

Skills I teach are:

Typing: Key is efficiently
Microsoft Office: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access are core programs
More Exciting Programs: Front Page, Photoshop, Flash.
Practical Knowledge: Resumes and Interview Tips
Business Management: Marketing, Sales, Finance, Management

The biggest problem or thing that I would like to change is the Business class philosophy of students and parents alike. These are a few of the most common thoughts about the classes I teach:

1. Students think that Business classes are supposed to be easy because they are an elective and involve computers.

2. Parents (and most of my friends) didn't know Business classes were offered in high school.

The problem with these two thoughts is that when you go out into the real world where you need to get a job the skills you learn in a business class are often the most practical of any at the high school level, and it's a shame that more students don't take these classes or two take them seriously.  Finally business is one of the most common major on college campuses today.  The things you learn in class can be put to use at almost any job in the country of the American Dream.

I use a hands on approach to many activities.  I also like to assign small group (2-3 at the most) projects.  Finally, I think real world examples are a great way to engage the students especially if it relates to their world.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About Me ==
My name is Lauren and I've come back to school after eight years to earn a teaching certification. This is one of my first classes in that process. I'd like to have the credential to teach high school journalism and other English classes someday. I'm most interested in teaching in a Title I school and working with at-risk students.
I live in Norfolk with my husband, Mike, and our six-month-old son, William. We like watching Tides baseball games and traveling.

== Teaching Philosophy ==
I believe that the teaching profession needs to be made more appealing so that it can attract the best college graduates from a variety of disciplines. I think that teachers should be paid more for working in at-risk schools or in other hard-to-staff schools like those in rural areas. Those schools should also be given more resources so they can have the latest technology and resources.

I think inclusion is the correct approach for most students, especially those who are learning-disabled. However, I think it can backfire when regular-education teachers are not trained on how best to work with these students, and when those teachers are overburdened. For example, I have seen classes of 25 where eight of the students have disabilities. The teacher does not have time to address each student's needs. Similarly, when not enough teacher assistants are provided, special education students can be left behind.

As I mentioned above, I believe schools should be able to hire the best teachers, especially at the schools that need it the most. That would require a re-allocation of resources, and a change in the way teachers are evaluated. If principals are free to choose the best teachers -- and give them the incentives to stay -- they can create the best environment at their schools. These schools should also have plenty of computers, televisions, interactive whiteboards, science equipment and other technological resources.

I would like my classes to include a variety of teaching styles, with the intention of engaging all students. They would be expected to participate in class, read out loud and write cohesively. While there would be some lecturing, there would also be group work, centers, student performances, writing assignments, drawing and anything else that gets the students engaged.

I would not want the desks in my class to be arranged in rows, but in small groups, and I would expect the students to be answering questions, asking questions, giving ideas and sharing their ideas as much as I would talk. By hearing what the students are thinking, it will be easier to tell what they know. By keeping track of all of their work, there will be a constant stream of assessments to see how they are doing and see what areas need more work.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello everyone!! My name is Melissa Biernot and I live in Chesapeake, VA.  I have had the pleasure of residing here, as have most of my family, for my entire life - all 28 years. I am married to a wonderful man and together we have 4 children.  We also have 2 cats and a dog - all of whom are spoiled rotten and think that they belong in our bed - whether we have room to sleep or not!!

After completing my MS in elementary education, I hope to start a career as a teacher in the 4th-6th grades. Although I love interacting with all children, I think that this age group is extremely impressionable and quite unique in their views of the world.  I feel that I will have much to offer them, and they will surely have much to teach me.

As for my teaching philosophy, I think that simplicity is best.  I want my classroom to be one that values openness, honesty, and respect for each other.  I feel that if all of these areas are held sacred, then the classroom will be a fun, interesting, and interactive place to learn.

I feel that all students should be treated equally and expected to perform to the best of their abilities. For this reason, most of the work my students will be responsible will be lecture and solo project based material.  I feel that group work tends to highlight the ideas and creativity of a select few in the group.

It would be my hope that parents are involved in their children's education as well as in the classroom.  I would provide my email and home phone number for parents to contact me, and I would contact them at least weekly concerning the performance, behavior, and future expectations of their children. I would also stress a high level of teamwork for all of the teachers in my grade level, so that great ideas are shared and used schoolwide.

I would like for my students to be able to use all technology that they could - computers, calculators, overheads, microscopes, etc... These things enrich the lesson and keep it interesting. After the lesson, they would be assessed using standard testing methods such as fill in the blank and true/false, and also with presentations, book reports, and projects.</text>

Diversity is a major issue in todays schools, coming from a very diverse school i have seen this first hand.  Everyone is not exactly the same and different situations call for different solutions.  Group sssignments are very important as well school requires interaction between the students for a more educational exoerience.  As a teacher i would like to have interaction from all including parents.  Hopefully this interaction would allow me to be a better teacher.  Technology is also very importatn in todays schools and every student should have access to the best.  Assesment should be done not only with tests and essays but with participation and involvemnt in class.</text>

My name is Sheenita Jones Hill and I reside in Norfolk,Virginia with my husband two children. I am a returning student to Old Dominion University after being out of school for Twenty years. I plan to teach Spanish for grades K2-12.I also want to translate Spanish and I want to teach English as a second language. My long term goal is to develope a program that would introduce Spanish to all public school students as soon as they enter the public school system. 

''''''My teaching Philosophy''''''

Languages are a must, and should be a required part of the educational system begining in grade K. Doing this will definitely make the educational environment more diverse whrn dealing with other languages and cultures. I believe that each student should be introduced to other languages so that they will have a better understanding of this great big world we share. The children that I teach will not only learn another language, they will also learn geography while also learning to understand, respect, and appreciate another culture.  Again, as a Spanish major, I feel that foreign languages should be a mandatory part of the educational curriculum for all students begining in grade K.

''''''My goal''''''  

I plan to help make the public school system an environment that bridges cultural and racial gaps while introducing children to a brand new language.</text>

&lt;font color=&quot;#6666CC&quot;&gt;I AM ME!!!...My name is Jessica Metcalf, and I love the arts.  My passion is music.  Cello and voice are my main mediums of musical expression, though I do dabble with any instrument I can get my hands on.  I study music education at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA, and I love it.  The more I study music education, the more I love the idea of becoming a music teacher. 


Originally from Oklahoma, I am a small town, family girl, but I love people.  I want to see the world and explore everything the world has to offer...the good, the bad, and everything in between. With an open mind, I constantly search to unlock the secrets of myself and everything around me. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#7A1EA1&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''''~ MY PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION ~'''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#6666CC&quot;&gt;I believe every child is an individual, each with his or her own thoughts, feelings, and experiences.  It is the combination of those three elements that shapes the character of a child.  Though each incredibly unique, every child has the potential to learn anything, if given opportunity and encouragement.  Most importantly, every child '''should''' be given the opportunity to expand his or her imagination.  Creativity is vital to all things educational, especially music.  Music combines every educational subject: science, math, history, physical education, and foreign language, but most importantly music is feeling-ful.  Music education allows students of all ages to express a wide range of human feelings and emotions in a rather unique way.  Many times in the classroom, the child is forgotten amongst the books, homework, and exams.  After all, as teachers, we do not teach subjects; we teach people!!!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;</text>

== Hi Melissa! ==
I really enjoyed reading your user page.  And I completely agree with you regarding the importance of &quot;openness, honesty, and respect for each other&quot;.  One of my least favorite experiences as a student occurred in a classroom with very little respect for everyone's differences.  I also found your point about group work to be very enlightening.  I had never thought of group work that way, but I think you have an excellent point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Amy!
My name is Shannon and I loved reading about your &quot;All about me section&quot; I too have a very crazy life (BUT not nearly as crazy busy as yours)!I think its awsome that you are already teaching. I think it makes your Educational Philosophy even more touching. I totally agree that
each child is going to have his or her own needs and there can't be just one set way of running things.  Good teachers for me have also been those who truly loved what they were doing and teaching. Well Good Luck with your very busy life! [[User:Swrig020|Swrig020]] ([[User talk:Swrig020|talk]]) 11:31, 1 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

&lt;br/&gt;
Well, I changed the code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
.xforms-repeat-index {
        background-color: blue;
      }
&lt;/source&gt;
to be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
.xf-repeat-index {
        background-color: blue;
      }
&lt;/source&gt;
and then it does work as expected under FireFox XForms extension 0.7.0.1

= Benko Gambit =
Black offers the b5 pawn in return for a slight lead in development and a superior pawn structure. The main idea is that Black gets strong positional pressure against White's queenside, where he has two open files for his rooks (after ...a6), and an open diagonal for the fianchetto on g7. The pawn structure has lasting effect and often even if White enters the endgame up a pawn, he will find it hard to convert this advantage into a win. As theory has developed, however, it's become harder for Black to find lines with winning chances and with proper play white can usually weather the storm.

Questions can lead to useful content but please put them in the right context and space, I have moved your question on [[Genetics/Behavioral Genetics]] to [[Talk:Genetics]], since that is the talk space for the work, I also noticed that you didn't sign you question, you should really take a look into the content of the Welcome message above...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:21, 27 May 2008 (UTC)</text>

==Peer Review==
|-
|Well hello Connie.  My name is Joseph (roughcopy) and it is very nice to meet you.  I must say that I admire your determination, drive, and obvious management skilis.  A full time mother, wife, master's student, with two jobs!  It might be safe to say your flirting with insanity.  But seriously I truely admire what you are doing.  Don't worry, I'm not going to edit your page ;).
|-
|Your teaching philosophy seems to be quite established and I'm guessing that since your pursueing your master's degree, that you've had some other class that have help shape your beliefs.  Myself am lacking in the department of education experience and like you did not decide that teaching was right for me until... well last year.  I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.  
|-
|Why do you want the student to see you as the same person in and out of the classroom?  I mean I understand wanting the student to look up to you as a person, but shouldn't there be a destinction between you as the teacher and you as another adult or friend?  Would this affect your sense of professionalism?
|-
|How do you feel about the standardized tests.  This what you were referring to, yes?  Personally, I hate them.  Having to had taken them myself, I feel that constricted the class too much and made everything about the tests.  It created too much pressure to pass the test and hampered creativity.  Well atleast made creativity harder to find in the lessons.  I like that the test are there because it helps keep school to a certain standard. But I think there is too much weight placed upon the tests.
|-
|I agree with almost all of your philosophy and your plan.  Wonderful header idea.  In addition, I like your &quot;senses&quot; explaination.  I went about it a different way but I thought it was funny we both shared the same thought.
|-
|I have one final question for you.  Since you plan to work in a private school, are there any programs you know of that can help meet your desired technology wishes.  I did not know of any but I didn't know if you had looked into it.  I read an article on Plank Road Publishing (k-8.com) I think, about a teacher who sold ice cream or pop sticks at the end of the year.  She made a couple hundred dollars on 25 cent treats to the students.  Because it was her money she could use to improve the equipement she had.  I don't know if this would work or help in your furture situation, but I thought I would give a suggestions.
|-
|Good luck.

Hey! I love your page. It is so well organized and completely thought out. I must say, as I was reading your page, I have really thought a lot about the points that you brought up. I think you are right on about everything. It will be hard to accomplish because of all the guidelines and hoops that us future teachers will have to &quot;jump&quot; threw, but I know that you can do it.  I also want to say how much I enjoyed learning all about you and how strong you are in your faith.I don't know how you manage with all the responsibilities in your life. Way to go!

Hello.  I really like your poetic way of phrasing your philosophy of education.  I agree with your points that teachers should make a difference in a students life.  That is what I really want to do, even though it may be something small.  I am trying to become a high school math teacher.  I am not sure which grade yet.  I know in high school I had to learn the material on my own, because my teachers couldn't teach (they were brilliant, but couldn't pass on the information to the students).  What grade and subject are you planning on teaching?  I don't believe I saw that in your page, but maybe I just missed it.

Hi Connie,
Thank you for giving a thoughtful review to the article on Homeschooling. I thought your assessment was fair and constructively stated. You might want to check the multiple choice questions again, I'm not sure I agree that they all assess application of knowledge. Being able to distinguish between the two will show up on quizzes and exams and certainly, you'll be thinking about this a lot later on when you are creating quizzes and tests for your students. Keep up the conscientious work. [[User:Jenniferjkidd|Jenniferjkidd]] ([[User talk:Jenniferjkidd|talk]]) 18:24, 9 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">REST interfaces, in particular the URL language used to invoke services, has no equivalent to SOAP's WSDL. This example looks a creating a simple XML schema for defining such an interface, and using an XQuery script to create a generic interface to the site based on the interface definition.

== Example REST definition ==

Here is a somewhat partial definition of the del.icio.us interface using a home-made schema. Parameters are defined using unique local names for each parameter, and then the services supported by the interface are defined using templates with curly braces delimiting the names of parameters, to be replaced by their actual values. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;interface&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;&lt;p&gt;An almost complete description of the REST interface of the del.icio.us social
    bookmark site, excluding services requiring login&lt;/p&gt;

== Generate the interface ==

An XQuery script takes one parameter called uri, the uri of the XML interface description.  The script creates a generic interface based on this definition, regenerating the service urls when values are changed in the form and the form refreshed.

== Discussion ==

=== Architecture ===
The script uses a common layered architecture in which low level functions operate on the base data model, and these functions are in turn used by functions which generate the user interface.  Finally class and id hooks in the generated XHTML link with CSS to style the page.  Determining how many layers to use and how the layers should interface is a central design decision in XQuery application, as it is in other technologies. Several alternatives are worth considering: the script generates an intermediate XML structure which is transformed server- or client-side with XSLT; the script generates an XForm in place of the HTML form; the whole task is handled client-side with JavaScript;  client-side AJAX interfaces with a base XQuery script. Handling this design space is one of the challenges of web development.

=== Cache busting ===
For scripts running inside a proxy server,as these scripts are on the UWE server, repeated access to the same url in the doc() function will return the cached file. To break the cache, a random number is added to the URL. 

=== Global Variables ===
The script uses variable declarations to define some global variables used in the script functions. Global variables feel like a reversion to Fortran COMMON and similar horrors, except that these are all constant once defined. Nonetheless, the dependence on these variables is not explicit.  An alternative would be to explicitly pass this data down through the functions. An alternative script using this style,  passing a single node which composed the data into a single 'object', executes several times slower, is more verbose and arguably no more understandable.

=== Recursion ===
Replacement of the multiple parameters in a template is a recursive function, successively replacing each parameter throughout the template in turn.

== Other interface ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fixed buffer overflow problem in encoder C source code==
Before this source code was moved to Wikibooks, I noticed there was a buffer overflow bug in the C version of the base64 encoder that could cause memory corruption 1 byte past the stated end of the caller's result buffer.  See:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Base64#Apparent_buffer_overflow_bug_in_C_code
I have fixed this bug here.  I also made the function return &lt;code language=&quot;C&quot;&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code language=&quot;C&quot;&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;, so that the caller can tell whether the encoder was passed a buffer sufficiently large to receive the complete encoding.  The function now returns 1 if successful, or 0 if the encoding is not complete.  [[User:CosineKitty|CosineKitty]] ([[User talk:CosineKitty|talk]]) 18:45, 26 May 2008 (UTC)


==Added C++ encoder and decoder example==
Er.. yup. I added it :P [[User:Billyoneal|Billyoneal]] ([[User talk:Billyoneal|talk]]) 01:48, 7 May 2009 (UTC)


==Group by language instead of encoding and decoding?==
I noticed that in the Java decoding section that both the encoding and decoding is done here. 

Should the code be separated or should it be grouped by language instead of encode/decode? [[User:Lone wolfII|Lone wolfII]] ([[User talk:Lone wolfII|talk]]) 08:14, 19 September 2009 (UTC)</text>

==Projects==

Inventor is capable of creating complex 3D assemblies.  These assemblies are made by combining various part files that are either custom to that assembly, or that are shared across many different assemblies.  This collection of files must be organized in such a way to make it easy for the designer to use.  Inventor does this by creating what's called ''Projects''.

A Project organizes your data by creating a ''Workspace'' which is a series of directories (folders) that all the custom parts and drawings are located for a given assembly. Some Workspace directories may be stored locally on the designer's computer, while others may be stored on a server allowing others to work on them at the same time.

Oftentimes there are many part files like fasteners or bearings that tend to be reused across many assemblies.  These part files are stored in folders that are referred to as ''Libraries''.  Since Library parts are shared across many different Projects, they are not allowed to be edited.

Autodesk has been moving toward using a program called ''The Vault'' to store Inventor files.  Inventor R12 (2008) no longer allows Projects to be multi user unless all the files are stored in The Vault.  The Vault handles file management in a multi user environment better than Microsoft's NTFS file system, eliminating many issues that used to plague Inventor. 

A good starting point for projects is the [http://www.widom-assoc.com/MA401-1.pdf Autodesk Inventor Project Files Revisited] document.

== Overview ==

A '''''Cockatrice''''' is, in Muggle texts, a synonym for a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]]. Though never fully defined in the Harry Potter series, it is apparently a dangerous creature that reproduces by means of eggs.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

There are only two mentions of a Cockatrice anywhere in the series. One is when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Karkaroff]] is accusing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]] of being over-cautious, perhaps to the point of paranoia. Karkaroff says that Moody had destroyed a gift given to him because it was ticking and he had thought it might contain a Cockatrice egg; in fact it was a carriage clock.

The other is when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], in response to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s question about who the five judges for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] are, says that three of the judges must be the heads of the three schools. This was because she has found mention of the Triwizard Tournament of 1792, in which all three school heads were injured when a cockatrice the Champions were supposed to be catching went on a rampage.

Interestingly, cockatrices are not mentioned in &quot;Newt Scamander&quot;'s ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them''.

== Analysis ==

From the limited description we have, we do not know whether Basilisks and Cockatrices are the same creature, as our Muggle literature would indicate. As a Basilisk hatches from a chicken's egg (in Muggle mythology, a rooster's egg) incubated by a toad, it is possible; but no mention is made of the basilisk egg making a ticking sound. One also would have to wonder if the egg could be taken away from the toad before it hatched: would the lack of incubation prove fatal to the basilisk?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Prelude==
[[Image:Germans_at_Polish_Border_%281939-09-01%29.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Germans at the Polish border on September 1, 1939.]]
On September 1, 1939, the German army launched a massive attack on Poland. On the night before, the German Gestapo staged the Gleiwitz incident. According to Alfred Naujocks, the Gestapo (Germany's secret police) ordered he and a small group of others to dress up as Polish soldiers and seize the Gleiwitz radio station.  After seizing the station, Naujocks' group broadcast an anti-German message in Polish. A false flag operation with the intention to provide Germany the ''Casus belli'' to invade Poland.  However they needed to make the attack more convincing.  The Gestapo brought in Franciszek Honiok, a German Silesians who sympathized with Poland that had been captured the previous day.  Honiok was dressed up as a saboteur, put to death using lethal injection, and given multiple bullet wounds.  This would be used as evidence (given to the press and police) of the supposed Polish attack, as he would be presented as one of the dead attackers.

==The German Invasion==
Now with a seemingly legitimate reason for the attack, Germany was free to invade Poland. At 08:00, German troops, still without a formal declaration of war issued, attacked near the Polish town of Mokra. The battle of the border had begun. Later that day, the Germans attacked on Poland's western, southern and northern borders, while German aircraft began raids on Polish cities. The main axes of attack led eastwards from Germany proper through the western Polish border. Supporting attacks came from East Prussia in the north, and a co-operative German-Slovak tertiary attack by units (Army &quot;Bernolak&quot;) from German-allied Slovakia in the south. All three assaults converged on the Polish capital of Warsaw.

Although Italy had agreed to come to the aid of Germany if it entered war, Mussolini contacted Hitler and told him Italy simply did not have the resources for war at that time.
[[Image:Polish_infantry_marching_-2_1939.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The smaller Polish army was no match for the German forces.]]
The Allied governments of France and the British Commonwealth declared war on Germany on September 3; however, they failed to provide any meaningful support. The German-French border saw only a few minor skirmishes, although the majority of German forces, including eighty-five percent of their armoured forces, were engaged in Poland. Despite some Polish successes in minor border battles, German technical, operational and numerical superiority forced the Polish armies to retreat from the borders towards Warsaw and Lwów. The Luftwaffe gained air superiority early in the campaign. By destroying communications, the Luftwaffe increased the pace of the advance which overran Polish airstrips and early warning sites and causing logistical problems for the Poles. Many Polish Air Force units ran low on supplies, 98 of their number withdrew into then-neutral Romania. The Polish initial strength of 400 was reduced to just 54 by September 14 and air opposition virtually ceased.

Polish forces abandoned regions of Pomerania, Greater Poland and Silesia in the first week. The Polish plan for border defence was proven a dismal failure. The German advance as a whole was not slowed. On September 10, the Polish commander-in-chief, Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły, ordered a general retreat to the southeast, towards the so-called Romanian bridgehead. Meanwhile, the Germans were tightening their encirclement of the Polish forces west of the Vistula (in the Łódź area and, still farther west, around Poznań) and also penetrating deeply into eastern Poland. Warsaw, under heavy aerial bombardment since the first hours of the war, was attacked on September 9 and was put under siege on September 13. Around that time, advanced German forces also reached the city of Lwów, a major metropolis in eastern Poland.

The largest battle during this campaign, the Battle of Bzura, took place near the Bzura river west of Warsaw and lasted from September 9 to September 19. Polish armies Poznań and Pomorze, retreating from the border area of the Polish Corridor, attacked the flank of the advancing German 8th Army, but the counterattack failed after initial success. After the defeat, Poland lost its ability to take the initiative and counterattack on a large scale.

==Soviet Invasion==
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead. However, these plans were rendered obsolete nearly overnight, when the over 800,000 strong Soviet Union Red Army entered and created the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
[[Image:Polishborder17091939.jpg|thumb|250px|Soviet Soldiers invading Poland]]
Following the Soviet Invasion, all hope for Poland was lost. Polish troops were ordered not to engage the Soviets, but this did not prevent some minor battles. Meanwhile, Polish forces tried to move towards the Romanian bridgehead area, still actively resisting the German invasion. From September 17 to September 20, Polish armies Kraków and Lublin were crippled at the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski, the second largest battle of the campaign. The city of Lwów capitulated on September 22 because of Soviet intervention; the city had been attacked by the Germans over a week earlier, and in the middle of the siege, the German troops handed operations over to their Soviet allies. Despite a series of intensifying German attacks, Warsaw—defended by quickly reorganised retreating units, civilian volunteers and militia—held out until September 28.

The Modlin Fortress north of Warsaw capitulated on September 29 after an intense 16-day battle. Some isolated Polish garrisons managed to hold their positions long after being surrounded by German forces. Westerplatte enclave's tiny garrison capitulated on September 7, and the Oksywie garrison held until September 19; Hel was defended until October 2.

Despite a Polish victory at the Battle of Szack, after which the Soviets executed all the officers and NCOs they had captured, the Red Army reached the line of rivers Narew, Western Bug, Vistula and San by September 28, in many cases meeting German units advancing from the other direction. Polish defenders on the Hel peninsula on the shore of the Baltic Sea held out until October 2. The last operational unit of the Polish Army, General Franciszek Kleeberg's Samodzielna Grupa Operacyjna &quot;Polesie&quot;, surrendered after the four-day Battle of Kock near Lublin on October 6, marking the end of the campaign.

==Casualties==
Despite an overall German victory, Germany suffered heavy casualties. Over 16,000 German soldiers were killed, and over 27,000 wounded. Soviet casualties were light, suffering only 737 killed and 1,125 wounded. 

On the other side, the Polish casualties were horrendous. 66,000 soldiers were dead, 133,000 more wounded and 694,000 captured. 150,000 Polish civilians were also killed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">On the Morning of May 10, 1940, the German military advanced into the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Luxembourg fell in about 5 hours, with little resistance. 

== The Netherlands ==

Hitler had expected to conquer the Netherlands within a day. German airborne units were sent behined the lines, one group to capture airfields outside the Hague, and the other to capture key bridges in the vincity of Rotterdam. The Battle for the Hague, was an absolute failure for the Germans. the airfield were taken with heavy casualties, only to be retaken later in the day by the Dutch, forcing the Germans to flee into nearby woods. The Luftwaffe lost 125 transport planes, representing 50% of the fleets strength.

At Rotterdam, the Germans were much more successful. The Dutch soilders were taken offguard, and the bridges fell into German hands. The reason for capturing the bridges was so the advancing tanks could cross into Rotterdam when they arrived. 
[[Image:Netherlands-map1-en.gif|thumb|350px|The German Advance into the Netherlands, Day by Day]]
In the North the Germans were stopped at the Afsluitdijk, a chain of defences protecting the Afsluitdijk dike. In the center, the main Dutch defence was the Grebbline. The Germans reached in on the 10th, but it was not until the 14th that the Dutch were forced to evacuate into Fortress Holland, the last Dutch defence line. 

In the south the German achieved the most succes. They quickly advanced towards Rotterdam. On the 14th the Dutch and Germans were fighting through the streets of the city, and later the Dutch surrendered the city after hearning that the Germans were going to bomb the city. However, for unknown reasons, the German planes on the way to bomb this city never got the message, and some 900 civilians were killed.

On the evening of the 15th, the Dutch Army was still largely intact, however, their strategic situation had become hopeless. At 9:00pm, the Netherlands surrendered. However, in the Dutch province of Zeeland, the remaining Dutch and French troops, who had just arrived, would hold out until the 17th.

== Belgium ==
[[Image:Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-127-0396-13A%2C_Im_Westen%2C_deutsche_Panzer.jpg|thumb|left|German tanks advance through Belgium.]]
The Germans quickly, once again, established Air Superiority over Belgium. On the first day of battle they destroyed almost half of the planes in the Belgian Air Force. 

The main problem the Germans faced advancing into Belgium was  Fort Eben-Emael, a large fortress then generally considered the most modern in the world, controlling the junction of the Meuse and the Albert Canal. To overcome this problem, the Germans landed gliders on top of the fort filled with German assault infantry, and blew up the main gun cupolas with hollow charges. The bridges over the canal were seized by German paratroopers. Shocked by a breach in its defences just where they had seemed the strongest, the Belgian Supreme Command withdrew its divisions to the KW-line five days earlier than planned.

The arrival of French tanks, resulted in the Battle of Hannut, which up to that time, was the largest tank battle in history. However, the French were forced off the battlefield. Following this battle, Belgium was overrun, and on May 27th, surrendered to Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Phosphorus is the fifteenth element in the [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Periodic table|periodic table]].  The phosphorus nucleus therefore contains fifteen protons.

== Isotopes ==
Only phosphorus-31, &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P, is stable, so all naturally-occurring phosphorus is this isotope, which contains 16 neutrons. The &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P nucleus is NMR-active, and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P NMR is widely used in chemistry.

&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P is radioactive and emits beta particles; it is used in biological experiments.

== Electron configuration ==
The electron configuration of the neutral phosphorus atom, H, in the gas phase is

&lt;math&gt;1\mbox{s}^2 2\mbox{s}^2 2\mbox{p}^6 3\mbox{s}^2 3\mbox{p}^3 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is more concisely written as

&lt;math&gt;[\mbox{Ne}] 3\mbox{s}^2 3\mbox{p}^3 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This simplifies to 2.8.5 in GCSE-style electron shell notation.

== Allotropes ==
In its standard elemental state, phosphorus is known to exist in several infinite covalent network structures. The most important allotropes of P are:

* White phosphorus: contains discrete P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra (these also exist in liquid P)
* Black phosphorus: sheets of phosphorus atoms stacked on top of each other - each sheet is puckered
* Red phosphorus: amorphous, like glass

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Black-phosphorus-sheet-A-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;ball-and-stick model of a sheet of P atoms in black phosphorus&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Compounds ==
Phosphorus forms compounds with most elements in the periodic table. Due to its larger size, phosphorus is much worse at forming double bonds than nitrogen is, so it mostly forms single bonds. One key exception is the very strong P=O bond is phosphoric acid.

=== Phosphates ===
Salts of phosphoric acid, contain the phosphate ion, PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;.

* sodium phosphate, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
* magnesium phosphate, Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* aluminium phosphate, AlPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Phosphides ===
In compounds with very electropositive elements, as in sodium phosphide, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P, phosphorus can exist as the phosphide ion, P&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;. P&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; does not exist in solution because it is exceptionally reactive. For example, if you try to dissolve Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P in water, the following reaction occurs:

:Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) → PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + 3NaOH(aq)

In compounds with elements whose electronegativity is similar to or greater than phosphorus, such as phosphorus trifluoride, PF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, phosphorus is covalently bonded to the other element.

=== Organophosphorus compounds ===
* Phosphines: phosphorus analogues of amines
* Organophosphates: esters of phosphoric acid
* Organophosphites: esters of phosphorous acid

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Control Systems Design Page}}



==Introduction==

To illustrate the mentioned terminologies, characteristics and design criteria of an embedded control system, the example of a team of RoboCup robots is presented. 
This example covers all the aspects that come across when designing an embedded control system. 

''[[w:RoboCup|RoboCup]]'' is a competition between 200 robot soccer teams from all over the world, participating in six different leagues. Each robot soccer team consists of six autonomous robots (so no human interaction is allowed).
A robot-system requires the close integration of planning, sensing, control and modelling. The robot must also take into account the interactions between itself, its task and its environment.
More information of the RoboCup competition can be found at this link: ''[[w:RoboCup|RoboCup]]''

Each team participating in the RoboCup competition has to design a team of soccer robots. Every single soccer robot is an embedded control system and every team can therefore be seen as a system of systems. 
The aim of this application chapter is to give an overview of the design job that every team has to master. 


This example differs from other examples as aviation, etc. by:

•	The requirements are not well specified at the start of the project, but are continuously adjusted as shown in next chapter (moving target). This means the design phases are not as well specified and can change with the target.

•	There is a dominant hostile environment that is continuously changing and improving. In aviation the environment , like air traffic control or other planes (not in combat),  is an ally and cooperates with the actions of the plane.

•	There is a different design target: “try to do the best you can in the time you are given and with the human resources you have”. This means the resources can be assumed fixed. 


In general, this example can be seen as a prototype of a system of systems on every design-level. 


In general, Robotics can be divided into two domains: (in order of increasing complexity) design on system level (1 robot) or design on “system of systems” level (team of robots).
Choosing one design procedure above the other, depends on the priorities of the (team of) engineer(s). 
However, both domains have to be designed, so  by starting from &quot;system of systems&quot; level, for instance,  working downwards and optimizing the individual robots (by learning from  obtained results) is needed.

==Requirements analysis==

The RoboCup Team Wiki has one year to design a team of autonomous soccer robots.  The team organizes a brain storm session with all the members and makes up a list with the skills and/or specifications each of the field soccer robots has to posses in order to serve its purpose and follow the regulations.  These skills and specifications are challenges for the designers and written in plain language and not yet (technically) specified.


===4-C===

The “four C’s”, explained in the main chapter embdedded control systems design, are now used to execute a thorough analysis of robotics. 
The topics below reformulate these four concepts, applied to this subject.  


'''''1.computation'''''

Computation can be described  as the reaction speed on each possible input. Because computation on “system of system” level depends on that of the system level, a differentiation  is redundant. 
On both levels, the hardware is decentralised. The software is centralised on system level, but decentralised on “system of system” level. This approach results in a faster system and moreover has a smaller chance of failure.


'''''2.configuration'''''

This is the programmation of de robots. The stand-alone code, as well as the cooperation code are implemented in each robot. 


'''''3.coordination'''''

A division can be made between the functional coordination and system coordination. Functional coordination defines the tactical intelligence, such as the actions needed for an attack. System coordination on the other hand covers the junction between the different subsystems.


'''''4.communication'''''

Communication creates the links needed to make all the aspects of the coordination possible. The links between de different subsystems of a robot are necessary for the system coordination.

===Robustness===

For more general information on robustness, see [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Design_criteria|Design Criteria]].

Robustness is a very wide concept and has a lot of applications in many areas of this Robocup-example. It can be described as  the level of immunity for failure on software level (dealing with communication errors, etc.) or  hardware level (equal to collisions, etc.)  


It’s very important to make a good balance between robustness in one hand, and efficiency and performance on the other hand. 

•	The system must be robust enough to handle with moving targets. For example, always foresee a way to implement new rules into the   configuration by using an external link to upload new driver or software by wire. The possibility to switch between several management programs or play tactics is a smart thing to do.


•	Considering the hardware, client-server communication  creates a single-point-of-failure, which seriously decreases the robustness compared to peer-to-peer communication.


•	In case of peer-to-peer communication , the consideration can be made to implement a “server” on software level.  One randomly chosen robot collects all the inputs necessary for a tactical decision for the entire team and transmits it. In this case there is no direct loss in robustness and more efficiency. However, getting all field-info of the robots in an hostile environment is not evident. Therefore peer-to-peer on every level, this means  each robot determines a tactical decision (parallel with the others)  with the info he gets and transmits it, can be the better solution at first. 


•	A minimum of communication will lead to a maximum of robustness. However, a remarkable decrease in efficiency cannot be neglected.
Within the world of the Robocup (in contrast to aviation for instance), redundancy isn’t implemented most of the time because of the increasing complexity, the higher cost and so on. With such a kind of  “constraint”, you lose robustness to network failures. However, it is still possible to exploit the available resources, by minimizing the communication to the necessary minimum and creating a different kind of robustness. After all, the more autonomous a robot can function, with only the necessary part of communication, the higher the robustness.

•	Often the priority lies within performance, instead of the physical  state of the robot. Physical damage (a collision for instance) is almost inevitable and the many possible reinforcements against them will cause a complete downfall of the performance. This drawback shows that physical robustness is a must up to a certain level, because don’t forget it’s a game where your team has to perform!


These considerations cannot be framed within one C, but are more likely to be cross-sectional design criterions. It’s obvious that without a certain form of robustness, performance and efficiency can hardly be achieved.

Autonomy is , just like robustness, a design aspect that rises above all others. Because communication is still very sensitive to failure, it is of critical importance that every robot can function autonomously. A certain degree of autonomy for each robot will automatically result in robustness to failure of the team. 



===Design requirements===

Design challenges: play soccer, tactics, communication, energy management 

Design constraints: autonomy, safety, size, weight

The design challenges, combined with the design constraints (given by the organization), give shape to the design requirements. 
Although these constraints are mostly non-quantitative, a number of these design requirements are well specified. 
Namely these of the client: play football according to the RoboCup rules. 
Just as in every design environment, the rule is to keep it as simple as possible and mainly focus on the two most important design criteria.


More technical info about the design of these robots can be found in the [[/appendix/]].

==Lessons Learned==

&lt;u&gt;Do’s&lt;/u&gt;

•	Foresee an alternative scenario in case of a communication error of any kind. When a tactical decision has to be made, don’t let a robot wait until he has all possible info, but foresee a certain autonomy so the robot can still make a fast decision without all info.


•	Be aware of the trade-off you make by choosing robustness over efficiency and performance or vice versa. It’s impossible to purchase the maximum of both criteria, so chose wisely which criteria has the highest priority before you start.


•	Considering the limited design time it is advisable to focus on the team instead of putting all the effort on one robot. Therefore, use the method described in “high level design” and use standard components without adjusting and reprogramming them more than necessary. That way, more valuable time and effort  can be spend on the teamplay-aspect. Via experiences on the field, adjustments can be made on system level.


•	Foresee a way to implement new rules into the  configuration by using an external link to upload new driver or software by wire. The possibility to switch between several  management programs or play tactics is a smart thing to do.  


&lt;u&gt;
Dont’s&lt;/u&gt;

•	Communication via  Client-Server configuration, this creates a single-point-of-failure (as explained earlier).


•	Trying to implement that a robot can detect whether another robot deals with a serious failure.  This is very hard to do via communication: which signal must be sent and what if its communication system fails? It is only by continuous interpretation of the movement of the other robots or reverse processing that some sort of failure detection is possible.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Dietary fats serve a variety of function in the body. One of the most important function is as a metabolic fuel, per gram, fats yield twice as much energy as carbohydrate. All steroid hormones are derived initially from lipid, and these in turn are responsible for the regulation of body functions such as growth, development and the appearance of sexual characteristics as a result of sex hormones. Essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid are prostaglandin and ecosanoid precursors.


==Lipid Droplets (LDs)==

The LDs takes part of a hydrophobic phase in the cytosol and are composed of an organic phase of neutral lipids.  This hydrophobic core stores metabolic energy and membrane components making them the central region for lipid metabolism. They also take part in protein storage, degradation, and viral replication.
The formal definition for Lipid Droplets is &quot;the cytoplasmic organelle composed of a hydrophobic core of neutral lipids bounded by a phospholipid monolayer and specific proteins&quot; [1]

===How were they Discovered===

These droplets were found in the nineteenth century by the method of light microscopy of cellular organelles. Lipid Droplets were often called liposomes until the in vitro vesicles were generated in 1960's and this new vesicles were named liposomes. Since this moment the Lipid Droplets were referred as lipid bodies, fat bodies, spherosomes, or simply LDs. 
LDs were mainly ignored on research until a protein that specifically localized to LD surface was identified in 1991 [1]

===Where are they found?===

LDs are found in most cells. LDs can be found among bacterias and eukaryote, although their number and size vary greatly in different cell types. 

===What is their functions?===

The LDs provide building blocks for membranes for energy metabolism. LDs have the ability to package hydrophobic lipids, such as TGs, without water, providing a very efficient form of energy storage. It has also been found that there are links between lipid synthesis pathways and LDs. 
LDs also serve as organizing center for specific lipids and have been linked to protein storage with the possibility of also storing unfolded membrane proteins.
LDs have also been found to be involved in the hepatitis C virus assembly.

== Very Low Density Lipoprotein (vLDL)==

== Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL)==
Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is known as bad cholesterol. When the level of LDL is high in the blood, it could slowly build up inside the arteries that pump the blood to the brain and the heart. LDL and other substances can cause atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease that happened when the arteries became less flexible and narrow due to the plaque that LDL and other substances form.

==High Density Lipoprotein (HDL)==
Cholesterol can not dissolved in the blood there for it has to be transported in and out of the cells by carrier called lipoprotein. There are two type of lipoprotein: low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) and high-density lipoprotein HDL. 
high density lipoproteins (HDL) are known as good cholesterol because high level of HDL could prevent from heat attacks. Some scientists believe that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) slow the build up of plaque in which it removes cholesterol from arteries.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
char *ctime( const time_t *time );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The ctime() function converts the calendar time ''time'' to local time of the format:

 day month date hours:minutes:seconds year            

using ctime() is equivalent to

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Africa==
Prior to World War II, all of Africa exluding Liberia was under European control. Within just a few decades every country on the continent would be independent.
===France===
The French colonial empire began to fall apart during the Second World War, when various parts of their empire were occupied by foreign powers.
====French West Africa====
In 1958 the French Community replaced the French Union. When the Community was established, French leader de Gaulle specified that any country within it would eventually have the option of moving to complete independence. Apart from Guinea, which chose by referendum in 1958 not to join, all French-ruled territories in sub-Saharan Africa joined the new Community. They all obtained independence in 1960.
====Algeria====
In 1954, the National Liberation Front (NLF) launched the Algerian War of Independence which was a guerrilla campaign. This situation was a huge problem with France, because there were a large amount of French settelers in Algeria. By the end of the war, newly elected President Charles de Gaulle, understanding that the age of empire was ending, held a plebiscite, offering Algerians three options. This resulted in a landslide vote for complete independence from the DuVal Mortorian Colonial Dynasty. Over one million people, 10% of the population, then fled the country for Italy in just a few months in mid-1962. These included most of the 1,025,000 Pieds-Noirs, as well as 81,000 Harkis (pro-French Algerians serving in the French Army). The war was costly for both sides, 141,000 Algerians and 28,000 French were dead.
[[Image:Colonization 1945.png|thumb|250px|Colonializim in 1945]]
====French Morocco====
France's exile of Sultan Mohammed V in 1953 to Madagascar and his replacement by the unpopular Mohammed Ben Aarafa, whose reign was perceived as illegitimate, sparked active opposition to the French protectorate all over the country. The most notable occurred in Oujda where Moroccans attacked French and other European residents in the streets. Operations by the newly created &quot;Jaish al-tahrir&quot; (Liberation Army), were launched on October 1, 1955. Jaish al-tahrir was created by &quot;Comité de Libération du Maghreb Arabe&quot; (Arab Maghreb Liberation Committee) in Cairo, Egypt to constitute a resistance movement against occupation. Its goal was the return of King Mohammed V and the liberation of Algeria and Tunisia as well. France allowed Mohammed V to return in 1955, and the negotiations that led to Moroccan independence began the following year.
====Madagascar====
In 1947, with French prestige at low ebb, a nationalist uprising was suppressed after several months of bitter fighting with 90,000 people killed. The French later established reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully towards independence. The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on October 14, 1958, as an autonomous state within the French Community. A period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on June 26, 1960.

====Nigeria====
====Northern Rhodesia====
====Cameroons====
====Kenya====
====Tanzania====
====Uganda====
====Zimbabwe====
====British Somaliland====
====Ghana====
====Bechuanaland====
====Lesotho====
====Swaziland====

===Italy===
====Libya====
After British occupation during World War Two, Libya was divided into French and British sections. Under the terms of the 1947 peace treaty with the Allies, Italy relinquished all claims to Libya. On November 21, 1949, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution stating that Libya should become independent before January 1, 1952. On December 24, 1951, Libya declared its independence as the United Kingdom of Libya, a constitutional and hereditary monarchy under King Idris.
====Eritrea====
After WWII, the United Nations conducted a lengthy inquiry regarding the status of Eritrea, with the superpowers each vying for a stake in the state's future. Britain, the last administrator at the time, put forth the suggestion to partition Eritrea between Sudan and Ethiopia, separating Christians and Muslims. The idea was instantly rejected by Eritrean political parties as well as the UN. A UN plebiscite voted 46 to 10 to have Eritrea be federated with Ethiopia which was later stipulated on December 2, 1950 in resolution 390 (V). Eritrea would have its own parliament and administration and would be represented in what had been the Ethiopian parliament and would become the federal parliament. In 1961 the 30-year Eritrean Struggle for Independence began, following the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I's dissolution of the federation and shutting down of Eritrea's parliament. The Emperor declared Eritrea the fourteenth province of Ethiopia in 1962.
====Italian East Africa====
In 1941, Italian Somalia was occupied by British and South African troops as part of the East African Campaign of World war II. The British continued to administer the area until November 1949, when Italian Somalia was made a Trust Territory by the United Nations under Italian administration. On July 1, 1960, Somalia was granted independence. The former Italian colony immediately united with the neighboring State of Somaliland, which had become independent on June 26, to form the Republic of Somalia.

===Belgium===
====The Congo====
In May 1960, the MNC party or Mouvement National Congolais, led by Patrice Lumumba, won the parliamentary elections, and Lumumba was appointed Prime Minister. Joseph Kasavubu, of the ABAKO (Alliance des Bakongo) party, was elected President by the parliament. Other parties that emerged include the Parti Solidaire Africain (or PSA, led by Antoine Gizenga) and the Parti National du Peuple (or PNP led by Albert Delvaux and Laurent Mbariko). (Congo 1960,dossiers du CRISP,Belgium) The Belgian Congo achieved independence on June 30, 1960 under the name &quot;Republic of Congo&quot; or &quot;Republic of the Congo&quot;.
====Ruanda-Urundi====
Independence for Ruanda-Urundi came largely as a result of actions elsewhere. In the 1950s an independence movement arose in the Belgian Congo, and the Belgians became convinced they could no longer control the territory. In 1960, Ruanda-Urundi's larger neighbor gained its independence. After two more years of hurried preparations the colony became independent on July 1, 1962, broken up along traditional lines as the independent nations of Rwanda and Burundi. It took two more years before the government of the two became wholly separate.

===Portugal===
====Angola====
Leftist military officers overthrew the Caetano government in Portugal in the Carnation Revolution on April 25, 1974. The transitional government opened negotiations with the three main independentist guerrilla groups: MPLA, FNLA, and UNITA, concluding separate peace agreements with each organization. With Portugal out of the picture, the nationalist movements turned on each other, fighting for control of Luanda and international recognition. Holden Roberto, Agostinho Neto, and Jonas Savimbi met in Bukavu, Zaire in July and agreed to negotiate with the Portuguese as one political entity. They met again in Mombasa, Kenya on January 5, 1975 and agreed to stop fighting each other, further outlining constitutional negotiations with the Portuguese. They met for a third time in Alvor, Portugal from January 10-15. Roberto, Neto, Savimbi, and the Portuguese government signed the Alvor Agreement on January 15, and on November 11, Angola became independent.
====Mozambique====
The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO), initiated a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule in September 1964. This conflict, along with the two others already initiated in the other Portuguese colonies of Angola and Guinea-Bissau, became part of the so-called Portuguese Colonial War (1961-1974). After 10 years of sporadic warfare and Portugal's return to democracy through a leftist military coup in Lisbon (the Carnation Revolution of April 1974), FRELIMO took control of the territory. Within a year, almost all Portuguese population had left – some expelled by the government of the newly-independent territory, some fleeing in fear –, and Mozambique became independent from Portugal on June 25, 1975.
====Guinea-Bissau====
By 1973, the PAIGC(a group fighting for independence) was in control of most of the country. Independence was unilaterally declared on September 24, 1973, and was recognized by a 93-7 UN General Assembly vote in November 1973. Recognition became universal following the 1974 socialist-inspired military coup in Portugal.

===Spain===
====Spanish Morocco====
In 1956, when French Morocco became independent, Spain discontinued the Protectorate and surrendered most of its occupied territories to the newly independent Morocco but retained control of certain regions, including: Ceuta, Melilla and the rest of plazas de soberanía, Sidi Ifni, Tarfaya and the Spanish Sahara (Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro regions). The Moroccan Army of Liberation waged a war against Spanish forces, that started from Ifni and spread south to Rio de Oro. As a result of this war, Spain in 1958 returned Tarfaya to Morocco. Morocco continued to lay claim over the remaining regions, and in 1969, it obtained the region of Ifni.

====Equatorial Guinea====
Independence was declared and granted on October 12, 1968.

==Asia==
===The Netherlands===
====Indonesia====
Two days after the Japanese surrender in August 1945, Sukarno and fellow nationalist leader Hatta declared Indonesian independence. At first the Dutch were supported by the British, but they quickly withdrew from the war. A four and a half-year struggle followed as the Dutch tried to re-establish their colony. Dutch forces eventually re-occupied most of the colonial territory through two &quot;Police Actions&quot;, and a guerrilla struggle ensued. The majority of Indonesians, and ultimately international opinion, favored independence, and on December 27 1949, the Netherlands formally recognized Indonesian sovereignty. Under the terms of the 1949 agreement, Western New Guinea remained under the auspices of Netherlands New Guinea.

====New Guinea====
Indonesia attempted to invade New Guinea on December 18, 1961. Following some skirmishes between Indonesian and Dutch forces an agreement was reached and the territory was placed under United Nations administration in October 1962. It was subsequently transferred to Indonesia in May 1963. The territory was formally annexed by Indonesia in 1969.
===United Kingdom===
===France===
===Portugal===
====East Timor====
The process of decolonization in Portuguese Timor began in 1974, following the change of government in Portugal in the wake of the Carnation Revolution. Owing to political instability and more pressing concerns over the decolonisation of Angola and Mozambique, Portugal effectively abandoned East Timor and it unilaterally declared itself independent on November 28, 1975. Nine days later, it was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces before the declaration could be internationally recognized.

Following a UN-sponsored agreement between Indonesia, Portugal and the United States and a surprise decision by the Indonesian President B. J. Habibie, a UN-supervised popular referendum was held on August 30, 1999 to choose between Special Autonomy within Indonesia and independence. 78.5% of voters chose independence, but violent clashes, instigated primarily by elements within the Indonesian military and aided by Timorese pro-Indonesia militias led by Eurico Guterres, broke out soon afterwards.

Portugal recognized their independence on May 20, 2002.

====Macau====
On May 20, 1986, the People's Republic of China, along with Portugal, officially announced that talks on Macanese affairs would begin on June 30 in Beijing. The Portuguese delegation arrived in Beijing in June, and was welcomed by the Chinese delegation led by Zhou Nan. In the welcoming speech, it was stated that, the &quot;Negotiation between China and Portugal on Macau affairs is going to be a talk between two partners, not two opponents.&quot; Negotiations between China and Portugal on Macau officially began.

Twelve years later the transfer was complete, on December 20, 1999.

==South America==
===United Kingdom===
====Guyana====
Guyana achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1966 and became a republic on February 23, 1970, remaining a member of the Commonwealth. The United States State Department and the CIA, along with the British government, played a strong role in influencing who would politically control Guyana during this time.
===The Netherlands===
====Suriname====
In 1954, the Dutch placed Suriname under a system of limited self-government, with the Netherlands retaining control of defense and foreign affairs. In 1973, the local government, led by the NPK (a largely Creole, meaning ethnically African or mixed African-European, party) started negotiations with the Dutch government leading towards full independence, which was granted on November 25, 1975. The severance package was very substantial, and a large part of Suriname's economy for the first decade following independence was fueled by foreign aid provided by the Dutch government.

It is important to note that one or a group of people cannot gain freedom or independence by simply requesting or waiting for it. Independence comes by demanding it, through struggle, revolution. No severance package was given it was demanded by the majority Afro population due to their knowledge of the wealth the Dutch Government had gained through colonization in Suriname.

Hi! My name is Shannon Albert. I live in Fredericksburg Virginia with my husband. I am a lead teacher at Children of America I work with the school age children before and after school. I do not have any children of my own unless you count my dogs. I have always wanted to be a teacher; I have just been taking the roundabout way to become one. I received my Associates Degree from John Tyler Community College in Richmond Virginia, and then I went on to earn my Bachelors Degree majoring in Psychology from Virginia Commonwealth University. Now here I am at ODU’s Distance learning to try and complete my Masters. 

'''Education Philosophy:'''

My teaching philosophy is ever changing.As a high school student I started out really having trouble with school, but shortly after I switched schools I realized why I had such a hard time. It all revolved around my classroom environment. The first school I went to had an extremely high student-teacher ratio so there was not much interaction between the two. The first school required as little parental involvement as possible in fact they seemed to discourage parental involvement. When I changed schools I began to realize that I loved learning because the teachers there were so helpful and encouraging and simply loved to teach. The second school also required weekly letters sent home about how each child was doing in the classrooms which let me parents know exactly where I was in the class.

I think this experience has taught me so much about my own educational philosophy because I now believe that children need a more one on one experience with all of their teachers. A teacher is not there to stand at the front of a classroom reading out of a book, they should be right there next to the child if there are any questions or concerns. So I know (and already practice) helping kids individually with any work we have done I try to not just stand around but go to each child and talk with them make sure they understand what we are trying to do.

I enjoyed reading about this author. I think it is very interesting how different people come to want to be teachers. The educational philosophy of this author is very interesting.  I  like how she describes her changing educational philosophy.

Hi Shannon. My name is Jennifer. I am also taking ODU through a distance learning site here in Richmond. It's definitely different, but I am loving the experience so far. I have to say I completely agree with what you have said about the teacher and child interaction policy. I believe every school should focus on that. Having high ratios in classroom is not effective, in my opinion. If a child does not feel the interaction between the teacher and themselves, it is possible that the child may not try to succeed in that particular class, having feelings such as the teacher not caring. Like yourself, I had great interaction with my teachers growing up. I was always called the &quot;teachers pet&quot;, but I don't see it. I was just doing what I felt was right, communicating with my teacher in a respectful, educational manner, making sure that I took full advantage of the learning environment. If every child did that, imagine all of the learning that could go on in school. Good luck with your journey :)

Hi, Shannon! I'm Shelby and I took the same route you are in. I live in Richmond but right now are commuting down to ODU until I can find housing and a part-time job substituting. I got my Associates from John Tyler and graduated in 2007 from CNU with my BS in Psychology. I use to work in daycare settings until I switched to substitute teaching. I highly agree with you on the teacher/student interaction. I also agree that parents should be involved in their child's school. If you have a great interaction with your students you will be able to help them should some type of crisis or problem occur. You can get to know the students moods which can help you determine if something is wrong. I had teachers who left that mark, that when you look back, you realize they touched your life and helped to plant the seed of the hunger for knowledge. I even had a high school teacher who got to know me through interactions and could tell when something was wrong. It was then she was able to try and get me to talk which made me feel like someone cared when I was going through a family crisis. Good luck on the journey to becoming a great teacher.  :-)[[User:Sblai007|Sblai007]] ([[User talk:Sblai007|talk]]) 07:57, 12 September 2008 (UTC)


Hi Shannon. You touched base on teacher, parent involvement and I agree that Teacher-student-parent interaction is imperative! When this is absent and students see the lack of communication between their teachers and parents it is no wonder that they fail to recognize and grasp the importance of education and the importance that lies in being involved with the learning process.

Like you, I also agree &quot;a teacher is not there to stand at the front of the classroom reading out of a book...&quot; Again, student and teacher interaction is so very important. Teachers need to aquire an individual standing with each and every student so that both parties understand where he or she, the student, is at with the learning material. Good teacher-student-parent relationships play an significant role in the success of the student.[[User:Malwa002|Malwa002]] ([[User talk:Malwa002|talk]]) 04:01, 15 September 2008 (UTC)

'''The Integration of Computers in the Early Childhood Classroom'''
	

Early childhood is a time of significant discovery and development in all realms of life.  Beginning with their cognitive worlds, and stretching as far as their physical and emotional worlds, children are growing and advancing at an exponential rate.  At this age, children begin to increase their communication skills and acquire language rapidly.  All of this emergent knowledge is gained through their senses during the exploration of their environment.  This is readily evident as “children … are gaining control of their bodies and making things happen in a fascinating world of possibilities” (Haugland, 1999).  The design of their learning environments greatly impacts their education.  Although development occurs at a different pace for each individual child, the sooner they are exposed to a stimulating learning environment and given the necessary tools to learn, the more successful they will become. 

Early Childhood Programs serve as facilitating environments for early learning through many avenues.  In addition to the introduction and development of literacy and numeracy skills and a strong emphasis on the molding and honing of fine and gross motor skills, interaction and socialization are also key components to a successful Early Childhood Program.  With so much going on in the Early Childhood Classroom, it makes one wonder where computers and computer games fit into this mix. 
 
Over the past few decades we have seen an immense shift in the use of technology, computers in particular.  Computers and computer games are ever evolving and simultaneously changing the world we live in.  In our current fast-paced culture, computers have inevitably crossed the threshold of business and entered even the classrooms of the youngest children. Our educational landscape has thus become a digital one and children are exposed to computers at an earlier age than ever before. With this tremendous shift, how can computers and computer games be effectively integrated into the classroom?  What can educators do to ensure that computers and computer games exert a positive impact and influence on the acquisition of fundamental skills in early education?  Which games are best designed to assist children in their learning?  Or, on the flipside, should computers be avoided altogether?

Some researchers have argued against the use of computers and computer games for young children claiming that “computers simply do not match their learning style” since children “learn through their bodies: their eyes, ears, mouths, hands, and legs” (Haugland, 1999).  Although, there is truth in this statement, it is important “to realize that using computers with young children is a process of exploration and discovery” (Haugland, 1999).  Computers should not be relied upon as the sole means of learning for children; they are not meant to replace experiential and hands-on learning.  It is crucial for parents and educators alike to implement a balanced use of computers in the lives of young children.  Computers and computer games should therefore be used in combination with traditional learning and exploration of the child’s natural and surrounding environment, and they should equally enhance and support their early learning.  

In a 1992 study, Haugland uncovered that “three and four-year-old children who use computers with supporting activities that reinforce the major objectives of the programs have significantly greater developmental gains when compared to children without computer experiences in similar classrooms – gains in intelligence…non-verbal skills, structural knowledge, long-term memory, manual dexterity, verbal skills, problem solving, abstraction, and conceptual skills” (Haugland, 1999).  

Despite the opinions of the critics, “there is an increasing consensus that computer games should be taken seriously as both learning and assessment tools” (Puttnam, 2006).  Children thrive when they are actively engaged in fun and meaningful activities. 
This is why play occupies a central role in the early learning environment. “Creative play supports the foundation of later lateral thinking and a creative approach to scientific and cultural concepts” (Long-Breipoh, 2004).  Learning through play occurs with exposure to activities in the real and natural world.  This in turn promotes intellectual development and early mathematical skills. 
 
Similarly, when children play computer games they are provided with genuine experiences for learning.  Computers possess the power to “encourage debate, adaptation, analysis, and celebration.  Their increasing presence in homes, classrooms, and public cultural institutions is testament to how they have become enmeshed in the fabric of the nation’s cultural identity” (Heppell, 2006).  Most early childhood educators would agree that “children three and four years of age are developmentally ready to explore computers and they see the computer center as a valuable activity center for learning” (Haugland, 1999).  

According to Papert, “it is not easy to implement a totally new tool for learning.  For computers to be used successfully, teachers must be open to learning” (Papert as cited by Haugland, 1999).  What then, is the teacher’s role in the implementation and introduction of computers and computer games in early childhood?  Teachers play an integral role in provoking interest and increasing student’s computer-based knowledge.  This may be new ground for some educators who feel as though they are being forced to rethink or alter their longstanding pedagogies.  Nonetheless, teachers are required to reinforce the constructive use of computers and computer games in the early childhood setting.  Educators should model and instruct the appropriate use of computers and games, they should monitor a child’s progress, and finally, they should assist students in extracting the most from each game to ensure that there has been a gain in their knowledge and skill.  Computer games should not substitute the ability to think critically.  It is vital to teach our students critical thinking skills and use the computer for what it essentially is, a tool. 

That being said, computer games serve a multitude of purposes in early learning, and are effective in the sense that they are able to “cut across traditional subject boundaries as a practical and useful tool” (Davis &amp; Shade, 1994).  Computer games should not serve as a stand-in for traditional learning or experiences in the real world.  Computer games in the early childhood classroom need to extend across and integrate various skills such as language, mathematics, and science.  “Only when computers are integrated into the curriculum as a vital element for instruction and are applied to real problems for a real purpose, will children gain the most valuable computer skill – the ability to use computers as natural tools for learning” (Davis &amp; Shade, 1994).  

“Our students will learn from video games” (Shaffer, Squire, Halverson, &amp;Gee, 2004).  In order for computer games to be effective, they need to be interactive and engaging.  They should be “personally meaningful, experiential, age-appropriate, social, and epistemological all at the same time” (Shaffer et al 2004)
Many early childhood computer games use popular-culture icons to prompt interest in their games.  This is useful for children, as they are able to connect to the characters and learn through the narrative of the game being played.  Computer games for early learners should take into account the variety of learning styles and preferences that exist.  Additionally, they should make the players feel like “active agents” (Gee, 2005).  Being an active agent means that the child would have control in their learning and in the outcome of events in the games being played.  

Computer games are most valuable when they allow children to practice and apply the principles they have already learned in a new and meaningful context.  This is readily evident as “they require engagement with complex decisions – exploring the effects of different choices and a multiplicity of variables” (Heppell, 2006).  
 
It is essential that the games being used in the early childhood setting are developmentally appropriate.  (Bredekamp &amp; Copple, 1997).  Computer games such as Reader Rabbit and A to Zap rely on the user’s literacy skills to advance from one level to the next, while mathematical programs like Monster Numbers take the user on a numerical journey across themes and concepts covered in the curriculum.  Computer games possess the potential to attract even the most reluctant learner since they allow students to take risks while having fun and playing.  “Computer games also offer safe situations in which to explore solutions to unique problems” (Heppell, 2006).  The feedback and results while playing these games are instant and provide the child with a certain amount of control.  Children thrive at games when they can master a challenge by problem solving and then advance to progressively harder skills while having fun.  This creates profoundly useful methods and strategies for the internalization of fundamental skills; “video games….create new social and cultural worlds; worlds that help people learn by integrating thinking, social interaction, and technology, all in service of doing things they care about”  (Shaffer, Squire, Halverson, Gee, 2004). 
 
In summary, education is being transformed.  Computers have revolutionized the way that adults and children learn.  “Education and games are literally starting to speak the same language” (Heppell, 2006).  Computers have made their way into the early childhood classroom and are here to stay.  As such, it is vital that children are playing developmentally appropriate games and that these games are being used to support and enhance their regular development.  Computer games present more powerful ways to learn in the information and technology age, hence “the next challenge for game and school designers alike is to understand how to shape learning in terms of games, and how to integrate games and game-based learning environments into the predominant arena for learning: school” (Shaffer, Squire, Halverson, Gee, 2004).  Ultimately, computer games in early childhood serve the purpose of offering a fun new way to learn.  It is the responsibility of the educator in the early childhood classroom to ensure that computer games are being used as tools to contextualize and augment fundamental skills and to supplement and initiate new ways of thinking.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bonjour, everyone!  Here's the dish on me...

I am 24 years old and was born in Florida but raised in the mountains of North Carolina.  I have a degree in Accounting with a minor in French and am currently pursuing a Master's in Secondary Education, to teach math and french.  I will be coaching basketball and possibly volleyball at the high school level.  I like to read, sing, and spend time with friends and family when I can.  

I have worked with all ages of kids (and pupils) so I have begun to realize what kind of teacher I want to be.  My philosophy of education is a simple and straightforward one, one of effort and creativity, although I haven't always been the most creative person.  The following teaching philosophy comes with the disclaimer that I have worked in the teaching field for several years but am fairly early on the formal learning track so my philosophy is probably a little raw.

I want to teach using creative methods, ones that encourage analytical thinking and relevant learning.  I am learning to recognize when streamlined students need to be taught in a different way and I will be willing to help.  However, for all students, I strongly believe in them giving a big effort in the learning process.  I am strict and expect students to, with effective teaching, be active learners.  Simply put: I will be creative and make lessons relevant and give help when necessary but I expect students to pay attention and sincerely try.     

Here's to shaping the future and changing lives!  Have a terrific day!  :-)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The ''plot'' command plots 2D data linearly to the current axis on the current figure.

==Usage==
Here's how a plot can be created.
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
  &gt;&gt; h = figure;                                   % Create new figure and save the handle to h
  &gt;&gt; x = [0:0.001:10];                         % Create x vector
  &gt;&gt; y = sin(x);
  &gt;&gt; plot(x, y)                                      % Plot
  &gt;&gt; title('Sine wave from 0 to 10')        % Set the title of the current axis
  &gt;&gt; ylabel('sin(x)')                              % Set the label for the y-axis
  &gt;&gt; xlabel('x') %set the label for the x-axis
% xlabel('alpha') - - &gt; alpha
% xalbel('\alpha') - -&gt; symbolic alpha
  &gt;&gt; grid on                                         % Turn on the grid
&lt;/source&gt;
Graphs can also be created and saved using the command line interface. For example, the following code will create a graph comparing the [[w:en:speedup|speedup]] of two algorithms. The graph created is shown below.
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
  &gt;&gt; x = [1 2 4 8];
  &gt;&gt; y = [1 2 1.95 3.79];
  &gt;&gt; z = [1 1.73 2.02 3.84]; 
  &gt;&gt; h = plot(x,y,'--');
  &gt;&gt; hold on; % Plot next graph on same figure
  &gt;&gt; plot(x,z);
  &gt;&gt; hold off;
  &gt;&gt; xlabel('Number of processors');
  &gt;&gt; ylabel('Speedup');
  &gt;&gt; saveas(h,'graph.eps',eps);
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a step-by-step guide for backing up and restoring the operating system(s) installed on your PC (Linux, Windows, etc).  Specifically, it describes how to back up and restore hard drive partitions and MBR boot code using free tools and discusses backup and restoration procedures and scenarios.  Backup and restoration take about 10 minutes each.

==Frequently Asked Questions==

===Why Is This Useful?===

Uses and benefits include:

* After a system upgrade or other 'surgery' gone wrong, you can roll the system back to its exact previous state.
* If after a time your system performance degrades, you can roll the system back to its 'fresh install' state without having to reinstall.
* If you are busy working on your computer and your system develops problems, instead of taking the time to research and fix them, you can restore your system in minutes and get back to work.
* If you aren't sure if a new problem is hardware or software related, you can roll the system software back to when you know it worked.  If the problem remains, it is a good indication of a hardware problem.
* Your system is infected with a virus.  Restoring from backup is a quick and thorough fix, equivalent to formatting your entire hard drive and tediously reinstalling everything from scratch (in 10 minutes).
* You maintain a system in a public place.  Instead of being worried that someone may 'mess up' the system, you know you can restore it in minutes.
* Store your backup on a CD/DVD, external drive, or on a network share, and in the event of a hard drive failure, you can purchase a new hard drive and simply restore the partitions from backups.
* During install of an OS, you can make backups at several stages.  For example, you may make a backup before installing a video driver.  If you have problems with the driver, instead of trying to cleanly remove it and try again, you can roll the system back, confident that it is 'clean' for the next driver test.
* Having an MBR backup means that MBR damage or overwrite can be easily corrected.
* You can test a new version of your OS.  If it doesn't perform to your expectations, you can have your old system back in minutes.
* Your backup tools do not rely on any commercial products or any operating system installed on your computer.

In short, this is a relatively easy procedure well worth taking the time to learn!  Mastering this technique takes most of the fear out of system changes - you know how to press the 'rewind' button on everything you do, and the rewind button works reliably and quickly.


===What Operating Systems Can Be Backed Up?===

What OS(es) you're running doesn't matter.  The only limitations are the filesystems being used and the amount of data involved.  Most Linux and Windows systems are supported for backup.  While some of the tools in this guide are available for use on Macs, this guide does not cover Mac backups specifically.

This guide supports the following filesystems (at least): ext2/3/4, reiserfs, reiser4, btrfs, xfs, jfs, vfat, fat16/32, ntfs, iso9660.  Note that encrypted partitions cannot be backed up using the methods in this guide.

The second issue is the amount of data on the hard drive partition to be backed up.  While there is no general limit on the size of the partition involved, it is most practical to back up a system which has separate partitions for the operating system(s) and the user data.  This keeps the size of the backup practical.  This means that if your hard drive has a single, huge partition containing the OS as well as the user data (movies, music files, documents, etc), then it will be difficult to back up this system due to the size of the backup, and in some cases the lack of a place to store the backup (which cannot be stored on the partition being backed up).  In this case, consider repartitioning your hard drive so that your OS with installed software is stored on its own partition, separate from your user data files.  (Repartitioning your hard drive is outside the scope of this guide and is not described here.)

===Who Can Use This Guide?===

This guide is primarily intended for Linux users who maintain multi-OS systems.  Some basic knowledge of how Linux refers to and mounts partitions, and the ability to enter a few console commands carefully will be helpful, because this guide uses several Linux tools to accomplish the tasks.  The ability to burn a CD from an ISO image will also be required.  If you don't already have this knowledge, a little extra homework may be required to use this guide successfully.

==The Tools For The Job==

This guide will use the following tools:

* [http://www.sysresccd.org/ SystemRescueCD] - a free, slim, live Linux CD which includes the Partimage and FSArchiver programs, and other useful system tools.  This is the system you will run to back up and maintain the other systems on your computer.

* The Partimage program - free software that can easily copy a partition's contents into a single, compressed 'partition image file', and can also restore a partition's contents using such a file.  http://www.partimage.org/

* The FSArchiver program - a new program still in development which adds functionality not included in Partimage (such as ext4 support).  http://www.fsarchiver.org

* A [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&amp;bookcmd=render_article&amp;arttitle=How+To+Backup+Operating+Systems&amp;writer=rl printed copy of this guide] is also helpful.

===Getting SystemRescueCD===

Step one is to make yourself a copy of the SystemRescueCD.  This CD may be downloaded as an iso file from http://www.sysresccd.org/Download.  After downloading the iso file, it is suggested that you check its integrity using md5sum.  For example, on a Linux system you can generally do this by entering:

&lt;pre&gt;md5sum systemrescuecd-x86-1.3.5.iso&lt;/pre&gt;

and compare the output with the md5sum published on the download page.

Finally, burn a copy of the CD using your CD burning software, and if possible have this software verify the integrity of the burn.  

'''Note: If you plan to use FSArchiver, it is best to use the very latest beta version of SystemRescueCD.  http://www.sysresccd.org/Beta-x86'''

''Note:  This guide is based on SystemRescueCD version 1.3.5.  Later versions should be compatible with this guide, but when in doubt check the latest manual.''

==Creating Backups==

===Partition Backup Requirements===

To back up a partition, you will need a &quot;source partition&quot; (a partition to be backed up), and a &quot;target filesystem&quot; (a place to save the backup file).  Both the source and target must already contain valid filesystems (ext2/3/4, reiserfs, reiser4, btrfs, xfs, jfs, vfat, fat16/32, ntfs, iso9660).

Note that the source partition may be a primary partition or a logical drive on an extended partition - this makes no difference.

The &quot;target filesystem&quot; (place to save the backup file) must NOT be located on the source partition.  The backup file's size will be approximately half the size of the total data on the source partition (NOT half the total partition size).  For example, if the 6 GB source partition contains 2 GB of files, the backup file will be approximately 1 GB.  (The data on the partition is gzipped; free space is ignored.)

Examples of target filesystems which can be used to save your backup file:

* Another formatted partition, on the same hard drive as the source partition, with ample space

* A formatted partition on another internal hard drive

* A USB stick or external hard drive with ample space

* An NFS share on another computer

* A shared folder on a networked Windows computer (samba share)

If you know the drive number and partition number of your source partition, and you know your target filesystem's location, then you are ready to proceed.

===Prepare The Target===

First, you may want to [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&amp;bookcmd=render_article&amp;arttitle=How+To+Backup+Operating+Systems&amp;writer=rl print out a copy of this guide].

Boot SystemRescueCD.  You may generally press Enter at the &quot;boot:&quot; and keyboard prompts, and will eventually be presented with a root console prompt.

Enter the following command to prepare a mount point for the target filesystem:
&lt;pre&gt;mkdir /mnt/target&lt;/pre&gt;

Next, mount your target filesystem (the place where you will save the backup file).  Examples include:

&lt;pre&gt;# Note: If you'd like to see a list of partitions and sizes, you can enter:
fdisk -l
# OR
cat /proc/partitions

# To mount a local partition (hard drive, USB stick, etc.):
# In this example, sda5 (partition 5 of drive 1)
mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/target

# To mount a local NTFS partition with write permission:
ntfs-3g /dev/sda5 /mnt/target

# Note: Before mounting networked filesystems as shown below, you may need to enter:
net-setup

# OR  To mount a networked Windows shared folder (samba share):
mount -t smbfs -o lfs //192.168.10.3/my-share/ /mnt/target

# OR  To mount an NFS share:
mount -t nfs 192.168.10.1:/home/user/share /mnt/target

# Finally, make sure the target filesystem is successfully mounted:
ls /mnt/target&lt;/pre&gt;

Once the target filesystem is mounted, you are ready to create the backup.  This guide includes two methods for creating a partition backup: FSArchiver and Partimage.  Each method has its strengths and weaknesses.  Choose the method most appropriate for each partition you are backing up.

===Create Partition Backup - FSArchiver Method===

The FSArchiver method works best for linux filesystems (ext2/3/4, reiserfs, xfs, etc), and also has support for ntfs.  FSArchiver has several advantages over Partimage: it supports ext4 and btrfs; it can restore data to a partition which is smaller than the original the backup was made from; it can change the filesystem type when restoring (eg ext3 to ext4); it can encrypt the backup; it checksums the data to detect corruption; and it can restore files from a partially corrupted backup.  However, FSArchiver has '''no support for FAT''' filesystems, and the ntfs support is new and may not be stable.  FSArchiver is also under heavy development and is thus not recommended for critical data (as of Jan 2010).  Check the [http://www.fsarchiver.org FSArchiver Homepage] for the latest information on these issues.  For more comparison information see [http://www.fsarchiver.org/Fsarchiver_vs_partimage FSArchiver vs Partimage].  To make sure you have the most up-to-date version of FSArchiver, be sure to download the [http://www.sysresccd.org/Beta-x86 latest version of SystemRescueCD].  

This guide currently recommends the FSArchiver method if a partition contains an ext2/3/4  or other linux filesystem.  Otherwise the Partimage method detailed in the next section is recommended.

Working by example, the following command will create a backup of the /dev/sda5 partition and save it to the backup file &quot;/mnt/target/backup-sda5.fsa&quot; on the [[#Prepare The Target|target filesystem]]:

&lt;pre&gt;fsarchiver savefs /mnt/target/backup-sda5.fsa /dev/sda5&lt;/pre&gt;

It will take a few minutes.  When finished, you can view information on the created archive with:
&lt;pre&gt;fsarchiver archinfo /mnt/target/backup-sda5.fsa&lt;/pre&gt;

FSArchiver has other options for archive creation.  Examples include:

&lt;pre&gt;# To encrypt the backup using &quot;yourpassword&quot;:
fsarchiver -c yourpassword savefs /mnt/target/backup-sda5.fsa /dev/sda5

# To split the backup into 4300MB files for DVD burning:
fsarchiver -s 4300 savefs /mnt/target/backup-sda5.fsa /dev/sda5

# To use a dual-core processor for greater compression speed (or use -j4 for quad):
fsarchiver -j2 savefs /mnt/target/backup-sda5.fsa /dev/sda5

# To see progress and more details as the backup is created::
fsarchiver -v savefs /mnt/target/backup-sda5.fsa /dev/sda5&lt;/pre&gt;

For further options and information, please consult the [http://www.fsarchiver.org/QuickStart FSArchiver Quick Start Guide].

If you have a multi-OS system, create a backup (using Partimage or FSArchiver) of each relevant partition, saving each to an appropriately-named backup file.  (Linux swap partitions do not need to be backed up.)

===Create Partition Backup - Partimage Method===

The Partimage method works for most filesystems (ext2/3, reiserfs, reiser4, xfs, jfs, vfat, fat16/32, ntfs, iso9660), but '''does not support ext4''' or btrfs.  Partimage has some other limitations:  it does not checksum data so corruptions may not be detected; a corrupt archive cannot be partially restored; you can only restore data to a partition which is the same size as or larger than the original partition the backup was created from; there is no encryption built-in; there is no support for multi-threaded compression.  Advantages of Partimage include that it backs up all data on the partition including VBR boot code, and it restores files to their original disk sectors.  [http://partimage.org Partimage] is an older program which is quite stable, but is no longer being developed, so no ext4 support is expected.

This guide currently recommends the Partimage method if a partition contains a FAT (including vfat) or ntfs filesystem.  Otherwise the FSArchiver method detailed in the previous section is recommended.

Once the [[#Prepare The Target|target filesystem]] is mounted, run the Partimage program:
&lt;pre&gt;partimage&lt;/pre&gt;

Partimage's GUI just requires you to fill in the boxes.  You can see some screenshots of this here...  http://www.partimage.org/Partimage-manual_Usage

First, use the up &amp; down arrow keys to highlight the partition you want to back up.  Once it's highlighted, press Tab to move the cursor to the &quot;Image file to create/use&quot; box.  Enter the backup file here.  For example:  
&lt;pre&gt;/mnt/target/backup-sda5&lt;/pre&gt;
(This will save the backup to a file named &quot;backup-sda5.000&quot; in /mnt/target/)

Now move down to the &quot;Action to be done:&quot; box by pressing the Tab key and make sure the 'Save partition into a new image file' option is checked (use space bar to select it if necessary).  Press F5 to proceed.

Next you are given some options - set these as you wish, using the Tab key to move and the spacebar to check/uncheck options.  Generally you can leave them as they are.  If the image file is larger than the set size (default 2 GB), it will be broken into multiple files (.000, .001, etc)  If you are saving the image file to a FAT32 filesystem, be sure to set the split size no higher than 4000 MB.  If you plan to burn your backup to CDs or DVDs, set this to 690 MB for CD or 4300 MB for DVD.

Press F5 to proceed.

The partition's contents will be gzipped and saved to the backup 'image' file(s) - takes 5-10 minutes on most systems.  When it's done, exit Partimage.

If you have a multi-OS system, create a backup (using Partimage or FSArchiver) of each relevant partition, saving each to an appropriately-named backup file.  (Linux swap partitions do not need to be backed up.)

===How To Back Up An MBR And Partition Table===

====MBR Backup====
For a discussion of what the MBR is and why we're backing it up, read [[#How The Computer Boots - The MBR Explained|How The Computer Boots - The MBR Explained]].

For an automated utility which creates and restores MBR backup files, [http://igurublog.wordpress.com/downloads/script-mbrback/ mbrback] is recommended. 

The MBR backup is a VERY small file (512 bytes).  In this example, we will assume that /dev/sda is the first hard drive (boot drive) of the system.  Substitute your correct boot drive accordingly.

&lt;pre&gt;# Back up entire MBR:
dd if=/dev/sda of=/mnt/target/sda-MBR-backup bs=512 count=1&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that you do NOT include a partition number after the device name, just &quot;sda&quot;.

&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #ff0000; background: #ffa000; padding: 0.5em; color: #000000;&quot;&gt;IMPORTANT:  Anytime you change the partitioning of the drive, or change the boot code in the MBR, you should make a new backup of the MBR.  Restoring the MBR using an outdated backup MBR file can be fatal to all of the data on your drive!&lt;/div&gt;

Note: Linux users do not need SystemRescueCD to make an MBR backup.  The above dd command may be executed from a root console while the system is running.

====Partition Table Backup====
While the MBR contains the primary partition table, it does not contain the extended partition table, which is stored on the extended partition.  The program sfdisk may be used to back up and restore the entire partition table, including extended partitions.  For example, to create a partition table backup of the first hard drive:

&lt;pre&gt;sfdisk -d /dev/sda &gt; /mnt/target/sda-part-table.sf&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: The output of sfdisk is plain text and may be viewed by loading the file into a text editor or omitting the redirection.  This output can be used by sfdisk to restore (recreate) the partition table, as detailed in [[#Partition Table Restoration|Partition Table Restoration]].


===Rebooting And Finishing Up===

Finally, umount the target filesystem and reboot:

&lt;pre&gt;umount /mnt/target
reboot&lt;/pre&gt;

When the screen goes blank, remove the CD so the computer boots into your OS.  You should now find the backup files where you saved them.  If on a Linux filesystem, they will be owned by root - change this as you like.  For example:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo chown 1000:1000 backup-sda5.*&lt;/pre&gt;

I now suggest creating a text file which describes the contents of the backup file.  In this example it could be named &quot;backup-sda5.txt&quot;, and would describe what OS version was on the partition at the time of backup, date it was created, md5sum of the backup file, what software and drivers were installed, etc.  You can also use this text file to record subsequent changes you make to the system.  This makes remembering and repeating these changes after restoration very quick.

You can now copy and move the backup files as you like - to another drive, to a networked computer, burn them to CD or DVD.  If multiple backup files were created, numbered .000, .001,... (Partimage), or .fsa,.f01,.f02,... (FSArchiver), just keep them together - they will all be required for restoration.

===How To Back Up The /home Folder===

On Linux systems, the /home folder contains user software/desktop settings and some user files.  This data changes more frequently than system files - usually daily - so it is convenient to have a more up-to-date backup of this data.  Also, unlike the system files, this data may be reliably backed up while the system is running and users are logged in.

====Manual Backup Of The /home Folder====

The following examples assume your backup partition is mounted to /user - change if necessary.

&lt;pre&gt;# To make a backup tar file of your /home folder, enter in a console:
sudo tar --preserve -czf /user/home-backup.tar.gz /home

# Or, you can save space by omitting unnecessary files:
sudo tar --preserve --exclude=/home/*/.mozilla/firefox/*/Cache/* \
--exclude=/home/*/.mozilla/firefox/*/bookmarkbackups/* \
--exclude=/home/*/.googleearth/Cache/* \
--exclude=/home/*/.local/share/Trash/* --exclude=/home/*/.thumbnails/* \
-czf /user/home-backup.tar.gz /home&lt;/pre&gt;

The /home folder has been compressed and saved to /user/home-backup.tar.gz.

Alternatively, you can simply copy your /home folder to a backup location without compression:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo cp -a /home /user/home-backup&lt;/pre&gt;

The -a option ensures that file permissions and ownership information is retained.

Or, if your /home folder is on a separate partition of its own, you can use Partimage to back up the partition.

====Automatic Backup Of The /home Folder====

It is also possible to automate backup of the /home folder so that a daily backup is created.  To do so, enter (or copy/paste) the following commands in a console:  (substitute your desired backup location for &quot;/user&quot;, preferably a different partition from your system partition)

&lt;pre&gt;# Create folders for backups and scripts to be used
mkdir -p /user/scripts
mkdir -p /user/backups
# Create a script to perform daily backups
echo '#!/bin/bash' &gt; /user/scripts/daily-home-backup.sh
echo 'tar --preserve --exclude=/home/*/.mozilla/firefox/*/Cache/* \
--exclude=/home/*/.mozilla/firefox/*/bookmarkbackups/* \
--exclude=/home/*/.googleearth/Cache/* --exclude=/home/*/.local/share/Trash/* \
--exclude=/home/*/.thumbnails/* -czf /user/backups/home-backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M).tar.gz \
/home' &gt;&gt; /user/scripts/daily-home-backup.sh
# Make the script automatically remove backups older than 20 days
echo 'find -L /user/backups -type f -mtime +20 -name &quot;home-backup-*.tar.gz&quot; \
-execdir rm {} \;' &gt;&gt; /user/scripts/daily-home-backup.sh
# Make the script owned by root (security precaution since it will be run by root)
sudo chown root:root /user/scripts/daily-home-backup.sh
# Make the script executable
sudo chmod ugo+x /user/scripts/daily-home-backup.sh
# Create a crontab file to run the backup script daily at 3:00AM
echo '00 3 * * * /user/scripts/daily-home-backup.sh' &gt; /user/scripts/root-crontab
# Install the crontab file
sudo crontab -u root /user/scripts/root-crontab&lt;/pre&gt;

The above commands produce the following executable script (/user/scripts/daily-home-backup.sh) and schedule it to be run daily at 3:00AM:
&lt;pre&gt;#!/bin/bash
tar --preserve --exclude=/home/*/.mozilla/firefox/*/Cache/* \
--exclude=/home/*/.mozilla/firefox/*/bookmarkbackups/* --exclude=/home/*/.googleearth/Cache/* \
--exclude=/home/*/.local/share/Trash/* --exclude=/home/*/.thumbnails/* \
-czf /user/backups/home-backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M).tar.gz /home
find -L /user/backups -type f -mtime +20 -name &quot;home-backup-*.tar.gz&quot; -execdir rm {} \;&lt;/pre&gt;

Anytime you want to manually create a backup of home, just enter:
&lt;pre&gt;sudo bash /user/scripts/daily-home-backup.sh&lt;/pre&gt;

If you decide you don't want the daily-home-backup.sh script to run daily, just remove the crontab job:
&lt;pre&gt;sudo crontab -u root -r&lt;/pre&gt;

The above script is just a simple example which may be customized by editing /user/scripts/daily-home-backup.sh  There are also GUI backup programs on most systems which can automate backup of your /home folder.

==Restoring From Backups==

===Restoration Requirements===

Restoring the contents of a partition should restore all files and boot information present when the backup was made.  Assuming the partition contained your OS, all the settings and installed software which were located on that partition will be restored to their previous state.

To restore, you need a backup file created by Partimage or FSArchiver, and you need a destination partition.  The destination partition may be on any drive, and does not need to be the same partition the backup was created from.  You may restore the backup file to any partition on any drive, providing:

* If the backup file contains an OS, be sure the backup file was created on this same computer.  Generally it is a poor idea to attempt to use backup files created on one computer with another computer, unless the hardware is virtually identical.  (Each computer usually has a different mainboard, video card, memory, and other specifics.  Running an OS which was installed on a different machine's hardware generally doesn't go well!)  Make separate backup files for each computer's OS(es) and don't mix them.

* The destination partition does NOT need to have a valid filesystem on it.  It may be unformated, or may contain any filesystem or data.  Whatever is there will be overwritten.  If you are restoring to a brand new drive, you merely need to create the partitions (using cfdisk, sfdisk, or similar).

* (Partimage only) The size of the destination partition must be at least as large as the original partition the backup was created from, not merely big enough to hold the data.  For example, if the original source partition was 10 GB with 2 GB of files on it, the new destination partition must be at least 10 GB in size (or larger - depending on the filesystem, it may automatically grow to use the available space).  Partimage will refuse to restore to a smaller partition than the original.  (Partimage uses a low level block/cluster copy to copy and restore the partition's contents, so file data is placed in its original location on the partition.  [http://www.partimage.org/Partimage-FAQ#Can_I_restore_it_to_a_smaller_or_bigger_partition_.3F more info])  To copy and restore a partition to a smaller partition, use the [[#Create Partition Backup - FSArchiver Method|FSArchiver method]], or the method described in [[#How To Copy Data To A Smaller Partition|How To Copy Data To A Smaller Partition]].)

If you know the location and type (Partimage or FSArchiver) of your backup image file, and it is accessible from the computer, and you know the drive and number of your destination partition, you are ready to restore.  Note that Partimage backups have the extensions .000, .001, etc., while FSArchiver backups have the extentions .fsa, .f01, etc.

===Prepare The Source===

First, boot SystemRescueCD and mount the partition or network share where the backup file is stored.  Using the backup location in our previous example:

&lt;pre&gt;# Our backup file is on /dev/sda5
mkdir /mnt/back
mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/back&lt;/pre&gt;

OR, if you burned the backup file onto a bootable SystemRescueCD DVD ([[#How To Burn A Bootable DVD Containing Backup Files And Tools|see how to do this]]), you will find it in /mnt/cdrom.  You do not need to mount anything.

OR, if your backup file is located on a single CD or DVD, you can either copy the backup file to another location before booting SystemRescueCD, or you can boot SystemRescueCD in such a way that you can remove it from the drive.  To do so, enter this at the &quot;boot:&quot; prompt:

&lt;pre&gt;boot: fb1024 docache doeject&lt;/pre&gt;
or:
&lt;pre&gt;boot: fb800 docache doeject&lt;/pre&gt;

The CD will eject after SystemRescueCD has booted, and you can insert another CD or DVD in the drive and mount it.

OR, if your backup file was split into multiple files (.000, .001, etc), you must copy them to a single location before proceeding, such as another partition or network share, and mount this location.

===Restore Partition - FSArchiver Method===

If you created your backup file using FSArchiver, you must use this method to restore it.

'''WARNING: All the data currently stored on this partition will be overwritten!'''

Working by example, to restore /dev/sda5 from the backup file /mnt/back/backup-sda5.fsa (substitute the device name you wish to restore to!):

&lt;pre&gt;fsarchiver restfs /mnt/back/backup-sda5.fsa id=0,dest=/dev/sda5&lt;/pre&gt;

Note:  &quot;id=0&quot; in the above command specifies that filesystem #0 in the archive is to be restored.  Unless you saved multiple filesystems to the archive file, which is not covered in this guide, always use &quot;id=0&quot;.

If you encrypted your archive using the -c option, use the same -c option when restoring.

If your backup was split into multiple files (.fsa, .f01, .f02...), just specify the first file (with .fsa extension) and FSArchiver will find the rest.

Note: Unlike Partimage, which restores an exact duplicate of a partition using a low level block copy, FSArchiver recreates the filesystem.  This means that files will be in different locations on the disk.  If the partition you restored contains GRUB's stage files (/boot/grub/), you will need to [[#How To Set Grub's Root Partition|reinstall GRUB to the MBR]] so it can mark the new disk location of its files.  If using LILO, it must also be reinstalled.

Note: If you restored to a different partition than the original, you may need to change Linux (GRUB, fstab) or Windows (boot.ini) boot information.  Consult the [[#Restoration Scenarios|Restoration Scenarios]] section for more information.

Finally, umount what you mounted, and reboot:

&lt;pre&gt;umount /mnt/back
reboot&lt;/pre&gt;

Remove the SystemRescueCD at the blank screen and your computer will travel back in time!

===Restore Partition - Partimage Method===

If you created your backup file using Partimage, you must use this method to restore it.  Once you have the location of your backup file(s) mounted, run Partimage:
&lt;pre&gt;partimage&lt;/pre&gt;

First, using the up &amp; down arrow keys, highlight the destination partition (the partition which will be restored using your backup file).

'''WARNING: All the data currently stored on this partition will be overwritten!'''

Press Tab to move the cursor to the &quot;Image file to create/use&quot; field.  Enter your backup file location and name.  In this example:
&lt;pre&gt;/mnt/back/backup-sda5.000&lt;/pre&gt;

(If you have multiple backup files, just enter the name of the first file, including the extension .000)

'''IMPORTANT''':  Press Tab twice to move down to &quot;Restore partition from an image file&quot; and press spacebar to select it.

Then press F5 to proceed.  Follow on-screen instructions and the partition will generally be restored within 5-10 minutes.

Exit Partimage, umount what you mounted, and reboot:

&lt;pre&gt;umount /mnt/back
reboot&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: If you restored to a different partition than the original, you may need to change Linux (GRUB, fstab) or Windows (boot.ini) boot information.  Consult the [[#Restoration Scenarios|Restoration Scenarios]] section for more information.

Remove the SystemRescueCD at the blank screen and your computer will travel back in time!

===How To Copy Data To A Smaller Partition===
If you want to copy the contents of a partition to a ''smaller'' partition and are unable to use FSArchiver, you can avoid Partimage's limitation using the cp command.  Boot SystemRescueCD, and execute some variation of the following example commands:

&lt;pre&gt;# format destination partition (in this example /dev/sda3 using ext3)
# WARNING: this destroys all data on the partition!
mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda3
# mount source partition (/dev/sda2) and target
cd /mnt
mkdir source
mkdir target
mount /dev/sda2 source
mount /dev/sda3 target
# copy the filesystem
# Note: be sure to include the dots
cp -ax /mnt/source/. /mnt/target/.&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: Unlike Partimage, the above method only copies the files on the partition.  It does not copy the VBR boot sector of the partition (critical to Windows booting), and it changes the location of the linux kernel files (which may require reinstallation of your bootloader to the MBR).

===How To Restore An MBR And Partition Table===

====MBR Restoration====
You should only restore the MBR if it is necessary to do so, and you should be sure you have an up-to-date backup file to work with.  Because the primary partition table is stored in the MBR, an out-of-date backup file containing a different version of the partition table can cause loss of data.

If you are merely rolling back the state of a partition in order to roll back your OS, you do not need to restore the MBR.  The MBR only needs to be restored if the system is not booting the way you want (perhaps the MBR was damaged, you purchased a new hard drive and have no bootable MBR, or you installed Windows which overwrites the MBR without installing a multi-OS boot manager), or if the primary partition table has been damaged.  Consult the [[#Restoration Scenarios|Restoration Scenarios]] section to determine when it is appropriate to restore the MBR.

You can choose to restore the entire MBR, which restores the boot code as well as the primary partition table.  Or you can restore just the boot code within the MBR.  If the partition table is okay, just restore the boot code.

If you previously had GRUB installed in the MBR of your hard drive, restoring the boot code from backup is usually equivalent to reinstalling GRUB to the MBR.

For an automated utility which backs up and restores the MBR, [http://igurublog.wordpress.com/downloads/script-mbrback/ mbrback] is recommended.

In this example, we will assume that /dev/sda is the first hard drive (boot drive) of the system.  Substitute your correct boot drive accordingly.

Boot SystemRescueCD and mount the location where your backup files are stored.  Using the backup location in our previous example:

&lt;pre&gt;# Our backup file is on /dev/sda5
mkdir /mnt/back
mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/back

# Our boot drive is /dev/sda
# To restore the boot code ONLY, leaving the partition table unchanged:
dd if=/mnt/back/sda-MBR-backup of=/dev/sda bs=448 count=1

# OR, to restore the ENTIRE MBR (including partition table):
dd if=/mnt/back/sda-MBR-backup of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1&lt;/pre&gt;

'''IMPORTANT: Note that you do NOT include a partition number after the device name in the dd command, just &quot;sda&quot;.'''

Note: Linux users may not need SystemRescueCD to restore the MBR.  If you have a working Linux system, the above dd commands may be executed from a root console while the system is running.

====Partition Table Restoration====
While the MBR contains the primary partition table, it does not contain the extended partition table.  If the full partition table needs to be restored (perhaps it was damaged or was modified incorrectly), the backup file created by sfdisk may be used.  (This method also works to create a partition table on a new drive identical to another drive.)  For example, to recreate the partition table from the backup made of the first hard drive:

&lt;pre&gt;sfdisk /dev/sda &lt; /mnt/back/sda-part-table.sf&lt;/pre&gt;

===How To Restore The /home Folder===

If /home is on a separate partition, it is restored using the same method as other partitions.

If the /home folder was copied or tarred, boot into your OS or SystemRescueCD.  If using your OS, it is important not to log into the system as a graphical user.  At the graphical desktop manager greeting, press Ctrl-Alt-F1 to access a console.  Login as root (preferred) or as a user.

If using SystemRescueCD, you must mount the location of the backup files and the location of the /home folder before proceeding, and use the correct location of the home folder in lieu of &quot;/home&quot; in the example below (eg /mnt/mysystem/home instead of /home).

&lt;pre&gt;# First, remove the /home folder:
sudo rm -r /home

# If your backup of the /home folder was a copy made with &quot;cp -a&quot;, just copy it back:
sudo cp -a /user/home-backup /home

# OR, if your backup is a tar file:
sudo cd /
sudo tar xzfp /user/home-backup.tar.gz&lt;/pre&gt;

You may then reboot (enter &quot;reboot&quot;) or press Ctrl-Alt-F7 to login to a desktop.


==How The Computer Boots - The MBR Explained==

It is valuable to have a basic understanding of how a computer boots so you know what to back up and what to restore when maintaining your system.

===BIOS Device Priority===

When you turn on your computer, the BIOS programming (which is stored in memory chips on the mainboard) starts running.  Among other things, this BIOS program determines which drive or device will be booted first.  The 'boot device priority' may be changed by entering the BIOS (aka Setup) at boot.  A typical boot device priority is floppy, CDROM, hard drive 1.  In most cases, the BIOS can be told which device on your system should be considered drive 1.  This gives you control over what device boots your system.

===Master Boot Record===
The BIOS then consults the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the boot device.  The MBR is NOT located on any partition of the device.  Rather, it is the first 512 byte sector of the device, located in front of the first partition.

The MBR contains:
* a 'boot code' area
* the primary partition table
* a 32 bit 'disk signature'

====MBR Boot Code====
When booting a boot device, such as a hard drive, the BIOS runs the program code contained in the MBR of the device (this program is called the 'boot code' of the MBR).  Repartitioning your hard drive, formatting partitions, or restoring partitions from backup will NOT alter or restore the MBR boot code.

The MBR boot code is generally only modified by:
* the installation program of an OS (eg a Linux or Windows install CD)
* the repair facility of an OS (eg Windows fixmbr)
* installing a boot manager (eg GRUB)
* direct disk writing as used in this guide (dd)
* a virus which infects the MBR
* disk-wiping utilities (eg DBAN)

====MBR Primary Partition Table====
In addition to the boot code, the MBR contains the drive's primary partition table.  This information includes the size, number, and OS-type of the partitions, and which one partition is marked 'bootable' (referred to as the 'boot' or 'active' partition of the drive).  (The extended partition table, which defines any logical partitions of the drive, is located on the extended partition, not in the MBR.)  The primary partition table of the MBR is modified by:
* the installation program of an OS (eg a Linux or Windows install CD)
* partitioning software (eg cfdisk, sfdisk, Gparted)
* direct disk writing as used in this guide (dd)

Formatting or changing the data on the partitions does not change the partition table.  You must resize, delete, or create partitions, change their type, or change the bootable partition in order to affect the MBR's partition table.

====MBR Disk Signature====
Finally, it should be noted that the MBR contains a 32-bit number (a &quot;Windows NT disk signature&quot; - now also used by Linux) intended to uniquely identify the disk medium (Note: this is NOT the same as UUIDs, which are stored in the filesystems on the partitions).  Restoring the entire MBR to a new drive from an MBR backup file will duplicate this number. 

For a thorough discussion of the MBR:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record

===Boot Management===
Once the BIOS passes control to the MBR boot code, that program determines what happens next.  The boot code area of the MBR is not very big, so it can't do much.  Mostly what it does is pass control to another program.  Here are several possible boot configurations:

====Generic Boot Code====
On a simple, single-OS system (such as DOS or older Windows), the MBR boot code will examine the partition table portion of the MBR to see which partition is marked 'bootable' (aka 'active').  It then passes control to the Volume Boot Record (VBR) of this boot partition.  (A VBR is stored in the first few sectors of a ''partition'', whereas the MBR is stored in the first sector of the ''drive'').  In this case, the VBR contains a boot loader - a program which the installed OS uses to get itself up and running.  With this kind of generic MBR boot code, the only way to boot a different partition is to modify the partition table.  Specifically, using a program like cfdisk, you must [[#How To Set The Boot Partition|change which partition is marked 'bootable']].

====Linux Boot Managers====
On most Linux systems, the MBR boot code contains a boot manager such as GRUB or LILO.  For example, if GRUB is installed to the MBR of the drive, it will run first.  GRUB will consult its 'root partition' for further information.  (When GRUB is installed, one partition is defined as the GRUB 'root' and contains data used by GRUB, generally in /boot/grub/.  Specifically, GRUB's &quot;menu.lst&quot; or &quot;grub.cfg&quot; file tells GRUB what partitions on the system may be booted and how to boot them.)  GRUB may present the user with a menu at boot time asking what partition to boot.  Control is then passed to the Linux kernel and boot programs.  Note that this scenario has at least two places where vital boot information is stored: in the MBR boot code, and on the partition designated as GRUB's 'root'.  If either area is damaged or changed, it may affect the boot process.  Note that this method ignores which partition is marked 'bootable' in the partition table.  Also note that GRUB stores within the MBR boot code the physical disk sector where its stage file is located.  If the physical location of this file changes (due to restoration with FSArchiver, for example), GRUB will need to be reinstalled to the MBR.

====Windows Boot Managers====
On newer Windows systems such as NT, XP, and Vista, a boot manager is used: NT Loader aka &quot;NTLDR&quot; (Windows NT and XP), or Windows Boot Manager (Windows Vista).  When Windows is installed, the MBR's boot code will be overwritten.  At boot, this code will transfer control to the VBR of the boot partition, which in turn transfers control to the NT Loader or Windows Boot Manager, which will control the rest of the boot process.  Sometimes the boot manager will present a menu asking the user what installed version of Windows to boot.  Note that this scenario has at least four places where vital boot information is stored: in the MBR boot code, in the boot flag of the MBR partition table, in the VBR of the boot partition, and in the filesystem of the partition containing the NT Loader or Windows Boot Manager.  If any of these areas is damaged or changed, it may affect the boot process.

====Linux &amp; Windows====
If a multi-OS system includes Linux and Windows, a Linux boot manager must be used to control the boot process because the Windows boot managers do not accommodate Linux partitions.  This setup is very similar to a Linux-only system, except that in order to boot a Windows partition, the boot manager (such as GRUB) will transfer control to the VBR of the Windows partition, allowing the Windows boot loader or manager to take control (called chainloading).  Note that this scenario has several places where vital boot information is stored: in the MBR boot code, on the partition designated as GRUB's 'root', in the VBR(s) of Windows partition(s), and in the filesystem(s) of the partition(s) containing NT Loader or Windows Boot Manager.  If any of these areas is damaged or changed, it may affect the boot process.  Note that this method ignores which partition is marked 'bootable' in the partition table.

====Grub In A VBR And More====
Another more rare variation of GRUB installation is for GRUB's boot code to be installed only in the VBR area of a partition, not in the drive's MBR.  In this case the MBR contains generic boot code which simply boots the 'bootable' partition.  If the partition where GRUB is installed to the VBR is marked 'bootable', GRUB will boot, and will present its menu, again based on its configuration files located on its root partition.

There are also many other possible variations of boot management, but the above examples describe most common configurations.

===Backing Up And Restoring The Boot Process===
For the purpose of backing up your complete system, you want to determine what needs to be backed up in order to restore not only the filesystems, but if possible the entire boot process.  For example, if you have a simple, single-OS system, then the MBR boot code will simply boot the partition marked 'bootable'.  In that case, if you back up the MBR and the partition containing the OS, you have a full backup.  You can fully restore the system by restoring the MBR and the OS partition.  (If you move the OS to a different partition, you simply need to [[#How To Set The Boot Partition|change which partition is marked 'bootable']].)

If you have a multi-OS system which has GRUB installed in the MBR, then backing up and controlling the boot process is more complicated.  You must back up the MBR, which contains the GRUB boot code.  You also must back up the GRUB 'root' partition, which contains /boot/grub/ (along with your Linux OS).  In addition, you must back up other partitions containing other OSes.  To control the boot process on this kind of system, you edit GRUB's configuration files.  Changing the 'bootable' flag in cfdisk will have no effect.  To change which partition is GRUB's 'root', you must [[#How To Set Grub's Root Partition|run GRUB and install it to the MBR]].

In most cases, restoring the MBR boot code and the OS partitions will restore the boot process of the system.  However, there are exceptions.  The Windows installer will sometimes borrow the VBR of another compatible partition in order to boot the partition containing Windows, which can create very confusing boot behavior, and lead to breakages in the boot process.  For example, Windows insists that it boot from hard drive 1, and not from extended partitions (logical drives).  If you attempt to install it to a partition on another drive, or to an extended partition, it may write a boot loader into the VBR of one of the primary partitions on drive 1 in order to boot.  In terms of backing up and restoring Windows, this means that sometimes restoring the partition containing Windows will not be enough to restore the boot process to working order.  In this case, it may be necessary to reinstall or repair Windows using the Windows installation disc.  In other cases, reconfiguring the Windows boot manager may be required (edit boot.ini, etc.)  For a more detailed discussion of the Windows boot process, please consult [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_startup_process Windows NT/XP Startup Process] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista_startup_process Windows Vista Startup Process].

Also note that the Partimage program, one method used by this guide for backing up and restoring partitions, copies not only the filesystem on the partition but also the 'boot sector' contents of the partition's VBR, and it maintains the locations of the kernel and other files.  (Partimage uses a low level block/cluster copy, not the linux kernel's filesystem support.)  For more information please consult [http://www.partimage.org/Partimage-manual_Partition_Image_Internals#How_are_the_partitions_read.2Fwritten Partimage: How are the partitions read/written].

On the other hand, the FSArchiver method merely recreates the filesystem, so files may be moved, and the contents of the VBR may not be restored.  However, when restoring ntfs partitions, FSArchiver does perform an [http://www.fsarchiver.org/Cloning-ntfs ntfs-clone] which is designed to maintain the boot functionality of a Windows partition.  If a partition you restore with FSArchiver contains GRUB's root (/boot/grub/), you will need to [[#How To Set Grub's Root Partition|reinstall GRUB to the MBR]] so that it can mark the new location of its files.

===How To Set The Boot Partition===

This section only applies if you have a single-OS system with generic MBR boot code that boots the 'bootable' (aka 'active') partition, OR if you have GRUB installed into the VBR of a partition rather than into the MBR (which is not usually done).  If you have GRUB installed in the MBR, changing the 'bootable' partition will make no difference as GRUB ignores this.

To change the 'bootable' partition, boot SystemRescueCD or any Linux console and enter:
&lt;pre&gt;cfdisk&lt;/pre&gt;

Highlight the desired boot partition using the up/down arrow keys.  Next, make sure &quot;[Bootable]&quot; is highlighted at the bottom of the screen.  If it is not, press Tab repeatedly until &quot;[Bootable]&quot; is highlighted.  Press Enter.  &quot;Boot&quot; should appear next to the partition name in the list above.  Now press Tab repeatedly until &quot;[Write]&quot; is highlighted, and press Enter.

&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #ff0000; background: #ffa000; padding: 0.5em; color: #000000;&quot;&gt;The partition table has been modified, so be sure to make a new backup of the MBR.&lt;/div&gt;

===How To Set Grub's Root Partition===

If you have GRUB installed in the MBR, then it will use files on its 'root' to determine what partitions are bootable and how (the GRUB menu).  If you relocate GRUB's root to a different partition, or move the disk location of its files (as FSArchiver will when restoring), you need to tell GRUB where to find these files (called stage files).  

If GRUB is not already installed to the MBR, this method will also install GRUB's boot code.

Because there are now two versions of GRUB in common use (v1 and v2) which work quite differently, you must first determine which version you are using.  From your linux OS with GRUB installed, run:

&lt;pre&gt;grub-install -v&lt;/pre&gt;

If the version is reported as something similar to &quot;(GNU GRUB 1.97~beta4)&quot;, this means you are running GRUB v2.  If the report is &quot;(GNU GRUB 0.97)&quot;, you are using GRUB v1.

Use the method below appropriate for your version of GRUB.

====GRUB v1====

This describes how to set GRUB v1's root partition and install its boot code to the MBR.

From a Linux console (SystemRescueCd or an installed system), enter:

&lt;pre&gt;# To set GRUB's root partition and reinstall GRUB in the MBR:
# start GRUB
sudo grub
# Show partitions containing GRUB's stage 1
grub&gt; find /boot/grub/stage1
# Select a partition from the list and set it as root  (sda2 in this example)
grub&gt; root (hd0,1)
# Install GRUB into the MBR
grub&gt; setup (hd0)
# exit GRUB
grub&gt; quit&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that GRUB v1 numbers hard drives and partitions starting from 0, not 1.  So (hd0,4) is equivalent to /dev/sda5.

Note that the root partition must contain GRUB's stage files (usually in /boot/grub/).  If it does not, you need to install the GRUB program (which is beyond the scope of this guide).  Most Linux distributions install GRUB during installation.

&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #ff0000; background: #ffa000; padding: 0.5em; color: #000000;&quot;&gt;The MBR has been modified, so be sure to make a new backup of the MBR.&lt;/div&gt;

====GRUB v2====

This section briefly describes how to set GRUB v2's root partition, install its boot code to the MBR, and reinstall the GRUB2 stage files (/boot/grub/).

First, from SystemRescueCD or your installed linux system, determine and mount the partition which contains GRUB's files (/boot/grub/).  From your installed system, this should already be mounted on &quot;/&quot; or on your boot partition.  If using SystemRescueCD, mount the partition manually.  For example, if your GRUB root is on sda1, then from SystemRescueCD:
&lt;pre&gt;mkdir /mnt/grubroot
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/grubroot&lt;/pre&gt;

Once you have GRUB's root mounted, reinstall GRUB.  With SystemRescueCD:
&lt;pre&gt;grub2-install --root-directory=/mnt/grubroot /dev/sda&lt;/pre&gt;

Or if using your installed linux system:
&lt;pre&gt;sudo grub-install --root-directory=/ /dev/sda&lt;/pre&gt;

If using your installed linux system, you may also want to update the GRUB menu:
&lt;pre&gt;sudo update-grub&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: GRUB will install its files to the boot folder beneath the root you specify (eg /mnt/grubroot/boot/grub/ or /boot/grub/)  Be sure NOT to include a partition number in the grub-install command, just &quot;/dev/sda&quot;.

Note: SystemRescueCD contains both GRUB v1 and v2.  &quot;grub-install&quot; runs GRUB v1, while &quot;grub2-install&quot; runs v2.  On a linux system with just one version of GRUB installed, &quot;grub-install&quot; is the command to use.  Use &quot;grub-install -v&quot; to see the version (0.9x is v1, 1.9x and later is v2).

For more thorough information on using GRUB v2, please consult [http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub.html GNU GRUB], the [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 Ubuntu GRUB2 Guide], or the many other guides available for GRUB2.

&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #ff0000; background: #ffa000; padding: 0.5em; color: #000000;&quot;&gt;The MBR has been modified, so be sure to make a new backup of the MBR.&lt;/div&gt;

===Using UUIDs===

Some Linux systems, such as Ubuntu, use UUIDs to identify partitions in GRUB's configuration files and in /etc/fstab.  A UUID is a randomly generated identification number (for example ddec031f-558c-378f-b26f-158f5742c397) which is stored in the filesystem of the partition when it is formated.  This means that reformatting a partition will change the partition's UUID.  It also means that restoring a partition from backup will restore the UUID of the backed up filesystem.

If the UUIDs of partitions change, and GRUB and fstab are not updated, either the system will not boot, it will boot the wrong partition, or it may complain about missing filesystems.

One particularly troublesome condition you want to avoid is two partitions with the same UUID.  This generally results from restoring a partition from a backup made on another partition.  If two partitions have the same UUID, and GRUB or fstab use UUIDs to boot, it can create very confusing boot behavior.  Be sure to generate a new UUID when you restore a partition using a backup containing a duplicate UUID.

In some cases it may be easier to change the UUID references in GRUB and fstab to device designations.

For example, this line in GRUB v1's /boot/grub/menu.lst:

&lt;pre&gt;kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-16-generic  root=UUID=ff0531cb-a7c6-4973-a106-02f62f432fff ro splash&lt;/pre&gt;

might become

&lt;pre&gt;kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-16-generic root=/dev/sda2 ro splash&lt;/pre&gt;

And this line in /etc/fstab:

&lt;pre&gt;UUID=d08bed28-71d2-45e8-9a20-07e593a7c828  / reiserfs  defaults  0 1&lt;/pre&gt;

might become

&lt;pre&gt;/dev/sda2  /  reiserfs  defaults  0 1&lt;/pre&gt;

If you do wish to continue using UUIDs, you may need to know how to look up a UUID and how to change a UUID.  The following examples work on Ubuntu - your distribution may be slightly different.

&lt;pre&gt;# To look up the current UUID of /dev/sda2:
sudo blkid
# OR
sudo vol_id -u /dev/sda2

# To install a new random UUID in an ext2/ext3 filesystem:
# Note: device sda2 should not be mounted
sudo tune2fs -U random /dev/sda2

# To install a new random UUID in a reiser filesystem:
# Note: device sda2 should not be mounted
sudo reiserfstune --uuid random /dev/sda2

# Note: On some systems the reiserfstune command is tunefs.reiserfs

# To generate a random UUID for general purposes:
uuidgen -r&lt;/pre&gt;

==System Partitioning Recommendations==

By partitioning your system well and setting it up carefully, you'll make maintenance much easier.  This is not a guide on how to setup a multi-boot system, but some discussion of partition usage applies, and will be referenced in the following section on Restoration Scenarios.  If you are not starting with a clean hard drive, you may be able to change the size of existing partitions and create new partitions without losing the data on your drive.  One such method is the Gparted program distributed on many live CDs, including SystemRescueCD (you must startx to see the Gparted icon).  For the purposes of this discussion, I will assume you are setting up a fresh, multi-OS system from scratch.  If this is the case, you can run the cfdisk program on SystemRescueCD to destructively (re)partition your drive.  All data on the drive will be lost.

A suggested partition table:

&lt;pre&gt;device  size    mount       use
------  ----    -----       ---
MBR     512b                GRUB boot code installed
sda1    2G      swap        Linux swap
sda2    7G      /           Linux system  [GRUB root partition]
sda3    20G     /mnt/win    Windows OS (ntfs or fat32) [VBR contains Windows boot code]
sda4    -                   Extended Partition (contains extended partition table)
sda5    20G     /mnt/sda5   test system
sda6    20G     /mnt/sda6   backup partition  [bootable SystemRescueCD]
sda7    xxG     /user       user data (reiser, ext3/4, ntfs, or vfat)&lt;/pre&gt;

If you are installing Windows, it is best to partition your drive (using cfdisk on SystemRescueCD or another method), and then install Windows to its correct partition.  Once Windows installation is complete, then install the Linux OS.  Most Linux OSes will install GRUB to the MBR, so your system will become multi-boot.

Note: The reason Windows is installed first is that it overwrites the MBR, making itself the only bootable OS on the system.  If you install it after Linux, this will remove GRUB from the MBR's boot code, and you will not be able to boot Linux without restoring the MBR boot code or reinstalling GRUB to the MBR.

If you have multiple Linux systems on your computer, they can share a single swap partition.  The data in the swap is only valid while the OS is running (or hibernating).  Generally, you need only one swap partition.

The size of the partitions above are approximate and will vary depending on what OS you're installing to them and how much software you're installing.  Typically, Windows XP uses approximately 5 GB without software, and Vista takes 12 GB.  A typical linux install ''with'' software may use 2-5 GB.

sda5 in the above example is an extra system partition where you can test new versions of an OS, or new OSes, without affecting your primary OSes.  If you like the new system, you can then make that your primary OS (see [[#Scenario #4: A New Version Of Linux On Your Test Partition|Restoration Scenario #4]]).

sda6 is a storage area for backup partition images created by Partimage.  It is safer to keep these on their own unmounted partition.  You can also easily make this partition a bootable SystemRescueCD, so that you don't need to insert the SystemRescueCD to perform maintenance.  Review [[#How To Install SystemRescueCD On A Hard Drive|How To Install SystemRescueCD On A Hard Drive]].

sda7 uses the remaining space on the drive, and contains the majority of user data, such as documents, movies, music, and other large data.  This amount of data is difficult to back up due to its size, which is why it is convenient to have it on a separate partition.  This partition may also be used to store Partimage backup files.  If you want this partition to be accessible from both Windows and Linux, it is easiest to format it as FAT32 or NTFS (although there are also drivers available which allow Windows to access Linux filesystems).

Note that the /home folder has been left on the / (Linux root) partition.  This allows you to maintain different /home folders for different OS installations.  Generally, having two OSes share a single /home folder can create problems.  It is also acceptable to create a separate partition for /home.  In this case, the /home partition or files are backed up and restored separately from the system partition.

Because we have GRUB installed to the MBR, it doesn't matter which of the partitions is marked 'bootable'.  GRUB's /boot/grub/ files on sda2 will determine the default boot OS and options.


==Restoration Scenarios==

Working by example, this section will explore various restoration scenarios.  It is assumed that you have an up-to-date backup of your boot drive's MBR, and a reasonably up-to-date backup image file of each partition containing an OS on your system.  You may also have a separate, more recent backup of your /home folder available (for Linux systems), and a backup of your entire partition table made with sfdisk.

Instructions for all of the activities described in this section, such as restoring MBR boot code, are detailed in the prior sections of this guide.

===Scenario #1: System Modification Gone Bad===

This is a common use for restoration.  Perhaps you tried an OS upgrade which did not turn out well.  Perhaps you installed a driver which has created problems, and you don't know how to cleanly remove it.  Perhaps you simply want to roll the system back to its 'fresh install' state when it was running better.  Or perhaps you want to thoroughly clean and reconfigure your system for security purposes.

In this case, all that is required is restoring the partition containing the OS using the backup file.  It is NOT necessary to restore the MBR.

The only other detail to consider is whether to restore your /home folder from a more recent backup, if available.  If you believe your system problems may be related to user settings in the /home folder, you may wish to use the older version of the /home folder.  If you want to restore your user's settings, then follow the system partition restoration with additional restoration of your /home folder.

===Scenario #2: Repair Or Reinstall Of Windows On A Multi-Boot System===

The Windows install and repair programs may overwrite the MBR, which means the system will no longer boot with GRUB - it will only boot into Windows.  This is a quick fix.  Restore the boot code portion of the MBR.  Alternatively, you can [[#How To Set Grub's Root Partition|reinstall GRUB to the MBR]].

===Scenario #3: A New Version Of Windows On Your Test Partition===

In the [[#System Partitioning Recommendations|example partitioning recommendations]], sda5 is a partition reserved for testing new versions of an OS.  You may want to install a new version of Windows to this partition, while leaving your old version intact on another partition.

The Windows install program will overwrite the MBR.  At best, it will see several versions of Windows and will allow you to boot into them, but not into Linux.  Or, you may only be able to boot into your new install of Windows.

The first step in correcting this is to restore the MBR boot code, which will put GRUB back in the MBR.  Alternatively, you can [[#How To Set Grub's Root Partition|reinstall GRUB to the MBR]].

The system will now boot into the GRUB boot manager, but it will not be aware of the new Windows system.  If using GRUB v1, you need to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst on the GRUB root partition (generally your Linux system partition), and add an entry for the Windows partition in the appropriate place.  This will generally look something like this:

&lt;pre&gt;# /dev/sda5
title		Microsoft Windows
root		(hd0,4)
savedefault
makeactive
chainloader	+1&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that GRUB v1 numbers hard drives and partitions starting from 0, not 1.  So (hd0,4) is equivalent to /dev/sda5.

If you are using GRUB v2, simply update the menu with this command issued on your installed linux system, which should automatically find and add your Windows OS:
&lt;pre&gt;sudo update-grub&lt;/pre&gt;

You can examine /boot/grub/grub.cfg to see if the OS was added.  Note that GRUB v2 numbers hard drives starting from 0, and partitions starting from 1.  So (hd0,5) is equivalent to /dev/sda5.

Depending on what version of Windows you installed, the behavior may vary.  In some cases, each Windows partition can be booted independently by separate GRUB menu entries.  In other cases, one Windows partition will boot to a Windows boot manager, which will present another boot menu, this time only for the different versions of Windows you have installed.  Note that the partition you installed the new version of Windows to may not even be bootable - it may use another partition as its boot partition.  For additional information, consult [[#Backing Up And Restoring The Boot Process|Backing Up And Restoring The Boot Process]] above.

Note that when a partition is formated during reinstallation, its UUID may change.  This may cause your Linux system to complain during boot when it looks for the old UUID of the Windows partition.  If so, you need to edit your /etc/fstab file to either reflect the new UUID, or change to a /dev/xxx reference.  See [[#Using UUIDs|Using UUIDs]] for instructions.

===Scenario #4: A New Version Of Linux On Your Test Partition===

If you want to test a new version of Linux without affecting your current working system, you can install it to the test partition (sda5 in the [[#System Partitioning Recommendations|example partitioning]]).  It can use the same swap partition as your original Linux system.

The good news is that most Linux installations will reinstall GRUB, and will recognize other OSes on the system.  When you reboot, you should have the option to boot into all your OSes.

However, there is one thing to be aware of - the reinstallation of GRUB probably changed GRUB's root partition to the new system (sda5).  This means that GRUB's configuration files (in /boot/grub/) on the new system partition is now controlling the boot options.  This may be fine to use.  However, you should know that if you erase the test partition, GRUB will not be able to find its /boot/grub/ files, and you will not be able to boot.

If you prefer to have your original Linux partition remain in control of GRUB, you can restore the MBR boot code from backup, or you can [[#How To Set Grub's Root Partition|change GRUB's root partition]].  If using GRUB v1, then add an entry to your menu.lst file (on the original Linux system - sda2 in this example) to boot the new Linux system.  Something like:

&lt;pre&gt;# Linux installation on /dev/sda5
title		Ubuntu (sda5)
root		(hd0,4)
kernel		/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda5 ro
initrd		/initrd.img
savedefault
boot&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that GRUB v1 numbers hard drives and partitions starting from 0, not 1.  So (hd0,4) is equivalent to /dev/sda5.

If you are using GRUB v2, simply update the menu with this command issued on your installed linux system, which should automatically find and add your installed OSes:
&lt;pre&gt;sudo update-grub&lt;/pre&gt;

Also note that when a partition is formated during installation, its UUID may change.  This may cause your old Linux system to complain during boot when it looks for the old UUID of the test partition.  If so, you need to edit your /etc/fstab file (on the old system) to either reflect the new UUID, or change to a /dev/xxx reference.  See [[#Using UUIDs|Using UUIDs]] for instructions.

===Scenario #5: Alternating Versions Of Linux===

Major upgrades of Linux come out every few months.  One method for using these upgrades is to install them to alternating partitions.  For example, you might install Linux version 6 to sda2.  Then install version 7 to sda5, leaving version 6 on sda2 intact.  Then, you can install version 8 on sda2, leaving version 7 on sda5 intact, etc.  This allows you to try out the new system install or upgrade while still having access to 'old reliable'.  As noted earlier, both installations can share a common swap partition.

If you prefer to avoid upgrades and simply do a fresh install when a new version comes out, this is extremely easy.  You simply install the new version to the free partition.  This will also install GRUB, and will make the new Linux partition the GRUB root partition.  Your computer will boot into the new installation by default, but this can easily be modified by editing GRUB's configuration (on the new partition).  You can work on setting up the new installation at your leisure while still having access to your old system.  (If you have servers running, you may want to assign the new installation a different IP address while you are working on it to distinguish it from the old system.)

If you prefer to work with upgrades, there are a few extra steps.  First, make a copy of your old system partition onto the new partition.  This is as simple as making a backup file of the partition and restoring it to the new partition.  (Be sure to [[#Using UUIDs|generate a new UUID]] for the copy partition, if applicable.)  Next, make the new partition bootable by adding an entry to GRUB's menu (on the old partition).  Finally, update /etc/fstab on the new partition so that the system knows where to find its root filesystem and other mountable partitions.  You can now boot into two mirror copies of your Linux system.

Next, boot into the copy system and perform the upgrade, testing it as you like.  If it is functional, you can make it your primary system simply by editing GRUB's configuration (on the old partition) to make it the default boot partition.  The old partition may be left as a backup.

What you do with the /home folder during these alternating installs is a matter of preference.  My suggestion is to copy the /home folder to the new partition, thereby creating two parallel /home folders.  Or, you can have both installations share a common /home folder, but this may cause problems.

Once you have the two parallel systems installed, you can mount their filesystems from within each system to copy relevant files from one system to the other.  You can also compare two versions of system files, etc.  To offer maximum protection to your old installation, only mount its filesystems as readonly in the new system.

The bonus of alternating Linux installs is that you also always have a reliable backup system installed on your computer.

===Scenario #6: Virus Infection===

A virus may infect the system files, the /home folder (Linux), and the MBR.  Unless you know where the virus is located, it is wise to restore the system partition(s), the MBR boot code, and optionally restore the /home folder using a backup which you know was made prior to infection.  It is unusual for a virus to hop from one OS partition to another, but not impossible.  When in doubt, restore them all.

You should also scan your user data partition for viruses.

===Scenario #7: New Hard Drive===

The first thing to address is partitioning.  You should create the partition table from scratch using a tool like cfdisk (available on SystemRescueCD).  Or, if the new drive is the identical size of the old drive, you can recreate the partition table from backup using sfdisk.  If using the Partimage method for your backups, be sure to make your system partitions at least as large as the old partitions, or you will not be able to restore them (FSArchiver does not have this limitation, but the partition still needs to be large enough to hold all the data in the backup).  Also, it is most convenient to use the same partition numbers for the installed systems so that GRUB can find them.  Otherwise, you may need to update GRUB's configuration, change the fstab file(s), and edit Windows boot manager files to reflect the new partition numbers.

Now restore the system partitions, and if desired, /home folder.  If /home is located on a separate partition, you must restore this as well.  If your old hard drive failed, then you will need your backups which you saved to DVD or another drive (you did archive your backups to another drive, right??)

Once your partitions are restored, restore the MBR boot code (boot code only! NOT the full MBR which contains the old partition table).  Alternatively, you can [[#How To Set Grub's Root Partition|install GRUB to the MBR]].  (Note: If you used FSArchiver to restore the partition containing GRUB's root (/boot/grub/), you must [[#How To Set Grub's Root Partition|install GRUB to the MBR]] due to the movement of the files on the disk.)

If you have changed the partition numbers of the installed systems, you may need to update GRUB's configuration, change the fstab file(s), and edit Windows boot manager files to reflect the new partition numbers.  If you have changed the partition numbers of Windows, be sure to consult [[#Backing Up And Restoring The Boot Process|Backing Up And Restoring The Boot Process]] which details other Windows boot issues.

===Scenario #8: Moving A System To Another Partition===

You may want to move an installed OS to another partition, a larger partition, or onto a partition on a different drive.  (Note: Moving Windows to a second drive or to an extended partition can be problematic for booting - keep Windows on a primary partition of the first hard drive.)

The first step is to prepare your new partition, and ensure that it is at least as large as the old partition.  (If it is smaller, you will not be able to restore using Partimage.)  Then, restore to the new partition using the backup file.

Next, you will need to address the boot process.

If the new partition is on a primary partition of the same drive, and you have a generic MBR which boots the bootable partition, then [[#How To Set The Boot Partition|change which partition is marked 'bootable']].

If you have GRUB in the MBR, and you moved GRUB's root (/boot/grub/), you will need to [[#How To Set Grub's Root Partition|change GRUB's root partition]].

If the new partition is on a different drive and contains GRUB's root, you may need to make the new drive bootable by restoring the boot code of the MBR from the old drive, or by [[#How To Set Grub's Root Partition|changing GRUB's root partition]].  You may also need to change the BIOS boot device priority or drive numbering, or the BIOS will continue to boot the old drive's MBR.  In short, when you're done, the MBR of the boot drive must contain boot code (GRUB, etc), and GRUB must be set to the correct root partition to find its /boot/grub/ files.

If using GRUB, you will also need to update GRUB's configuration to reflect the new location of the moved OS (with GRUB v1, edit the entry in the /boot/grub/menu.lst file; with GRUB v2, run update-grub).  To edit files, you can use the nano editor on SystemRescueCD (once you have mounted the file's location).

As your new partitions may have different UUIDs or device designations, or two partitions may now have identical UUIDs, you may need to change /etc/fstab entries to reflect the new locations in order for your Linux OS to boot.  You can change outdated UUIDs to /dev/xxx if necessary.  Most importantly, fstab tells Linux where its root filesystem (/) is located.   See [[#Using UUIDs|Using UUIDs]] for instructions.

If you have changed the partition numbers of Windows, you may need to edit Windows boot manager files to reflect the new partition numbers.  Also, be sure to consult [[#Backing Up And Restoring The Boot Process|Backing Up And Restoring The Boot Process]] which details other Windows boot issues.


==How To Burn A Bootable DVD Containing Backup Files And Tools==

It is possible and very simple to burn a DVD which includes the bootable SystemRescueCD system on it, as well as one or more backup files for your partitions.  You can do this from any Linux installation which includes the growisofs program (which is common), including SystemRescueCD.

Assuming the SystemRescueCD iso file is located in /user/, and your backup files are located in the folder /user/backups/

&lt;pre&gt;# Where /dev/hdc is your DVD-burner - change if necessary
growisofs -Z /dev/hdc=/user/systemrescuecd-x86-1.3.5.iso
growisofs -M /dev/hdc -J -R /user/backups/&lt;/pre&gt;

Obviously there must be ample space on the DVD for the iso contents as well as the backup files in /user/backups/ for this to be successful.

==How To Install SystemRescueCD On A Hard Drive==

It is also very simple to make a hard drive partition a bootable SystemRescueCD system.  This alleviates the need to put the CD in the drive in order to perform system maintenance.  In the example partitioning, the backup partition would be an ideal candidate.

The only requirements are that the partition has 200MB free, and that it use one of the standard filesystems supported by SystemRescueCD.  You can even use a partition which has another bootable system on it.  (The partition can be booted two different ways depending on the GRUB menu entry selected.)

The procedure is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;# Mount the iso file
sudo mkdir /mnt/iso
sudo mount -o loop /user/systemrescuecd-x86-1.3.5.iso /mnt/iso&lt;/pre&gt;
(Alternatively, you can simply insert the SystemRescueCD in the CDROM drive so that the files can be read directly from it.)

Next, create a folder on the destination partition, in this example /dev/sda6, and copy the relevant files to this folder (/sysrcd).  Note that some of the files are located in the isolinux sub-folder, but they should all be copied without directory structure to /sysrcd.

&lt;pre&gt;sudo mkdir /mnt/sda6
sudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt/sda6
sudo mkdir /mnt/sda6/sysrcd
sudo cp /mnt/iso/sysrcd.dat /mnt/iso/sysrcd.md5 /mnt/iso/isolinux/initram.igz \
/mnt/iso/isolinux/rescuecd /mnt/iso/isolinux/rescue64 \
/mnt/iso/isolinux/altker32 /mnt/iso/isolinux/altker64 \
/mnt/sda6/sysrcd
umount /mnt/iso&lt;/pre&gt;

The hard drive partition /dev/sda6 is now bootable.  We just need to add an entry to GRUB's menu.

'''If using GRUB v1''', edit /boot/grub/menu.lst so it appears as a boot option...

&lt;pre&gt;title       SystemRescueCD-1.3.5 (sda6)
root        (hd0,5)
kernel      /sysrcd/rescuecd subdir=sysrcd setkmap=us
initrd      /sysrcd/initram.igz
savedefault
boot&lt;/pre&gt;

'''If using GRUB v2''', create a file named &quot;/etc/grub.d/51_my-sysrcd&quot; (or wherever your grub.d folder is located), and paste the following text into the file, modifying the &quot;set root&quot; line as needed:
&lt;pre&gt;#!/bin/sh

echo &quot;Adding SystemRescueCD&quot; &gt;&amp;2
cat &lt;&lt; EOF
menuentry &quot;SystemRescueCD-1.3.5 (sda6)&quot; {
set root=(hd0,6)
linux /sysrcd/rescuecd subdir=sysrcd setkmap=us
initrd /sysrcd/initram.igz
}
EOF&lt;/pre&gt;

Save that file, then run:
&lt;pre&gt;sudo chmod +x /etc/grub.d/51_my-sysrcd
sudo update-grub&lt;/pre&gt;

==Alternatives To Using SystemRescueCD==

In some situations, it may be more convenient not to use SystemRescueCD, although I do recommend keeping a CD copy on hand.

For example, if you have two Linux systems installed on your computer, you can install the Partimage or FSArchiver programs and use them from your installed systems to back up other, unmounted partitions.  This way you will not have to reboot to make some backups.  One limitation is that you cannot use Partimage to back up a mounted partition, so you cannot back up the booted system using the booted system.

Also, other live Linux CDs often include the Partimage program.  If they run successfully on your hardware, you can use these as a substitute for SystemRescueCD.  The advantage to SystemRescueCD is that it boots very quickly.  Some other live CDs are not so reliable or quick to use.

Other free tools include:

* [http://www.clonezilla.org/ Clonezilla]: based on DRBL, Partition Image, ntfsclone, and udpcast, it allows you to create backups and recover

* [http://www.pcinspector.de/Default.htm?language=1 PC Inspector Clonemaxx]: A no-frills simple method described in [http://www.wikihow.com/Back-up-Any-Hard-Drive How to Back Up Any Hard Drive]

I find being a part of this class and this book a honor and privilege.  I feel that teachers are today's inspiration for tomorrow.  Teachers have possess the power to make or to break a child's self-esteem and self-motivation.  Being a good teacher is something I strive to do because I realize what is being placed in my hands each and every day....our future!!!</text>

      <comment>/* Isolating DNA from Strawberries */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Isolating DNA from Strawberries==

Contrary to popular belief, DNA is not difficult to isolate.

This laboratory allows the students to isolate DNA from Strawberries in order to visualize DNA.

Why strawberries?

Strawberries are octoploid therefore they have a large amount of DNA.

Plus, I think that they smell nicer than onions.

===Before the lab===
*Put the 95% ethanol in the freezer.
*Make the extraction buffer.

===Extraction Buffer===
(I'm doing this from memory. When I find my notes I will put in the amounts that I actually used. Feel free to add to this if you find a buffer that works better, but this is very simple.)

:200 ml  Water  
:30 ml   Dish detergent
:1 g     Salt(sodium Chloride)
:0.1g    Meat tenderizer



===Explanation of Procedure===

1. The strawberries are mashed by hand in plastic bags.
We are physically breaking down the cell walls to make it easier to access the cell contents.

2. Soap is added to break down the cell and nuclear membranes.

3. The meat tenderizer contains proteases which break down nucleases in the cell which would degrade the DNA otherwise.

4. The ethanol precipitates the DNA so that it can be visualized. The colder the ethanol, the less it will dissolve in the water.

5. DNA is very long and therefore it can be spooled around a stick.


For an alternative procedure using sweet peas, see the University of Utah's How to extract DNA from anything living page. [http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/units/activities/extraction/]

&lt;big&gt;'''About Me'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt; 
Hello Everybody, I'm Sarah. I guess I will tell you a little about myself. I was born, raised and am still living in a small town in Southwest Virginia. I am 23 years old.  I am attending ODu through the teletechnet site at the Community College in the town where I live.  I love living in a small town and I love living in the mountains of southwest Virginia. I have traveled a lot. I have been to Europe and Canada, Along with Hawaii and many places in the continintal U.S. But there is still no place I would rather be.  I am working for a degree in Elemantary education and I can't wait to be teaching. I really believe teaching to be my true calling. It just feels right.

&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; 
My other interests include camping and fishing, cooking out, sitting around a campfire, really anything outdoors. I also love music. Although I enjoy and respect many forms of music, my favorites include country and bluegrass, I guess you can't grow up in the mountains without hearing and enjoying bluegrass music, my absolute favorite type of music. I especially like the traditional bluegrass tunes. My boyfriend and I sing in a bluegrass group and I am currently learning to play a mandolin. 


&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt; 
&lt;big&gt;'''I guess thats it about me. Now for my Teaching Philosophy.'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; 

My mother is a teacher and so were my aunts. I used to go with Mama to the school before the school year began and help her prepare for the year. Now, I have been employed as a substitute teacher. I have been around the education environment all my life. I have experienced different grade levels and different teacher’s methods of doing things. This has helped me in gathering ideas to form my own teaching philosophy.

&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt; 

There are many things that we must consider as educators. Everything that we do and everything we have in the classroom affects our students. Therefore considerable thought must be put into preparing a classroom and methods of teaching. A teacher must think about capturing attention, eliminating distractions, and making the classroom environment an appealing place to learn. 
The way that a classroom is set up and decorated is a very important part of the teaching philosophy.  The classroom is the first thing that a student sees when he or she comes to school for a new year and a new teacher. The classroom also gives the first impressions to parents and administrators. So what are the characteristics of a good classroom?  First of all, a classroom should be colorful. And not just any colors, bright colors. Bright colors capture the attention of student and also make the classroom more comfortable and welcoming. Nobody would like sitting in a room where plain white walls were all you had to look at all day. This would cause boredom in students and teachers alike.  Also around the room should be posters and pictures that reinforce what will be learned. 

&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; 

Another idea to consider is routine. So everything should be clearly marked and labeled. For example, students names on the desk,( lower grades) labels on where things go and there are others. So the desired classroom is one that is welcoming and bright but also instills a since of structure and order.
In what ways does the teacher insure that his/her classroom is an effective place to learn?  Things to consider when answering this question are teaching methods of course. Also, we need to consider discipline. For us to maintain order in our classroom we must have some discipline. But how much and the way it is administered is what is important in making a classroom an ideal place to learn.

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; 

So lets talk about the actual teacher and the teaching methods? What can we do as educators to insure that the students are learning in a way that is best for them? There are many ways that teacher can create an active learning environment. The key is to keep the students interested and motivated.  The most common way to do this is to keep changing the methods of teaching. Don’t simply stand at the front of the room and lecture. Be sure to get the students involved. Playing games, or doing activities and even something as simple as asking questions is and effective way of keeping attention.  Teachers of younger children sometimes have them move back and forth between desks and the “reading carpet” frequently. Teachers mainly do this because these younger students will get restless if they sit in one place for too long. The key to effective teaching is  acquiring motivation and eliminating distractions. The use of technology, which is quickly being integrated into classroom everywhere, can be another useful tool in an effective classroom.

&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt; 

As I have said, every classroom needs discipline. Without discipline the teacher could never get anything done. The rules and consequences need to be established at the beginning of the year or else the teacher loses control for the entire year. But how much discipline is needed?  It is not effective if a teacher spends more time yelling and disciplining students the teaching. Also, to much discipline stunts a students desire to learn. The biggest challenge to educators is finding the right balance between discipline and education.
 

&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt; 
&lt;big&gt;'''Well thats all.  Let me know what you think.  Have a great semester Ya'll!'''&lt;/big&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; 
&lt;big&gt;'''God Bless,'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Memory Management/Page}}

In every application, you must allocate new storage before you can use it, and then you must return all such storage to the operating system when you are finished. While some languages handle all of this for you, lower-level languages like C or C++ sometimes require more effort by the programmer to manage memory. There are several ways to do this: implicit and explicit.

Implicit memory allocation is memory that is allocated, typically on the system stack, by the compiler.  This occurs when you create a new variable:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
void my_func(void) {
  int x;
  char y;
  int z[25];
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, space is allocated on the system stack for the variables &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; when the function is called, and the space is reclaimed automatically when the function exits. 

{{info|For more information about memory allocated on the stack, see the relevant chapters in [[x86 Disassembly]]}}

Explicit memory allocation occurs through pointers, and calls to the memory management functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
void my_func(void) {
  int * z;
  z = (int *)malloc(25);
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, we still have variable &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; which is still being used as an array of 25 integers. However, this storage is not automatically reclaimed when the function exits. This has the added benefit that an array created this way can be returned from the function:

{|
|-
!RIGHT
!WRONG
|-
|&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
int *my_func(void) {
  int * x;
  x = (int *) malloc(25);
  return x;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
int *my_func(void) {
  int x[25];
  return x;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Why is one way right, and the other is wrong? The answer is scope: In the left example, the array is created on the heap, and the memory is not reclaimed after the function exits. This means that the memory can still be used even after the function returns. In the example on the right, however, the memory is allocated on the stack and disappears when the function exits. 

There are also many places where memory needs to be created in a size which is not known at compile-time. Consider a web browser that needs to allocate enough storage to store the downloaded HTML text of a webpage. Since webpages can be all different sizes, we can't possibly know the sizes of them all when we compile, we must allocate the storage at runtime with &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; or an equivalent.

Memory that is allocated on the stack and is fixed in size and scope is called '''static'''. Memory that uses &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; to be allocated at run time is called '''dynamic'''.

== Freeing Dynamic Memory ==

When you allocate memory from the heap using &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; or something similar, you obtain a pointer to allocated memory from the system. When you are done with it, you must free the memory, to return it back to the system. Failure to return all the memory that you allocate is called a '''memory leak'''. In C, you can free memory using the &lt;code&gt;free()&lt;/code&gt; function. 

== Problems with Memory Management ==

When you allocate memory, you must always be careful to release your allocated memory back to the system. Herein is the problem: if your system is complicated and needs to allocate many small chunks of memory, you need to be certain to free all those individual little chunks as well. This can be all the more difficult if you are in a dynamic situation where memory is being allocated and deallocated continuously, and memory chunks must stay available for random lengths of time.

To overcome these complications automatic memory manager systems, such as garbage collectors, can be employed to try to automate the memory allocations and deallocations.</text>

In this chapter, guidelines are presented for the avoidance of inefficient operations and for the preparation of source code for a possible optimization stage - all without jeopardizing code safety or maintainability.

Following these guidelines might result in no overall performance gain. But equally there is unlikely to be a performance loss.  The guidelines can therefore be applied without worrying about their impact on performance.
It is advisable always to follow these guidelines, even in code portions that have no particular efficiency requirements.

== [[Optimizing C++]] ==

Ciao, ti volevo chiedere per favore di collegare tra loro le pagine della traduzione del libro e quelle della versione italiana utilizzando gli [[:it:Aiuto:interlink|interwiki]]. È sufficiente che tu li inserisca solo su una delle due parti (it o en) poi così passo con il bot che provvederà a linkare anche la pagina dell'altra lingua. Ciao! --[[User:Ramac|Ramac]] ([[User talk:Ramac|talk]]) 17:52, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

== reply: Conventions ==

Well since you keep a static version I thought you would also like that the works evolved in a similar fashion (there were several post with proposals about this synchronization problem, dealing with translations, can't remember where) and even if you aren't very strict on it, keeping chapters matching will be similarly hard. I still think that you should make as evident as possible what your expectations are (books not similar to articles on Wikipedia), as author (several people don't see eye to eye with me on this point, author != editor ) you have already shaped the book and provided a specific flow to it, you would only be helping fellow editors and future authors to extend it in a given direction in a coordinated way. On the other hand I don't know if you consider the book as being in a finished state or near completion (adding a PDF static version is also possible).&lt;br&gt;
The actual problem with the C++ Programming book TOCs arouse because of the order of the sections, the problem is mostly moot now, I was just telling you that the talk page may not be the best place state your objectives/intentions, because it's volatile nature (the post can be deleted), making clear block against any BeBold action that would unilaterally violate them is your best defense against conflicting views, but that depends on the spirit you made the post in the first place. Were you asking for compliance, simply stating you wishes or opening a debate on the issue. I read it as the first.&lt;br&gt;
[[Optimizing C++#Preface|Preface]] and the [[Subject:C++]] are ok, take a look on the C++ Programming structure, the editors   TOC and specific guidelines we created for the book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:41, 2 June 2008 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
I also noticed that you started elaborating on some book conventions that was what I was leading to. Talk posts can be easily disregarded or overlooked. With a cleared structure you and the &quot;book community&quot; can reach a better understating on the needs and priorities...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:32, 4 June 2008 (UTC)

== [[Optimizing C++/Print Version]] ==

I have created a printable version for your book, which contains the text of all chapters (and some special formatting) on a single webpage for printing. The book is 43 pages long this way. If you create a nice cover page for the book, I will also try to create a PDF version for you. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:50, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

:I like that image, and I've taken the liberty of creating a title page for the book. To see the print version in all it's glory, go to this link [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Optimizing_C%2B%2B/Print_Version&amp;printable=yes] and select &quot;Print Preview&quot; in your browser. Now the book is registering in at 82 pages, so I must have calculated wrong yesterday. I have a little bit more detail work to do on the print version, and then I'll create a nice PDF for you. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:59, 14 June 2008 (UTC)

==[[Saylor.org's C++ Programming]]==

Hey there, I was looking at your C++ textbook and it looks great. Right now I'm working with the [http://www.saylor.org/about/ Saylor Foundation] to create a textbook that we can host and use in our C++ course on our website (which we offer for free to anybody online). We would love for you to check out [[Saylor.org's C++ Programming]] and give us some feedback or make some contributions! --[[User:Azin|Azin]] ([[User talk:Azin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Azin|contribs]]) 17:22, 6 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a linear space. A ''norm'' is a real-valued function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, with the notation &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \| = f(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, such that
*(i) &lt;math&gt;\|x + y\| \le \|x\| + \|y\|&lt;/math&gt; ([[w:triangular inequality]])
*(ii) &lt;math&gt;\|\lambda x\| = |\lambda| \|x\|&lt;/math&gt; for any scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
*(iii) &lt;math&gt;\|x\| = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

(ii) implies that &lt;math&gt;\|0\| = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This and (ii) then implies &lt;math&gt;0 = \|x-x\| \le \|x\| + \|-x\| = 2\|x\|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; that is, norms are always non-negative. A linear space with a norm is called a ''normed space''. With the metric &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = \|x - y\|&lt;/math&gt; a normed space is a metric space. Note that (i) implies that:
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\| \le \|x - y\| + \|y\|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|y\| \le \|x - y\| + \|x\|&lt;/math&gt;
and so: &lt;math&gt;| \|x\| - \|y\| | \le \|x - y\|&lt;/math&gt;. (So, the map &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto \|x\|&lt;/math&gt; is continuous; in fact, 1-Lipschitz continuous.)

A complete normed space is called a ''Banach space.'' While there is seemingly no prototypical example of a Banach space, we still give one example of a Banach space: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}(K)&lt;/math&gt;, the space of all continuous functions on a compact space &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, can be identified with a Banach space by introducing the norm:
:&lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\| = \sup_K |\cdot|&lt;/math&gt;
It is a routine exercise to check that this is indeed a norm. The completeness holds since, from real analysis, we know that a uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous. In concrete spaces like this one, one can directly show the completeness. More often than that, however, we will see that the completeness is a necessary condition for some results (especially, reflexivity), and thus the space has to be ''complete''. The matter will be picked up in the later chapters.

Another example of Banach spaces, which is more historical, is an &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; space; that is, the space of convergent series. (The geometric properties of &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; spaces will be investigated in Chapter 4.) It is clear that &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; is a linear space, since the sum of two p-convergent series is again p-convergent. That the &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; norm is in fact a norm follows from

{{Functional Analysis/theorem
|label=norm dual lemma
|theorem=Lemma
|claim=If &lt;math&gt;\|x\|_p &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\|_p = \sup_{\|y\|_q = 1} |\sum x_j \overline{y_j}|&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;1/p + 1/q = 1&lt;/math&gt;
|proof=By Hölder's inequality,
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{\|y\|_q=1} |\sum x_j \overline{y_j}| \le \|x\|_p&lt;/math&gt;
Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;\|x\|_p = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then taking &lt;math&gt;y_j = \overline{x_j}|x_j|^{p-2}&lt;/math&gt; we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum x_j \overline{y_j} = \sum |x_j|^p = 1&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\|y\|_q = (\sum |x_j|^{(p-1)q})^{1/q} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
since &lt;math&gt;p = (p-1)q&lt;/math&gt;. More generally, if &lt;math&gt;\|x\|_p \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;{x \over \|x\|_p} = \sup_{\|y\|_q = 1} |\sum x_j\overline{y_j}| {1 \over \|x\|_p}&lt;/math&gt;.
Since the identity is obvious when &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the proof is complete.}}

Now, it remains to show that an &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; space is complete. For that, let &lt;math&gt;x_k \in l_p&lt;/math&gt; be a Cauchy sequence. This means explicitly that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty |(x_k)_n - (x_j)_n|^2 \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n, m \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;
For each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, by completeness, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty} (x_k)_n&lt;/math&gt; exists and we denote it by &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be given. Since &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; is Cauchy, there is &lt;math&gt; N&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty |(x_k)_n - (x_j)_n|^2 &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k, j &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;
Then, for any &lt;math&gt;k &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty |(x_k)_n - y_n|^2 = \sup_{m \ge 1} \sum_{n=1}^m |(x_k)_n - y_n|^2 = \sup_{m \ge 1} \lim_{j \to \infty} \sum_{n=1}^m |(x_k)_n - (x_j)_n|^2 &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, &lt;math&gt;x_k \to y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;y = \sum_{n=1}^\infty y_n&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is in fact in &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\|y\|_2 \le \|y - x_n\|_2 + \|x_n\|_2 &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;. (We stress the fact that the completeness of &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; spaces come from the fact that the field of complex numbers is complete; in other words, &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; spaces may fail to be complete if the base field is not complete.) &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; is also separable; i.e., it has a countable dense subset. This follows from the fact that &lt;math&gt; l_p&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a union of subspaces with dimensions 1, 2, ..., which are separable. (TODO: need more details.)

We define the ''operator norm'' of a continuous linear operator &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; between normed spaces &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\|f\|&lt;/math&gt;, by
:&lt;math&gt;\|f\| = \sup_{\|x\|_{\mathcal{X}} \le 1} \|f(x)\|_{\mathcal{Y}}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a linear operator from a normed space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; to a normed space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt;.
* (i) &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if there is a constant &lt;math&gt;C &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\|Tx\| \le C\|x\|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* (ii) &lt;math&gt;\|f\| = \inf \{&lt;/math&gt; any &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; as in (i) &lt;math&gt;\} = \sup_{\|x\|=1} \|f(x)\|&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; has nonzero element. (Recall that the inf of the empty set is &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.)
Proof: If &lt;math&gt;\|T\| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\|T(x_n - x)\|_\mathcal{Y} \le \|T\| \|x_n - x\|_\mathcal{X} \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
as &lt;math&gt;x_n \to x&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. Conversely, suppose &lt;math&gt;\|T\| = \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Then we can find &lt;math&gt;x_n \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\|x_n\|_\mathcal{X} \le 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|Tx_n\| \ge n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;{x_n \over n} \to 0&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;\left\| T \left({x_n \over n} \right) \right\| \not\to 0&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is not continuous. The proof of (i) is complete. For (ii), see [[w:operator norm]] for now. (TODO: write an actual proof). &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

It is clear that an addition and a scalar multiplication are both continuous. (Use a sequence to check this.) Since the inverse of an addition is again addition, an addition is also an open mapping. Ditto to nonzero-scalar multiplications. In other words, translations and dilations of open (resp. closed) sets are again open (resp. closed).

Not all linear operators are continuous. Take the linear operator defined by &lt;math&gt;D(P)= XP'&lt;/math&gt; on the normed vector space of polynomials &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}[X]&lt;/math&gt; with the suprenum norm &lt;math&gt;\|P \|_{\infty}=\sup_{x\in [0,1]} |P(x)|&lt;/math&gt; ; since &lt;math&gt;D(X^n)=nX^n &lt;/math&gt;, the unit ball is not bounded and hence this linear operator is not continuous.

Notice that the kernel of this non continuous linear operator is closed: &lt;math&gt;\ker D=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;. However, when a linear operator is of finite rank, the closeness of the kernel is in fact synonymous to continuity. To see this, we start with the special case of linear forms.

'''2 Theorem''' ''A (non null) linear form is continuous iff it's kernel is closed.
:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; continuous &lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow \ker T=\overline{\ker T}&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
If the linear form &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; on a normed vector space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;  is continuous, then it's kernel is closed since it's the continuous inverse image of the closed set &lt;math&gt;\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, suppose a linear form &lt;math&gt;T:X\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is not continuous. then by the previous theorem, 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall c&gt;0,\exists x(c) s.t.|Tx(c)|\geqslant c\|x(c)\|&lt;/math&gt; so in particular, one can define a sequence &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|Tx_n|\geqslant n\|x_n\|&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Then denote: 
:&lt;math&gt;u_n:=\frac{x_n}{|x_n|}&lt;/math&gt;, one has defined a unit normed sequence (&lt;math&gt;|u_n|=1&lt;/math&gt;) s.t. &lt;math&gt;|Tu_n|\geqslant n&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, denote 
:&lt;math&gt;v_n:=\dfrac{u_n}{|Tu_n|}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt; \frac{|u_n|}{|Tu_n|}  \leqslant \dfrac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, one can define a sequence that converges &lt;math&gt;\{v_n\}\to 0&lt;/math&gt;  whilst &lt;math&gt;|Tv_n|= 1&lt;/math&gt;. 
Now, since &lt;math&gt;\ker T\neq X&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Ta\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the sequence of general term converges 
:&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{a-v_n Ta}_{\in \ker T}\to a\notin \ker T&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\ker T&lt;/math&gt; is not closed. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, if the linear form is continuous and the kernel is dense, then &lt;math&gt;\ker T=\overline{\ker T}=X\Rightarrow f=0&lt;/math&gt;, hence a continuous &amp; non null linear has a non dense kernel, and hence a linear form with a dense kernel is whether null or non continuous so a non null continuous linear form with a dense kernel is not continuous, and a linear form with a dense kernel is not continuous.

''2 Corollary''' &quot; A non null linear form on a normed vector space is not continuous iff it's kernel is dense.
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\ker T}=X \Leftrightarrow T&lt;/math&gt; is not continuous&quot; &lt;br/r&gt;

More generally, we have:
'''2 Theorem''' &quot; A non null linear operator of finite rank between normed vector spaces. then closeness of the null space is equivalent to continuity.&quot; &lt;br/r&gt;
Proof:  It remains to show that continuity implies closeness of the kernel. Suppose &lt;math&gt;T:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is not continuous. Denote &lt;math&gt;r:=\dim \mbox{Im } T&lt;/math&gt;; 

'''2 Lemma ''' ''If &lt;math&gt;T:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a linear operator between normed vector spaces, then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is of finite rank &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; iff there exists &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; independent  linear forms &lt;math&gt;(f_1,\dots,f_r)&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; independent vectors &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\dots,a_r)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Tx=a_1f_1(x)+\dots+a_rf_r(x)&lt;/math&gt;&quot; &lt;br/r&gt;
Proof: take a basis &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\dots,a_r)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Im }T&lt;/math&gt;, then from &lt;math&gt;Tx=\sum_{i=1}^r a_i y_i&lt;/math&gt;, one can define &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; mappings &lt;math&gt;f_i(x)=y_i&lt;/math&gt;. Unicity and linearity of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; implies linearity of the &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt;'s. Furthermore, the family &lt;math&gt;(f_1,\dots,f_r)&lt;/math&gt; of linear forms of &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt; is linearly independent: suppose not, then there exist a non zero family &lt;math&gt;(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_r)&lt;/math&gt; such that e.g. &lt;math&gt;f_1=\sum_{i=2}^r \alpha_if_i&lt;/math&gt; so 
:&lt;math&gt;Tx=\sum_{i=1}^r f_i(x)a_i=(\sum_{i=2}^r\alpha_if_i(x))a_1+\sum_{i=2}^r f_i(x)a_i=(\alpha_2 a_1+a_2)f_2(x)+\dots+(\alpha_n a_1+a_r)f_r(x)&lt;/math&gt; and the family &lt;math&gt;(\alpha_ia_1+a_i)_{i=2,\dots,r}&lt;/math&gt; spans &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Im }T&lt;/math&gt;, so  &lt;math&gt;\dim \mbox{Im }T=r-1&lt;/math&gt; which is a contradiction. Finally, one has a unique decomposition of a finite rank linear operator:
:&lt;math&gt;Tx=a_1f_1(x)+\dots a_r f_r(x)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f_i\in E^*&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Take &lt;math&gt;x\in \ker T\Rightarrow x\in \bigcap_{i=1}^r \ker f_i\subset \ker f_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Then there exists a vector subspace &lt;math&gt;H_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\ker f_i=\ker T \oplus H_i&lt;/math&gt;. Denote &lt;math&gt;T_i:H_i\to \mbox{Im}T&lt;/math&gt; the restriction of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;H_i&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;ker T_i=\{x\in H_i:T_i(x)\}=0=\ker T\cap H_i=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;, the linear operator &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; is injective so &lt;math&gt; \mbox{Im}T_i\subset \mbox{Im}T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_i &lt;/math&gt;  is of finite dimension, and this for all &lt;math&gt;i=1,\dots,r&lt;/math&gt;.

By hypothesis &lt;math&gt;\ker T&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Since the sum of this closed subspace and a subspace of finite dimension (&lt;math&gt;H_i&lt;/math&gt;) is closed (see lemma bellow), it follows that the kernel of each &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; linear forms &lt;math&gt;\ker f_i&lt;/math&gt; is closed, so the &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt;'s are all continuous by the first case and hence &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Lemma ''' ''The sum of subspace of finite dimension with a closed subspace is closed.&quot; &lt;br/r&gt;
Proof: by induction on the dimension.

Case &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;. Let's show that &lt;math&gt;H:=F+\mathbb{K}a&lt;/math&gt; is closed when &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is closed (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{K}&lt;/math&gt; is a complete field). Any &lt;math&gt;x\in H&lt;/math&gt; can be uniquely written as &lt;math&gt;x=y+\lambda a&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;y\in F&lt;/math&gt;. There exists a linear form &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; s.t. &lt;math&gt;x=y+L(x)a&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is closed in &lt;math&gt;(X,\|\cdot\|)&lt;/math&gt; so in &lt;math&gt;(H,\|\cdot\|)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous by the first case.
Take a convergente sequence &lt;math&gt;{x_n}\to x\in E&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. He have &lt;math&gt;x_n=y_n+L(x_n)a&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;y_n\in F&lt;/math&gt;. Since the sequence &lt;math&gt;{x_n}&lt;/math&gt; is convergente, then it si Cauchy, so it's continuous image &lt;math&gt;{L(x_n)}&lt;/math&gt; is also Cauchy. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is complete, then &lt;math&gt;{L(x_n)}\to \lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the sequence &lt;math&gt;{y_n}&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;x-\lambda a&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is closed, then &lt;math&gt;x-\lambda a\in F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in H&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is closed.

Suppose the result holds for all subspaces of dimension &lt;math&gt;\leqslant p&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;  be a subspace of dimension &lt;math&gt;p+1&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\dots,a_{p+1})&lt;/math&gt; be a basis of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;H:=F+\bigoplus_{i=1}^p \mathbb{K}a_i + \mathbb{K}a_{p+1}&lt;/math&gt; and concludes easily.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''Any linear operator on a normed vector space of finite dimension onto a normed vector space is continuous.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Since  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is of finite dimension, then any linear operator is of finite rank. Then as &lt;math&gt;\dim \ker T + \dim \mbox{Im}T=\dim X&lt;/math&gt; holds, it comes that the null space is of finite dimension, so is closed (any &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{K}&lt;/math&gt; vector subspace of finite dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{K}^n&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{K}&lt;/math&gt; is a complete field), so the subspace is complete and closed). Then one applies the previous theorem.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;



'''2 Lemma (Riesz)''' ''A normed space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional if and only if its closed unit ball is compact.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;T: \mathbf{C}^n \to X&lt;/math&gt; be a linear vector space isomorphism. Since &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has closed kernel, arguing as in the proof of the preceding theorem, we see that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. By the same reasoning &lt;math&gt;T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. It follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\{ x \in \mathcal{X} | \|x\| \le 1 \} \subset T \{ y \in \mathbf{C}^n | \|y\| \le \|T^{-1}\| \}&lt;/math&gt;
In the above, the left-hand side is closed, and the right-hand is a continuous image of a closed ball, which is compact. Hence, the closed unit ball is a subset of a compact set and thus compact. Now, the converse. If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is not finite dimensional, we can construct a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;1 = \|x_j\| \le \|x_j - \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} a_k x_k\|&lt;/math&gt; for any sequence of scalars &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, in particular, &lt;math&gt;\|x_j - x_k\| \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j, k&lt;/math&gt;. (For the details of this argument, see : [[w:Riesz%27s_lemma]] for now) &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''Every finite-dimensional normed space is a Banach space.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; be a Cauchy sequence. Since it is bounded, it is contained in some closed ball, which is compact. &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; thus has a convergent subsequence and so &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; itself converges. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''A normed space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional if and only if every linear operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; defined on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Identifying the range of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;, we can write:
:&lt;math&gt;Tx = (f_1(x), f_2(x), ... f_n(x))&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f_1, ... f_n&lt;/math&gt; are linear functionals. The dimensions of the kernels of &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; are finite. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; all have complete and thus closed kernels. Hence, they are continuous and so &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. For the converse, we need Axiom of Choice. (TODO: complete the proof.) &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

The ''graph'' of any function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;\{ (x, f(x)) | x \in E \}&lt;/math&gt;. A continuous function between metric spaces has closed graph. In fact, suppose &lt;math&gt;(x_j, f(x_j)) \to (x, y)&lt;/math&gt;. By continuity, &lt;math&gt;f(x_j) \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt;; in other words, &lt;math&gt;y = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; is in the graph of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. It follows (in the next theorem) that a continuous linear operator with closed graph has closed domain. (Note the continuity here is a key; we will shortly study a linear operator that has closed graph but has non-closed domain.)

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous densely defined linear operator between Banach spaces. Then its domain is closed; i.e., &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is actually defined everywhere.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
Suppose &lt;math&gt;f_j \to f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Tf_j&lt;/math&gt; is defined for every &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., the sequence &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; is in the domain of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Since
:&lt;math&gt;\| Tf_j - Tf_k \| \le \|T\| \|f_j - f_k\| \to 0&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;T f_j&lt;/math&gt; is Cauchy. It follows that &lt;math&gt;(f_j, Tf_j)&lt;/math&gt; is Cauchy and, by completeness, has limit &lt;math&gt;(g, Tg)&lt;/math&gt; since the graph of ''T'' is closed. Since &lt;math&gt;f = g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Tf&lt;/math&gt; is defined; i.e., &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is in the domain of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem is frequently useful in application. Suppose we wish to prove some linear formula. We first show it holds for a function with compact support and of varying smoothness, which is usually easy to do because the function vanishes on the boundary, where much of complications reside. Because of th linear nature in the formula, the theorem then tells that the formula is true for the space where the above functions are dense.

We shall now turn our attention to the consequences of the fact that a complete metric space is a Baire space. They tend to be more significant than results obtained by directly appealing to the completeness. Note that not every normed space that is a Baire space is a Banach space.

'''2 Theorem (open mapping theorem)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; be Banach spaces. If &lt;math&gt;T: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous linear surjection, then it is an open mapping; i.e., it maps open sets to open sets.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;B(r) = \{ x \in \mathcal{X}; \|x\| &lt; r \}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is surjective, &lt;math&gt;\cup_{n=1}^\infty T(B(n)) = T(\cup_{n=1}^\infty B(n)) = T(X) = Y&lt;/math&gt;. Then by Baire's Theorem, some &lt;math&gt;B(k)&lt;/math&gt; contains an interior point; thus, it is a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''If &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{X}, \|\cdot\|_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{X}, \|\cdot\|_2)&lt;/math&gt; are Banach spaces, then the norms &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_2&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent; i.e., each norm is dominated by the other.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;I: (\mathcal{X}, \|\cdot\|_1 + \|\cdot\|_2) \to (\mathcal{X}, \|\cdot\|_1)&lt;/math&gt; be the identity map. Then we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\| I \cdot \|_1 = \|\cdot\|_1 \le (\|\cdot\|_1 + \|\cdot\|_2)&lt;/math&gt;.
This is to say, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. Since Cauchy sequences apparently converge in the norm &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_1 + \|\cdot\|_2&lt;/math&gt;, the open mapping theorem says that the inverse of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is also continuous, which means explicitly:
:&lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_1 + \|\cdot\|_2 = \|I^{-1} \cdot\|_1 + \|I^{-1} \cdot\|_2 \le \|I^{-1}\| \|\cdot\|_1&lt;/math&gt;.
By the same argument we can show that &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_1 + \|\cdot\|_2&lt;/math&gt; is dominated by 
&lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{X}, \| \cdot \|_\mathcal{X})&lt;/math&gt; be a Banach space with dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Then the norm &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|_\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the standard Euclidean norm:
:&lt;math&gt;|(x_1, ... x_n)|^2 = \sum_j |x_j|^2&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''If &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous linear operator between Banach spaces with closed range, then there exists a &lt;math&gt;K &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;y \in \operatorname{im}(T)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\|x\| \le K\|y\|&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;Tx = y&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: This is immediate once we have the notion of a quotient map, which we now define as follows.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be a closed subspace of a normed space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. The quotient space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} / \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is a normed space with norm:
:&lt;math&gt;\|\pi(x)\| = \inf \{ \|x + m\|; m \in \mathcal{M} \}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\pi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X} / \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is a canonical projection. That &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt; is a norm is obvious except for the triangular inequality. But since
:&lt;math&gt;\|\pi(x + y)\| \le \|x+m\| + \|y+n\|&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;m, n \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking inf over &lt;math&gt;m, n&lt;/math&gt; separately we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\|\pi(x + y)\| \le \|\pi(x)\| + \|\pi(y)\|&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose, further, that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is also a commutative algebra and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} / \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; becomes a quotient algebra. In fact, as above, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\|\pi(x)\pi(y)\| = \|\pi((x+m)(y+n))\| \le \|x+m\|\|y+n\|&lt;/math&gt;,
for all &lt;math&gt;m, n \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism. Taking inf completes the proof.

So, the only nontrivial question is the completeness. It turns out that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} / \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is a Banach space (or algebra) if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is Banach space (or algebra). In fact, suppose
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \|\pi(x_n)\| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;
Then we can find a sequence &lt;math&gt;y_n \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \|x_n + y_n\| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;
By completeness,  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n + y_n&lt;/math&gt; converges, and since &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \pi(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; converges then. The completeness now follows from:

'''2 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a normed space. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is complete (thus a Banach space) if and only if''
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \|x_n\| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; ''implies'' &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n&lt;/math&gt; ''converges.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) We have:
:&lt;math&gt;\| \sum_{n=k}^{k+m} x_n \| \le  \sum_{n=k}^{k+m} \|x_n\|&lt;/math&gt;.
By hypothesis, the right-hand side goes to 0 as &lt;math&gt;n, m \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. By completeness, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n&lt;/math&gt; converges. Conversely, suppose &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence. Thus, for each &lt;math&gt;j = 1, 2, ...&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an index &lt;math&gt;k_j&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\| x_n - x_m \| &lt; 2^{-j}&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;n, m \ge k_j&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;x_{k_0} = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^\infty \| x_{k_{j+1}} - x_{k_j} \| &lt; 2&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, by assumption we can get the limit &lt;math&gt;x = \sum_{j=0}^\infty x_{k_{j+1}} - x_{k_j}&lt;/math&gt;, and since
:&lt;math&gt;\| x_{n_k} - x \| = \| \sum_{j=1}^n x_{k_{j+1}} - x_{k_j} - x \| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;,
we conclude that &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; has a subsequence converging to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; thus, it converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

The next result is arguably the most important theorem in the theory of Banach spaces. (At least, it is used the most frequently in application.)

'''2 Theorem (closed graph theorem)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; be Banach spaces, and &lt;math&gt;T: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; a linear operator. The following are equivalent.''
* ''(i) &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.''
* ''(ii) If &lt;math&gt;x_j \to 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Tx_j&lt;/math&gt; is convergent, then &lt;math&gt;Tx_j \to 0&lt;/math&gt;.''
* ''(iii) The graph of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is closed.''
Proof: That (i) implies (ii) is clear. To show (iii), suppose &lt;math&gt;(x_j, Tx_j)&lt;/math&gt; is convergent in &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; converges to some &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x_j - x_0 \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Tx_j - Tx&lt;/math&gt; is convergent. Thus, if (ii) holds, &lt;math&gt;T(x_j - x) \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, to prove (iii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (i), we note that Corollary 2.something gives the inequality:
:&lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\| + \|T\cdot\| \le K \|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt;
since ''by hypothesis'' the norm in the left-hand side is complete. Hence, if &lt;math&gt;x_j \to x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;Tx_j \to Tx&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Note that when the domain of a linear operator is not a Banach space (e.g., just dense in a Banach space), the condition (ii) is not sufficient for the graph of the operator to be closed. (It is not hard to find an example of this in other fields, but the reader might want to construct one himself as an exercise.)
&lt;!--When &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional (so in particular when &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is linear functional), the completeness of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be relaxed from the theorem.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a normed spaces. If a linear operator &lt;math&gt;T: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; has closed graph, then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
It suffices to show that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. For that end, suppose this is not the case; i.e., there exists a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n \to 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\|T(x_n)  - x_n\| \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;. Since the sequence &lt;math&gt;T x_n&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, thanks to the linearity, it has a convergent subsequence, say, &lt;math&gt;Tx_{n_k} \to y&lt;/math&gt;. Since the graph of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is closed, &lt;math&gt;(x_{n_k}, Tx_{n_k}) \to (0, T(0))&lt;/math&gt;. So, &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This contradicts that &lt;math&gt;\|T(x_n)  - x_n\| \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;

Finally, note that an injective linear operator has closed graph if and only if its inverse is closed, since the map &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2) \mapsto x_2, x_1&lt;/math&gt; sends closed sets to closed sets.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{X}_j, \|\cdot\|_j)&lt;/math&gt; be Banach spaces. Let &lt;math&gt;T: \mathcal{X}_1 \to \mathcal{X}_2&lt;/math&gt; be a closed densely defined operator and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a linear operator with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dom}(T) \subset \operatorname{dom}(S)&lt;/math&gt;.

Proof:
Suppose &lt;math&gt;\|u_j - u\|_1 + \|(T + S)u_j - f\|_2 \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\|T(u_j - u_k)\| \le \|(T + S)(u_j - u_k)\| + a \|T(u_j - u_k)\| + b\|u_j - u_k\|&lt;/math&gt;
Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;(1 - a) \|T(u_j - u_k)\| \le \|(T + S)(u_j - u_k)\| + b\|u_j - u_k\|&lt;/math&gt;
By hypothesis, the right-hand side goes to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;j, k \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is closed, &lt;math&gt;(u_j, Tu_j)&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;(u, Tu)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, with &lt;math&gt;a = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the hypothesis of the theorem is fulfilled, if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

When &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; are normed spaces, by &lt;math&gt;L(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})&lt;/math&gt; we denote the space of all continuous linear operators from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2 Theorem''' ''If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; is complete, then every Cauchy sequence &lt;math&gt;T_n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})&lt;/math&gt; converges to a limit &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|T\| = \lim_{n \to \infty}\|T_n\|&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;L(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})&lt;/math&gt; is complete, then so is ''Y''.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;T_n&lt;/math&gt; be a Cauchy sequence in operator norm. For each &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, since
:&lt;math&gt;\|T_n(x) - T_m(x)\| \le \|T_n - T_m\|\|x\| &lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; is complete, there is a limit &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to which &lt;math&gt;T_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; converges. Define &lt;math&gt;T(x) = y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is linear since the limit operations are linear. It is also continuous since &lt;math&gt;\|T(x)\| \le \sup_n \|T_n\|\|x\|&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \|T_n - T\| = \sup_{\|x\| \le 1} \|\lim_{n \to \infty} T_n(x) - T(x)\|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| \|T^n\| - \|T\| | \le \|T^n - T\| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. (TODO: a proof for the converse.) &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem (uniform boundedness principle)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; be a family of continuous functions &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a normed linear space. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;M \subset X&lt;/math&gt; is non-meager and that:
:&lt;math&gt;\sup \{ \|f(x)\| : f \in \mathcal{F} \} &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x \in M&lt;/math&gt;
It then follows: there is some &lt;math&gt;G \subset X&lt;/math&gt; open and such that 
:(a) &lt;math&gt;\sup \{ \|f(x)\| : f \in \mathcal{F}, x \in G \} &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;
If we assume in addition that each member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a linear operator and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a normed linear space, then
:(b) &lt;math&gt;\sup \{ \|f\| : f \in \mathcal{F} \} &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;E_j = \cap_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \{ x \in X ; \|f(x)\| \le j \}&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence. By hypothesis, &lt;math&gt;M \subset \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty E_j&lt;/math&gt; and each &lt;math&gt;E_j&lt;/math&gt; is closed since &lt;math&gt;\{ x \in X ; \|f(x)\| &gt; j\}&lt;/math&gt; is open by continuity. It then follows that some &lt;math&gt;E_N&lt;/math&gt; has an interior point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;; otherwise, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; fails to be non-meager. Hence, (a) holds. To show (b), making additional assumptions, we can find an open ball &lt;math&gt;B = B(2r, y) \subset E_N&lt;/math&gt;. It then follows: for any &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\|x\| = 1&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\|f(x)\| = r^{-1}\|f(rx + y) - f(y)\| \le 2 r^{-1} N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

A family &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; of linear operators is said to be ''equicontinuous'' if given any neighborhood &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we can find a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;f(V) \subset W&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;f \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;

The conclusion of the theorem, therefore, means that the family satisfying the hypothesis of the theorem is equicontinuous.

If &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is separately continuous (i.e., the function is continuous when all but one variables are fixed) and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; is complete, then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: For each &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\sup \{ \|T(x, y)\|_\mathcal{Z}; \|x\|_\mathcal{X} \le 1 \} = \|T(\cdot, y)\|&lt;/math&gt;
where the right-hand side is finite by continuity. Hence, the application of the principle of uniform boundedness to the family &lt;math&gt;\{ T(x, \cdot); \|x\|_\mathcal{X} \le 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; shows the family is equicontinuous. That is, there is &lt;math&gt;K &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that:

The theorem now follows since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Since scalar multiplication is a continuous operation in normed spaces, the corollary says, in particular, that every linear operator on finite dimensional normed spaces is continuous. The next is one more example of the techniques discussed so far.

Then there is a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\|y - x\| \ge \delta&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. Define a linear functional &lt;math&gt;z(y + \lambda x) = \lambda&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and scalars &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;\lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;-\lambda^{-1} y \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;|z(y + \lambda x)| = |\lambda| \delta^{-1} \delta \le \delta^{-1} |\lambda||\lambda^{-1} y + x\| = \|y + \lambda x\|&lt;/math&gt;.
Since the inequality holds for &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt; as well, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. Hence, in view of the Hahn-Banach theorem, &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; while we still have &lt;math&gt;z = 0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z(x) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Here is a classic application.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; be Banach spaces, &lt;math&gt;T:\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; be a linear operator. If &lt;math&gt;x_n \to 0&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;(z \circ T) x_n \to 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;x_n \to 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Tx_n \to y&lt;/math&gt;. For every &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;, by hypothesis and the continuity of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \lim_{n \to \infty} z (T x_n) = z (y)&lt;/math&gt;.
Now, by the preceding corollary &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt; and the continuity follows from the closed graph theorem. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a Banach space.
*''(i) Given &lt;math&gt;E \subset \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is bounded if and only if &lt;math&gt;\sup_E |f| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;''
*''(ii) Given &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Proof: (i) By continuity,
:&lt;math&gt;\sup \{ |f(x)|; x \in E \} \le \|f\| \sup_E \|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt;.
This proves the direct part. For the converse, define &lt;math&gt;T_x f = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \in E, f \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;. By hypothesis
:&lt;math&gt;|T_x f| \le \sup_E |f|&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;|T_x f| \le K \|f\|&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in E, f \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, in view of Theorem 2.something, for &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\| = \sup \{ |f(x)|; f \in \mathcal{X}^*, \|f\|\le 1 \} \le K&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous since its domain is finite-dimensional, and so by the Hahn-Banach theorem we could extend the domain of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in such a way we have &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. Corollary''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{X}, \|\cdot\|)&lt;/math&gt; be Banach, &lt;math&gt;f_j \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \subset \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; dense and linear.

Proof: Since &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; is Cauchy, it is bounded. This shows the direct part. To show the converse, let &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;y_j \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;|f_j(x)| \le |f_j(x - y_j)| + |f_j(y_j)| \le (\sup_j \|f_j\|) \|x - y_j\| + |f_j(y_j)|&lt;/math&gt;
By denseness, we can take &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\|y_j - x\| \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous linear operator into a Banach space. If &lt;math&gt;\| I - T \| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the identity operator, then the inverse &lt;math&gt;T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; exists, is continuous and can be written by:
:&lt;math&gt;T^{-1} (x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left( I - T \right)^k (x)&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the range of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.
Proof: For &lt;math&gt;n \ge m&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\| \sum_{k=m}^n \left( I - T \right)^k (x) \| \le \|x\| \sum_{k=m}^n \left \| I - T \right \| ^k&lt;/math&gt;.
Since the series is geometric by hypothesis, the right-hand side is finite. Let &lt;math&gt;S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \left( I - T \right)^k&lt;/math&gt;. By the above, each time &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is fixed, &lt;math&gt;S_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence and the assumed completeness implies that the sequence converges to the limit, which we denote by &lt;math&gt;S(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Since for each &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sup_{n \ge 1} \| S_n(x) \| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, it follows from the principle of uniform boundedness that:
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{n \ge 1} \| S_n \| \le \infty&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, by the continuity of norms,
:&lt;math&gt;\| S(x) \| = \lim_{n \to \infty} \| S_n(x) \| \le (\sup_{n \ge 1} \| S_n \|) \|x\|&lt;/math&gt;.
This shows that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous linear operator since the linearity is easily checked. Finally,
:&lt;math&gt;\|TS (x) - x \| = \| \lim_{n \to \infty} -(I - T)^{n + 1} (x) \| \le \|x\| \lim_{n \to \infty} \| I - T \|^{n+1} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''The space of invertible continuous linear operators &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is an open subspace of &lt;math&gt;L(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{X})&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: If &lt;math&gt;T \in L(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{X})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|S - T\| &lt; {1 \over \|T^{-1}\|}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is invertible. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar field and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is a normed space, then &lt;math&gt;L(\mathcal{X}, \mathbf{F})&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''dual'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;. In view of Theorem 2.something, it is a Banach space.

A linear operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a ''compact operator'' if the image of the open unit ball under &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is relatively compact. We recall that if a linear operator between normed spaces maps bounded sets to bounded sets, then it is continuous. Thus, every compact operator is continuous.

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a reflexive Banach space and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; be a Banach space. Then a linear operator &lt;math&gt;T:\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; is a compact operator if and only if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; sends weakly convergent sequence to norm convergent ones.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: &lt;ref&gt;This proof and a few more related results appear in [http://www.math.gatech.edu/~loss/03falltea/6580/compact.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; converges weakly to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and suppose &lt;math&gt;Tx_n&lt;/math&gt; is not convergent. That is, there is an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T x_n \ge \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for infinitely many &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Denote this subsequence by &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt;. By hypothesis we can then show (TODO: do this indeed)  that it contains a subsequence &lt;math&gt;y_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T y_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; converges in norm, which is a contradiction. To show the converse, let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be a bounded set. Then since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is reflexive every countable subset of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; contains a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; that is Cauchy in the weak topology and so by the hypothesis &lt;math&gt;Tx_n&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence in norm. Thus, &lt;math&gt;T(E)&lt;/math&gt; is contained in a compact subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary'''
* ''(i) Every finite-rank linear operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., a linear operator with finite-dimensional range) is a compact operator.''
* ''(ii) Every linear operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with the finite-dimensional domain is continuous.''
Proof: (i) is clear, and (ii) follows from (i) since the range of a linear operator has dimension less than that of the domain. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''The set of all compact operators into a Banach space forms a closed subspace of the set of all continuous linear operators in operator norm.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a linear operator and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; be the open unit ball in the domain of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is compact, then &lt;math&gt;T(\overline {\omega})&lt;/math&gt; is bounded (try scalar multiplication); thus, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. Since the sum of two compacts sets is again compact, the sum of two compact operators is again compact. For the similar reason, &lt;math&gt;\alpha T&lt;/math&gt; is compact for any scalar &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. We conclude that the set of all compact operators, which we denote by &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, forms a subspace of continuous linear operators. To show the closedness, suppose &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is in the closure of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be given. Then there is some compact operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\| S - T \| &lt; \epsilon / 2&lt;/math&gt;. Also, since &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a compact operator, we can cover &lt;math&gt;T(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; by a finite number of open balls of radius &lt;math&gt;\epsilon / 2&lt;/math&gt; centered at &lt;math&gt;z_1, z_2, ... z_n&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. It then follows: for &lt;math&gt;x \in \omega&lt;/math&gt;, we can find some &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\| Tx - z_j \| &lt; \epsilon / 2&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\| Sx - Tx \| \le \| Sx - z_j \| + \| z_j - Tx \| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. This is to say, &lt;math&gt;S(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is totally bounded and since the completeness its closure is compact. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''If &lt;math&gt;T_n&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of compact operators which converges in operator norm, then its limit is a compact operator.''

'''2 Theorem (transpose)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; be Banach spaces, and &lt;math&gt;u:\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous linear operator. Define &lt;math&gt;{}^t\!u: \mathcal{Y}^* \to \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt; by the identity &lt;math&gt;{}^t\!u(z)(x) = u(z(x))&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;{}^t\!u&lt;/math&gt; is continuous both in operator norm and the weak-* topology, and &lt;math&gt;\|{}^t\!u\| = \|u\|&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: For any &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathcal{Y}^*&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\|{}^t\!u(z)\| = \sup_{\|x\| \le 1} |(u \circ z) (x)| \le \|u\|\|z\|&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, &lt;math&gt;\|{}^t\!u\| \le \|u\|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{}^t\!u&lt;/math&gt; is continuous in operator norm. To show the opposite inequality, let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be given. Then there is &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;(1-\epsilon)\|u\| \le |u(x_0)|&lt;/math&gt;. Using the Hahn-Banach theorem we can also find &lt;math&gt;\|z_0\| = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_0(u(x_0)) = |u(x_0)|&lt;/math&gt;. Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\|{}^t\!u\| = \sup_{\|z\| \le 1}\|{}^t\!u(z)\| \ge \|{}^t\!u(z_0)\| = |z_0(u(x))| =  |u(x_0)| \ge (1-\epsilon)\|u\|&lt;/math&gt;.
We conclude &lt;math&gt;\|{}^t\!u\| = \|u\|&lt;/math&gt;. To show weak-* continuity let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;; that is, &lt;math&gt;V = \{ z; z \in \mathcal{X}^*, |z(x_1)| &lt; \epsilon, ..., |z(x_n)| &lt; \epsilon \}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0, x_1, ..., x_n \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. If we let &lt;math&gt;y_j = u(x_j)&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;{}^t\!u ( \{ z; z \in \mathcal{Y}^*, |z(y_1)| &lt; \epsilon, ..., |z(y_n)| &lt; \epsilon \} ) \subset V&lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;z(y_j) = {}^t\!u(z)(x_j)&lt;/math&gt;. This is to say, &lt;math&gt;{}^t\!u&lt;/math&gt; is weak-* continuous. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; be a linear operator between normed spaces. Then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is compact if and only if its transpose &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is compact.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be the closure of the image of the closed unit ball under &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. If ''T'' is compact, then ''K'' is compact. Let &lt;math&gt;y_n \in Y^*&lt;/math&gt; be a bounded sequence. Then the restrictions of &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt; to ''K'' is a bounded equicontinuous sequence in &lt;math&gt;C(K)&lt;/math&gt;; thus, it has a convergent subsequence &lt;math&gt;y_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; by Ascoli's theorem. Thus, &lt;math&gt;T'y_{n_k}(x) = y_{n_k}(Tx)&lt;/math&gt; is convergent for every ''x'' with &lt;math&gt;\|x\|_\mathcal{X} \le 1&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;T' y_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; is convergent. The converse follows from noting that every normed space can be embedded continuously into its second dual. (TODO: need more details.)&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

A Banach space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''Banach algebra'' if it is an algebra and satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\|x y\| \le \|x\| \|y\|&lt;/math&gt;.
We shall assume that every Banach algebra has the unit &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; unless stated otherwise.

Since &lt;math&gt;\|x_n y_n - xy\| \le \|x_n\| \|y_n - y\| + \|x_n  - x\| \|y\| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x_n, y_n \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, the map
:&lt;math&gt;(x, y) \mapsto xy : \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;
is continuous.

For &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all complex numbers &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x - \lambda 1&lt;/math&gt; is not invertible.

'''5 Theorem''' ''For every &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty and closed and
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(x) \subset \{ s \in \mathbf{C} | |s| \le \|x\| \}&lt;/math&gt;.
Moreover,
:&lt;math&gt;r(x) \overset{\mathrm{def}}= \sup \{ |z| | z \in \sigma(x) \} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \|x^n\|^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;r(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''spectral radius'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;G \subset \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be the group of units. Define &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbf{C} \to A&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda) = \lambda 1 - x&lt;/math&gt;. (Throughout the proof &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is fixed.) If &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in \mathbf{C} \backslash \sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then, by definition, &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda) \in G&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in f^{-1}(G)&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, we have: &lt;math&gt;G \subset f(\sigma(x))&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;x \in f^{-1}(G) \subset \sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is clearly continuous, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} \backslash \sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt; is open and so &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;|s| &gt; \|x\|&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;s \in \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;. By the geometric series (which is valid by Theorem 2.something),
we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(1 - {x \over s}\right)^{-1} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left({x \over s}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, &lt;math&gt;1 - {x \over s}&lt;/math&gt; is invertible, which is to say, &lt;math&gt;s1 - x&lt;/math&gt; is invertible. Hence, &lt;math&gt;s \not\in \sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt;. This complete the proof of the first assertion and gives:
:&lt;math&gt;r(x) \le \|x\|&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt; is compact, there is a &lt;math&gt;a \in \sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r(x) =  a&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;a^n \in \sigma(x^n)&lt;/math&gt; (use induction to see this),
:&lt;math&gt;r(x)^n \le \|x^n\|&lt;/math&gt;
Next, we claim that the sequence &lt;math&gt;{x^n \over s^{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded for &lt;math&gt;|s| &gt; r(x)&lt;/math&gt;. In view of the uniform boundedness principle, it suffices to show that &lt;math&gt;g \left( {x^n \over s^{n+1}} \right)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded for every &lt;math&gt;g \in A^*&lt;/math&gt;. But since
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} g\left( {x^n \over s^{n+1}} \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;,
this is in fact the case. Hence, there is a constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\|x^n\| \le c|s|^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. It follows:
:&lt;math&gt;r(x) \le \lim_{n \to \infty} \|x^n\|^{1/n} \le \lim_{n \to \infty} c^{1/n} |s| = |s|&lt;/math&gt;.
Taking inf over &lt;math&gt;|s| &gt; r(x)&lt;/math&gt; completes the proof of the spectral radius formula. Finally, suppose, on the contrary, that &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt; is empty. Then for every &lt;math&gt;g \in A^*&lt;/math&gt;, the map
:&lt;math&gt;s \mapsto g( (x - s)^{-1} )&lt;/math&gt;
is analytic in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\lim_{s \to \infty} g( (x - s)^{-1} ) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, by Liouville's theorem, we must have: &lt;math&gt;g ( (x - s)^{-1} ) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;(x - s)^{-1} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;s \in \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''5 Corollary (Gelfand-Mazur theorem)''' ''If every nonzero element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is invertible, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be a nonzero element. Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty, we can then find &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda 1 - x&lt;/math&gt; is not invertible. But, by hypothesis, &lt;math&gt;\lambda 1- x&lt;/math&gt; is invertible, unless &lt;math&gt;\lambda 1 = x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; be a maximal ideal of a Banach algebra. (Such &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; exists by the usual argument involving Zorn's Lemma in abstract algebra). Since the complement of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; consists of invertible elements, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; is closed. In particular, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} / \mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; is a Banach algebra with the usual quotient norm. By the above corollary, we thus have the isomorphism:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} / \mathfrak{m} \simeq \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;

Much more is true, actually. Let &lt;math&gt;\Delta(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all nonzero homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;\omega: \mathcal{A} \to \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;. (The members of &lt;math&gt;\Delta(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; are called ''characters''.)

'''5 Theorem''' ''&lt;math&gt;\Delta(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; is bijective to the set of all maximal ideals of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''5 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is invertible if and only if &lt;math&gt;\omega(x) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \Delta(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt;''

'''5 Theorem''' ''&lt;math&gt;\omega(x) = \omega(\hat x)&lt;/math&gt;''

An ''involution'' is an anti-linear map &lt;math&gt;x \to x^*: A \to A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x^{**} = x&lt;/math&gt;. Prototypical examples are the complex conjugation of functions and the operation of taking the adjoint of a linear operator. These examples explain why we require an involution to be anti-linear.

Now, the interest of study in this chapter. A Banach algebra with an involution is called a C*-algebra if it satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\|xx^*\| = \|x\|^2&lt;/math&gt; (C*-identity)

From the C*-identity follows
:&lt;math&gt;\|x^*\| = \|x\|&lt;/math&gt;,
for
&lt;math&gt;\|x\|^2 \le \|x^*\| \|x\|&lt;/math&gt; and the same for &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;\|1\| = 1&lt;/math&gt; (if &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; exists). Furthermore, the &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;-identity is equivalent to the condition: &lt;math&gt;\|x\|^2 \le \|x^*x\|&lt;/math&gt;, for this and
:&lt;math&gt;\|x^*x\| \le \|x^*\| \|x\|&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\|x\| = \|x^*\|&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\|x\|^2 \le \|x^* x\| \le \|x\|^2&lt;/math&gt;.

For each &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;C^*(x)&lt;/math&gt; be the linear span of &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, y_1 y_2 ... y_n | y_j \in \{ x, x^* \} \} &lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;C^*(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest C*-algebra that contains &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The crucial fact is that &lt;math&gt;C^*(x)&lt;/math&gt; is commutative. Moreover, 

'''Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be normal. Then &lt;math&gt;\sigma_A (x) = \sigma_{C^*(x)} (x)&lt;/math&gt;

A ''state on &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a positive linear functional f such that &lt;math&gt;\|f\| = 1&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently &lt;math&gt;f(1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;). Since &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is convex and closed, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is weak-* closed. (This is Theorem 4.something.) Since &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is contained in the unit ball of the dual of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is weak-* compact.

&lt;!--
'''5 Theorem (Gelfand–Naimark)''' ''Every &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;-algebra is &lt;math&gt;*-&lt;/math&gt;isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H})&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: (see [[w:Gelfand–Naimark_theorem]])
--&gt;

'''5 Theorem''' ''Every C^*-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is *-isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the spectrum of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''5 Theorem''' ''If &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;C_0(Y)&lt;/math&gt;, then it follows that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are homeomorphic.''

'''3 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous linear operator on a Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;TT^* = T^*T&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\|Tx\| = \|T^*x\|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;

Continuous linear operators with the above equivalent conditions are said to be ''normal''. For example, an orthogonal projection is normal. See [[w:normal operator]] for additional examples and the proof of the above lemma.

'''3 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be a normal operator. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are distinct eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, then the respective eigenspaces of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal to each other.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be the identity operator, and &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; be arbitrary eigenvectors for &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Since the adjoint of &lt;math&gt;\alpha I&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\bar \alpha I&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \|(N - \alpha I)x\| = \|(N - \alpha I)^*x\| = \|N^*x - \bar \alpha x\|&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, &lt;math&gt;N^*x = \bar \alpha x&lt;/math&gt;, and we thus have:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar \alpha \langle x, y \rangle = \langle N^*x, y \rangle = \langle x, Ny \rangle = \bar \beta \langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is nonzero, we must have &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \beta&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

In the previous chapter we studied a Banach space having a special geometric property: that is, a Hilbert space. This chapter continues this line of the study. The main topics of the chapter are (i) the notion of reflexibility of Banach spaces (ii) weak-* compactness, (iii) the study of a basis in Banach spaces and (iv) complemented (and uncomplemented) subspaces of Banach spaces. It turns out those are a geometric property,

== Weak and weak-* topologies ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a normed space. Since &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt; is a Banach space, there is a canonical injection &lt;math&gt;\pi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X}^{**}&lt;/math&gt; given by:
:&lt;math&gt;(\pi x)f = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;.
One of the most important question in the study of normed spaces is when this &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is surjective; if this is the case, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be &quot;reflexive&quot;. For one thing, since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^{**}&lt;/math&gt;, as the dual of a normed space, is a Banach space even when &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is not, a normed space that is reflexive is always a Banach space, since &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; becomes an (isometrical) isomorphism. (Since &lt;math&gt;\pi(X)&lt;/math&gt; separates points in &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt;, the weak-* topology is Hausdorff by Theorem 1.something.)

Before studying this problem, we introduce some topologies. The ''weak-* topology'' for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt; is the weakest among topologies for which every element of &lt;math&gt;\pi(\mathcal{X})&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. In other words, the weak-* topology is precisely the topology that makes the dual of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\pi(\mathcal{X})&lt;/math&gt;. (Recall that it becomes easier for a function to be continuous when there are more open sets in the domain of the function.)
&lt;!--
Yet another way to define the weak-* topology is to define a neighborhood base &lt;math&gt;V_f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;V_f = \{ g; g \in \mathcal{X}^*, |g(x_j) - f(x_j)| &lt; \epsilon \quad (1 \le j \le n) \}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_1, ... x_n \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. From this definition follows immediately that &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; converges weak-* to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;.

By definition, weak-* topology is weaker than the norm topology; i.e., every weak-* open set is open in norm.
--&gt;

The ''weak topology'' for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the weakest of topologies for which every element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. (As before, the weak topology is Hausdorff.)

'''4 Theorem (Alaoglu)''' ''The unit ball of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}^*&lt;/math&gt; is weak-* compact.''&lt;br &gt;
Proof: For every &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ran}f&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}^\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;. With this identification, we have: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}^* \subset \mathbf{C}^\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The inclusion in topology also holds; i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}^*&lt;/math&gt; is a topological subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}^\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The unit ball of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}^*&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the set
:&lt;math&gt;E = \prod_{x \in \mathfrak{B}} \{ \lambda; \lambda \in \mathbf{C}, |\lambda| \le \|x\|_\mathfrak{B} \}&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, a product of disks, is weak-* compact by [[w:Tychonoff's theorem]] (see Chapter 1), it suffices to show that the closed unit ball is weak-* closed. This is easy once we have the notion of nets, which will be introduced in the next chapter. For the sake of completeness, we give a direct argument here. (TODO) &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a TVS whose dual separates points in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the weak-* topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt; is metrizable if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; has a at most countable Hamel basis.'' 

Obviously, all weakly closed sets and weak-* closed sets are closed (in their respective spaces.) The converse in general does not hold. On the other hand,

'''4. Lemma''' ''Every closed convex subset &lt;math&gt;E \subset \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is weakly closed.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; be in the weak closure of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose, if possible, that &lt;math&gt;x \not\in E&lt;/math&gt;. By (the geometric form) of the Hanh-Banach theorem, we can then find &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt; and real number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}f (x) &lt; c &lt; \operatorname{Re}f(y)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;y \in E&lt;/math&gt;.
Set &lt;math&gt;V = \{ y; \operatorname{Re}f(y) &lt; c \}&lt;/math&gt;. What we have now is: &lt;math&gt;x \in V \subset E^c&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is weakly open (by definition). This is contradiction.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. Corollary''' ''The closed unit ball of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; (resp.  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;) is weakly closed (resp. weak-* closed).''

'''4 Exercise''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be the unit ball of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. Prove &lt;math&gt;\pi(B)&lt;/math&gt; is weak-* dense in the closed unit ball of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^{**}&lt;/math&gt;. (Hint: similar to the proof of Lemma 4.something.)''

'''4 Theorem''' ''A set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is weak-* sequentially closed if and only if the intersection of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and the (closed?) ball of arbitrary radius is weak-* sequentially closed.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: (TODO: write a proof using PUB.)

== Reflexive Banach spaces ==

'''4 Theorem (Kakutani)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a Banach space. The following are equivalent:
*(i) ''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is reﬂexive.''
*(ii) ''The closed unit ball of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is weakly compact.''
*(iii) ''Every bounded set admits a weakly convergent subsequence. (thus, the unit ball in (ii) is actually weakly sequentially compact.)''
Proof: (i) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (ii) is immediate. For (iii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (i), we shall prove: if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is not reflexive, then we can find a normalized sequence that falsifies (iii). For that, see [http://www.ams.org/proc/1998-126-08/S0002-9939-98-04691-7/S0002-9939-98-04691-7.pdf], which shows how to do this. Finally, for (ii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (iii), it suffices to prove:

'''4 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a Banach space, &lt;math&gt;x_j \in X&lt;/math&gt; a sequence and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be the weak closure of &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is weakly compact, then &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is weakly sequentially compact.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: By replacing &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with the closure of the linear span of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we may assume that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; admits a dense countable subset &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Then for &lt;math&gt;u, v \in\mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u(x) = v(x)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;u = v&lt;/math&gt; by continuity. This is to say, a set of functions of the form &lt;math&gt;u \mapsto u(x)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt; separates points in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a fortiori, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, the closed unit ball of &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt;. The weak-* topology for &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is therefore metrizable by Theorem 1.something. Since a compact metric space is second countable; thus, separable, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; admits a countable (weak-*) dense subset &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt; separates points in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, for any &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\|x\|=1&lt;/math&gt;, by the Hahn-Banach theorem, we can find &lt;math&gt;f \in B&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \|x\| = 1&lt;/math&gt;. By denseness, there is &lt;math&gt;g \in B'&lt;/math&gt; that is near &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the sense: &lt;math&gt;|g(x) - f(x)| &lt; 2^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and we have:
:&lt;math&gt;|g(x)| \ge |f(x)| - |g(x) - f(x)| &gt; 2^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
Again by theorem 1.something, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is now metrizable.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Remark: Lemma 4.something is a special case of [[w:Eberlein–Šmulian theorem]], which states that every subset of a Banach space is weakly compact if and only if it is weakly sequentially compact. (See [http://www.ams.org/proc/2003-131-10/S0002-9939-03-06894-1/S0002-9939-03-06894-1.pdf], [http://misuma.um.es/beca/Investigacion/22_Version%20Proceddings%20Charrla%20Huelva.pdf])

In particular, since every Hilbert space is reflexive, either (ii) or (iii) in the theorem always holds for all Hilbert spaces. But for (iii) we could have used alternatively:

'''4 Exercise''' ''Give a direct proof that (iii) of the theorem holds for a separable Hilbert space. (Hint: use an orthonormal basis to directly construct a subsequence.)''

'''4 Corollary''' ''A Banach space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is reflexive if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt; is reflexive.'

'''4 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a Banach space with a [[w:Schauder basis]] &lt;math&gt;e_j&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is reflexive if and only if &lt;math&gt;e_j&lt;/math&gt; satisfies:''
*''(i) &lt;math&gt;\sup_n \left\| \sum_{j=1}^n a_j e_j \right\| &lt; \infty \Rightarrow \sum_{j=1}^\infty a_j e_j&lt;/math&gt; converges in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;.''
*''(ii) ''For any &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \sup \{ |f(x)|; x = \sum_{j \ge n}^\infty a_j e_j, \|x\|=1 \} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;): Set &lt;math&gt;x_n = \sum_{j=1}^n a_j e_j&lt;/math&gt;. By reflexivity, &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; then admits a weakly convergent subsequence &lt;math&gt;x_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; with limit &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. By hypothesis, for any &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, we can write: &lt;math&gt;x = \sum_{j=1}^\infty b_j(x) e_j&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b_j \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;b_l(x) = \lim_{k \to \infty} b_l(x_{n_k}) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \sum_{j=1}^{n_k} a_j b_l(e_j) = a_l&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;x = \sum_{j=1}^\infty a_j e_j&lt;/math&gt;.
This proves (i). For (ii), set
:&lt;math&gt;E_n = \{ x; x \in \mathcal{X}, \|x\| = 1, b_1(x) = ... b_{n-1}(x) = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then (ii) means that &lt;math&gt;\sup_{E_n} |f| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; is a weakly closed subset of the closed unit ball of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;, which is weakly compact by reflexivity, &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; is weakly compact. Hence, there is a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; such that: &lt;math&gt;\sup_{E_n} |f| = |f(x_n)|&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;. It follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} |f(x_n)| = |f(\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n)| = |f(\sum_{j=1}^\infty b_j(\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n) e_j)| = 0&lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} b_j(x_n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. (TODO: but does &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt; exist?) This proves (ii).&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;): Let &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; be a bounded sequence. For each &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\{ b_j(x_n) ; n \ge 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded; thus, admits a convergent sequence. By Cantor's diagonal argument, we can therefore find a subsequence &lt;math&gt;x_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;b_j(x_{n_k})&lt;/math&gt; converges for every &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. Set &lt;math&gt;a_j = \lim_{n \to \infty} b_j(x_{n_k})&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;K = 2 \sup_n \|x_n\|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_n = \sup \{ |f(y)|; y = \sum_{j=m+1}^\infty c_j e_j, \|y\| \le K \}&lt;/math&gt;. By (ii), &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Now,
:&lt;math&gt;|f(\sum_{j=1}^m b_j(x_{n_k}) e_j)| \le |f(\sum_{j=1}^\infty b_j(x_{n_k})e_j)| + |f(\sum_{j=m+1}^\infty b_j(x_{n_k}) e_j)| \le \|f\| \sup_n \|x_n\| + s_m&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;s_m&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, &lt;math&gt;\sup_m |f(\sum_{j=1}^m a_j e_j)| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\sup_m \| \sum_{j=1}^m a_j e_j \| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;. By (i), &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^m a_j e_j&lt;/math&gt; therefore exists. Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be given. Then there exists &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;s_m &lt; \epsilon / 2&lt;/math&gt;. Also, there exists &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^m (a_j - b_j(x_{n_k})) f(e_j) &lt; \epsilon / 2&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;k \ge N&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x_{n_k}) - f(\sum_{j=1}^\infty a_j e_j)| \le |\sum_{j=1}^m (a_j - b_j(x_{n_k})) f(e_j) | + |f(\sum_{j=m+1}^\infty (a_j - b_j(x_{n_k})) e_j| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

'''4 Example''' &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is not reflexive; in particular, the closed unit ball of &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is not weakly compact. (This is so since the canonical basis of &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is a Schauder basis that contradicts (i) of the theorem. More generally, we can prove:

'''3 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T \in B(\mathfrak H)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;T(\overline{B}(0, 1))&lt;/math&gt; is closed.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Since &lt;math&gt;\overline{B}(0, 1)&lt;/math&gt; is weakly compact and &lt;math&gt;T(\overline{B}(0, 1))&lt;/math&gt; is convex, it suffices to show &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is weakly continuous. But if &lt;math&gt;x_n \to 0&lt;/math&gt; weakly, then &lt;math&gt;(Tx_n|y) =  (x_n|T^*y) \to 0&lt;/math&gt; for any ''y''. This shows that ''T'' is weakly continuous on &lt;math&gt;\overline{B}(0, 1)&lt;/math&gt; (since bounded sets are weakly metrizable) and thus on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak H&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''T'' is compact, it suffices to show that &lt;math&gt;T(\overline{B}(0, 1))&lt;/math&gt; is closed. But since &lt;math&gt;T(\overline{B}(0, 1))&lt;/math&gt; is weakly closed and convex, it is closed.&lt;br /&gt;

'''3 Lemma''' ''If &lt;math&gt;T \in B(\mathfrak H)&lt;/math&gt; is self-adjoint and compact, then either &lt;math&gt;\| T \|&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\| T \|&lt;/math&gt; is an eigenvalue of ''T''.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: First we prove that &lt;math&gt;\|T\|^2&lt;/math&gt; is an eigenvalue of &lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is compact, by the above lemma, there is a &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; in the unit ball such that &lt;math&gt;\|T\| = \|Tx_0\|&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\langle T^2 x_0, x_0 \rangle = \|T\|^2&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\|T^2 x - \|T\|^2 x\|^2 \le \|T\|^2 - 2\|T\|^2 + \|T\|^2&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, &lt;math&gt;T^2 x_0 = \|T\|^2 x_0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;(T^2 - \|T\|^2I)x_0 = (T + \|T\|I)(T - \|T\|I)x_0&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;(T - \|T\|I)x_0&lt;/math&gt; is either zero or an eigenvector  of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;-\|T\|&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Theorem''' ''If ''T'' is normal; that is, &lt;math&gt;T^*T = TT^*&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors of ''T''.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:&lt;!-- copied from [[Compact operator on Hilbert space]]. --&gt; Since we may assume that ''T'' is self-adjoint, the theorem follows from the preceding lemma by transfinite induction. By Zorn's lemma, select ''U'' to be a maximal subset of ''H'' with the following three properties: all elements of ''U'' are eigenvectors of&amp;nbsp;''T'', they have norm one, and any two distinct elements of ''U'' are orthogonal.  Let ''F'' be the orthogonal complement of the linear span of&amp;nbsp;''U''.  If ''F''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;{0}, it is a non-trivial invariant subspace of&amp;nbsp;''T'', and by the initial claim there must exist a norm one eigenvector ''y'' of ''T'' in&amp;nbsp;''F''.  But then ''U''&amp;nbsp;&amp;cup;&amp;nbsp;{''y''} contradicts the maximality of&amp;nbsp;''U''.  It follows that ''F''&amp;nbsp;= {0}, hence span(''U'') is dense in&amp;nbsp;''H''.  This shows that ''U'' is an orthonormal basis of ''H'' consisting of eigenvectors of&amp;nbsp;''T''.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Corollary (polar decomposition)''' ''Every compact operator ''K'' can be written as:''
:&lt;math&gt;K = R|K|&lt;/math&gt;
where ''R'' is a partial isometry and &lt;math&gt;|K|&lt;/math&gt; is the square root of &lt;math&gt;K^*K&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;T \in \mathcal{L}(\mathfrak{H})&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\sigma(T)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all complex numbers &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T - \lambda I&lt;/math&gt; is not invertible. (Here, I is the identity operator on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;.)

'''3 Corollary''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T \in B(\mathfrak H)&lt;/math&gt; be a compact normal operator. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\|T\| = \max_{\|x\|=1} \|(Tx | x)\| = \sup \{ |\lambda| | \lambda \in \sigma(T) \}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a densely defined operator on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is positive (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\langle Tx, x \rangle \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in \operatorname{dom}T&lt;/math&gt;) if and only if &lt;math&gt;T = T^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma(T) \subset [0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Partial proof: &lt;math&gt;(\Rightarrow)&lt;/math&gt; We have:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle Tx, x \rangle = \overline{\langle T^*x, x \rangle}&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in \operatorname{dom}T&lt;/math&gt;
But, by hypothesis, the right-hand side is real. That &lt;math&gt;T = T^*&lt;/math&gt; follows from Lemma 5.something. The proof of the theorem will be completed by the spectrum decomposition theorem in Chapter 5.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

More materials on compact operators, especially on their spectral properties, can be found in a chapter in the appendix where we study Fredholm operators.

'''3 Lemma (Bessel's inequality)''' ''If &lt;math&gt;u_k&lt;/math&gt; is an  orthonormal sequence in a Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;, then''
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, u_k \rangle|^2 \le \|x\|^2&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;.
Proof: If &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\|x + y \|^2 = \|x\|^2 + \|y\|^2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\| x - \sum_{k=1}^n \langle x, u_k \rangle \|^2 = \|x\|^2 - 2 \operatorname{Re} \sum_{k=1}^n |\langle x, u_k \rangle |^2 + \sum_{k=1}^n | \langle x, u_k \rangle |^2 = \|x\|^2 - \sum_{k=1}^n | \langle x, u_k \rangle |^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Letting &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; completes the proof. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

'''3 Theorem (Parseval)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;u_k&lt;/math&gt; be a orthonormal sequence in a Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the following are equivalent:''
* (i) ''&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{span} \{ u_1, u_2, ... \}&lt;/math&gt; is dense in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;''.
* (ii) ''For each &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \langle x, u_k \rangle u_k&lt;/math&gt;''.
* (iii) ''For each &lt;math&gt;x, y \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \langle x, u_k \rangle \overline{\langle y, u_k \rangle}&lt;/math&gt;''.
* (iv) ''&lt;math&gt;\|x\|^2 = \sum_{k=1}^\infty | \langle x, u_k \rangle |^2&lt;/math&gt;'' (the Parseval equality). 
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} = \operatorname{span} \{ u_1, u_2, ... \}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, then it has the form: &lt;math&gt;v = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \alpha_k u_k&lt;/math&gt; for some scalars &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\langle v, u_j \rangle = \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_j \langle u_k, u_j \rangle = a_j&lt;/math&gt; we can also write: &lt;math&gt;v = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \langle v, u_k \rangle u_k&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;y =\sum_{k=1}^\infty \langle x, u_k \rangle u_k&lt;/math&gt;. Bessel's inequality and that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; is complete ensure that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; exists.
Since
:&lt;math&gt;\langle y, v \rangle = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \langle x, u_k \rangle \langle u_k, v \rangle = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \langle x, \langle v, u_k \rangle u_k \rangle = \langle x, \sum_{k=1}^\infty \langle v, u_k \rangle u_k \rangle = \langle x, v \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;x - y \in \mathcal{M}^\bot = \{0\}&lt;/math&gt;, proving (i) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (ii). Now (ii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (iii) follows since
:&lt;math&gt;|\langle x, y \rangle - \sum_{k=1}^n \langle x, u_k \rangle \overline {\langle y, u_k \rangle}| = | \langle x, y - \sum_{k=1}^n \langle y, u_k \rangle u_k \rangle | \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;
To get (iii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (iv), take &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;. To show (iv) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (i), suppose that (i) is false. Then there exists a &lt;math&gt;z \in (\operatorname{span \{ u_1, u_2, ... \}})^{\bot}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;z \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^\infty | \langle z, u_k \rangle |^2 = 0 &lt; \|z\|^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, (iv) is false.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; be an ''orthogonal'' sequence in a Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{H}, \|\cdot\| = \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle^{1/2})&lt;/math&gt;. Then the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^\infty x_k&lt;/math&gt; converges if and only if the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^\infty \langle x_k, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt; converges for every &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Since
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^\infty | \langle x_k, y \rangle | \le \|y\| \sum_{k=1}^\infty \| x_k \|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^\infty \| x_k \| = \left\| \sum_{k=1}^\infty x_k \right\|&lt;/math&gt;
by orthogonality, we obtain the direct part. For the converse, let &lt;math&gt;E = \left\{ \sum_{k=1}^n x_k ; n \ge 1 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;. Since
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_E |\langle \cdot, y \rangle| = \sup_n |\sum_{k=1}^n \langle x_k, y \rangle| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;
by hypothesis, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by Theorem 3.something. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^\infty \|x_k\| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n x_k&lt;/math&gt; converges by completeness.

The theorem is meant to give an example. An analogous issue in the Banach space will be discussed in the next chapter.

'''4 Theorem''' ''A Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{H}&lt;/math&gt; is separable if and only if it has an (countable) orthonormal basis.''

It is plain that a Banach space is separable if it has a Schauder basis. Unfortunately, the converse is false.

'''4 Theorem (James)''' ''A Banach space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is reflexive if and only if every element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; attains its maximum on the closed unit ball of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''4 Corollary (Krein-Smulian)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a Banach space and &lt;math&gt;K \subset \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; a weakly compact subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. then &lt;math&gt;\overline{co}(K)&lt;/math&gt; is weakly compact.''&lt;br /&gt;

Whether the converse holds is unknown as of this writing. A partial converse is known. (see [http://www.ams.org/proc/1996-124-08/S0002-9939-96-03343-6/S0002-9939-96-03343-6.pdf SOME CONVERSES OF THE STRONG SEPARATION THEOREM])
--&gt;

A Banach space is said to be ''uniformly convex'' if
:&lt;math&gt;\|x_n\| \le 1, \|y_n\| \le 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|x_n + y_n\| \to 0 \Rightarrow \|x_n - y_n\| \to 2&lt;/math&gt;
Clearly, Hilbert spaces are uniformly convex. The point of this notion is the next result.

'''4 Theorem''' ''Every uniformly convex space &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; is reflexive.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Suppose, if possible, that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly convex but is not reflexive. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''4 Theorem''' ''Every finite dimensional Banach space is reflexive.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: (TODO)

'''4 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}_1, \mathfrak{B}_2&lt;/math&gt; be Banach spaces. If &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{B}_1&lt;/math&gt; has a [[w:Schauder basis]], then the space of finite-rank operators on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}_1&lt;/math&gt; is (operator-norm) dense in the space of compact operators on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}_1&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--
Proof:
The hypothesis means that we have a sequence of projections &lt;math&gt;\pi_n: \mathfrak{B}_1 \to \operatorname{span} \{e_1, ... e_n\}&lt;/math&gt; given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_n(x) = \sum_{j=1}^n a_j(x) e_j&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{B}_1&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;\pi_n&lt;/math&gt; are finite-rank; thus, continuous,
:&lt;math&gt;\| a_n(x) e_n \| = \|(\pi_n - \pi_{n-1})(x) e_n\| \le 2 \sup_m \|\pi_m\| \|x\| \|e_n\|&lt;/math&gt;.
This is to say, &lt;math&gt;\|a_j\| \le 2 \sup_n \|\pi_n\|&lt;/math&gt;. It follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\|T \circ \pi_n - T\| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;

This chapter gathers some standard results that will be used in sequel. In particular, we prove the Hahn-Banach theorem, which is really a result in linear algebra. The proofs of these theorems will be found in the [[Topology]] and [[Linear Algebra]] books.

== Set theory ==

The axiom of choice states that given a collection of sets &lt;math&gt;S_i, i \in I&lt;/math&gt;,  there exists a ''function''
:&lt;math&gt;f: I \to \prod_{i \in I} S_i&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Exercise.''' ''Use the axiom of choice to prove that any surjection is right-invertible.''&lt;!-- or left-invertible?--&gt;

In this book the axiom of choice is almost always invoked in the form of Zorn's Lemma.

'''Exercise.''' ''Prove Tychonoff's theorem for finite product without appeal to Axiom of Choice (or any of its equivalences).''

By definition, a compact space is Hausdorff.

{{Functional Analysis/theorem
|label=metrization
|name=[[Topology/Countability#Urysohn.27s_Metrizability_Theorem|metrization theorem]]
|claim=If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a second-countable compact space, then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is metrizable.
|proof=Define &lt;math&gt;d: X \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty 2^{-j} |f_j(x) - f_j(y)|&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;f_j(x) = f_j(y)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, which in turn implies &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;. The converse holds too. Since &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = d(y, x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is a metric then. Let &lt;math&gt;\tau_d&lt;/math&gt; be the topology for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that is induced by &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. We claim &lt;math&gt;\tau_d&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the topology originally given to &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. In light of:

'''Lemma.''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set. If &lt;math&gt;\tau_1 \subset \tau_2&lt;/math&gt; are a pair of topologies for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff and &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; is compact, then &lt;math&gt;\tau_1 = \tau_2&lt;/math&gt;.''

it suffices to show that &lt;math&gt;\tau_d&lt;/math&gt; is contained in the original topology. But for any &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;d(\cdot, x)&lt;/math&gt; is the limit of a sequence of continuous functions on a compact set, we see &lt;math&gt;d(\cdot, x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. Consequently, an &lt;math&gt;\tau_d&lt;/math&gt;-open ball in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; with center at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is open (in the original topology.)}}

{{Functional Analysis/theorem
|theorem=Proposition
|label=second-prop
|claim=(i) Every second-countable space is separable. (ii) Every separable metric space is second-countable.
|proof=To be written.}}

In particular, a compact metric space is separable.

'''Exercise.''' ''The [[w:lower limit topology]] on the real line is separable but not second-countable.''

|name=[[Topology/Completeness#Theorem_.28Baire_Category_Theorem.29|Baire]]
|claim=A complete metric space is not a countable union of closed subsets with dense complement.

We remark that the theorem is also true for a locally compact space, though this version will not be needed in the sequel.

'''Exercise.''' ''Use the theorem to prove the set of real numbers is uncountable.''

|claim=Let ''X'' be a compact space. A subset of &lt;math&gt;C(X)&lt;/math&gt; is compact if and only if it is bounded, closed and equicontinuous.
|proof=See [[w:Ascoli's theorem]].}}

The next exercise gives a typical application of the theorem.

'''Exercise.''' ''Prove Peano's existence theorem for ordinal differential equations: Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a real-valued continuous function on some open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Then the initial value problem
:&lt;math&gt;\dot x = f(x), x(t_0) = x_0&lt;/math&gt;
has a solution in some open interval containing &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt;. (Hint: Use [[w:Euler's method]] to construct a sequence of approximate solutions. The sequence probably does not converge but it contains a convergent subsequence according to Ascoli's theorem. The limit is then a desired solution.)

'''Exercise.''' ''Deduce [[w:Picard–Lindelöf theorem]] from Peano's existence theorem: Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a real-valued locally Lipschitz function on some open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Then the initial value problem
:&lt;math&gt;\dot x = f(x), x(t_0) = x_0&lt;/math&gt;
has a &quot;unique&quot; solution in some open interval containing &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt;. (Hint: the existence is clear. For the uniqueness, use [[w:Gronwall's inequality]].)

{{Functional Analysis/theorem
|label=completion
|claim=Given a metric space ''X'', there exists a complete metric space &lt;math&gt;\tilde{X}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a dense subset of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{X}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Linear algebra==

{{Functional Analysis/theorem
|label=Hamel
|claim=Let ''V'' be a vector space. Then every (possibly empty) linearly independent set is contained in some basis of ''V''.
|proof=Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all linearly independent set containing the given linearly independent set. &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty. Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a chain in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., a totally ordered subset), then &lt;math&gt;\cup \omega&lt;/math&gt; is linearly independent, since if 
:&lt;math&gt;a_1 x_1 + ... + a_n x_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are in the union, then &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; all belong to some member of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, by Zorn's Lemma, it has a maximal element, say, ''E''. It spans ''V''. Indeed, if not, there exists an &lt;math&gt;x \in V \backslash E&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;E \cup { x }&lt;/math&gt; is a member of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, contradicting the maximality of ''E''.}}

The theorem means in particular that every vector space has a basis. Such a basis is called a ''Hamel basis'' to contrast other bases that will be discussed later.

{{Functional Analysis/theorem
|label=Hahn-Banach
|name=Hahn-Banach
|claim=Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a real vector space and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be a function on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;p(x + y) \le p(x) + p(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(tx) = tp(x)&lt;/math&gt;
for any &lt;math&gt;x, y \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \subset \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subspace and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a linear functional on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f \le p&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; admits a linear extension &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; defined in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;F \le p&lt;/math&gt;.
|proof=First suppose that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} = \{ x + tz; x \in \mathcal{M}, t \in \mathbb{R} \}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;z \not\in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. By hypothesis we have:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) + f(y) \le p(x - z) + p(y + z)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;,
which is equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;\sup \{ f(x) - p(x - z) ; x \in M \} \le \inf \{ p(y + z) - f(y) ; y \in M \}&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; be some number in between the sup and the inf. Define &lt;math&gt;F(x + tz) = f(x) + tc&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{M}, t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an desired extension. Indeed, &lt;math&gt;f = F&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; being clear, we also have:
:&lt;math&gt;F(x + tz) \le t p({x \over t} + z)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;F(x + tz) \le -t p({x \over -t} - z)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;t &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be the collection of pairs &lt;math&gt;(H, g_H)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is linear space with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \subset \mathcal{H} \subset X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_H&lt;/math&gt; is a linear function on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; that extends &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and is dominated by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is partially ordered and the union of every totally ordered sub-collection of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (TODO: need more details). Hence, by Zorn's Lemma, we can find the maximal element &lt;math&gt;(L, g_L)&lt;/math&gt; and by the early part of the proof we can show that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;.}}

We remark that a different choice of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in the proof results in a different extension. Thus, an extension given by the Hahn-Banach theorem in general is not unique.

'''Exercise''' ''State the analog of the theorem for complex vector spaces and prove that this version can be reduced to the real version. (Hint: &lt;math&gt;Re f (ix) = Im f (x)&lt;/math&gt;)''

Note the theorem can be formulated in the following equivalent way.

{{Functional Analysis/theorem
|label=Hahn-Banach-geo
|name=Geometric Hahn-Banach
|claim=Let ''V'' be a vector space, and &lt;math&gt;E \subset V&lt;/math&gt; be a convex subset. If ''x'' is not in ''E'', then there exists a hyperplane that contains ''E'' but doesn't contain ''x''.
|proof=We prove the statement is ''equivalent'' to the Hahn-Banach theorem above. We first show that there is a one-to-one corresponding between the set of sublinear functional and convex sets. Given a convex set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;p(x) = \inf { t &gt; 0 | tx \in E}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (called a [[w:Minkowski functional]]) is then sublinear. In fact, clearly we have &lt;math&gt;p(a x) = |a| p(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Also, if &lt;math&gt;tx \in E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;sy \in E&lt;/math&gt;, then, by convexity, &lt;math&gt;{t \over t + s} x + {s \over t + s} y \in E&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;p(x + y) \le t + s&lt;/math&gt;. Taking inf over ''t'' and ''s'' (separately) we conclude &lt;math&gt;p(x + y) \le p(x) + p(y)&lt;/math&gt;. Now, note that: &lt;math&gt;E = \{ x \in V | p(x) \le 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;. This suggests that we can define a set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; for a given sublinear functional &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, if &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is sublinear, then for &lt;math&gt;x, y \in E&lt;/math&gt; we have: &lt;math&gt;p(t x + s y) \le tp(x) + sp(y) \le 1&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;t, s \le 0, t + s = 1&lt;/math&gt; and this means &lt;math&gt;tx + sy \in E&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is convex.

{{Functional Analysis/theorem|
|label=quotient-univ
|claim=Let &lt;math&gt;V \supset W&lt;/math&gt; be linear vector spaces, and &lt;math&gt;\pi: V \to V/W&lt;/math&gt; a canonical surjection. If &lt;math&gt;T: V \to X&lt;/math&gt; (where X is some vector space) is a linear map, then there exists &lt;math&gt;F: V / W \to X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;F \circ \pi = f&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;W \subset \operatorname{ker}f&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover,
*(i) If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; exists, then &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is unique.
*(ii) &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is injective if and only if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}(f) = W&lt;/math&gt;.
*(iii) &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is surjective if and only if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is surjective.
|proof=If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; exists, then &lt;math&gt;W = \operatorname{ker}(\pi) \subset \operatorname{ker}(F \circ \pi) = \operatorname{ker}f&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, suppose &lt;math&gt;W \subset \operatorname{ker}f&lt;/math&gt;, and define &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by:
:&lt;math&gt;F(x + W) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;x \in V&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined. In fact, if &lt;math&gt;x + W = y + W&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x - y \in W \subset \operatorname{ker}f&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;(F \circ \pi) (x) = f(x) = f(y) = (F \circ \pi) (y)&lt;/math&gt;.
By this definition, (i) is now clear. (ii) holds since &lt;math&gt;F(x+W) = (F \circ \pi) (x) = f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x \in W&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}f = W&lt;/math&gt;. (iii) is also clear; we have a set-theoretic fact: &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; is surjective if and only if &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is surjective.}}

In this section we present some common techniques for algorithmic optimization. These techniques should mostly be independent of the programming language, software or hardware platform. When optimizing, always start by considering different algorithms before resorting to lower-level optimizations in order to retain generality, maintainability and portability in your code.

Some of the proposed techniques will have an implementation in C++.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Blended Learning in the EFL Setting
 
Blended Learning Definitions for EFL

Blended learning is a relatively new ‘pedagogical’ approach to instruction. In the English as a foreign language (EFL) setting blended learning (BL) is only just beginning to take stride. There are many definitions of BL but at the core of all the BL definitions implies a combination of face-to-face and online as components of the pedagogy (Graham, 2006). In the EFL setting social interaction is needed to facilitate language outcomes (Vygotsky, 1987). Therefore blended learning in the EFL setting can be defined as a pedagogical approach that combines the effectiveness and socialization opportunities of the classroom with the technologically enhanced active learning possibilities of the online environment (Dziuban, Hartman, Moskal, 2004). What are the learners’ needs teachers should be aware of when implementing BL in the EFL setting? What are some constraints of BL that teachers need to understanding? How does the methodology enhance the learning and thus facilitate the students overcoming the constraints of the EFL setting?	

The Needs of the EFL Setting

The EFL setting differs from the ESL setting in that most EFL countries the students have little or no access to the target language community (Cummins, 2001; Baker, 2000; Graddol, 2006). This means understanding of socio-pragmatic discourse, cultural understanding (Duff, P. &amp; Uchida, Y. 1997) which affects literacy, speaking and listening, and exposure to literacy genres is limited or non-existent (Al-Jarf, 2006). Therefore students’ who may be grammatically correct when speaking lacks experience with the proper meaning and context of the language.  The EFL learner differs from the ESL learner in three important aspects: a) a lack of socio-cultural exposure b) the lack of chance to practice meaningfully (Oxford, 1990; Spada &amp; Lightbown, 1996) c) the lack of high frequency exposure of English (Lee, K., 2000, O’Donnell, T.). As we will see later BL can eliminate or at least diminish many of these constraints. First, teacher awareness within this new pedagogy will be examined. 

Constraints for the Learners

There are three areas that can constrain the learner and they are; the design and content of the program, the teacher training, and awareness of how the student is processing the new language learning environment.   When designing a program the teacher should remember that the context of learning might not always be culturally appropriate for the students (Duff, P. &amp; Uchida, Y., 1997). Another factor in the design of the program that needs consideration is for the standardizing of content and testing. The teacher needs to upgrade and learn technology skills. This is so they are aware of how to properly utilize the tolls so to avoid a mismatch of the learning content and technology. A big mistake teachers should avoid is using technology for non-target reasons (das Neves Seesink, T., Dissertation, 2007). Finally teacher must become aware to check in with the students feelings about the programs (das Neves Seesink, T., Dissertation, 2007). Research has shown that sometimes e-learning produces anxiety in students (das Neves Seesink, T., Dissertation, 2007). Language learning is ultimately about communication therefore the teachers need to balance face-to-face with online so to avoid anxiety (Al-Jarf, 2006). 

Benefits of Blended Learning for the EFL learner

One thing absent in the EFL setting is the target language culture. E-learning can allow access to target language culture through the use of Youtube videos, meaningful situational interacting videos, blogs, chat rooms etc. (Duff, P. &amp; Uchida, Y. 1997). These ‘tools’ enable the EFL student to have more access to native speakers. Using tools such as blogging, wiki pages, and brainstorming aid the student with overcoming academic literacy issues (Al-Jarf, 2006).Not only can blended learning provide safe way to practice chatting without the fear of the native speaker presence. The distance created from the online atmosphere helps to relax the student’s research has found (Al-Jarf, 2006). This real life online exposure can enables strategy use in the process of reading and writing (Al-Jarf, 2006). Strategy use to solve a problem facilitates the increase in self-direct learning (Barenfanger, O., 2007). The 24 access nature of online learning coupled with the reality practice of face-to-face allows for more practice (O’Donnell, 2006). Researchers have found that the e-learning component of the blended course gives the student a chance to revisit lectures (Graham, C.,). Overall blended learning offers more affordances than constraints.

Pitfalls of Blended learning that EFL Teachers Should Avoid

When designing a blended learning program the needs of the students must be balanced with the outcomes expected by the institution. Teachers as good as they may be in the traditional classroom need further training so that implementation of the course is not hampered by a mismatch of content and technology. Finally the teacher and the students need to understand the collaborative nature of the new learning endeavor so that a balance will be struck and motivation to learn will remain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Due to the effect of compounding interest, large gains on principle can be achieved over a period of many years.
For example, suppose one were to invest $100 at an interest rate of 7% for 20 years. Without compound interest, the total at the end of 20 years would be $240.

FV&lt;sub&gt;simple interest&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt; =\ C\ +\ t(C*r)&lt;/math&gt;

However, when the interest earnings from one year are reinvested the next, the following formula is used:

FV&lt;sub&gt;compound interest&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;=\ C\,(1+r)^t&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting 100 for C, 0.07 for r, and 20 for t, we see that


FV&lt;sub&gt;compound interest&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;=\ $100\,(1.07)^{20} = $386.97&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, compound interest enables significant gains over a period of many years.

The following diagram shows how $1 will become $10 after 47 years of 5% compound interest:

&lt;big&gt;'''Sarcoma Staging'''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;br&gt;

'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)''' &lt;br&gt;
''Primary Tumor:''
*T1 - less than or equal to 5cm
**T1a - superficial
**T1b - deep
*T2 - greater than 5cm
**T2a - superficial
**T2b - deep

''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
*N0 - no
*N1 - yes

''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - none
*M1 - yes

''Grade:''
*AJCC now recommends a three-tier system.  The FNCLCC (French) system is the preferred grading system.
*The grade is determined by three parameters:
**Differentiation
**Mitotic activity
**Extent of necrosis


''Stage Grouping:''
*IA - T1a/b N0 G1 - low grade (grade 1), small
*IB - T2a/b N0 G1 - low grade (grade 1), large 
*IIA - T1a/b N0 G2-3 - mod/high grade (grade 2-3), small
*IIB - T2a/b N0 G2 - mod grade (grade 2), large
*III - T2a/b G3, or N1 - high grade (grade 3), large; or node positive
*IV - M1 - metastatic


''Changes from AJCC 6th Edition:''
*Now incorporates a three-tiered grading system. For staging, there is now a distinction between G2 and G3, at least for tumors &gt;5 cm.
*N1 is now Stage III instead of Stage IV
*Stage I is divided into IA and IB. Stage II is divided into IIA and IIB. 
*Deep or superficial location of tumor no longer is a factor in overall stage

''Notes:''
*This staging system does not apply to Kaposi's sarcoma, GIST (is now staged with its own classification), fibromatosis (desmoid tumor), and infantile fibrosarcoma; does not apply to sarcomas arising in the dura mater or brain, parenchymal organs, and hollow viscera. 
*Now includes dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (which was previously excluded), angiosarcoma, and extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma
*Superficial - located entirely in the subcutaneous tissues without any degree of any involvement of the muscular fascia or underlying muscle



==Older systems==
'''AJCC 6th Edition (2002)''' &lt;br&gt;
*T1 - less than or equal to 5cm
**T1a - superficial
**T1b - deep

**T2b - deep

''Stage Grouping:''
*Stage I - All low grade, N0, M0
*Stage II - T1a/b-T2a, N0, high grade
*Stage III - T2b, N0, high grade
*Stage IV - N1 or M1, any grade

''Note:''
*Excludes dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Also excludes Kaposi's, fibromatosis (desmoid tumor), sarcoma arising from dura mater, brain, parenchymal organs, and hollow viscera.


'''AJCC 5th Edition (1997)'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">When valuing a new venture by a company, it is necessary to use an appropriate discount rate. However, since corporations can be structured very differently, it is important to reflect that in the respective costs of capital. Let's say there are two similar companies in the same industry. Company A is financed 90% by equity (that is, stock) and 10% by debt (long term corporate bonds). Company B is financed by 25% equity, and 75% debt. These two companies would have to be valued according to their respective risk levels and required returns.

One common way to determine the cost of capital is to use the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, or WACC.

&lt;math&gt; WACC = r_D(1 - T)\frac{D}{V} + r_E\frac{E}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

In this formula, V is equal to the value of the firm, or Debt (D) plus Equity (E)
Example:

AKL corporation is currently financed with $1,000,000 of 7% bonds, and $2,000,000 of common stock. The stock has a beta of 1.5, and the risk free rate is 4%, and the market risk premium is 3.5%. The marginal tax rate for a corporation of AKL's size is 35%. What is AKL's WACC?

The first thing we must do in this problem is determine the required rate on equity (R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) for AKL. We can plug the Beta given and the risk free rate into the CAPM as follows:

&lt;math&gt;E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_{im}(E(R_m) - R_f).\,&lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;math&gt;E(R_i) = 4.5 + 1.5(3.5).\, = 9.75%&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we have all of the necessary information to solve for WACC:

&lt;math&gt; WACC = .07(1 - .35)\frac{1,000,000}{3,000,000} + .0975\frac{2,000,000}{3,000,000} = 8%&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A corporations Beta is a measurement of its volatility. A high beta has high volatility in response to the market. A low beta company has low volatility, such as utilities companies. 


== Asset Beta and Equity Beta ==

Since companies are structured differently, it becomes necessary to distinguish between Asset, or Unlevered Beta, and Equity, or Levered Beta. The Equity beta is what is commonly reported on financial websites, such as finance.yahoo.com. However, to perform certain financial functions, such as valuing a company, the use of the Unlevered, or Asset Beta is necessary. This is the company's beta if one were to assume it were financed entirely by equity.

&lt;math&gt;\beta_{L} = \beta_{U}\left[1+(1-T)\frac{D}{E}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

== Return On Equity ==
'''Return on Equity''' is an important financial ratio used to compare companies. It is also commonly used as a target for executive compensation. For example, a CEO might have to earn a 15% ROE for the year in order to get his bonus. Targets like these are designed to help shareholders by giving management an incentive to perform better.

ROE is defined as Net Income divided by Shareholder's Equity. However, there are other ways to calculate it. One common way is by using Return on Assets (ROA = Net Income/Assets), which may be easier to calculate, and the debt to equity ratio, in addition to information about tax and interest rates.

&lt;math&gt;ROE = (1 - T)\left[ROA + (ROA - I)\frac{D}{E}\right]&lt;/math&gt;


== DuPont Identity ==
The DuPont Identity is a financial tool that can be used to see how three main factors affect ROE:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li/&gt;'''Profit Margin''' - Net Profit/Sales
&lt;li/&gt;'''Asset Turnover''' - Sales/Assets
&lt;li/&gt;'''Leverage Ratio''' - Assets/Equity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;math&gt;ROE = \frac{Net Profits}{Sales} * \frac{Sales}{Assets} * \frac{Assets}{Equity} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Suppose XYZ Corp. has a profit margin of 20%, asset turnover of 300%, and a leverage ratio of 50%. What would their return on equity be?

We can see that this relatively simple calculation is:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;ROE = .2 * 3 * .5 = 30%&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The DuPont Identity allows us to see that ROE is a complex measure. A company with a low profit margin may have a strong ROE if it is not levered up very much. The equation can be rearranged to solve for missing values, as in the following example:

Suppose ABC Corp. has a 10% profit margin, an ROE of 30%, sales of $2000, and equity of $1000. What is the value of its assets?

By plugging in the values given, we can solve for assets = $500&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;.3 = .15 * \frac{2000}{x} * \frac{x}{1000} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = 500&lt;/math&gt;</text>

== A two security portfolio ==

When building a portfolio, it is important not only to consider the individual securities in a portfolio, but also how they interact with one another. For example, consider a portfolio that contains two stocks, XYZ and ABC.

The following formula finds the variance of a portfolio using the correlation (rho) between two stocks in a portfolio:

&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_{portfolio} = x^2_1 \sigma^2_1 + x^2_2 \sigma^2_2 + 2(x_1x_2\rho_{12}\sigma_1\sigma_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Where x represents the weight of each security in the portfolio.

So, let us suppose the following information:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|
!XYZ
!ABC
|-
!Price
|$50
|$60
|-
!Shares
|20
|15
|-
!Variance
|0.02
|0.04
|-
!Std. Dev.
|0.1414
|0.2
|}


And the correlation between the two is 0.25

Find the variance of this portfolio.

The first thing we must do is determine the relative weights of each stock. We see that we have $1000 in XYZ, and 900 in ABC. Therefore x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=0.53 and x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.47. The other relevant information is listed, so we simply plug it into the equation:

&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_p = 0.53^2 (0.02) + .47^2 (0.04) + 2(0.53*0.47*0.25*0.1414*0.2) = 0.01798&lt;/math&gt;


----
Now let us say we were trying to find the Beta of the XYZ company, and we know that the market has a variance of 0.04. The following formula will allow us to do so:

&lt;math&gt;\beta_i = \frac{\sigma_{im}}{\sigma^2_m}&lt;/math&gt;

First, we will need to find the covariance (&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{12}&lt;/math&gt;) between the market and XYZ. For that, we will use the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{12} = \rho_{12}\sigma_1\sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

For this exercise we will need to know the correlation between the market and XYZ, which we will say is 0.75. Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{12} = 0.75*0.1414*0.2 = 0.02121&lt;/math&gt;

Applying our covariance of 0.02121 to the formula for beta, we find that:


&lt;math&gt;\beta_i = \frac{0.02121}{0.04} = 0.53&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I agree that encorporating a variety of teaching styles rather than just standing and lecturing is a great way to teach! Students would be so busy actively participating that they would never be bored. They would most likely learn to love the subject this way. Having desks in groups is also a great idea. Students could learn from each other and feed off of each other's ideas.

I think it is fasinating that you want to be in a risk school. It really shows that you will be the kind of teacher who will not give up on their students. You proved a very good point on the inclusion of disabled children in a classroom. I also had a chance to do some volunteer work at a elementary school in Chesapeake virgnia, where the teacher was completely overwhelmed with the disabled children in her classroom. I believe there were 13 out of 28 kids that had a disablment. That's a heavy load no matter how good of a teacher you are!

Hi Lauren,

I found your approach to your teaching philosophy really interesting. When I was writing mine I focused a lot on mostly teaching strategies and didn't really take into account the problems in the teaching profession nor the lack of resources and funding problems that I will encounter when I become a teacher. I also have witnessed the problems that teachers face at times when they have a sizable population of children with disabilities. They don't have the ability or time to focus on these children in the context that some of them need it while still maintaining a calm and productive classroom for the majority of the class. More often than not, it seems the so called &quot;special needs&quot; child or children get left behind - the teacher is just satisfied if their behavior is in line, rather than focusing on whether these students are learning and retaining what they need to learn, like the other children in their classroom. I loved the way you are planning to assess your students - interaction with them - it really does seem like it would give you a very true and interactive assessment of your students without them even knowing that they are being assessed. I think with your interactive classroom and your desire and will to help the more challenging students, you will be a great teacher!

Hello Lauren,

I see that you have a 6 month old son and are going to school. I can definitely relate because my wife and I just had our first child this past month. How do you juggle being a Mom and going to school? I know it has been difficult for me to juggle my job and class! I wouldn't have been able to do it without my wife's help. I look forward to hearing your response. Have a good day! [[User:Jroer001|Jroer001]] ([[User talk:Jroer001|talk]]) 03:46, 2 June 2008 (UTC)




Hi!  How are you?  Thanks for writing on my talk page.  I just wanted to respond...I've actually only been volunteer teaching and tutoring in addition to substituting so I can't really answer the question about the administration.  In talking with teachers, though, and having my dad teach, the best I can figure is that it depends on the administration as to giving non-working students a lower grade.  I have seen different teachers in the same school have different standards of behavior and work effort so my guess is that it is possible for a teacher to hold to her standards despite other teachers being a little more slack.  I definitely think there should be fun, and interesting lessons in a classroom, and I believe a teacher can be cool and liked but still require a healthy, hard-working, discliplined environment.  Are you already teaching?

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;u&gt;'''A Little Bit About Myself....'''&lt;/u&gt;

Hello. My name is Kelly Alperin and I am currently living in Norfolk, VA. When I am not working or studying for classes, I like to utilize my free time doing things outdoors. My favorite hobbies include hiking, backpacking and camping. I love the beach and in the summer time that is where I a most likely to be found.

As far as work goes, I am currently teaching Environmental Science at Granby High School. I have taught Biology in the past, but really enjoy the content of Environmental. I think it is important to try to instill an appreciation in students (or at least try to) for natural things in the world around us and my subject area gives me a lot of freedom to try and do just that!

&lt;u&gt;'''My Educational Philosophy'''&lt;/u&gt;

I have been in school or have taken college classes for the greater part of my life and have had the privledge to have had several different teachers, each with a uniqueness that made them memorable. I have learned from experience what teaching styles I prefer and know which ones simply do not work for my personal style of learning. Although the individual teachers I have had differ, the traits which make a teacher a 'good' teacher seem to overlap. In my opinion, being a good teacher goes far beyond the classroom setting. The best teachers I had were the ones that showed an interest not only in instruction, but in the student as an individual. In my opinion, getting to know a person and showing that you truely care can have an impact equal to or greater than any knowledge that may be gained in the classroom.
 

As far as insructional strategies go, I am still trying to figure out which ones are most effective. I consider my teaching style and ability as a work in progress. Because I was in the collegiate setting for so many years before I started teaching high school, I was accustomed to learning predominately through taking notes from lectures given by my professors. Learning in a teacher centered classroom was 'normal' to me and when I first started teaching, this was exactly how I attempted to present new material to my student's. However, I am slowly changing my teaching style to include more student centered and hands on activities. I have found that my students enjoy this style of learning and feel that they tend to retain more information because they are able to personalize the whole learning experience.


There are several different ways one can address the topic of diversity in the classroom. As far as special needs students are concerned, I truly feel that in certain cases, special needs students should not be included in general education classes unless there is a co-teacher present. I have had classes where up to 30 percent of the students had learning disabilities and no co-teacher was provided. I personally found it difficult to differentiate my lessons enough so that those students who needed extra help and time received the help they needed and those students who were ready to move on to new topics could do so in a timely manner. I think that for all students to learn at a pace deemed 'normal' for the individual, that students should be seperated if the resources are available to do so. I feel this will make the both the learning and teaching process more effective for all parties involved.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello All!

My name is Elizabeth and I am a senior at ODU. I have been a senior for quite some time now, just taking one to two classes at a time to finish up my degree in elementary ed. I have about six more classes left! :) I am taking this class at the Va Beach center although I take a majority of my classes on campus in Norfolk. I work a full time job of 40+ hours at the NAS Oceana Youth Center in Virginia Beach. I am the teen coordinator there so my primary job is to work with the big kids - can be a challenge, but also a lot of fun and excitement with amazing trips like white water rafting, skiing, and next summer - Italy!

I have a large family - oldest of six siblings and I am very close to all of them. A majority of my spare time (which is not much) is spent with friends and family and most recently working on my new home that I just moved into this past weekend! I love art, reading, being outdoors, and am a huge movie buff. I have been working with kids for 10+ years and am looking forward to one day having a classroom of my own! :)

My Educational Philosophy:

I think being a good teacher is really something you have to want to be - it is not going to happen over night and it is not going to happen just because you get a degree. Being a teacher that actually reaches children requires a desire, a will to work hard, be consistent, be caring and nuturing and then also having the much needed education to actually teach the required material. I want to be the kind of teacher that students will remember. I had a fifth grade teacher, Ms. Simpson, that I remember so much more about than all my teachers, even my high school teachers. She made learning fun and we did so many interactive activities that tied into the material that I truly couldn't tell you exactly when I learned the things I learned. I just remember that I wanted to go to school because of how amazing she was as an educator and as an individual. She was there for her students both in the educational sense but also was in tune with what was going on in our daily lives and she showed that she cared without becoming unprofessionally involved with her student's personal lives. I hope that one day I can learn this finesse, this attitude that will make be the teacher that a student can remember in detail, nearly twenty years later.

For me, I think I have also learned a lot about the kind of teacher I want to be through my current job. I have worked with children for ten years and although it is not a typical classroom setting, I have dealt with a very diverse group of kids. We have &quot;at-risk&quot; youth at our center and we have students with learning disabilities as well as physical disabilities and the experience I gained just from daily interactions with children who don't fit the norm, I believe, will be invaluable to me when I become a teacher. I definitely believe that every student is different, with different learning styles and different abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. To ignore those differences rather than celebrating them will not only cause the students to dislike school but it will give the teacher more work and it will take away the opportunity to teach the kids about diversity and how being different from one another is also a way to learn more about the world. I plan on (hopefully) learning about different methods to teach the same topics because I had a hard time in school when a teacher taught to primarily the visual learner. I am a kinesthetic learner so I learn best by doing and half the time I ended up having to take extra work home and teach myself because I just couldn't get it when it was just written on the board. I had to do, so I hope to be a teacher that really is able to plan based upon the learning style makeup in the classroom.

My classroom environment is something that I haven't really thought about. I hope that I am able to create an inviting atmosphere, one that encourages interaction amongst the teachers, students, and parents alike. This is one area that I really want to learn more about and try to find what I think would fit with my teaching style. Technology is also a topic that I need some time to think about. Who knows what technology will be available once I actually get my own classroom? I do know that it is definitely important to give the students the education about technology because it is becoming pretty impossible to be technologically illiterate and still succeed in our society. Overall, I think that I still have some soul searching to do to figure out exactly how I want to approach being a teacher. I have some old habits to break, based upon working in the child care industry for so long and I also need a lot more experience with creating lesson plans based upon required curriculum and SOLS. I am really looking forward to being a teacher and I hope that I am able to bring all my goals, ideas, and values about teaching to fruition.</text>

Hi!
Kudos to you for returning to school!  I know that must have been quite a transition for you, having been out of school for so long...I know I was a bit disoriented after only one semester off last year.  
You have wonderful ideas on the need for bilingual education.  Spanish is becoming more commonly spoken in the U.S., whether we like it or not, so it would probably be useful for us to be able to speak it fluently.  Also, bilingual education is simply a good thing in itself.
I also liked your philosophy on teaching culture and geography along with another language.  It's definitely important--now more than ever--to know what is going on in the rest of the world and to broaden one's horizons.
Sincerely,
Sommer Alexander</text>

      <comment>/* Class Methods */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ruby Programming/TopNav|prev=Writing methods|next=Exceptions}}

== Ruby Classes ==

As stated before, everything in Ruby is an object. Every object has a class. To find the class of an object, simply call that object's &lt;tt&gt;class&lt;/tt&gt; method. For example, try this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
    puts &quot;This is a string&quot;.class
    puts 9.class
    puts [&quot;this&quot;,&quot;is&quot;,&quot;an&quot;,&quot;array&quot;].class
    puts {:this =&gt; &quot;is&quot;, :a =&gt; &quot;hash&quot;}.class
    puts :symbol.class
&lt;/source&gt;

Anyhow, you should already know this. What you don't know however, is how to make your own classes and extend Ruby's classes.

== Creating Instances of a Class ==

An instance of a class is an object that has that class. For example, &lt;tt&gt;&quot;chocolate&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is an instance of the String class. You already know that you can create strings, arrays, hashes, numbers, and other built-in types by simply using quotes, brackets, curly braces, etc., but you can also create them via the &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; method. For example, &lt;tt&gt;my_string = &quot;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;tt&gt;my_string = String.new&lt;/tt&gt;. Every class has a &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; method: arrays, hashes, integers, whatever. When you create your own classes, you'll use the &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; method to create instances.

== Creating Classes ==

Classes represent a type of an object, such as a book, a whale, a grape, or chocolate. Everybody likes chocolate, so let's make a chocolate class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
    class Chocolate
      def eat
        puts &quot;That tasted great!&quot;
      end
    end
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's take a look at this. Classes are created via the &lt;tt&gt;class&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. After that comes the name of the class. All class names must start with a Capital Letter. By convention, we use CamelCase for class name. So we would create classes like PieceOfChocolate, but not like Piece_of_Chocolate.

The next section defines a class method. A class method is a method that is defined for a particular class. For example, the String class has the &lt;tt&gt;length&lt;/tt&gt; method:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
    # outputs &quot;5&quot;
    puts &quot;hello&quot;.length
&lt;/source&gt;

To call the &lt;tt&gt;eat&lt;/tt&gt; method of an instance of the Chocolate class, we would use this code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
    my_chocolate = Chocolate.new
    my_chocolate.eat # outputs &quot;That tasted great!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also call a method by using &lt;tt&gt;send&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
    &quot;hello&quot;.send(:length) # outputs &quot;5&quot;
    my_chocolate.send(:eat) # outputs &quot;That tasted great!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

However, using &lt;tt&gt;send&lt;/tt&gt; is rare unless you need to create a dynamic behavior, as we do not need to specify the name of the method as a literal - it can be a variable.

== Self ==

Inside a method of a class, the pseudo-variable &lt;tt&gt;self&lt;/tt&gt; (a pseudo-variable is one that cannot be changed) refers to the current instance. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
    class Integer
      def more
        return self + 1
      end
    end
    3.more # -&gt; 4
    7.more # -&gt; 8
&lt;/source&gt;

== Class Methods ==

You can also create methods that are called on a class rather than an instance. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
    class Strawberry
      def Strawberry.color
        return &quot;red&quot;
      end
 
      def self.size
        return &quot;kinda small&quot;
      end
 
      class &lt;&lt; self
        def shape
          return &quot;strawberry-ish&quot;
        end
      end
    end
    Strawberry.color # -&gt; &quot;red&quot;
    Strawberry.size  # -&gt; &quot;kinda small&quot;
    Strawberry.shape # -&gt; &quot;strawberry-ish&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the three different constructions: &lt;tt&gt;ClassName.method_name&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;self.method_name&lt;/tt&gt; are essentially the same - outside of a method definition in a class block, &lt;tt&gt;self&lt;/tt&gt; refers to the class itself. The latter is preferred, as it makes changing the name of the class much easier. The last construction, &lt;tt&gt;class &lt;&lt; self&lt;/tt&gt;, puts us in the context of the class's &quot;meta-class&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;eigenclass&quot;). The meta-class is a special class that the class itself belongs to. However, at this point, you don't need to worry about it. All this construct does is allow us to define methods without the &lt;tt&gt;self.&lt;/tt&gt; prefix.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A diode ==

In electronics, a diode is a two-terminal device. Diodes have two active electrodes between which the signal of interest may flow, and most are used for their unidirectional current property.The most common function of a diode is to allow an electric current to pass in one direction (called the forward biased condition) and to block it in the opposite direction (the reverse biased condition). Thus, the diode can be thought of as an electronic version of a check valve. Real diodes do not display such a perfect on-off directionality but have a more complex non-linear electrical characteristic, which depends on the particular type of diode technology. Diodes also have many other functions in which they are not designed to operate in this on-off manner.

== A current mirror ==
A current mirror is a circuit designed to copy a current through one active device by controlling the current in another active device of a circuit, keeping the output current constant regardless of loading. The current being 'copied' can be, and sometimes is, a varying signal current. Conceptually, an ideal current mirror is simply an ideal current amplifier. The current mirror is used to provide bias currents and active loads to circuits.

[[File:Air Force welding.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|A welder for the US Air Force]]
'''Welding''' is one of the most important trades of the world in which we live. Welding is defined as 'the fusing of two or more pieces of metal or plastic'. It binds the office buildings in which we work, the malls where we hang out, and in every car that we will ever drive. 

Welding is a 'skilled trade', which means that not everyone can pick up a welding torch and build something, it must be learned. Because of this, welders are often paid well or above average wages. Interested? It actually doesn't take too long to learn, in some cases a journey person status can be reached in as little as 3 years. The skilled welder has a steady hand, good hand-eye coordination, and good working ethics.

A vector space endowed by a topology that makes translations (i.e., &lt;math&gt;x + y&lt;/math&gt;) and dilations (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\alpha x&lt;/math&gt;) continuous is called ''a topological vector space'' or ''TVS'' for short.

A subset &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; of a TVS is said to be:
* ''bounded'' if for every neighborhood &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there exist &lt;math&gt;s &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;E \subset t V&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;t &gt; s&lt;/math&gt;
* ''balanced'' if &lt;math&gt;\lambda E \subset E&lt;/math&gt; for every scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|\lambda| \le 1&lt;/math&gt;
* ''convex'' if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y \in E&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x, y \in E&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''1 Corollary''' ''&lt;math&gt;(s + t)E = sE + tE&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;s, t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is convex.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Supposing &lt;math&gt;s + t = 1&lt;/math&gt; we obtain &lt;math&gt;s x + t y \in E&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in E&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is convex,
:&lt;math&gt;{s \over s + t} x + {t \over s + t} y \in E&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;sx + sy \in (s+t)E&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x, y \in E&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;(s + t)E \subset sE + tE&lt;/math&gt; holds in general, the proof is complete.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda, x) = \lambda x&lt;/math&gt; for scalars &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a balanced set, for any &lt;math&gt;|\lambda| \le 1&lt;/math&gt;, by continuity,
:&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda, \overline{E}) \subset \overline{f(\lambda, E)} \subset \overline{E}&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, the closure of a balanced set is again balanced. In the similar manner, if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is convex, for &lt;math&gt;s, t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f((s + t), \overline{E}) = \overline{f((s+t), E)} = \overline{sE + tE}&lt;/math&gt;,
meaning the closure of a convex set is again convex. Here the first equality holds since &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is injective if &lt;math&gt;\lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, the interior of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;E^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, is also convex. Indeed, for &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 E^\circ + \lambda_2 E^\circ \subset E&lt;/math&gt;,
and since the left-hand side is open it is contained in &lt;math&gt;E^\circ&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, a ''subspace'' of a TVS is a subset that is simultaneously a linear subspace and a topological subspace. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be a subspace of a TVS. Then &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt; is a topological subspace, and it is stable under scalar multiplication, as shown by the argument similar to the above. Let &lt;math&gt;g(x, y) = x + y&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of a TVS, by continuity and linearity,
:&lt;math&gt;g(\overline{\mathcal{M}}, \overline{\mathcal{M}}) \subset \overline{g(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{M})} = \overline{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{M}}&lt;/math&gt; is a linear subspace. We conclude that the closure of a subspace is a subspace.

Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. By continuity there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;f(\{ \lambda; |\lambda| &lt; \delta \}, W) \subset V&lt;/math&gt;
It follows that the set &lt;math&gt;\{ \lambda; |\lambda| &lt; \delta \}W&lt;/math&gt; is a union of open sets, contained in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and is balanced. In other words, every TVS admits a local base consisting of balanced sets.

'''1 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a TVS, and &lt;math&gt;E \subset \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. The following are equivalent.''
* ''(i) &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is bounded.''
* ''(ii) Every countable subset of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is bounded.''

Proof: That (i) implies (ii) is clear. If (iii) is false, there exists a balanced neighborhood &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;E \not\subset nV&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;n = 1, 2, ...&lt;/math&gt;. That is, there is a unbounded sequence &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, ...&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, to show that (iii) implies (i), let &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; be a neighborhood of 0, and  &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a balanced open set with &lt;math&gt;0 \in V \subset U&lt;/math&gt;. Choose &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;E \subset t V&lt;/math&gt;, using the hypothesis. Then for any &lt;math&gt;s &gt; t&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;E \subset t V = s {t \over s} V \subset s V \subset s U&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''1 Corollary''' ''Every Cauchy sequence and every compact set in a TVS are bounded.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: If the set is not bounded, it contains a sequence that is not Cauchy and does not have a convergent subsequence. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''1 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a linear operator between TVSs. If &lt;math&gt;f(V)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded for some neighborhood &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.''&lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''6 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a linear functional on a TVS &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;.''
*''(i) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has either closed or dense kernel.''
*''(ii) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}f&lt;/math&gt; is closed.
Proof: To show (i), suppose the kernel of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not closed. That means: there is a &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; which is in the closure of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}f&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;f(y) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x - {f(x) \over f(y)}y&lt;/math&gt; is in the kernel of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. This is to say, every element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and some other element in &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}f&lt;/math&gt; is dense. (ii) If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}f = f^{-1}(\{0\})&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Conversely, suppose &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ker}f&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous when &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is identically zero, suppose there is a point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f(y) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Then there is a balanced neighborhood &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y + V \subset (\operatorname{ker}f)^c&lt;/math&gt;. It then follows that &lt;math&gt;\sup_V |f| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, suppose &lt;math&gt;|f(x)| \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;y - {x \over f(x)} \in \operatorname{ker}(f) \cap (y + V)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x \in V&lt;/math&gt;, which is a contradiction.
The continuity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; now follows from the lemma. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''6 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a TVS and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \subset \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; its subspace. Suppose:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is dense &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathcal{X}^* = 0 &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;z = 0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;.
(Note this is the conclusion of Corollary 2.something) Then every continuous linear function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on a subspace &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; extends to an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: We essentially repeat the proof of Theorem 3.8. So, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be the kernel of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, which is closed, and we may assume &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \ne \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, by hypothesis, we can find &lt;math&gt;g \in \mathcal{X}^*&lt;/math&gt; such that:&lt;math&gt;g = 0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;g(p) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; for some point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; outside &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. By Lemma 1.6, &lt;math&gt;g = \lambda f&lt;/math&gt; for some scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Since both &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; do not vanish at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda = { g(p) \over f(p) } \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;V_0, V_1, ...&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of subsets of a a linear space containing &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;V_{n+1} + V_{n+1} \subset V_n&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x \in V_{n_1} + ... + V_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2^{-n_1} + ... + 2^{-n_k} \le 2^{-m}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x \in V_m&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: We shall prove the lemma by induction over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The basic case &lt;math&gt;k = 1&lt;/math&gt; holds since &lt;math&gt;V_{n} \subset V_{n} + V_{n}&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, assume that the lemma has been proven until &lt;math&gt;k - 1&lt;/math&gt;. First, suppose &lt;math&gt;n_1, ..., n_k&lt;/math&gt; are not all distinct. By permutation, we may then assume that &lt;math&gt;n_1 = n_2&lt;/math&gt;. It then follows:
:&lt;math&gt;x \in V_{n_1} + V_{n_2} + ... + V_{n_k} \subset V_{n_2 - 1} + ... + V_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2^{-n_1} + ... 2^{-n_k} = 2^{-(n_2 - 1)} + ... + 2^{-n_k} \le 2^m&lt;/math&gt;.
The inductive hypothesis now gives: &lt;math&gt;x \in V_m&lt;/math&gt;. Next, suppose &lt;math&gt;n_1, ..., n_k&lt;/math&gt; are all distinct. Again by permutation, we may assume that &lt;math&gt;n_1 &lt; n_2 &lt; ... n_k&lt;/math&gt;. Since no carry-over occurs then and &lt;math&gt;m &lt; n_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m+1 &lt; n_2&lt;/math&gt; and so:
:&lt;math&gt;2^{-n_2} + ... + 2^{-n_k} \le 2^{-(m+1)}&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, by inductive hypothesis, &lt;math&gt;x \in V_{n_1} + V_{m+1} \subset V_m&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''1 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a TVS.
* ''(i) If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff and has a countable local base, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is metrizable with the metric &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that''
::''&lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = d(x + z, y + z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(\lambda x, 0) \le d(x, 0)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;|\lambda| \le 1&lt;/math&gt;''
* ''(ii) For every neighborhood &lt;math&gt;V \subset \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there is a continuous function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; such that''
::''&lt;math&gt;g(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g = 1&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V^c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x + y) \le g(x) + g(y)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt;.''
Proof: To show (ii), let &lt;math&gt;V_0, V_1, ...&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of neighborhoods of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the condition in the lemma and &lt;math&gt;V = V_0&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;g = 1&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V^c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x) = \inf \{2^{-n_1} + ... + 2^{-n_k}; x \in V_{n_1} + ... + V_{n_k} \}&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in V&lt;/math&gt;. To show the triangular inequality, we may assume that &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(y)&lt;/math&gt; are both &lt;math&gt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, and thus suppose &lt;math&gt;x \in V_{n_1} + ... + V_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \in V_{m_1} + ... + V_{m_j}&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;x + y \in V_{n_1} + ... + V_{n_k} + V_{m_1} + ... + V_{m_j}&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, &lt;math&gt;g(x + y) \le 2^{-n_1} + ... + 2^{-n_k} + 2^{-m_1} + ... + 2^{-m_j}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking inf over all such &lt;math&gt;n_1, ..., n_k&lt;/math&gt; we obtain:
:&lt;math&gt;g(x + y) \le g(x) + 2^{-m_1} + ... + 2^{-m_j}&lt;/math&gt;
and do the same for the rest we conclude &lt;math&gt;g(x + y) \le g(x) + g(y)&lt;/math&gt;. This proves (ii) since &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and it is then continuous everywhere by the triangular inequality. Now, to show (i), choose a sequence of balanced sets &lt;math&gt;V_0, V_1, ...&lt;/math&gt; that is a local base, satisfies the condition in the lemma and is such that &lt;math&gt;V_0 = \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. As above, define &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \inf \{2^{-n_1} + ... + 2^{-n_k}; x \in V_{n_1} + ... + V_{n_k} \}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. For the same reason as before, the triangular inequality holds. Clearly, &lt;math&gt;f(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;f(x) \le 2^{-m}&lt;/math&gt;, then there are &lt;math&gt;n_1, ..., n_k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;2^{-n_1} + ... + 2^{-n_k} \le 2^{-m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in V_{n_1} + ... + V_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;x \in V_m&lt;/math&gt; by the lemma. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;f(x) \le 2^{-m}&lt;/math&gt; for &quot;every&quot; &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff. Since &lt;math&gt;V_n&lt;/math&gt; are balanced, if &lt;math&gt;|\lambda| \le 1&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda x \in V_{n_1} + ... + V_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;n_1, ..., n_k&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x \in V_{n_1} + ... + V_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt;.
That means &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda x) \le f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and in particular &lt;math&gt;f(x) = f(-(-x)) \le f(-x) \le f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Defining &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = f(x - y)&lt;/math&gt; will complete the proof of (i). In fact, the properties of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; we have collected shows the function &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is a metric with the desired properties. The lemma then shows that given any &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{x; f(x) &lt; \delta\} \subset V_m&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;\delta \le 2^m&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the sets &lt;math&gt;\{x; f(x) &lt; \delta\}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; forms a local base for the original topology. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

The second property of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; in (i) implies that open ball about the origin in terms of this &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is balanced, and when &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; has a countable local base consisting of convex sets it can be strengthened to:&lt;math&gt;d(\lambda x, y) \le \lambda d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;, which implies open balls about the origin are convex. Indeed, if &lt;math&gt;x, y \in V_{n_1} + ... + V_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2 \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 + \lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y \in V_{n_1} + ... + V_{n_k}&lt;/math&gt;
since the sum of convex sets is again convex. This is to say,
:&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y) \le \min \{ f(x), f(y) \} \le {f(x) + f(y) \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;
and by iteration and continuity it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda x) \le \lambda f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;|\lambda| \le 1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Corollary''' ''For every neighborhood &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of some point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, there is a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\overline{W} \subset V&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Since we may assume that &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, take &lt;math&gt;W = \{ x; g(x) &lt; 2^{-1} \}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''Corollary''' ''If every finite set of a TVS &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is closed, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; be given. By the preceding corollary we find an open set &lt;math&gt;V \subset \overline{V} \subset \{y\}^c&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

A TVS with a local base consisting of convex sets is said to be ''locally convex''. Since in this book we will never study non-Hausdorff locally convex spaces, we shall assume tacitly that every finite subset of every locally convex is closed, hence Hausdorff in view of Theorem something.

'''Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be locally convex. The convex hull of a bounded set is bounded.''

Given a sequence &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; of semi-norms, define:
:&lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty 2^{-n} {p_n(x - y) \over 1 + p_n(x - y)}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; then becomes a metric. In fact,
Since &lt;math&gt;(1 + p(x) + p(y)) p(x + y) \le (p(x) + p(y))(1 + p(x + y))&lt;/math&gt; for any seminorm &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) \le d(x, z) + d(z, y)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;!--
== Distributions ==

The support of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp}(u)&lt;/math&gt;, is the complement of the union of all the open sets &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u(w) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;w \in \mathcal{D}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{D}^'(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;u(w) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;w \in \mathcal{D}((\operatorname{supp}(u))^c)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem''' ''A distribution &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{D}^'(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; has compact support if and only if it can be extended to an continuous linear functional on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^\infty(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Theorem''' ''If &lt;math&gt;u \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\|\hat{u}\|_{L^2} = \|u\|_{L^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Proof: When &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;, the theorem is a special case of Theorem something. Using Theorem something we can find a sequence &lt;math&gt;u_j \in \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u_j \to u&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;-norm. It follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\|\hat{u_j} - \hat{u_k}\|_{L^2} = \|u_j - u_k\|_{L^2} \to 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, there is a limit &lt;math&gt;v \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{u_j} \to v&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;-norm and &lt;math&gt;v = \hat{u}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

== Avoidance ==

''The best way to resolve a dispute is to avoid it in the first place.'' Be respectful to others and their points of view. This means primarily: '''Do not simply revert changes in a dispute.'''

When someone makes an edit you consider biased or inaccurate, ''improve'' the edit rather than reverting it. Provide a good edit summary when making significant changes that other users might object to. The revision you would prefer will not be established by reverting. Discuss disputed changes on the talk page. If you encounter rude or inappropriate behavior, resist the temptation to respond unkindly, and [[WB:CIVIL|remain civil]]. 

Following the [[WB:NPOV|neutral point of view]] policy can help you write &quot;defensively&quot; and limit your own bias in your writing.

== Step One: Discuss ==

The first step in resolving a conflict is to discuss the issue. Use the talk page associated with the module in question or contact the other party on that user's talk page. Never carry on a dispute on the module page itself. When discussing an issue, stay cool and [[WB:ATTACK|do not mount personal attacks]]. Remember, [[WB:ATTACK|&quot;No personal attacks&quot;]] includes saying to another editor &quot;this needs a professional opinion from someone who knows what they are talking about&quot;. Take the other person's perspective into account and try to reach a compromise. Find specific areas where there is agreement, and build on those areas rather than focusing on areas of disagreement. Assume that the other person is acting in good faith unless you have clear evidence to the contrary.

Both at this stage and throughout the dispute resolution process, talking to other parties is not simply a formality to be satisfied before moving on to the next stage. Sustained discussion, respectful consideration, and serious negotiation, even if not immediately successful, shows that you are interested in finding a good solution. Failure to pursue discussion in good faith shows that you are trying to escalate the dispute instead of resolving it. Take a long-term view. The wiki process is designed to be self-healing. The disputed section will continue to evolve and other editors may become interested and bring in different perspectives.

Often the most important thing is to '''stay calm'''. If the situation is making you angry, your immediate comments and reactions might not be something you'll be proud of later, and making the person you're having a dispute with angry isn't going to help. A few things that might be helpful at this stage include:

*Writing replies (even angry ones) but ''not saving them'' until you've had time to cool your temper.
*Taking a break from the conflict for a few days.
*Asking a friend to have a look (either another Wikibookian, a fellow contributor from other wikis, &quot;real life&quot; friends, web forum friends, etc.)

It's also not always a bad idea to make a formal [[WB:RFC|request for comments]] (see Step Three, below) '''before''' it becomes a heated argument, if you think it might be headed that way. Also remember that our policy on Wikibooks is that we should all [[WB:CIVIL|be civil]] in our dealings with one another: rather than responding in kind, please [[WB:AN|notify the administrators]] if the person you are having a conflict is not following this policy.

===Compromise===

Compromise, don't stifle other editors simply because you are certain that you are right.  

Textbooks are not leading edge publications and can contain consensus content that is out of date - students are given the best marks for &quot;textbook&quot; answers rather than right answers and, in a good institution, the very best marks for entering both.  The latest discoveries may need to be identified as such and entered alongside accepted wisdom.

In the case of content disputes there can sometimes be minority views in a particular field.  A textbook may contain such views in a separate section '''provided they are clearly labelled as such'''. However, it would be sensible to provide at least one peer reviewed reference for such a view to be included. 

In some cases it may become apparent that a book's scope is too large, and different approaches or focuses are interfering with one another. In such cases there may genuinely be a need for two books (see [[Wikibooks:Forking policy]]).

In the case of intractable disputes about presentation it may be useful for all parties to agree to engage the services of the Editorial Board for a binding decision.

== Step Two: Mediation ==

If things are getting a bit tricky, it might be useful to ask some cool heads to look in and help out; this might be sufficient to do the trick. Contact an experienced Wikibooks user or even an [[WB:ADMIN|administrator]] to help mediate the situation. Experienced editors are often well-versed in Wikibooks policies and editing styles. Bringing a mentor or leader into a book's discussion will often resolve any disputes as well as improve overall book quality and direction.  

In the case of content disputes, it is possible to ask the [[Wikibooks:Editorial board]] to act as a mediator, or to make a comment on the issue. The editorial board may decline such a request, however, at the discretion of the board members.  Disputants may agree between themselves that the mediation by the Editorial Board should be binding, this could be a good way of clearing an impasse so that the book can be completed.

== Step Three: Request for Comments ==

If mediation fails to produce an acceptable result, the issue may be raised to the entire community via a post in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General|reading room]]. The community will come to consensus on the matter, and the decision of the community is considered binding and final.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">For beginning Korean language students, learning the hanja is not necessary.  However, because so many Korean words come from Chinese roots, knowing hanja will be quite helpful in mastering enough vocabulary to become fluent in Korean.

== What are Hanja and why do we use them? ==
Hanja are Chinese characters that have been borrowed into the Korean language.  Like many languages, many Korean words are composed of roots, many of which are from the Chinese language.  In the quest of mastering a foreign language, learning the roots of the words is one approach for learning vocabulary.

== Just how many Hanja do I need to know? ==
There's no exact number that you need to know.  Since many people learn Korean without learning the characters, it is possible to know the language without learning any characters.  Around 2000 characters is a good number for learning how to read and recognize words.  The 1800 standardized Hanja set will cover the majority of the roots for the Sino-Korean words.
&lt;br&gt;

Below is 1 example of how Hanja can be used to remember words.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;*船 -- 선. Boat&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;*漁 -- 어. Fish&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;*夫 -- 부. Husband/father&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;*船 -- 선. Boat&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Korean a fisherman is 어부, and fishing boat is 어선.  The corresponding characters are 漁夫 and 漁船.
&lt;br&gt;


Before we list the standard 1800 character set, you need to learn the 214 radicals that make up the characters.
See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kangxi_radicals List_of_Kangxi_radicals] for the list of radicals.  You need to write them on flashcards and commit them to memory.  If you know the radicals, it will be easier to remember the characters and to look up unknown words in a dictionary when necessary.

All you have to do is copy the code they show you and it will show up. It doesnt look like they have many organized here. In en the link is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:USERBOXES|here]. For example, in en if i wanted to include a userbox about an interest in ancient rome i would put this on my page &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User:UBX/Rome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

We'll use the following database, to represent a section of [[w:Harry Potter universe#The_Black_family|this]] family tree.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 man(sirius_black).
 man(regulus_black).
 man(orion_black).
 man(cygnus_black).
 man(pollux_black).

 woman(bellatrix_black).
 woman(andromeda_black).
 woman(narcissa_black).
 woman(walburga_black).
 woman(druella_roisier).
 woman(irma_crabbe).

 parent(orion_black, sirius_black).
 parent(walburga_black, sirius_black).
 parent(orion_black, regulus_black).
 parent(walburga_black, regulus_black). 

 parent(cygnus_black, bellatrix_black).
 parent(druella_roisier, bellatrix_black).
 parent(cygnus_black, andromeda_black).
 parent(druella_roisier, andromeda_black).
 parent(cygnus_black, narcissa_black).
 parent(druella_roisier, narcissa_black).

 parent(pollux_black, walburga_black).
 parent(irma_crabbe, walburga_black).
 parent(pollux_black, cygnus_black).
 parent(irma_crabbe, cygnus_black).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

1. List the women in the database
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- woman(Woman).
 Woman = bellatrix_black ;
 Woman = andromeda_black ;
 Woman = narcissa_black ;
 Woman = walburga_black ;
 Woman = druella_roisier ;
 Woman = irma_crabbe.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

2. List the children in the database
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- parent(_, Child).
 Child = sirius_black ;
 Child = sirius_black ;
 Child = regulus_black ;
...
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

3. List all combinations of a father and his son.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- parent(Father, Son), man(Father), man(Son).
 Father = orion_black,
 Son = sirius_black ;
 Father = orion_black,
 Son = regulus_black ;
 Father = pollux_black,
 Son = cygnus_black ;
 fail.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

4. which women have both a father and a son in the database?
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 ?- woman(Woman), parent(Father, Woman), parent(Woman, Son), man(Father), man(Son).

 Woman = walburga_black,
 Father = pollux_black,
 Son = sirius_black;

 Woman = walburga_black,
 Father = pollux_black,
 Son = regulus_black ;

 fail.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


5. (Extra question) Can you think of a way to display those women that do not have a father listed in the database? Can you describe what you would need to write such a query??

You need to use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#Negation negation].

Rules to put inside db:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
hasFather(Somebody):-  parent(Father,Somebody), man(Father).
womenWithNoFather(Woman) :- woman(Woman), \+ hasFather(Woman).

&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Query:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
?- womenWithNoFather(Woman).

 Woman = druella_roisier ;
 Woman = irma_crabbe ;

fail.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Hi Amy!

Thanks for reviewing my article. Your suggestions were very helpful. I definitely agree about the paragraphs (or lack thereof!). For the last few years I've been working at a newspaper writing short sentences for paragraphs, which translated in this article. I'm going to heed your advice and try to combine them a little more. 

And I appreciate all of the compliments - I'm glad you enjoyed the article!

Hi Amy,

I can tell by your &quot;about the author's info and your &quot;teacher's philosophy&quot; that you are going to be a great teacher. I can feel the excitement you have towards your new career of teaching. I also believe that your experiences as a parent and social worker has prepared you for this new and exciting career. It is also evident that the love and the passion you share will be needed and greatly appreciated by your students and their parents as well. You are going to be a great asset to the profession of education. Good luck!Sjone085 (talk) 15:30, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

I agree with your philosophy of actually getting to know your students. I think that many students today are lacking a role model in their lives. They are lacking a person in their lives who wants them to succeed and pushes them to do their best. After reading your philosophy, it sounds like you would be the kind of teacher that would change the way students feel about learning for the better.
[[User:Aquenvil|Aquenvil]] ([[User talk:Aquenvil|talk]]) 20:05, 28 May 2008 (UTC)


Hi Amy,

I can already tell based on reading your &quot;about me&quot; section and also your teaching philosophy that you are going to be one amazing teacher.  It takes a really extraordinary person to be able to consule dying members of our society and their famalies, to be able to put all of that emotion aside to make even one day a little brigther for a person is an ability that I really wish that I had at times.  I think that these past experiences that you have described to us will enable you to get to know your students on a level that they should be able to understand.  I wish you all the luck in the world with you endeavers and if you need any assistence am always here in the virtual world to assist you.[[User:Sthur002|Sthur002]] ([[User talk:Sthur002|talk]]) 23:34, 31 May 2008 (UTC)



Hey Amy,

Its wonderful to be able to read about your life and your educational philosophy because is full of passion, love and energy. I think that your students can feel how important learning is for you. This gives them the desire to learn and fallow your step. On your philosophy I can see that you have great amount of qualities to be a successful teacher you set a safe, loving, and fun environment with achievable expectations. I really think that you are a good role model for your students. You are one of those in a life time teachers that you never forget when you become an adult. You are a bless lady and I wish I can meet you in person sometime. [[User:Amort007|Amort007]] ([[User talk:Amort007|talk]]) 02:29, 2 June 2008 (UTC)


Hello Amy,

Wow! Your teaching philosophy is truly inspiring! I really admire all the positivity, enthusiasm, and energy you plan on bringing to your class and I hope I have a small part of that driving energy to bring to my future students. I totally agree with the idea of managing your classroom through positive reinforcement - I feel like this really teaches children what kind of behavior you are expecting, rather than coming down on a child when they make a mistake. I also agree with holding the children accountable for being productive and contributing members of your classroom - teaching kids to take pride in their contributions will give them that sense of usefulness and will make them feel ownership in their class and their role in the class. I really enjoyed reading your philosophy and I definitely think that your philosophy would provide an amazing learning environment for your students!    [[User:Ekett001|Ekett001]] ([[User talk:Ekett001|talk]]) 01:41, 2 June 2008 (UTC)



I understand and agree with you when you stated the students in your class will be eager to learn because they will see how important learning is to you.  When I was in school the teachers that I felt was getting something from us as well as what we were getting from them, made me wanted to participate even more and try harder so they could know that they made a difference.  I thank God for those teachers if it had not been for them I may not be in the profession I am trying to enter in now and I might not be the person I have become.  Some of my teachers really impacted my life in ways that I don't believe most of them knew. However, it wasn't really for them to know...I received the knowledge, power, strength, and determination from it and they will receive the blessing.  You are truly a gentle soul, the world really needs more people like you.  [[User:Pperk002|Pperk002]] ([[User talk:Pperk002|talk]]) 05:27, 31 May 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Volatile variables and Tasking ==

I've removed the example of a volatile variable used for various tasks. This usage presents several problems, even in uniprocessors. In that case it would be more illustrative to use an atomic variable instead of a volatile one. Although in some architectures the following code is possible (although probably not portable between different compilers):

 Shared_Counter : Integer_64;
 {{Ada/pragma|Volatile}} (Shared_Counter);

In architectures like SPARC the compiler would generate instructions that update the doubleword atomically. However, the compiler won't allow you to define the variable as Atomic because in a multiprocessor machine  doubleword updates to memory are not guaranteed to be atomic, even if performed by a single instruction. Of course, there is no problem in a uniprocessor machine (and if the compiler generates the adequate object code).

Anyway, using volatile '''or atomic''' variables for task communication presents several problems like multiple tasks updating the value, or executing over a multiprocessor or multicore platform. Probably the wikibook should reflect that... doesn't it? &amp;mdash;[[User:Suruena|surueña]] ([[User talk:Suruena|talk]]) 15:48, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

This page has incorrect information. The volatile qualifier from the C language does NOT guarantee atomic access. This is a big misconception.</text>

      <comment>/* The most efficient types */ Qualified the language on most efficient integral types</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Optimizing C++}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Some features of the C++ language, if properly used, allow to increase the speed of the resulting software.

In this section guidelines to exploit such features are presented.

=== The most efficient types ===

'''When defining an object to store an integer number, use the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; or the &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; type, except when a longer type is needed; when defining an object to store a character, use the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; type, except when the &lt;code&gt;wchar_t&lt;/code&gt; type is needed; and when defining an object to store a floating point number, use the &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; type, except when the &lt;code&gt;long double&lt;/code&gt; type is needed. If the resulting aggregate object is of medium or large size, replace each integer type with the smallest integer type that is long enough to contain it (but without using bit-fields) and replace the floating point types with the &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; type, except when greater precision is needed.'''

The &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; types are, by definition, the most efficient ones available on the platform that can hold at least a 16-bit range. If you only need 8-bit width and are compiling for an 8-bit processor then &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; might be more efficient, but otherwise one of the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; types is likely to be the most efficient type you can use.

The &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; type is two to three times less efficient than the &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; type, but it has greater precision.

Some processor types handle &lt;code&gt;signed char&lt;/code&gt; objects more efficiently, while others handle &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt; objects more efficiently.
Therefore, both in C and in C++, the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; type, which differs from the &lt;code&gt;signed char&lt;/code&gt; type, was defined as the most efficient character type for the target processor.

The &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; type can contain only small character sets; typically up to a maximum of 255 distinct characters.
To handle bigger character sets, you should use the &lt;code&gt;wchar_t&lt;/code&gt; type, although that is less efficient.

In the case of numbers contained in a medium or large aggregate object or in a collection that will be probably be of medium or large size, it is better to minimize the size in bytes of the aggregate object or collection.
This can be done by replacing primitives larger than word size with those that are word size for the processor.  A &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt; actually
takes up the same amount of memory as word size even though the field size of a short is less.

Bit-fields can also be used to minimize the size of aggregate objects, but as their handling is slower this can be counterproductive. Therefore, postpone their introduction until the optimization stage.

=== Function-objects ===

'''Instead of passing a function pointer as an argument to a function, pass a [[w:Function object|function-object]] (or, if using the [[w:C++11|C++11]] standard, a lambda expression).'''

For example, if you have the following array of structures:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
struct S {
    int a, b;
};
S arr[n_items];
&lt;/source&gt;

&amp;hellip; and you want to sort it by the &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; field, you could define the following comparison function:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
bool compare(const S&amp; s1, const S&amp; s2) {
    return s1.b &lt; s2.b;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&amp;hellip; and pass it to the standard sort algorithm:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
std::sort(arr, arr + n_items, compare);
&lt;/source&gt;

However, it is probably more efficient to define the following function-object class (aka ''functor''):

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
struct Comparator {
    bool operator()(const S&amp; s1, const S&amp; s2) const {
        return s1.b &lt; s2.b;
    }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

&amp;hellip; and pass a temporary instance of it to the standard sort algorithm:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
std::sort(arr, arr + n_items, Comparator());
&lt;/source&gt;

Function-objects are usually expanded ''inline'' and are therefore as efficient as in-place code, while functions passed by pointers are rarely inlined.  Lambda expressions are implemented as function-objects, so they have the same performance.

=== &lt;code&gt;qsort&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bsearch&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

'''Instead of the &lt;code&gt;qsort&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bsearch&lt;/code&gt; C standard library functions, use the &lt;code&gt;std::sort&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;std::lower_bound&lt;/code&gt; C++ standard library functions.'''

The former two functions require a function pointer as an argument, whereas the latter two may take a function-object argument (or, using the C++11 standard, a lambda expression). 
Pointers to functions are often not expanded inline and are therefore less efficient than function-objects, which are almost always inlined.

=== Encapsulated collections ===

'''Encapsulate (using a class) a collection that is accessible from several compilation units.'''

At design time, it is difficult to decide which data structure will have optimal performance when the software is used.
At optimization time, performance can be measured and it can be seen whether changes to the container type result in improvements, for example changing from &lt;code&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;std::list&lt;/code&gt;.
Such implementation changes can however propagate to users of the code.

If a collection is private to one compilation unit, implementation changes will only impact the source code of that unit and encapsulation of the collection is unnecessary.
If, however, the collection is not private (in other words, it is directly accessible from other compilation units) an implementation change could result in extensive change being necessary.
To make such optimization feasible, therefore, encapsulate the collection in a class whose interface does not change when the container implementation is changed.

STL containers already use this principle, but certain operations are still available only for some containers (like &lt;code&gt;operator[]&lt;/code&gt;, existing for &lt;code&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt;, but not for &lt;code&gt;std::list&lt;/code&gt;).

=== STL container usage ===

'''When using an STL container, if several equivalent expressions have the same performance, choose the more general expression.'''

For instance, call &lt;code&gt;a.empty()&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;a.size() == 0&lt;/code&gt;, call &lt;code&gt;iter != a.end()&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;iter &lt; a.end()&lt;/code&gt;, and call &lt;code&gt;distance(iter1, iter2)&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;iter2 - iter1&lt;/code&gt;.
The former expressions are valid for every container type, while the latter are valid only for some. The former are also no less efficient than the latter and may even be more efficient. For example, to get the size of a linked list the list must be traversed, whereas to see that it is empty is a constant time operation. 

Unfortunately, it is not always possible to write code that is equally correct and efficient for every type of container. Nevertheless, decreasing the number of statements that are dependent on the container type will decrease the number of statements that must be changed if the type of the container is later changed.

=== Choice of the default container ===

'''When choosing a variable-length container, if in doubt, choose a &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;.'''

For a data-set with a small number of elements, &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; is the most efficient variable-length container for any operation.

For larger collections, other containers may become more efficient for certain operations, but &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; still has the lowest space overhead (as long as there is no excess capacity) and the greatest locality of reference.

=== Inlined functions ===

'''If your compiler allows whole program optimization and automatic inline-expansion of functions, use such options and do not declare any functions &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt;. If such compiler features are not available, declare suitable functions as &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; in a header; suitable functions contain no more than three lines of code and have no loops.'''

Inline function-expansion avoids the function call overhead. The overhead grows as the number of function arguments increases.
In addition, since inline code is near to the caller code, it has better locality of reference.
And because the intermediate code generated by the compiler for inlined functions is merged with the caller code, it can be optimized more easily by the compiler.

Expanding inline a tiny function, such as a function containing only a simple assignment or a simple &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement, can result in a decrease in the size of the generated machine code.

Conversely, every time a function containing substantial code is inlined the machine code is duplicated and the total size of the program increases.

Inlined code is more difficult to profile. If a non-inlined function is a bottleneck, it can be found by the profiler. But if the same function is inlined wherever it is called, its run-time is scattered among many functions and the bottleneck cannot be detected by the profiler.

For functions containing substantial amounts of code, only performance critical ones should be declared &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; during optimization.

=== Symbols representation ===

'''To represent internal symbols, use enumerations instead of strings.'''

For example, instead of the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
const char* directions[] = { &quot;North&quot;, &quot;South&quot;, &quot;East&quot;, &quot;West&quot; };
&lt;/source&gt;

use the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
enum directions { North, South, East, West };
&lt;/source&gt;

An enumeration is implemented as an integer.
Compared to an integer, a string occupies more space and is slower to copy and compare.
(In addition, using strings instead of integers to represent internal state may introduce string comparison errors in code that deals with multiple locales.)

=== &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statements ===

'''If you have to compare an integer value with a set of constant values, instead of a sequence of &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements, use a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement.'''

For example, instead of the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if (a[i] == 1) f();
else if (a[i] == 2) g();
else if (a[i] == 5) h();
&lt;/source&gt;

write the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
switch (a[i]) {
case 1: f(); break;
case 2: g(); break;
case 5: h(); break;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Compilers may exploit the regularity of &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statements to apply some optimizations, in particular if the guideline &quot;Case values for &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statements&quot; in this section is applied.

=== Case values of &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statements ===

'''As constants for &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statements cases, use compact sequences of values, that is, sequences with no gaps or with few small gaps.'''

When compiling a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement whose case values comprise most of the values in an integer interval, instead of generating a sequence of &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements, an optimizing compiler will generate a ''jump-table''. The table is an array containing the start address of the code for each case. When executing the &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement, the table is used to jump to the code associated with the case number.

For example, the following C++ code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
switch (i) {
case 10:
case 13:
    func_a();
    break;
case 11:
    func_b();
    break;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

probably generates machine code corresponding to the following pseudo-code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// N.B.: This is not C++ code
static address jump_table[] = { case_a, case_b, end, case_a };
unsigned int index = i - 10;
if (index &gt; 3) goto end;
goto jump_table[index];
case_a: func_a(); goto end;
case_b: func_b();
end:
&lt;/source&gt;

Instead, the following C++ code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
switch (i) {
case 100:
case 130:
    func_a();
    break;
case 110:
    func_b();
    break;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

probably generates machine code corresponding to the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if (i == 100) goto case_a;
if (i == 130) goto case_a;
if (i == 110) goto case_b;
goto end;
case_a: func_a(); goto end;
case_b: func_b();
end:
&lt;/source&gt;

For so few cases, there is probably little difference between the two situations, but as the case count increases, the former code becomes more efficient, as it performs only one ''computed goto'' instead of a sequence of branches.

=== Case order in &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement ===

'''In &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statements, put typical cases first.'''

If the compiler does not use a ''jump-table'', cases are evaluated in order of appearance; therefore, fewer comparisons are performed for the more frequent cases.

=== Grouping function arguments ===

'''In a loop that calls a function with more arguments than there are registers, consider passing a struct or object instead.'''

For example, instead of the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; ++i) {
    f(i, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

consider writing the following:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
struct {
    int i;
    type a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8;
} s;
s.a1 = a1; s.a2 = a2; s.a3 = a3; s.a4 = a4;
s.a5 = a5; s.a6 = a6; s.a7 = a7; s.a8 = a8;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; ++i) {
    s.i = i;
    f(s);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If all function arguments can be placed directly into processor registers, the arguments can be passed and manipulated quickly. If there are more arguments than available registers, those arguments that could not be placed into registers will be pushed onto the stack at the start of every function call and removed from the stack at the end of the call. If a structure or object is passed, a register may be used and after initialization of the structure or object, only those parts of the structure or object that change between successive calls must be updated.

Compilers vary in the number of registers used for function arguments. Relying on the number used by any particular compiler version is unwise. Assuming that 4 registers are used is reasonable.

=== Use of container member functions ===

'''To search for an element in a container, use a container member function instead of an STL algorithm.'''

If a container provides a member function that duplicates a generic STL algorithm it is because the member function is more efficient. 

For example, to search a &lt;code&gt;std::set&lt;/code&gt; object, you can use the &lt;code&gt;std::find&lt;/code&gt; generic algorithm, or the &lt;code&gt;std::set::find&lt;/code&gt; member function. The former has linear complexity (O(n)), while the latter has logarithmic complexity (O(log(n))).

=== Search in sorted sequences ===

'''To search a sorted sequence, use the &lt;code&gt;std::lower_bound&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::upper_bound&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::equal_range&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;std::binary_search&lt;/code&gt; generic algorithms.'''

Given that all the cited algorithms use a logarithmic complexity (O(log(n))) binary search, they are faster than the &lt;code&gt;std::find&lt;/code&gt; algorithm, which uses a linear complexity (O(n)) sequential scan.

[[it:Ottimizzare C++/Scrivere codice C++ efficiente/Costrutti che migliorano le prestazioni]]

=== &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; member functions ===

'''In every class, declare every member function that does not access the non-&lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; members of the class as &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; .'''

In other words, declare all the member functions that you can as &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;.

In this way, the implicit &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; argument is not passed.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Tiffany,

Through my many years of experience I too can contest to the value of &quot;jumping into the fire&quot; rather than learning or teaching through lecture or text. While I was in high school I had an extreme difficulty learning foreign languages. It was so bad that I failed every course. However, while I was in the service I traveled nearly all of Europe and lived in Germany for three years. So once I actually moved to Germany I actually began to learn foreign languages. It truly was being &quot;thrown into the fire&quot; which made it possible for me learn foreign languages.


Thanks,

Hi,

I think those are great qualities for a History teacher. I like listening to lectures myself sometimes, sometimes I find projects all fluff and no subject, but a history teacher needs to bring history to life and get the students involved. We learn history not to just know about our past, but so we can learn from it and not make the same mistakes. Of course, that means that we make all new mistakes, but that's half the fun of life :)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Elizabeth!

Thanks for reviewing my article. I'm going to go through your suggestions and try to improve things. I felt it important to leave out anything about myself because I wanted to maintain the neutral point of view, but I'll let you know why I'm interested in this topic! I've always been concerned about including everyone in a classroom or in an office or social setting no matter how different we all may be, so I was interested in learning more about the theories academics have on including GLBTQ students. I was intrigued, after researching, how little things - like the way we discuss personal relationships - can have an impact on whether students feel a part of the group. Hope that helps explain things!

Hello Elizabeth,

Congratulations on your new home! I know that it is a big deal and how good it feels to be in your own home. It is great to hear from someone else who works with children in a non-traditional setting such as yours. I can relate to your responses since I too work with children that are not the standard or typical in a given society. It can be challenging but, like you seem to show, it can be very rewarding to you as a person.

As far your philosophy, I agree with just about everything you stated since I am in the same general situation. It is hard to state a philosophy on a subject with little experience and insight. However, just as the teaching staff has stated, I am sure we will develop our philosophies as well progress.

Thanks,

Hello Elizabeth,
 
I agree with all that you said about teaching and children. I also believe that teaching is something that you have to want to do. Like your teacher Ms. Simpson, you have to enjoy your work and be there for your students. If you have a teacher that does not want to do her/his work then you will have students that do not want to learn and do their work.

Hi Elizabeth,

I thouroughly enjoyed reading your philosophies on educatiion, and share your passion for embracing those who are 'outside the norm' or however you wish to describe students with extra challenges.  It is amazing the extent that we can, even as adults, continue to learn about the world, through working closely with a variety of children.  What exactly do you do in terms of your 10 years of working with kids? That is a great exented period of time, and it sounds like you will integrate your experiences nicely into the classroom setting.

Yo Elizabeth, 

I think that your experience with children will be very helpful to your teaching career. I thinl that the most important thing to consider is learning while having fun and just to cut out all the busy work and &quot;bull-crap&quot; that students have to endure on a daily basis. Best wishes!

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
When compared to C, C++ has some features that worsen efficiency if used inappropriately.

Some of these features are nevertheless quite efficient and can be used liberally when useful. However, their increased cost should be avoided when the feature is not needed.

Other features are instead quite inefficient and so should be used sparingly.

In this section, guidelines are presented for the avoidance of C++ features that worsen performance.

=== The &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; operator ===

'''Call the &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; operator only when you want to notify a user of the failure of the current command.'''

Raising an exception has a very high cost when compared to a function call. It requires thousands of processor cycles.
If an exception is raised only when a message is displayed on the user interface or written into a log file, there is a guarantee that it will not be performed too often without notice.

In contrast, if exceptions are made part of an algorithm, even if initially thought to be rare they may end up being performed too frequently.

=== &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; member functions ===

'''Define the destructor as &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; if and only if the class contains at least one other &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; member function or if the class might be derived from (i.e. the class is intended for use as a base class). With the exception of destructors, do not declare functions as &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; unless you intend to override them.'''

Classes that have &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; member functions occupy more storage space than those without. Instances of classes having at least one &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; member function occupy more space (typically, a pointer and possibly some padding) and their construction requires more time (typically, to set the pointer) than instances of classes without &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; member functions.

In addition, every &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; member function has a slower call time than an identical non-&lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; member function.

=== &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; inheritance ===

'''Use &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; inheritance only when several classes must share the representation of a common base class.'''

For example, consider the following class definitions:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class A { ... };
class B1: public A { ... };
class B2: public A { ... };
class C: public B1, public B2 { ... };
&lt;/source&gt;

With such definitions, every C class object contains two distinct class A objects, one inherited from the B1 base class, and the other from the B2 class.

This is no problem if class A has no non-&lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; member variables.

If, instead, class A contains some member variables and you mean that such member variables are unique for every class C instance, you must use &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; inheritance, in the following way:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class A { ... };
class B1: virtual public A { ... };
class B2: virtual public A { ... };
class C: public B1, public B2 { ... };
&lt;/source&gt;

This situation is the only case when &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; derivation is necessary.

The member functions of the class A are somewhat slower to call on a C class object if &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; inheritance is used.

=== Templates of polymorphic classes ===

'''Do not define templates of polymorphic classes.'''

In other words, don't use the &quot;&lt;code&gt;template&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and the &quot;&lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt;&quot; keywords in the same class definition.

Every time a class template is instantiated a copy is made of all member functions used. If such classes contain virtual functions, even their ''vtable'' and ''RTTI'' data is replicated.
This data bloats the code.

=== Use of automatic deallocators ===

'''Use a memory manager based on [[w:Garbage collection|garbage-collection]] or a kind of [[w:Reference counting|reference-counted]] [[w:Smart pointer|smart-pointer]] (like &lt;code&gt;shared_ptr&lt;/code&gt; in the [http://www.boost.org/ Boost] library) only if you can prove its expediency for the specific case.'''

Garbage collection, or automatic reclamation of unreferenced memory, allows the programmer to leave out calls for memory deallocation and prevents [[w:Memory leak|memory leaks]].
However, one must implement garbage collection through a non-standard library since these features are not included in C++. In addition, code using garbage collection typically executes more slowly than code using explicit deallocation (when the &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; operator is explicitly called).
In addition, when the garbage collector runs the rest of the program doesn't.  This makes execution of the program less deterministic. 

The C++98 standard library contains only one kind of smart-pointer, &lt;code&gt;auto_ptr&lt;/code&gt;, that is quite efficient. Other smart-pointers provided by non-standard libraries, such as Boost, will be provided by the C++11 standard library.
Smart-pointers rely upon reference-counting but are less efficient than simple pointers. For example, &lt;code&gt;shared_ptr&lt;/code&gt; is the standard Boost smart pointer. However, if the thread-safe version of Boost is used, the library has very poor performance for creation, destruction and copying of these pointers as it must guarantee mutual exclusion for these operations.

Usually, you should try to assign every dynamically allocated object to a single owner at design time.
When such an assignment is difficult, for example if several objects tend to bounce the responsibility to destroy the object, it becomes expedient to use a reference-counted smart-pointer to handle the object.

=== The &lt;code&gt;volatile&lt;/code&gt; modifier ===

'''Only variables that are changed asynchronously by hardware devices should be defined &lt;code&gt;volatile&lt;/code&gt;.'''

The usage of the &lt;code&gt;volatile&lt;/code&gt; modifier prevents the compiler from locating a variable in a register, even for a short time.
This guarantees that all devices ''see'' the same variable, but slows down operations that access the variable.

&lt;code&gt;volatile&lt;/code&gt; does '''not''' guarantee that other threads will see the same values, as it does not force the compiler to generate the necessary memory barrier and lock instructions.  Therefore, read and write access to a volatile value may be made out of order even on the same CPU (important in the case of interrupts and signals) and especially out of order across the memory cache and bus to other CPUs.  You '''must''' use a proper thread or atomic memory API or write machine code to guarantee the proper order of operations for safe threading.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Optimizing C++}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Construction and destruction of an object requires time, especially if the object owns other objects.

This section will provide guidelines for decreasing the number of object constructions and corresponding destructions.

=== Variable scope ===

'''Declare variables as late as possible.'''

To do so, the programmer must declare all variables in the most local scope. By doing so, the variable is neither constructed nor destructed if that scope is never reached. Postponing declaration as far as possible within a scope means that should there be an early exit before the  declaration (using a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; statement) the object associated to the variable is neither constructed nor destructed.

It is often the case that at the beginning of a routine no appropriate value is available with which to initialize a variable. The variable is therefore initialized with a default value and a later assignment sets the correct value when it becomes available.
If, instead, the variable is defined only when an appropriate value is available, the object is initialized with this value and no subsequent assignment is necessary.  This is advised by the guideline &quot;Initializations&quot; in this section.

=== Initializations ===

'''Use initializations instead of assignments. In particular, in constructors, use initialization lists.'''

For example, instead of writing:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string s;
...
s = &quot;abc&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

write:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string s(&quot;abc&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

Even if a class instance (s in the first example above) is not explicitly initialized, it is nevertheless automatically initialized by the default constructor.

To call the default constructor followed by an assignment with a value may be less efficient than to call only a constructor with the same value.

=== Increment/decrement operators ===

'''Use prefix increment (&lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt;) or decrement (&lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;) operators instead of the corresponding postfix operators if the expression value is not used.'''

If the incremented object is a primitive type, there is no difference between prefix and postfix operators. However, if it is a composite object, the postfix operator causes the creation of a temporary object, while the prefix operator does not.

Because every object that is a primitive type may become a composite object in the future, it is better to use the prefix operator whenever possible, especially when writing generic (templatized) code that operates on iterators.

Use the postfix operator only when the variable is in a larger expression and must be incremented only after the expression is evaluated.

=== Assignment composite operators ===

'''Use the assignment composite operators (like in &lt;code&gt;a += b&lt;/code&gt;) instead of simple operators combined with assignment operators (like in &lt;code&gt;a = a + b&lt;/code&gt;).'''

For example, instead of the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string s1(&quot;abc&quot;);
string s2 = s1 + &quot; &quot; + s1;
&lt;/source&gt;

write the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string s1(&quot;abc&quot;);
string s2 = s1;
s2 += &quot; &quot;;
s2 += s1;
&lt;/source&gt;

Typically, a simple operator creates a temporary object.
In the example, the operator &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; creates temporary strings whose creation and destruction require much time.

On the contrary, the equivalent code using the &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; operator does not create temporary objects.

=== Function argument passing ===

'''When you pass an object &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; as argument to a function, use the following criterion:
* '''If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an input-only argument,'''
** '''if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; may be null,'''
*** '''pass it by pointer to constant (&lt;code&gt;const T* x&lt;/code&gt;),'''
** '''otherwise, if &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is a fundamental type or an iterator or a function-object,'''
*** '''pass it by value (&lt;code&gt;T x&lt;/code&gt;) or by constant value (&lt;code&gt;const T x&lt;/code&gt;),'''
** '''otherwise,'''
*** '''pass it by reference to constant (&lt;code&gt;const T&amp; x&lt;/code&gt;),'''
* '''otherwise, i.e. if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an output-only or input/output argument,'''
** '''if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; may be null,'''
*** '''pass it by pointer to non-constant (&lt;code&gt;T* x&lt;/code&gt;),'''
** '''otherwise,'''
*** '''pass it by reference to non-constant (&lt;code&gt;T&amp; x&lt;/code&gt;).'''

Pass by reference is more efficient than pass by pointer as it facilitates variable elimination by the compiler and because the callee need not check whether the reference is valid or null. However, where the argument can be missing, it is more efficient to pass a NULL pointer, than to pass a reference to a possibly dummy object and a boolean indicating whether the reference is valid.

For objects that may be contained in one or two registers, pass by value is more efficient than pass by reference (or equally efficient). This applies to tiny objects, such as the fundamental types, iterators and function-objects.
For larger objects, pass by reference is more efficient than pass by value, as with the latter, the object must be copied onto the stack.

A composite object that is currently fast to copy might be passed efficiently by value.  However, unless the object is an iterator or a function-object (which are assumed always to copy efficiently), this technique is risky.  Future changes to the object might increase its size and make it more expensive to copy.
For example, if an object of class &lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt; contains only two &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;s, it could be efficiently passed by value; but if in the future a third &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; is added, or if the two &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;s become two &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;s, it could become more efficient pass by reference.

=== &lt;code&gt;explicit&lt;/code&gt; declaration ===

'''Declare as &lt;code&gt;explicit&lt;/code&gt; all constructors that receive only one argument, except for the copy constructors of concrete classes.'''

Non-&lt;code&gt;explicit&lt;/code&gt; constructors may be called automatically by the compiler when it performs an automatic (implicit) type conversion.
The execution of such constructors may take much time.

If such conversion is made compulsorily explicit, and if a new class name is not specified in the code, the compiler could choose another overloaded function, avoiding to call the costly constructor, or it could generate an error, so forcing the programmer to choose another way to avoid the constructor call.

For copy constructors of concrete classes a distinction must be made to allow their pass by value.
For abstract classes, even copy constructors may be declared &lt;code&gt;explicit&lt;/code&gt;, as, by definition, abstract classes cannot be instantiated and so objects of such type should never be passed by value.

=== Conversion operators ===

'''Declare conversion operators only to keep compatibility with an obsolete library (in C++11, declare them &lt;code&gt;explicit&lt;/code&gt;).'''

Conversion operators allow implicit conversions and so incur in the same problem as implicit constructors described in the guideline &quot;&lt;code&gt;explicit&lt;/code&gt; declaration&quot; in this section.

If such conversions are needed, provide instead an equivalent member function, as it may only be called explicitly.

The only acceptable remaining usage for conversion operators is when a new library must coexist with an older similar library.
In such a case, it may be convenient to have operators that automatically convert objects from the old library into the corresponding types of the new library and vice versa.

=== The ''Pimpl'' idiom ===

'''Use the [[w:Opaque pointer|''Pimpl'']] idiom only when you want to make the rest of the program independent from the implementation of a class.'''

The ''Pimpl'' idiom (meaning '''P'''ointer to '''impl'''ementation) consists of storing in an object only a pointer to a data structure containing all the useful information about the object.

The main advantage of the idiom is that it speeds up incremental compilation of code by making it less likely that a small change in the source code causes the need to recompile a large number of code lines.

This idiom also makes some operations more efficient, such as a &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; of two objects. In general, however, it slows down every access to the object data because of the added level of indirection and causes an additional memory allocation each time such an object is created or copied.
It should not, therefore, be used for classes whose public member functions are called frequently.

=== Iterators and function objects ===

'''Ensure that custom iterators and function objects are tiny and do not allocate dynamic memory.'''

STL algorithms pass such objects by value. Therefore, if their copy is not extremely efficient, STL algorithms are slowed down.

If an iterator or function object for some reason needs an elaborate internal state, allocate it dynamically and use a shared pointer. For example, say you want to implement an STL-compliant 32-bit [http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/RandomNumberGenerator.html Random Number Generator] on top of the Linux/OpenBSD &lt;code&gt;/dev/urandom&lt;/code&gt; device:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;boost/shared_ptr.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;

class urandom32 {
        boost::shared_ptr&lt;std::ifstream&gt; device;

  public:
        urandom32() : device(new std::ifstream(&quot;/dev/urandom&quot;)) { }

        uint32_t operator()()
        {
                uint32_t r;
                device-&gt;read(reinterpret_cast&lt;char *&gt;(&amp;r), sizeof(uint32_t));
                return r;
        }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, the use of a pointer was actually necessary because the &lt;code&gt;ifstream&lt;/code&gt; class is non-copyable: its copy constructor is declared &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;. This example uses the &lt;code&gt;boost::shared_ptr&lt;/code&gt; smart pointer; for more speed, intrusive reference counting could be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Optimizing C++}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation are very slow operations when compared to automatic memory allocation and deallocation. In other words, the heap is much slower than the stack.

In addition, dynamic allocation has a per-allocation overhead, causes virtual memory fragmentation, and causes bad data locality of reference, with the ensuing bad usage of both the processor data cache and virtual memory space.

Dynamic memory allocation/deallocation was performed in the C language using the &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; standard library functions.
In C++, although these functions are still available, the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;new[]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;delete[]&lt;/code&gt; operators are normally used.

An obvious way to decrease the allocation count is to decrease the number of constructed objects and for that you should refer to the section &quot;Constructions and destructions&quot; in this chapter.

Here we concentrate on guidelines for decreasing the allocation count for a given number of &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; operator calls.

=== Fixed length arrays ===

'''If a static or non-large array has compile-time constant length, instead of a &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; object, use a C-language array, std::array, or an &lt;code&gt;array&lt;/code&gt; object from the [http://www.boost.org Boost] library.'''

&lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;s store data in a dynamically allocated buffer, whereas arrays allocate data inside the object itself.
This avoids repeated allocations/deallocations of dynamic memory and favors data locality.

If the array is large, such advantages are diminished and it becomes more important to avoid using too much stack space.

=== Allocating many small objects ===

'''If you have to allocate many objects of the same size, use a block allocator.'''

A [[w:Memory pool|''block allocator'']] (aka ''pool allocator'') allocates medium to large memory blocks and provides a service to allocate/deallocate smaller, fixed-size blocks. It allows high allocation/deallocation speed, low memory fragmentation and efficient use of data caches and of virtual memory.

In particular, an allocator of this kind can greatly improve the performance of the &lt;code&gt;std::list&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::set&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::multiset&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;std::multimap&lt;/code&gt; standard containers.

If your standard library implementation does not already use a block allocator for such containers, you should get one and specify it as a template parameter of instances of such container templates. [[C++ Programming/Libraries/Boost|Boost]] provides two customizable block allocators, [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_38_0/libs/pool/doc/interfaces/pool_alloc.html &lt;code&gt;pool_allocator&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fast_pool_allocator&lt;/code&gt;]. Other pool allocator libraries can be found on the World Wide Web. Always measure first to find the fastest allocator for the job at hand.

=== Appending elements to a collection ===

'''When you have to append elements to a collection, use &lt;code&gt;push_back&lt;/code&gt; to append a single element, use &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt; to append a sequence of elements, and use &lt;code&gt;back_inserter&lt;/code&gt; to cause an STL algorithm to append elements to a sequence.'''

The &lt;code&gt;push_back&lt;/code&gt; functions guarantees an amortized linear time, as, in case of &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;s, it increases the capacity exponentially.

The &lt;code&gt;back_inserter&lt;/code&gt; class calls the &lt;code&gt;push_back&lt;/code&gt; function internally.

The &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt; function allows a whole sequence to be inserted in an optimized way and therefore a single &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt; call is faster than many calls to &lt;code&gt;push_back&lt;/code&gt;.

This section presents guidelines for improving main-memory access performance by exploiting features of the processor caches and of secondary memory swapping by the operating system virtual memory manager.

=== Memory access order ===

'''Access memory in increasing addresses order. In particular:
* '''scan arrays in increasing order;'''
* '''scan multi-dimensional arrays using the rightmost index for innermost loops;'''
* '''in class constructors and in assignment operators (&lt;code&gt;operator=&lt;/code&gt;), access member variables in the order of declaration.'''

Data caches optimize memory access in increasing sequential order.

When a multi-dimensional array is scanned, the innermost loop should iterate on the last index, the innermost-but-one loop should iterate on the last-but-one index, and so on.
In such a way, it is guaranteed that array cells are processed in the same order in which they are arranged in memory.
For example, the following code is optimized:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
float a[num_levels][num_rows][num_columns];
for (int lev = 0; lev &lt; num_levels; ++lev) {
    for (int r = 0; r &lt; num_rows; ++r) {
         for (int c = 0; c &lt; num_columns; ++c) {
            a[lev][r][c] += 1;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Memory alignment ===

'''Keep the compiler default memory alignment.'''

By default, compilers use an alignment criterion for fundamental types, for which objects may have only memory addresses that are a multiple of particular factors.
Such criterion guarantees top performance, but it may add ''paddings'' (or ''holes'') between successive objects.

If it is necessary to avoid such paddings for some structures, use the ''pragma'' directive only around such structure definitions.

=== Grouping functions in compilation units ===

'''Define in the same compilation unit all the member functions of a class, all the &lt;code&gt;friend&lt;/code&gt; functions of the class, and all the member functions of &lt;code&gt;friend&lt;/code&gt; classes of the class, except when the resulting file becomes unwieldy because of its size.'''

In this way, both the machine code resulting from the compilation of the functions and the static data defined in the classes and functions will have adjacent addresses. In addition, even compilers that do not perform whole program optimization may optimize calls among these functions.

=== Grouping variables in compilation units ===

'''Define every global variable in the compilation unit in which it is used most often.'''

In this way, such variables will have addresses near to each other and to the static variables defined in such compilation units. In addition, even compilers that do not perform whole program optimization may optimize accesses to such variables from the functions that use them most often.

=== Private functions and variables in compilation units ===

'''Declare in an anonymous namespace the variables and functions that are global to a compilation unit, but that are not used by other compilation units.'''

In the C language and also in C++, such variables and functions may be declared &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;.
However, in modern C++, the use of &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; global variables and functions is not recommended and should be replaced by variables and functions declared in an anonymous namespace.

In both cases, the compiler is notified that such identifiers will never be used by other compilation units.
This allows compilers that do not perform whole program optimization to optimize the use of such variables and functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Optimizing C++}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

=== Worker thread ===

'''In an interactive application, whenever you must perform an operation that can take more than few seconds, assign the operation to a worker thread having a lower priority than normal.'''

In this way, the main thread is ready to handle new user commands and by assigning the worker thread a lower priority, the user interface remains responsive.

Strictly speaking, this guideline does not improve the speed of the application, only its responsiveness.
However, this is perceived by users as an improvement in speed.

=== Multiple worker threads ===

'''In a multicore system, if you can split an operation across several threads, use as many worker threads as there are processor cores.'''

In this way, every core can process a worker thread. If more worker threads are assigned than there are cores, the result will be heavy thread-switching, thus reducing execution speed. The main thread does not affect operational speed as it is mostly inactive.

=== Use of multi-threaded libraries ===

'''If you are developing a single-threaded application, don't use libraries designed only for multi-threaded applications.'''

The techniques used to make a library thread-safe may have memory and time overheads.
If you don't use threads, avoid paying their costs.

=== Creation of multi-threaded libraries ===

'''If you are developing a library, handle its use by multi-threaded applications correctly, but also optimize for cases where it is used by single-threaded applications.'''

The techniques used to make a library thread-safe may have memory and time overheads.
If the users of your library don't use threads, avoid forcing your users to pay the cost of threads.

=== Mutual exclusion ===

'''Use mutual exclusion primitives only when several threads access the same data concurrently and at least one of these accesses is for writing.'''

Mutual exclusion primitives have a overhead.

If you are sure that, in a given period, no thread is writing in a memory area, there is no need to synchronize read accesses for such area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Optimizing C++}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

=== Binary format ===

'''Instead of storing data in text mode, store them in a binary format.'''

On average, binary numbers occupy less space than formatted numbers, and so it is faster to transfer them from memory to disk or vice versa. Also, if the data is transferred in the same format used by the processor there is no need of costly conversions from text format to binary format or vice versa.

Some disadvantages of using a binary format are that data is not human-readable and that the format may be dependent on the processor architecture.

=== Open files ===

'''Instead of opening and closing an often needed file every time you access it, open it only the first time you access it, and close it when you are finished using it.'''

To close and reopen a disk file takes a variable time, but about the same time to read 15 to 20 KB from the disk cache.

Therefore, if you need to access a file often, you can avoid this overhead by opening the file only one time before accessing it, keeping it open by hoisting its handle wrapper to an external scope, and closing it when you are done.

=== I/O buffers ===

'''Instead of doing many I/O operations on single small or tiny objects, do I/O operations on a 4 KB buffer containing many objects.'''

Even if the run-time support I/O operations are buffered, the overhead of many I/O functions costs more than copying the objects into a buffer.

Larger buffers do not have a good locality of reference.

=== Memory-mapped file ===

'''Except in a critical section of a real-time system, if you need to access most parts of a binary file in a non-sequential fashion, instead of accessing it repeatedly with ''seek'' operations, or loading it all in an application buffer, use a [[w:Memory-mapped file|memory-mapped file]], if your operating system provides such feature.'''

When you have to access most parts of a binary file in a non-sequential fashion, there are two standard alternative techniques:
* Open the file without reading its contents; and every time a data is demanded, jump to the data position using a file positioning operation (aka ''seek''), and read that data from the file.
* Allocate a buffer as large as the whole file, open the file, read its contents into the buffer, close the file; and every time a data is demanded, search the buffer for it.

Using a memory-mapped file, with respect to the first technique, every positioning operation is replaced by a simple pointer assignment, and every read operation is replaced by a simple memory-to-memory copy.
Even assuming that the data is already in disk cache, both memory-mapped files operations are much faster than the corresponding file operations, as the latter require as many system calls.

With respect to the technique of pre-loading the whole file into a buffer, using a memory-mapped file has the following advantages:
* When file reading system calls are used, data is usually transferred first into the disk cache and then in the process memory, while using a memory-mapped file the system buffer containing the data loaded from disk is directly accessed, thus saving both a copy operation and the disk cache space. The situation is analogous for output operations.
* When reading the whole file, the program is stuck for a significant time period, while using a memory-mapped file such time period is scattered through the processing, as long as the file is accessed.
* If some sessions need only a small part of the file, a memory-mapped file loads only those parts.
* If several processes have to load in memory the same file, the memory space is allocated for every process, while using a memory-mapped file the operating system keeps in memory a single copy of the data, shared by all the processes.
* When memory is scarce, the operating system has to write out to the swap disk area even the parts of the buffer that haven't been changed, while the unchanged pages of a memory-mapped file are just discarded.

Yet, usage of memory-mapped files is not appropriate in a critical portion of a real-time system, as access to data has a latency that depends on the fact that the data has already been loaded in system memory or is still only on disk.

Strictly speaking, this is a technique dependent on the software platform, as the memory-mapped file feature is not part of C++ standard library nor of all operating systems.
Though, given that such feature exists in all the main operating systems that support virtual memory, this technique is of wide applicability.

Here are two classes that encapsulate the access to a file through a memory-mapped file, followed by a small program demonstrating the usage of such classes.
Implementations are provided both for Microsoft Windows and for other operating systems (like Unix, Linux, and Mac OS X) which are assumed to have a POSIX interface.
The MemoryFile class allows both to write and to read a file, and also to change its size.
The InputMemoryFile class allows only to read a file, but it is simpler and safer, and therefore it is recommended in case you don't need to change the file contents.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Optimizing C++}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

[[w:Memoization|''Memoization'']] techniques (aka ''caching'' techniques) are based on the principle that if you must repeatedly compute a pure function, that is a [[w:Referential transparency (computer science)|''referentially transparent'']] function (aka [[w:Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]), for the same argument, and if such computation requires significant time, you can save time by storing the result of the first evaluation and retrieve that result the other times.

=== Look-up table ===
'''If you often have to call a pure function that has a small integer interval as domain, pre-compute (at compile time or at program start-up time) all the values of the function for every value of the domain and put them in a static array called [[w:Lookup table|''lookup table'']]. When you need the value of the function for a particular value of the domain, read the corresponding value of such array.'''

For example, to compute the square root of an integer between 0 and 9, the following function is faster:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
double sqrt10(int i) {
    static const double lookup_table[] = {
        0, 1, sqrt(2.), sqrt(3.), 2,
        sqrt(5.), sqrt(6.), sqrt(7.), sqrt(8.), 3,
    };
    assert(0 &lt;= i &amp;&amp; i &lt; 10);
    return lookup_table[i];
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Array access is very fast, mainly if the accessed cell is in processor data cache. Therefore, if the lookup table is not large, almost surely its access is faster than the function to evaluate.

If the lookup table is large, it may be no more efficient, for the memory footprint, for the time to pre-compute all the values, if it doesn't fit the processor data cache. But if the function to evaluate is slow, it is called many times and you can afford to use much memory, consider using a lookup table up to several hundreds of kilobytes. It is rarely efficient to exceed one megabyte.

=== One-place cache ===
'''If you often have to call a pure function with the same arguments, the first time the function is called save the arguments and the result in static variables. When the function is called again, compare the new arguments with the saved ones; if they match, return the saved result, otherwise compute the result and store the new arguments and the new result.'''

For example, instead of the following function:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
double f(double x, double y) {
    return sqrt(x * x + y * y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

you can use this function:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
double f(double x, double y) {
    static double prev_x = 0;
    static double prev_y = 0;
    static double result = 0;
    if (x == prev_x &amp;&amp; y == prev_y) {
        return result;
    }
    prev_x = x;
    prev_y = y;
    result = sqrt(x * x + y * y);
    return result;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that, for faster processing it isn't necessary that the function be called with the same arguments for the entire program session. It is enough that it is called some times with the same arguments, then some other times with other arguments. In such cases, the computation is performed only when the arguments change.

Obviously, instead of increasing the speed, this technique may decrease it if the function is called with almost always changing arguments or if the comparison between the new arguments and the old ones requires more time than the computation of the function itself.

Notice that if you use static variables this function is not thread-safe and cannot be recursive. If this function must be called concurrently by several threads, it is necessary to replace the static variables with variables that are [[w:Thread-local storage|distinct for every thread]].

Notice also that in the example it is assumed that the function has zero value when both arguments are zero.
Failing this, you should choose another solution, such as one of the following:
* Initialize the variable ''result'' with the value that corresponds to all-zero arguments.
* Initialize the variables ''prev_x'' and ''prev_y'' with values that will never be passed as arguments.
* Add a static flag indicating whether the static variables keep valid values and check that flag at every call.

=== N-places cache ===
'''If you often have to call a pure function with arguments that in most cases belong to a small domain, use a static ''map'' (aka ''dictionary'') that is initially empty. When the function is called, search the map for the function argument. If you find it, return the associated value, otherwise compute the result and insert the pair argument-result into the map.'''

Here is an example in which the map is implemented using an array. The same function was used for the example of the guideline &quot;One-place cache&quot; in this section:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
double f(double x, double y) {
    static const int n_buckets = 8; // should be a power of 2
    static struct {
        double x; double y; double result;
    } cache[n_buckets];
    static int last_read_i = 0;
    static int last_written_i = 0;
    int i = last_read_i;
    do {
        if (cache[i].x == x &amp;&amp; cache[i].y == y) {
            return cache[i].result;
        }
        i = (i + 1) % n_buckets;
    } while (i != last_read_i);
    last_read_i = last_written_i = (last_written_i + 1) % n_buckets;
    cache[last_written_i].x = x;
    cache[last_written_i].y = y;
    cache[last_written_i].result = sqrt(x * x + y * y);
    return cache[last_written_i].result;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Some functions, although they have a theoretically large domain, are called most often with few distinct arguments.

For example, a word processor may have many installed fonts, but in a typical document only a few fonts are used for most characters. A rendering function that has to handle the font of every character of the document will be called typically with few distinct values. For such cases, an N-places cache is preferable to a one-place cache, as in the example.

The remarks about static variables, in guideline &quot;One-place cache&quot; in this section, apply also to this case.

For small caches (in the example, having 8 places) the most efficient algorithm is a sequential scan on an array. To implement a larger cache, though, a search tree or a hash table could be more efficient. In addition, the cache of the example has fixed size, but it could be expedient to have a variable-size cache.

Usually, the last read element is the most likely for the next call. Therefore, as in the example, it may be expedient to save its position and to begin the search from that position.

If the cache does not expand itself indefinitely, there is the problem choosing the element to replace. Obviously, it would be better to replace the element that is the least likely to be requested by the next call. In the example, it is assumed that, among the elements in the cache, the first inserted element is the least probable for the next call. Therefore, the write scans cyclically through the array. Often, a better criterion is to replace the least recently read element instead of the least recently written element. To implement such criterion, a more complex algorithm is required.

The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provides the template function &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; that implements a [[:w:Comparison sort|comparison sort]] algorithm. Because &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; is templatized, it can be used for various types of sequences holding any type of key, as long as the keys are comparable (implement the &lt; operator). A good compiler can generate code optimized for the various kinds of sequence/key combinations.

The reference implementation of the STL uses the [[:w:Introsort|introsort]] algorithm (since the 2000 release; the GNU C++ library uses the reference implementation). This algorithm is a very fast combination of [[:w:Quicksort|quicksort]] and [[:w:Heapsort|heapsort]] with a specially designed selection algorithm.

The &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; template function is not guaranteed to be [[:w:Stable sort|stable]]. When a stable sort is required, use the &lt;code&gt;stable_sort&lt;/code&gt; template function instead.

This section suggests alternatives to the &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;stable_sort&lt;/code&gt; template functions that may be faster in specific cases.

== Sorting with small ranges of keys ==

'''To sort a data set according an integer key having a small range, use the [[Algorithm implementation/Sorting/Counting sort#C++|''counting sort'']] algorithm.'''

The ''counting sort'' algorithm has O(N+M) complexity, where N is the number of elements to sort and M is the range of the sort keys, that is the difference between the highest key and the lowest key.
In case N elements are to be sorted whose key is an integer number belonging to an interval containing no more than two times N values (i.e when &lt;code&gt;M &lt;= 2 * N&lt;/code&gt; holds), this algorithm may be quite faster than &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;.
In some cases it is faster even with larger ranges.

This algorithm may be used also for a partial ordering; for example, if the keys are integers between zero and one billion, you can still sort them using only the most significant byte, so to get an order for which the formula &lt;math&gt;a_n &lt; a_{n + 1} + 256*256*256 &lt;/math&gt; holds.

=== Example: sorting 8-bit integers ===
Say you want to sort an array of arbitrary &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; elements. These take on values in the range 0..CHAR_MAX (inclusive), accounting for CHAR_MAX+1 different values. CHAR_MAX is defined in the header &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;climits&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;climits&gt;

void count_sort(char *a, char *const end)
{
	size_t freq[CHAR_MAX+1] = {0};
	char *p;

	for (p = a; p &lt; end; ++p)
		freq[*p] += 1;

	char c;
	for (c = 0, p = a; c &lt; UINT8_MAX; ++c)
		while (freq[c]-- &gt; 0)
			*p++ = c;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;counting_sort&lt;/code&gt; function implements the [[:w:Pigeonhole sort|pigeonhole sort]] algorithm. It takes a pointer to the first element of the input array and a pointer that points ''one element beyond'' the end of the array. Why? Because we don't have to stop here.

We can generalize &lt;code&gt;counting_sort&lt;/code&gt; to a template function that also works for &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;vector&lt;char&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and other sequence types, without loss of efficiency. When doing so, we need to work with iterators rather than pointers.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;climits&gt;

template &lt;typename OutputIter&gt;
void counting_sort(OutputIter const &amp;begin, OutputIter const &amp;end)
{
	size_t freq[CHAR_MAX+1] = {0};
	OutputIter it;

	for (it = begin; it &lt; end; ++it)
		freq[*it] += 1;

	char c;
	for (c = 0, it = begin; c &lt; CHAR_MAX; ++c)
		while (freq[c]-- &gt; 0)
			*it++ = c;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Partial sorting ==

=== Partitioning ===

'''If you have to split a sequence according a criterion, use a partitioning algorithm, instead of a sorting one.'''

In STL there is the &lt;code&gt;std::partition&lt;/code&gt; algorithm, that is faster than the &lt;code&gt;std::sort&lt;/code&gt; algorithm, as it has O(N) complexity, instead of O(N log(N)).

=== Stable partitioning and sorting ===

'''If you have to partition or sort a sequence for which equivalent entities may be swapped, don't use a stable algorithm.'''

In STL there is the &lt;code&gt;std::stable_partition&lt;/code&gt; partitioning algorithm, that is slightly slower than the &lt;code&gt;std::partition&lt;/code&gt; algorithm; and there is the &lt;code&gt;std::stable_sort&lt;/code&gt; sorting algorithm, that is slightly slower than the &lt;code&gt;std::sort&lt;/code&gt; algorithm.

=== Order partitioning ===

'''If you have to pick out the first N elements from a sequence, or the N&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element in a sequence, use an order partitioning algorithm, instead of a sorting one.'''

In STL there is the &lt;code&gt;std::nth_element&lt;/code&gt; algorithm, that, although slightly slower than the &lt;code&gt;std::stable_partition&lt;/code&gt; algorithm, is quite faster then the &lt;code&gt;std::sort&lt;/code&gt; algorithm, as it has O(N) complexity, instead of O(N log(N)).

=== Sorting only the first N elements ===

'''If you have to sort the first N elements of a much longer sequence, use an order statistic algorithm, instead of a sorting one.'''

In STL there are the &lt;code&gt;std::partial_sort&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;std::partial_sort_copy&lt;/code&gt; algorithms, that, although slower than the &lt;code&gt;std::nth_element&lt;/code&gt; algorithm, are so much faster than the &lt;code&gt;std::sort&lt;/code&gt; algorithm as the partial sequence to sort is shorter than the whole sequence.

=== Query cursor ===

'''Instead of defining a function that returns a collection (aka ''snapshot''), define a function that returns an iterator (aka ''cursor'' or ''dynaset''), with which you can generate or possibly change the required data.'''

This technique is particularly useful for database queries, but is applicable also to internal data structures.

Let's assume you have a collection (or a set of collections) encapsulated in a class.
Such class exposes one or more member functions to extract (or filter) a subset from such collection.

A way to get it is to construct a new collection, to copy the extracted data into it, and to return such collection.
In the database jargon, such collection is called ''snapshot''.

This technique is effective but inefficient, as the allocation and copy of the snapshot takes a lot of time and a lot of storage space.
In addition, it has the shortcoming that, until all the data has been extracted, you cannot proceed to process the already extracted data.

Here is an equivalent but more efficient technique.

The query function returns an iterator.
In database jargon, such iterator is called ''cursor'' or ''dynaset''.
The caller uses such iterator to extract, one at a time, the data filtered, and possibly to change them.

Notice that this solution is not exactly equivalent, as if during the iterator use the collection is changed by another function call, possibly coming from another thread, it may happen that the iterator is invalidated, or just that the filtered collection do not corresponds to the specified criteria.
Therefore, you can apply this technique only when you are sure that the underlying collection is not changed in any way, except by the iterator itself, during the whole life of the iterator.

This technique is independent of the programming language, as the iterator concept is an abstract design pattern.

=== Binary search ===

'''If you have to do many searches in a rarely changed collection, instead of using a search tree or a hash table, you can get a speed up if you put the data in an array, sort the array, and do [[w:Binary search|binary searches]] on it.'''

A binary search on an array has logarithmic complexity, like search trees, but has the advantage of compactness and locality of reference typical of arrays.

If the array is changed, this algorithm may still be competitive, as long as the changes are much less frequent than searches.

If every collection change consists in very few insertions or changes or deletions of elements, it is better to shift the array at every change operation.
Instead, if a collection change is more bulky, it is better to recreate and sort the whole array.

In C++, if the array length is not a compile-time constant, use a &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Singly-linked lists ===

'''If for a list you don't need bidirectional iterators, you don't need to insert elements at the end or before the current element, and you don't need to know how many elements there are in the list, use a [[w:Linked list#Singly-linked list|singly-linked list]], instead of a [[w:Linked list#Doubly-linked list|doubly-linked list]].'''

Such container, although it has many shortcomings, occupies less space and it is faster.

Typically, the heading of a doubly-linked list contains a pointer to the head of the list, a pointer to the back, and the counter of elements, while the heading of a singly-linked list contains only a pointer to the head of the list.
In addition, typically, every node of a doubly-linked list contains a pointer to the previous node and a pointer to the next node, while every node of a singly-linked list contains only a pointer to the next node.
At last, every element insertion into a doubly-linked list must update four pointers and increment a counter, while every element insertion into a singly-linked list must only update two pointers.

In the C++ standard library, the &lt;code&gt;std::list&lt;/code&gt; container is implemented by a doubly-linked list.
The &lt;code&gt;slist&lt;/code&gt; container, non-standard but available in various libraries, and the &lt;code&gt;forward_list&lt;/code&gt; container, that will be in C++11 standard library, are implemented by singly-linked lists.

In this chapter some techniques, specific for C++ language, are proposed.
They are to be applied only in bottlenecks, as, although they may speed up execution, they also make more complex and less maintainable the source code.

In addition, such guidelines in some cases could worsen the performance instead of improving it, and therefore their effect should be always measured before releasing them.

The optimization techniques are grouped according their goal.

Even using a very efficient allocator, the allocation and deallocation operations take a significant time, and often the allocator is not very efficient.

In this section some techniques are described to decrease the total number of memory allocations, and their corresponding deallocations.
They are to be applied only in bottlenecks, that is after having measured that the large number of allocations has a significant impact on performance.

=== The &lt;code&gt;alloca&lt;/code&gt; function ===

'''In non-recursive functions, to allocate variable-size but not large memory space, use the &lt;code&gt;alloca&lt;/code&gt; function.'''

It is very efficient, as it allocates space on the stack.

It is a non-standard function, but it is available with many compilers for several operating systems.

It may be used even to allocate an array of objects having constructors, as long as the ''placement-new'' operator is called on the allocated space, but it shouldn't be used for an array of objects having a destructor or which, directly or indirectly, contain member variables having a destructor, as such destructors would never be called.

Though, it is rather dangerous, as, if called too many times or with a too big value, it overflows the stack, and, if called for objects having a destructor, it causes resource leaks.
Therefore this function is to be used sparingly.

=== Move allocations and deallocations ===

'''Move before bottlenecks memory allocations, and after bottlenecks the matching deallocations.'''

Variable length dynamic memory management is much slower than automatic memory management.

Analogous optimization is to be done for operations causing allocations indirectly, as the copy of objects which, directly or indirectly, own dynamic memory.

=== The &lt;code&gt;reserve&lt;/code&gt; function ===

'''Before adding elements to a &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; or to a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; object, call its member function &lt;code&gt;reserve&lt;/code&gt; with a size big enough for most cases.'''

If objects are repeatedly added to a &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; object, several costly reallocations are performed.
To avoid such reallocations, it is enough to initially allocate the required space.

=== Keep &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;s capacity ===

'''To empty a &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;T&gt; x&lt;/code&gt; object without deallocating its memory, use the statement &lt;code&gt;x.resize(0);&lt;/code&gt;; to empty it and deallocate its memory, use the statement &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;T&gt;().swap(x);&lt;/code&gt;.'''

To empty a &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; object, there also exists the &lt;code&gt;clear()&lt;/code&gt; member function, but, the C++ standard does not specify whether or not this function preserves the allocated capacity of the  &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;.

If you are repeatedly filling and emptying a &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; object, and thus you want to to avoid frequent reallocations, perform the emptying by calling the &lt;code&gt;resize&lt;/code&gt; member function, which, according to the standard, preserves the capacity of the object.
If instead you have finished using a large &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; object, and you may not use it again or you are going to use it with substantially fewer elements, you should free the object's memory by calling the &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; function on a new empty temporary &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; object.

=== &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; function overload ===

'''For every copyable concrete class &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; which, directly or indirectly, owns some dynamic memory, redefine the appropriate &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; functions.'''

In particular, add to the class &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; member function having the following signature:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;void swap(T&amp;) throw();&lt;/source&gt;

and add the following non-member function in the same namespace that contains the class &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;void swap(T&amp; lhs, T&amp; rhs) { lhs.swap(rhs); }&lt;/source&gt;

and, if the class is not a class template, add also the following non-member function in the same file that contains the class &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; definition:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;namespace std { template&lt;&gt; swap(T&amp; lhs, T&amp; rhs) { lhs.swap(rhs); } }&lt;/source&gt;

In the standard library, the &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; function is called frequently by many algorithms.
Such function has a generic implementation and specialized implementations for various types of the standard library.

If objects of a non-standard class are used in a standard library algorithm that calls &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; on them, and the &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; function is not overloaded, the generic implementation is used.

The generic implementation of the &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; function causes the creation and destruction of a temporary object and the execution of two object assignments.
Such operation take much time if applied to objects that own dynamic memory, as such memory is reallocated three times.

The ownership of dynamic memory may be even only indirect.
For example, if a member variable is a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;, or is an object that contains a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; object, the memory owned by these objects is reallocated every time the object that contains them is copied.
Therefore, even in these cases the &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; function is to be overloaded.

If the object doesn't own dynamic memory, the copy of the object is much faster, and however it is not noticeably slower than using other techniques, and so no &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; overload is needed.

If the class is not copyable or abstract, the &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; function must never be called on object of such type, and therefore also in these cases no &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; function is to be redefined.

To speed up the function &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt;, you have to specialize it for your class.
There are two possible ways to do that: in the same namespace of the class (that may be the global one) as an overload, or in the namespace &lt;code&gt;std&lt;/code&gt; as a specialization of the standard template.
It is advisable to define it in both ways, as, first, if it is a class template only the first way is possible, an then some compilers do not accept or accept with a warning a definition only in the first way.

The implementations of such functions must access all the members of the object, and therefore they need to call a member function, that by convention is called again &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt;, that does the actual work.

Such work consists in swapping all the non-static members of the two objects, typically by calling the &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; function on them, without qualifying its namespace.

To put the function &lt;code&gt;std::swap&lt;/code&gt; into the current scope, the function must begin with the statement:

C++ run-time support routines obviously have a significant cost, because otherwise such behavior would have be inlined.
Here techniques are presented to avoid the language features that cause an implicit call to costly run-time support routines.

=== The &lt;code&gt;typeid&lt;/code&gt; operator ===

'''Instead of using the &lt;code&gt;typeid&lt;/code&gt; operator, use a &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; function.'''

Such operator may take more time than a virtual function call.

=== The &lt;code&gt;dynamic_cast&lt;/code&gt; operator ===

'''Instead of the &lt;code&gt;dynamic_cast&lt;/code&gt; operator, use the &lt;code&gt;typeid&lt;/code&gt; operator, or, better, a &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; function call.'''

Such operator may take a time noticeably longer than a virtual function call, and longer also than the &lt;code&gt;typeid&lt;/code&gt; operator.

=== Empty exception specification ===

'''Use the empty exception specification (that is, append &lt;code&gt;throw()&lt;/code&gt; to the declaration) for the functions you are sure will never throw exceptions.'''

Some compilers use such information to simplify the bookkeeping needed to handle exceptions.

=== The &lt;code&gt;try/catch&lt;/code&gt; statement ===

'''For every bottleneck, move before the bottleneck the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; keywords, and after the bottleneck the matching &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; clauses.'''

In other words, hoist &lt;code&gt;try/catch&lt;/code&gt; statements out of bottlenecks.

The execution of a &lt;code&gt;try/catch&lt;/code&gt; statement sometimes is free of charge, but other times causes as a slowdown.
Avoid the repeated execution of such block inside bottlenecks.

=== Floating point vs integer operations ===

'''If the target processor does not contain a floating point unit, replace floating point functions, constants and variables with the corresponding integer functions, constants and variables; if the target processor contains only a single precision floating point unit, replace &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; functions, constants and variables with their &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; correspondents.'''

Present processors for desktop or server computers contain dedicated hardware for floating point arithmetic, both at single and at double precision, and therefore such operations are almost as fast as their integer correspondents.

Instead, some processors for embedded systems do not contain dedicated hardware for floating point arithmetic, 
or contain hardware able to handle only single precision numbers.
Therefore, in such systems, the operation that cannot be performed by hardware are emulated by very slow library functions.
In such case, it is much more efficient to use integer arithmetic, or, if available in hardware, single precision floating point arithmetic.

To handle fractional numbers by using integer operations, every number is to be meant as multiplied by a scale factor.
To do that, every number is multiplied by such factor at input, and is divided by the same factor at output, or vice versa.

=== Number to string conversion ===

'''Use optimized functions to convert numbers to strings.'''

The standard functions to convert an integer number to a string or a floating point number to string are rather inefficient.
To speed up such operations, use non-standard optimized function, possibly written by yourself.

=== Use of &lt;code&gt;cstdio&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

'''To perform input/output operations, instead of using the C++ streams, use the old C functions, declared in the &lt;code&gt;cstdio&lt;/code&gt; header.'''

C++ I/O primitives have been designed mainly for type safety and for customization rather than for performance, and many library implementation of them turn out to be rather inefficient.
In particular, the C language I/O functions &lt;code&gt;fread&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fwrite&lt;/code&gt; are more efficient than the &lt;code&gt;fstream&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; member functions.

If you have to use C++ streams, use &lt;code&gt;&quot;\n&quot;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;std::endl&lt;/code&gt; since &lt;code&gt;std::endl&lt;/code&gt; also flushes the stream.

Even the language features that generate inlined code may have a significant cost, as such instruction are anyway to be executed.
In this section some techniques are presented to decrease the total number of machine instructions that the processor will have to execute to perform a given operation.

=== Cases order in &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement ===

'''In &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statements, sort the cases by decreasing probability.'''

In the guideline &quot;Cases order in &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement&quot; in section 3.1, it was already suggested to put before the most typical cases, that is those that were presumed to be more probable.
As further optimization, you can count, in typical runs, the actual number of times every case is chosen, and sort the cases from the most frequent to the less frequent.

=== Template integer parameters ===

'''If an integer value is a constant in the application code, but is a variable in library code, make it a template parameter.'''

Let's assume you are writing the following library function, in which both &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; do not have a known value when the library is developed:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int f1(int x, int y) { return x * y; }
&lt;/source&gt;

Such function may be called from the following application code, in which &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; does not have a constant value, but &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is the constant 4:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int a = f1(b, 4);
&lt;/source&gt;

If, when you write the library, you know that the caller will surely pass a constant for the argument &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, you can transform your function into the following function template:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
template &lt;int Y&gt; int f2(int x) { return x * Y; }
&lt;/source&gt;

Such function may be called from the following application code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int a = f2&lt;4&gt;(b);
&lt;/source&gt;

Such a call instantiates automatically the following function:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int f2(int x) { return x * 4; }
&lt;/source&gt;

The latter function is faster than the former function &lt;code&gt;f1&lt;/code&gt;, for the following reasons:
* Only one argument is passed to the function (&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;) instead of two (&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;).
* The multiplication by an integer constant (4) is always faster than a multiplication by an integer variable (&lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;).
* As the constant value (4) is a power of two, the compiler, instead of performing an integer multiplication, performs a bit shift.

In general, the integer template parameters are constants for those who instantiate the template and therefore for the compiler, and constants are handled more efficiently than variables.
In addition, some operations involving constants are pre-computed at compilation-time.

If, instead of a normal function, you already have a function template, it is enough to add a further parameter to that template.

=== The ''Curiously Recurring Template Pattern'' ===

'''If you have to write a library abstract base class such that in every algorithm in the application code only one class derived from such base class will be used, use the [[w:Curiously recurring template pattern|''Curiously Recurring Template Pattern'']].'''

Let's assume you are writing the following library base class:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Base {
public:
    void g() { f(); }
private:
    virtual void f() = 0;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

In this class, the function &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; performs an algorithm that calls the function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; as an abstract operation for the algorithm.
In design patterns terminology, &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; is a [[w:Template method pattern|''template method'']] design pattern.
The purpose of such class is to allow to write the following application code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Derived1: public Base {
private:
    virtual void f() { ... }
};
...
Base* p1 = new Derived1;
p1-&gt;g();
&lt;/source&gt;

In such a case, it is possible to transform the previous library code into the following:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
template &lt;class Derived&gt; class Base {
public:
    void g() { f(); }
private:
    void f() { static_cast&lt;Derived*&gt;(this)-&gt;f(); }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

As a consequence, the application code will become the following:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Derived1: public Base&lt;Derived1&gt; {
private:
    void f() { ... }
};
...
Derived1* p1 = new Derived1;
p1-&gt;g();
&lt;/source&gt;

In such a way, the call to &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; in the function &lt;code&gt;Base&lt;Derived1&gt;::g&lt;/code&gt; is statically bound to the member function &lt;code&gt;Derived1::f&lt;/code&gt;, that is the call to such function is no more &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt;, and can be inlined.

Though, let's assume you want to add the following definition:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Derived2: public Base&lt;Derived2&gt; {
protected:
    void f() { ... }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

With this technique it wouldn't be possible to define a pointer or a reference to a base class that is common to both &lt;code&gt;Derived1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Derived2&lt;/code&gt;, as such base classes are two unrelated types; as a consequence, this technique is not applicable when you want to allow the application code to define a container of arbitrary objects derived from the class Base.

Other limitations are:
* &lt;code&gt;Base&lt;/code&gt; is necessarily an abstract type;
* an object of type &lt;/code&gt;Derived1&lt;/code&gt; cannot be converted into an object of type &lt;code&gt;Derived2&lt;/code&gt; or vice versa;
* for every derivation of &lt;code&gt;Base&lt;/code&gt;, all the machine code generated for &lt;code&gt;Base&lt;/code&gt; is duplicated.

=== The ''Strategy'' design pattern ===

'''If an object that implements the [[w:Strategy pattern|''Strategy'']] design pattern (aka ''Policy'') is a constant in every algorithm of the application code, eliminate such an object, make &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; all its members, and add its class as a template parameter.'''

Let's assume you are writing the following library code, that implements the ''Strategy'' design pattern:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class C;
class Strategy {
public:
    virtual bool is_valid(const C&amp;) const = 0;
    virtual void run(C&amp;) const = 0;
};

class C {
public:
    void set_strategy(const Strategy&amp; s) { s_ = s; }
    void f() { if (s_.is_valid(*this)) s_.run(*this); }
private:
    Strategy s_;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This library code has the purpose to allow the following application code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class MyStrategy: public Strategy {
public:
    virtual bool is_valid(const C&amp; c) const { ... }
    virtual void run(C&amp; c) const { ... }
};
...
MyStrategy s; // Object representing my strategy.
C c; // Object containing an algorithm with customizable strategy.
c.set_strategy(s); // Assignment of the custom strategy.
c.f(); // Execution of the algorithm with assigned strategy.
&lt;/source&gt;

In such a case, it's possible to convert the previous library code into the following:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
template &lt;class Strategy&gt;
class C {
public:
    void f() {
        if (Strategy::is_valid(*this)) Strategy::run(*this);
    }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

As a consequence, the application code will become the following:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class MyStrategy {
public:
    static bool is_valid(const C&lt;MyStrategy&gt;&amp; c) { ... }
    static void run(C&lt;MyStrategy&gt;&amp; c) { ... }
};
...

C&lt;MyStrategy&gt; c; // Object with statically assigned strategy.
c.f(); // Execution with statically assigned strategy.
&lt;/source&gt;

In such a way, the object-strategy is avoided, and the member functions &lt;code&gt;MyStrategy::is_valid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MyStrategy::run&lt;/code&gt; are statically bound, that is calls to &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; functions are avoided.

Though, such solution does not allow to choose the strategy at run-time, and of course neither to change it during the object life.
In addition, the algorithm code is duplicated for every instantiation of its class.

=== Bitwise operators ===

'''If you have to perform boolean operations on a set of bits, put those bits in an &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; object, and use bitwise operators on it.'''

The bitwise operators (&lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) are translated in single fast instructions, and operate on all the bits of a register in a single instruction.
