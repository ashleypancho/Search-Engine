REGISTER ON

REGISTER OFF

=== Revised === 

June 2001 (Release 5) 

=== Description === 

The constant _registerVars is set up by the editor before compilation begins. The constant is zero if register variables are currently turned off and -1 if they are on. You may not change the status of the constant by overriding. It is for information purposes only. These are non-executable statements which affect the way the compiler treats variables which are defined farther down in the program. The REGISTER ON statement instructs the compiler to attempt to use CPU registers to store the values of subsequently-encountered variables. The REGISTER OFF statement instructs the compiler to use addressable memory (RAM) to store the values of all subsequently-encountered variables. These statements are global in scope; they affect all variables that are defined below the statement, whether they're defined in a local function or in the &quot;main&quot; part of your program. Your program can include several REGISTER ON and REGISTER OFF statements, if you wish to exercise finer control over how specific variables are used. If you don't specify either statement, the default condition is determined by how you've set this option in the &quot;Compiler Preferences&quot; dialog. The advantage of using register-based variables is speed. Many operations are faster by orders of magnitude when they use register-based variables. Only 1-byte, 2-byte and 4-byte variables can be stored in CPU registers. There are only a limited number of registers available, so it's possible that not all of your variables will be register-based even if you specify REGISTER ON. When using REGISTER ON, you should define your most frequently used variables first (just below the REGISTER ON); this will increase their chances of being assigned to a CPU register. The advantage of using RAM-based variables is versatility. There are certain operations that can't be performed using register-based variables; in particular, any operation that makes reference to a variable's address must use a RAM-based variable. This includes using expressions like VARPTR(myVar) and @myVar, and passing the variable to certain statements and functions which need to return a value into the variable. The compiler will generate an error if you attempt to use a register-based variable in such situations. Floating Point Registers
While the specific set of registers used for most operations is designed to handle whole numbers, there is an additional set of registers on the PPC processor set aside for floating point values. It is important to note that all floating point registers are double precision. There is no advantage to attempting to use a single precision variable. In fact, the conversion to double precision may make it slower. This same feature is true of all math operations. Single precision variables are converted to double precision, the operation is performed, then the variable is converted back to its single precision state. In order to force a float into a register, you must dimension it between the LOCAL and the LOCAL FN statements. The following example shows register and non-register floats in a local function. 


LOCAL
DIM myRegisterVar# 'in register
DIM myVar AS DOUBLE 'in register

LOCAL FN anything
DIM myRamFloat# 'not in register
DIM notInRegister AS DOUBLE 'not in register
REM do anything
END FN 


Note: You can also use the DIM statement to selectively force certain variables to be RAM-based, even when REGISTER ON is in effect. Here are some items that force variables to be located in RAM: 

DIM @var
DIM var&amp;;0,hi%,lo%
DIM var.8

      <comment>Dice's similarity</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Dice's coefficient (also known as the Dice coefficient) is a similarity measure related to the Jaccard index.

For sets X and Y of keywords used in information retrieval, the coefficient may be defined as:[1]

 
When taken as a string similarity measure, the coefficient may be calculated for two strings, x and y using bigrams as follows:[2]

 
where nt is the number of character bigrams found in both strings, nx is the number of bigrams in string x and ny is the number of bigrams in string y. For example, to calculate the similarity between:

night 
nacht 
We would find the set of bigrams in each word:

{ni,ig,gh,ht} 
{na,ac,ch,ht} 
Each set has 4 elements, and the intersection of these two sets has only one element: ht.

Plugging this into the formula, we calculate, s = (2 * 1) / (4 + 4) = 0.25

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Micro sign==
I couldn't insert the μ (micro) sign into a document
 ! LaTeX Error: Command \textmu unavailable in encoding T1.
(ucs, utf8x, fontenc: T1)

I think, it should be covered the text, how can do it.

I think, the math mode is not elegant.

- Harp

==XeLaTex==

I think you should mention XeLaTeX which allows one to enter unicode data directly into the document. ([http://scripts.sil.org/xetex scripts.sil.org/xetex]). It's bundled with TeX Live and other TeX distributions.

== order of babel, fontenc, inputenc commands ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usepackage[..]{babel}
\usepackage[..]{fontenc}
\usepackage[..]{inputenc}
&lt;/source&gt;
The order of these commands is differently stated for different languages. Is the order important at all?
:It is important if you use utf8: it only loads definitions for characters presents in the fontenc. If you change the inputenc to utf8 before changing the fontenc, only the characters presents in the default one (OT1) will be loaded. So if you use utf8 with, let's say, T1, you should do:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
&lt;/source&gt;
:I have no idea about the ''babel'' package thought…

== selectlanguage ==
selectlanguage seems not to have any effect before \begin{document}. That could be added.

== babel languages ==
It appears to me that there are more babel languages and synonyms like &quot;latin&quot;, &quot;medieval&quot;, &quot;portuges&quot; for &quot;portugese&quot;, etc. So how about adding a list with supported languages by babel with possible synonyms etc.? -[[Special:Contributions/80.133.103.170|80.133.103.170]] ([[User talk:80.133.103.170|discuss]]) 07:45, 20 November 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">To receive credit for this assignment, student must LOG IN and then paste research information in this space.  Use the code provided to generate large, bold topic text followede by readable content text.

&lt;p&gt;The product I have chosen to write about is Google Docs, which is an online variation of Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The products, Documents and Spreadsheets, were originally created by Upstartly and name Writely and Spreadsheets, which Google bought out in 2005. Google combined both of these products on October 10, 2006. Then they acquired a online presentation software, along with the related technologies, from Tonic Systems, and rolled it into Google Docs on September 17, 2007.
This product allows for the online creation and storage of text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. By doing this, you can retrieve your information from any computer in the world, regardless of operating system. It also allows for you to share documents in real-time with people via the internet, and therefore make collaboration easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This product is important, because it is challenging the established leading computer software writer, Microsoft. Google Docs is basically an open-source software package available over the internet. Its competition, OpenOffice which is made by Sun Java Systems, is not as popular, but is just as widely available. The reasons for the popularity of Google Docs is because it is created and promoted by Google, Inc, the easy accessibility to all your documents because they are stored on Google's servers, and they are cross-platform compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Docs use as project management is feasible, but only on a small scale because of the limitations built into the software itself. In reality, the only group of people who would find it useful as project management software would be: students, self-employed business owners, and small business owners. When it comes to large companies, or those who have the need for security with their projects, Google Docs is not feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The are several reasons why Google Docs is not feasible to use as  project management software. The first reason is security. The only time that any of the Google packages signs in securely, using HTTPS, is at the sign in page, after that the entire site uses  normal HTTP for passing information. This would allow for someone, if they knew how to accomplish it, to use a cross-browser attack to compromise Google Docs. For this reason, any project that dealt with confidential information could not use Google Docs. Secondly, Google Docs is not written to handle all possible situations involving a large project. Small projects that only required the use of one or two spreadsheets and a couple of text documents are the most that are feasible by this package. Another reason for not using Google Docs as project management software is because there seems is way to check documents in an out, so in essence edits could be made on the same document at the same time and end up with two completely different documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information concerning Google Docs, please check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_docs.&lt;/p&gt;

'''The WikiBook'''

First off, let’s look at the history of Wiki’s and the technology behind such an apparent revolution in the cyber world and technological field – especially on the development side of these areas. The word &quot;wiki&quot; comes from a Hawaiian word for &quot;quick&quot;. Wikis were invented about 10 years ago by Socialtext advisor and friend Ward Cunningham. However, the creation of the first wiki website only became possible with the development of the hypertext protocol of the WorldWideWeb (1991) and graphical web browsers such as the Netscape Navigator (1994). Wikis became the collaboration tool of choice because they are simple and flexible. Cunningham's first wiki met with immediate success, and quickly spawned &quot;wiki clones,&quot; alternative versions of the wiki software. The use of wiki websites was rapidly adopted by communities of free software developers, but at first remained confined to these specialised groups. 

The knowledge of Wikis was not widespread known except in the areas of programmers and software developers till up to approximately 2001. The breakthrough that really cast Wikis into the limelight was through the success of the free content encyclopaedia Wikipedia introduced wikis to the general public. After this monumental occurrence in the WorldWideWeb arena, the number of Wiki websites and the varieties of wiki engines (software implementations) increased exponentially. There now exist thousands of wiki websites and hundreds of wiki engines.

A Wiki is a collaboratively-edited website which many people also view as an anarchistic publishing tool. The distinguishing feature of wikis is that they typically allow all users to edit any page, with full freedom to edit, change and delete the work of previous authors. It is used in many different areas of life, and the demand for more and more Wikis has increased  over the past few years. Some of the areas that use Wikis are banks, telecommunication companies, small businesses, hospitals, universities, software companies, and many more. 

''Advantages and Disadvantages''

Advantages of Wikis may include:
     1.	No need to install HTML authoring tools; minimal training may be needed.
     2.	Can help develop a culture of sharing and working together (cf. open source).
     3.	Useful for joint working when there are agreed shared goals.
     4.	In addition to the text on the page, any type of digital file can be uploaded to and shared by linking to them from the wiki page. 
     5.	Can be open to the public for viewing and editing, or limited to specific individuals for viewing only or viewing and editing.

Disadvantages of Wikis may include:
     1.	There is not (yet) a standard lightweight Wiki markup language.
     2.	It may be difficult for Wikis to gain momentum.
     3.	The simple design of the wiki and the need to keep formatting simple (so as to enable those unskilled in html to edit pages) limits the complexity of the documents that can be created in a wiki.
     4.	Even though nothing can be destroyed in a wiki (as it can be retrieved from the wiki history), the original formatting is lost, meaning that it can be time consuming to recreate what was deleted.
     5.	It is not always obvious what has been altered (unless users each agree to use a different colour font, but this requires coordination of effort that can stifle the ease of use of the wiki. 

	Wikis require shift in thinking about the whole notion of ownership (of what is written). Thus wikis that are open to a wide audience should not be used if author(s) want to retain control and credit for what is created. There may be copyright and other legal issues regarding collaborative content. Important not to use wikis when the exact wording of original content needs to be retained (e.g. not appropriate to post transcript of podcast in a wiki). 

''Application in Class?''

     1.	Very easy to create and edit with no understanding of html or web page design.
     2.	Efficient method of students sharing and organizing information. 
     3.	Students can collaborate on assignments without having to meet synchronously.
     4.	Avoids having one person assume responsibility for entering each student's contributions into the group paper/project.
     5.	Students can build on each other's ideas
     6.	Reduces the likelihood of having &quot;free riders&quot; who contribute little if anything to a group project, since the instructor (and other students) can refer to the wiki history, and see exactly what contributions were made by whom.
     7.	Also using the page history, instructors can identify which students may be struggling with different concepts as well as which students are assisting those who are struggling.
     8.	Students can use wikis for peer editing and peer feedback prior to submitting final assignments.
     9.	If a wiki is public it enables students to have their work seen by others and gives them an authentic audience. 

Wikis can enable students to receive feedback on their work if users insert comments at relevant places within the document. However, since it is difficult to use the history feature of wikis to compare the revised version with earlier versions, it is best to have students share their work in Microsoft Word and use the &quot;track changes&quot; feature so that the suggestions and changes are embedded in the relevant portions of the document without changing the original content.

The final project in the Future Media class required the use of a variety of software including After Effects, Live Type, Photoshop, iWeb, and Final Cut Pro.  Final Cut Pro being the most used of the bunch.  The class had to film themselves reciting a script, which they than brought into Final Cut and added all the attributes that made the videos sparkle.  Final Cut gave the class the ability to edit their movies with professional software, without the professional training.  Which is the beauty and attraction to this product; it has all the tools needed to edit everything from Christmas at grandma’s house, to a full length feature film.   
Final Cut Pro came on the scene in the 2000s as Apple’s response to the PC editing software Avid.  Avid has been the Hollywood standard for film editing in the past but that standard is now being threatened with the easy usability and cost effective Final Cut. Final Cut has always been preferred for independent film makers but has started grabbing the attention of film industry professionals.  Movies such as 300, Jarhead, Letters to Iwo Jima, and Academy Award Nominees Cold Mountain and No Country for Old Men are among the feature films edited with this software. 
	As with the Hollywood editors, some of the tools used by the Future Media class included the razor tool for cutting out unwanted material, the audio settings tool for bring down the music where voice over was prominent, and fading in and out between scenes.  The class movies were of course, at a beginning stage compared to the amount of effects Final Cut is actually capable of. What makes this software so popular is that it puts in the hands of beginners what professionals are using to make multi-million dollar films.  Not only is it packed full of all a novice film maker could hope for, but it also plays well with other software.  Final Cut is compatible with QuickTime and accepts video formats such as DV and MPEG-4.  It also is ideal when one is working with Adobe’s product After Effects or Apple’s Live Type, both of which were used in the final project for this class. 
	In keeping up with the trends of media, Final Cut has also been HD compatible since the release of the third version and Apple is currently on Final Cut Pro 6. Apple has also been releasing Final Cut Studio, which includes helpful products such as Compressor, Color, DVD Studio Pro, Soundtrack Pro, and Motion. Each of these products aid in different areas of composing a deceit project; for example, Compressor is used in shrieking file sizes, whereas DVD Studio Pro is used for burning one’s project to a DVD.  Soundtrack Pro serves as the audio editing software and Motion as the graphics part of the package.  With all of these components being included in one lump sum it’s just another reason the industry should continue to take a more serious look at this product.   	
	Though there is still a debate as to whether Final Cut or Avid is better for full length films, one could absolutely say Final Cut is the better choice for beginning film makers.  As with most Apple products, Final Cut is user friendly, without sacrificing quality. It provides easy access to powerful editing software that takes the idea from the film makers head and places it on screen.  It transforms any class project into something a viewer might actually want to take time to watch, making Final Cut Pro a great solution for beginning film makers and editors.

=='''GarageBand'''==
Part of the iLife suite, you can not buy GarageBand by itself. It comes free on new Macs or for under a hundred dollars Mac users can purchase it outright. GarageBand is an application focused to help the average person create music at an easy level. You can plug in a keyboard or guitar to your computer and mix your own recordings or use one of the many synthesized instruments included with the package. There is no doubt that composing in GarageBand is fun. It allows you to record in real time and you are able to monitor special effects while recording is taking place.

GarageBand layers its structured interface with levels of tracks. It supports drag and drop importing of audio loops from anywhere on your Mac. You can bring in your own loops or choose one of the many pre-made ones that Garageband offers. There are three kinds of tracks offered in Garageband: real instruments, software instruments, or you can import MIDI tracks. Real Instruments are supported by plugging an instrument directly into the computer or using a microphone to record the instrument being played. The other type of track is Software instruments, which are instruments already in the software. The supplied instruments vary from good to excellent. While you get enough to get started, there’s not nearly enough for serious loop composition. However, you can import loops to get more from your mixing. And for those who want a larger collection of sounds GarageBand also offers JamPacks which include more than 2,000 additional Apple Loops, 100+ new Software Instruments, and 100+ additional effect presets. 

After creating your music the next big thing is to turn it into a Podcast. Making Podcasts is simple, and can be inter-graded into other applications such as Final Cut Pro and Quick Time Pro. You can easily use all of GarageBand’s synthesizers and effects to spice up your composition and export a Podcast to iTunes to share with family and friends. 

Whether your a newbie or a professional working on a short project GarageBand is a wonderful way to start. It makes the job of recording music in real time more fun and easy to use. Things in the music world can get complicated, but Garageband is a refreshing application that is simply built for music making on Macs.

==Livetype==
By: Carolann Merchant.

	The greatest way to get quick, professional looking text graphics is through Apple's Livetype. It allows the user to choose the typeface they want, add a number of animations to the text, and create text entrances and exits to and from the screen. Livetype also offers background graphics, still or animated that compliment its library of text animations. It is an excellent tool that gives movie quality results in the time it would take to watch a movie.
	The class was introduced to Livetype during the time allotted to the final project. The project, a 30 second to one minute movie over the class, required students to create an introduction with Livetype as the suggested tool. Great results were accomplished in just a short class period supplemented with a brief demonstration by the professor. Most professional animators would choose to use After Effects, some might even use Motion for less sophisticated projects. A project done in After Effects may take several hours depending on its nature, however similar results can be achieved through the simplicity of Livetype. 
	Livetype enables text to glow, fade, zoom, and much more. Effects can be timed and edited by the user who is nearly given full control of the effects due to the elegance of the program and the options available.  Effects can even be layered and combined to create original and unique features in any animation. Livetype uses keyframes and a timeline for its editing layout. The functionality keeps the user organized and the eyes focused amidst the potential chaos that comes with editing and animating on a computer screen. 
	It would be an ill advised decision to use Livetype on a professional project that would be running in mainstream culture. Most people in the profession would recognize a basic Livetype animation and this would be considered uncreative, amateur, and low-rate. Livetype is good for the average YouTube user, small projects for school, church, etc... or just for fun!

Fantastic tutorial! Unfortunately, it fails to describe how I might filter records by an attribute list containing a certain element, which is really hard to Google. :(

Could someone add this example, please?

--[[User:Mcandre]]

I've reverted the edits by Suresh.V
+91 9901848757 because these only add the SQL equivalents and these are already in the wikibook in the original XQuery /SQL comparison module.

However it would be useful to have the the three languages side by side - in fact the other two are already in an XML file used to generate the queries and it would not be too much work to add the sparql to this file so that they could be executed too. Trouble is the site then becomes increasingly dependant on the eXist server.

I've started to edit the sparql queries into the XML file and added a script to execute a named Sparql query.</text>

== &lt;u&gt;Concrete&lt;/u&gt; ==
==='''Method 1'''===
This is a general concrete texture. It can be used in any sort of situation, and able to be easily applied and altered for most situations, as there are many variations in concrete in the world.

[[File:EXConcrete.jpg|240px]]

**NoiseSize-(Adjust as needed)&lt;u&gt;0.1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**NoiseBasis-&lt;u&gt;Blender Original&lt;/u&gt;

**SizeY-&lt;u&gt;7.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**SizeZ-&lt;u&gt;1.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''(Note: Adjust SizeX/Y/Z as necessary, try to keep 1:7:1 Ratio)''
*Map To:&lt;br&gt;
**Output-&lt;u&gt;Nor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Nor-&lt;u&gt;1.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''(Adjust Nor based on mesh size, as necessary)''

For this texture, try adding an '''&lt;u&gt;Image&lt;/u&gt;''' Texture and add an image of actual concrete. For a large scene, take multiple concrete images and tile them randomly and overlapping in Photoshop, then putting them down on your mesh. This texture is best for shading then a stand-alone material. Also works well with Nodes. Hope this helped!

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Two Mark Questions=
'''Q1.''' A person goes to office either by car, scooter, bus or train the probabilities for which are 1/7, 3/7, 2/7 and 1/7 respectively. The probabilities that he reaches office late, if he takes car, scooter, bus or train are 2/9, 1/9, 4/9 and 1/9 respectively. Given that he reached office in time, what is the probability that he travelled by a car?

'''Q2''' Find the range of values of t for which&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2\sin t=\frac{1-2x+5x^2}{3x^2-2x-1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
'''Q3''' Circles with radii 3,4 and 5 units touch each other externally. Let P be the point of intersection of tangents to these circles at their points of contact. Find the distance of P from the points of contact.

'''Q4''' Find the equation of the plane containing the line 2x – y + z – 3 = 0, 3x + y + z = 5 and at a distance of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt 6}&lt;/math&gt; from the point (2,1,–1).

&lt;B&gt;Q5&lt;/B&gt; A function &lt;I&gt;f&lt;/I&gt;(x) is such that &lt;B&gt;| &lt;I&gt;f&lt;/I&gt; (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)-&lt;I&gt;f&lt;/I&gt; (x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) | &lt; (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/B&gt; for all real x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Find the equation of the tangent to the curve y = &lt;I&gt;f&lt;/I&gt; (x) at the point (1,2)

Can't we think of a better title than this?  Perhaps &quot;plotting graphs?&quot;

:Do you mean ''Creating Graphics'' should be renamed ''Plotting Graphs''? If so, well, this chapter is not about plots only. It features any kind of graphics: diagrams, logos, drawings, geometric figures, etc. However I agree a better and more appropriate title would be needed.

== PGF and TikZ package ==

{{todo|Expand the section to include description of how to actually use the package, or removed it as a promotion of sorts, adding no value to the reader. Also, it could be mentioned at the beginning of this chapter as one of the packages not covered by the chapter.}}

The PGF package and its TikZ front-end is another powerful graphics package, usable with LaTeX but also plainTeX, available at:

* http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/

The package has a manual running over 500 pages and is comprehensive.

An PGF and TikZ examples gallery is at

* http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/

I am posting here a section that I have removed. It could be expanded into useful content; as it stands, it is only a list of links. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 19:07, 7 September 2008 (UTC)


== Chemical Graphics ==

{{todo|Expand the section to provide a more thorough introduction to the chemfig package. Also, expand to include alternatives (ochem)?}}

This section is slowly growing with more examples of the basic functions of chemfig. Would the section benefit from an image gallery of more complex 2D chemical graphics produced by chemfig?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SCROLL == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCROLL&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;h1&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v1&lt;/i&gt;)-(&lt;i&gt;h2&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v2&lt;/i&gt;),&lt;i&gt;hPixels%&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;vPixels%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement scrolls the pixels in the rectangle &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h1&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v1&lt;/i&gt;)-(&lt;i&gt;h2,v2&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, by a horizontal distance of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;hPixels%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a vertical distance of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;vPixels%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, in the current output window. Positive values of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;hPixels%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; scroll to the right; positive values of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;vPixels%&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;scroll downward; use negative values to scroll in the opposite direction(s). &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCROLL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is often used in conjunction with scroll bars to view a graphic that is too large to fit entirely in the window.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCROLL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; generates a &lt;code&gt;_wndRefresh&lt;/code&gt; event, which your program can detect in its dialog-event handling routine the next time a &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; statement is executed. Your dialog-event handling routine should respond to this event by redrawing the portion of the window that was left blank by the scroll. If you don't redraw this area explicitly, it will be filled with the window's current background color and pattern.

&lt;strong&gt;FB Lite behavior:&lt;/strong&gt;
When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCROLL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; operates only on the Graphics Window. Because &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; refreshes the window automatically, you won't receive a &lt;code&gt;_wndRefresh &lt;/code&gt;event.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SCROLL BUTTON == 
 


=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCROLL BUTTON&lt;/b&gt; [#]&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt; &amp;not;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[,[&lt;i&gt;current&lt;/i&gt;][,[&lt;i&gt;min&lt;/i&gt;][,[&lt;i&gt;max&lt;/i&gt;][,[&lt;i&gt;page&lt;/i&gt;][,[&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;][,&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;]]]]]]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCROLL BUTTON&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement puts a new scrollbar in the current output window, or alters an existing scrollbar's characteristics. The parameters are interpreted as follows:

&quot;Image was here&quot;

=== To Create a New Scrollbar ===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Choose an &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; value such that &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is different from the ID's of all&amp;nbsp;existing buttons and scrollbars in the window. If you use a negative &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and the&amp;nbsp;window contains a multistyled non-static edit field whose ID number is &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;then the actions of the scrollbar are linked to the edit field (explained below).


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Choose initial values for current, min, max and page. All of these parameters are&amp;nbsp;optional; any of them that you omit will have the following default initial values:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;current&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = 0


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = 0


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;max&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = 255


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;page&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = 16


&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If creating a &lt;code&gt;_scrollOther&lt;/code&gt; scrollbar, specify the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter. This parameter is&amp;nbsp;optional if you're creating a &lt;code&gt;_scrollVert&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_scrollHorz&lt;/code&gt; scrollbar.


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Specify the type. This parameter is optional; its default value is &lt;code&gt;_scrollOther&lt;/code&gt;.


&lt;/ul&gt;
=== To Alter an Existing Scrollbar ===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the ID number of an existing scrollbar in the window.


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If you want to change any of the current, min, max or page values, specify the&amp;nbsp;corresponding parameters. Any of these that you omit won't have their values changed.


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If you want to change the rectangle of a &lt;code&gt;_scrollOther&lt;/code&gt; scrollbar, specify the new&amp;nbsp;rectangle in the rect parameter. If you omit this parameter, the rectangle won't&amp;nbsp;change. NOTE: the rect parameter is ignored when you're altering a &lt;code&gt;_scrollVert&lt;/code&gt; or&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;_scrollHorz&lt;/code&gt; scrollbar.


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;You can't alter the type of an existing scrollbar. This parameter is ignored if the&amp;nbsp;scrollbar already exists.


&lt;/ul&gt;
=== To Activate or De-activate a Scrollbar ===

You can use the &lt;code&gt;BUTTON&lt;/code&gt; statement to activate (highlight) or de-activate (dim) an existing scrollbar.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;To activate it, use: &lt;code&gt;BUTTON scrollbarID, _activeBtn &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;To de-activate it, use: &lt;code&gt;BUTTON scrollbarID, _grayBtn&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
=== Linking a Scrollbar's Action to an Edit Field ===
If you specify a negative &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; value when creating a new scrollbar, FB looks for a multisyled edit field (which can be static) whose ID number equals &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; in the current window. If such a field is found, the behavior of the scrollbar and the edit field become linked, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;When the user (or your program) moves the scrollbar thumb, the text in the edit field scrolls vertically;


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;When the user (or your program) alters the text in the field, or drags through it vertically, the scrollbar thumb moves correspondingly.


&lt;/ul&gt;
When linking a scrollbar to an edit field, it's recommended that you use a vertical scrollbar. A horizontal scrollbar will not scroll the text horizontally, and its action is likely to look strange to the user.

You can't alter the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;current&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;max&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameters of a scrollbar that's linked to an edit field. These values are automatically altered dynamically as the content and position of the text in the field changes. Also, you can't use the &lt;code&gt;BUTTON&lt;/code&gt; statement to activate nor de-activate this kind of scrollbar; the scrollbar is active when the edit field contains more lines than will fit in the view rectangle, and is inactive otherwise.

&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: To link a scrollbar to an edit field, you must create the edit field first, and the scrollbar second.

&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: You can only link a scrollbar to a multistyled edit field (a field which was created using a negative &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; value).

=== Using the Scrollbar ===
To make the scrollbar usable, your program must call &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; periodically. Among other things, &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; tracks the motion and clicking of the mouse in the scrollbar, and moves the thumb in response to these user actions. Your program can also move the thumb explicitly by setting the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;current&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCROLL BUTTON&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/code&gt;statement.

Whenever the user moves the thumb, a dialog event of type &lt;code&gt;_btnClick&lt;/code&gt; is generated. The &amp;quot;id&amp;quot; value for this event equals the scrollbar's ID. You can determine the thumb's current position using the &lt;code&gt;BUTTON&lt;/code&gt; function:

&lt;code&gt;thumbPosition = &lt;b&gt;BUTTON&lt;/b&gt;(scrollBarID)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Note ===
To remove a scrollbar, use the &lt;code&gt;BUTTON CLOSE&lt;/code&gt; statement:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;BUTTON CLOSE&lt;/b&gt; scrollBarID&lt;/code&gt;

To find out information about a scrollbar, use the &lt;code&gt;BUTTON&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; function to get the scrollbar's control record.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SETSELECT == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SETSELECT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;startSelect%&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;endSelect%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
If the current output window contains an active edit field, this statement selects (highlights) a range of text in the field, or sets the position of the blinking insertion point. It also scrolls the selected text into view, if it's not already in view.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;startSelect%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;endSelect%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameters refer to positions between characters in the field. Position 0 is just to the left of the first character; position 1 is between the first and second characters; and so on. If you specify a position greater than or equal to the number of characters in the field, it indicates a position just to the right of the last character. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;startSelect%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;endSelect%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then no text is highlighted, but a blinking insertion point is paced at the indicated position.

=== Example ===
&lt;pre&gt;
If you specify &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SETSELECT&lt;/b&gt; 0,0&lt;/code&gt;, a blinking insertion point is placed at the beginning of the field's text. If you specify &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SETSELECT&lt;/b&gt; 0,32767&lt;/code&gt;, all of the text in the field is selected. If you specify &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SETSELECT&lt;/b&gt; 32767,32767&lt;/code&gt;, a blinking insertion point is placed at the end of the field's text.

The following inserts or replaces the selected range with the contents of &lt;code&gt;newString$&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SETSELECT&lt;/b&gt; startSelect%, endSelect%
TEKEY$ = newString$&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
Text selection and insertion-pont placement are normally handled automatically by the &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; statement, in response to the user's mouse and keyboard actions. Use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SETSELECT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for special situations.

Use the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW(_selStart)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WINDOW(_selEnd)&lt;/code&gt; functions to determine the active field's current selection range.

&lt;strong&gt;FB Lite behavior:&lt;/strong&gt;
When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SETSELECT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; switches to the Text Window, then highlights the indicated range of characters in the window.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SETZOOM == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SETZOOM&lt;/b&gt; [#]&lt;i&gt;windowID&lt;/i&gt; [,(&lt;i&gt;h1&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v1&lt;/i&gt;)-(&lt;i&gt;h2&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v2&lt;/i&gt;)]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SETZOOM&lt;/b&gt; [#]&lt;i&gt;windowID&lt;/i&gt;, @&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;June 12, 2000 (Release 3)

=== Description ===
When you create a window that has a zoom box, FB assigns a default &amp;quot;zoom rectangle&amp;quot; for the window. The zoom rectangle is the screen rectangle that the window occupies after the user clicks the zoom box. Clicking the zoom box a second time causes the window to change back to its previous rectangle. By default, the zoom rectangle takes up most of the screen.

Use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SETZOOM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement to assign a new zoom rectangle for the window, specified by &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h1,v1&lt;/i&gt;)-(&lt;i&gt;h2,v2&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h1,v1&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h2,v2&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; are diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle, in global screen coordinates. The next time the user clicks on the window's zoom box, and your program subsequently executes &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt;, the window's size and location will change to fit the specified zoom rectangle.

If you omit the &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h1,v1&lt;/i&gt;)-(&lt;i&gt;h2,v2&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; parameter, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SETZOOM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; resets the zoom rectangle to the default zoom rectangle.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SETZOOM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; has no effect on windows that don't have a zoom box.

=== Note ===
You can use the &lt;code&gt;DIALOG&lt;/code&gt; function to determine when the user has clicked on the window's zoom box.

The size of the zoom rectangle is not limited by the &lt;code&gt;MAXWINDOW&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;MINWINDOW &lt;/code&gt;statement.

Do not use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SETZOOM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; unless the window specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;windowID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; has already been created (using the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW&lt;/code&gt; statement).

&lt;code&gt;MAXWINDOW; MINWINDOW; DIALOG function; WINDOW statement&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SHUTDOWN == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHUTDOWN&lt;/b&gt; [&lt;i&gt;msg$&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
When used without the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;msg$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHUTDOWN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; behaves identically as the &lt;code&gt;END &lt;/code&gt;statement. If the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;msg$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter is included, the string in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;msg$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is displayed in an alert box before the program quits.

&lt;strong&gt;FB Lite behavior:&lt;/strong&gt;
When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, the string in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;msg$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter is displayed in the Text Window, rather than in an alert box.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SGN == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;signOfExpr&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;SGN&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
Use this function to determine the &amp;quot;sign&amp;quot; of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SGN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;1 if expr is positive;


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;0 if expr is zero;


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt; -1 if expr is negative.


&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
=== Example ===
&lt;pre&gt;
This loop counts up if first, and counts down if last:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOR&lt;/b&gt; x = first &lt;b&gt;TO&lt;/b&gt; last &lt;b&gt;STEP&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;SGN&lt;/b&gt;(last-first)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; x&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NEXT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;June, 2001 (Release 5)

=== Description ===
This statement is used in conjunction with other Apple Event commands available starting with Release 5. It allows you to send information of any size to another process. The parameters include the standard event type and class. (See &lt;code&gt;ON APPLEEVENT&lt;/code&gt; for details about these parameters.) The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;dataAddress&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies where the Apple Event Manager will find the data and the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;dataSize&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; variable tells the length of that data.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;processName$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter may be a null string (to send the information to all running processes) or it may be a specific process name. (See &lt;code&gt;GETPROCESSINFO&lt;/code&gt; for an example of how to build a list of running processes.)

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;theSine#&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;SIN&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
Returns the sine of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is given in radians. The returned value will be in the range -1 to +1. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; always returns a double-precision result.

=== Note ===
To find the sine of an angle &lt;code&gt;degAngle&lt;/code&gt; which is given in degrees, use the following:

&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;theSine# = &lt;b&gt;SIN&lt;/b&gt;(degAngle * pi# / 180)&lt;/code&gt;

where &lt;code&gt;pi#&lt;/code&gt; equals 3.14159265359

=== Description ===
This statement stops the sound that was initiated with the latest &lt;code&gt;SOUND &amp;lt;frequency&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;or &lt;code&gt;SOUND &amp;lt;snd&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SIZEOF == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;dataSize&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;SIZEOF&lt;/b&gt;({&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;|&lt;i&gt;typeName&lt;/i&gt;|&lt;i&gt;ptrType&lt;/i&gt;^|&lt;i&gt;hdlType&lt;/i&gt;^^})&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This function returns the number of bytes of memory allocated for a particular variable &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or the number of bytes allocated for each variable of a particular specified type.

If you specify &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;typeName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, it should either be the name of a type defined previously in your program (in a &lt;code&gt;BEGIN RECORD&lt;/code&gt; statement or a &lt;code&gt;#DEFINE&lt;/code&gt; statement), or the name of one of FutureBasic's built-in types (such as &lt;code&gt;INT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LONG&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RECT&lt;/code&gt;, etc.). &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIZEOF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns the size of a variable of that type.

If you specify &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;ptrType^&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;ptrType&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be the name of a type which was previously declared to be a pointer to some other type (in a &lt;code&gt;#DEFINE&lt;/code&gt; statement). In this case, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIZEOF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns the size of the type that &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;ptrType&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; points to. Note that if you omit the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; symbol, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIZEOF&lt;/b&gt;(ptrType)&lt;/code&gt; just returns the size of a pointer variable (usually 4).

If you specify &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;hdlType^^&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;hdlType&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be the name of a type which was previously declared to be a handle to some other type (in a &lt;code&gt;#DEFINE&lt;/code&gt; statement). In this case, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIZEOF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns the size of the type referenced by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;hdlType&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Note that if you omit the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;^^&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; symbols, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIZEOF&lt;/b&gt;(hdlType)&lt;/code&gt; just returns the size of a handle variable (usually 4).

=== Note ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIZEOF&lt;/b&gt;(stringVar$)&lt;/code&gt; returns the number of bytes reserved in memory for the string variable &lt;code&gt;stringVar$&lt;/code&gt;. 
This is not the same thing as &lt;code&gt;LEN(stringVar$)&lt;/code&gt;.

If a variable &lt;code&gt;handleVar&lt;/code&gt; contains the handle to a relocatable block (of a possibly unknown type), you can use the Toolbox function &lt;code&gt;GETHANDLESIZE&lt;/code&gt; to determine the size of the block.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SOUND &amp;lt;frequency&amp;gt; == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOUND&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;pitch&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;duration&lt;/i&gt; [,[&lt;i&gt;volume&lt;/i&gt;][,&lt;i&gt;async&lt;/i&gt;]]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement plays a tone of the given pitch, duration and volume.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pitch&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is expressed as a frequency in cycles per second. The frequency that you specify is converted to the nearest &amp;quot;MIDI note value,&amp;quot; which determines the actual note that's played. Middle &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; corresponds to a frequency of 261.625.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;duration&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is expressed in ticks, and can range from 0 to 32,767. However, the toolbox sound commands require FB to translate the ticks into an integer to represent half-milliseconds. This means you can play a note that is no longer than 32.8 seconds.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;volume&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can range from 0 through 127. Specifying 0 will result in silence, and 127 will play the sound at the maximum volume specified in the &amp;quot;Sound&amp;quot; control panel. If you omit this parameter, it is treated as 127.

If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;async&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;_zTrue&lt;/code&gt;, the sound will play asynchronously. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;async&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;_false&lt;/code&gt;, or you omit the parameter, the sound plays synchronously. When you play asynchronously, your program starts executing the next statement immediately while the sound is playing in the background. When you play synchronously, the next statement in your program does not execute until the sound has finished playing.

If you are playing notes asynchronously, and your execute a second &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOUND&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement while another sound is still playing in the background, the new sound won't start playing until the first sound finishes. Note that on some machines, this technique can result in lost sounds. When playing asynchronously it's better to use the &lt;code&gt;SOUND%&lt;/code&gt; function to determine when one sound has ended, before attempting to play the next sound.

One way to play sound frequencies is to use negative numbers (from -1 through -127) to represent the note that you wish to play. The table below shows how to use these values.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image was here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


Using the midi table for a guideline, we can create a version of &amp;quot;pop goes the weasel&amp;quot; as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Pop! &amp;quot;; : &lt;b&gt;SOUND&lt;/b&gt; -70, 45 ,,_false&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Goes &amp;quot;; : &lt;b&gt;SOUND&lt;/b&gt; -64, 30 ,,_false&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;the &amp;quot;; : &lt;b&gt;SOUND&lt;/b&gt; -67, 15 ,,_false&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;wea&amp;quot;; : &lt;b&gt;SOUND&lt;/b&gt; -66, 40 ,,_false&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;sel &amp;quot;; : &lt;b&gt;SOUND&lt;/b&gt; -62, 45 ,,_false&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;code&gt;SOUND%; SOUND END; SOUND&amp;lt;snd&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SOUND &amp;lt;snd&amp;gt; == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOUND&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;soundIDstring$

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOUND&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;%resIDNumber

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOUND&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&amp;amp;soundHandle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement plays a synthesized sound which is in the &amp;quot;snd&amp;quot; format. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;soundIDstring$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter identifies the sound you want to play; you can construct this string in any of the following ways:

* By resource name: Set &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;soundIDstring$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the name of an &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;snd &lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource in a currently open resource file. Don't use a resource name that begins with &amp;quot;%&amp;quot; or with &amp;quot;&amp;amp;&amp;quot;, or it will be confused with the other forms discussed below.
* By resource ID number: If &lt;code&gt;%myResID&lt;/code&gt; is the resource ID number of an &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;snd &lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource in a currently open resource file, you can prefix the number with a percent sign:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SOUND&lt;/b&gt; %myResID&lt;/code&gt;

* By &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;snd &lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; handle: If &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;mySoundHandle&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is a handle to a sound in &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;snd &lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; format, you can construct the &lt;i&gt;&lt;code&gt;soundIDstring$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/i&gt; parameter as follows:

&lt;code&gt;SOUND &amp;amp;mySoundHandle&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;

If FB needs to load a resource to play the sound, it does not automatically release the resource after the sound stops. In this case, you should either use purgeable &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;snd &lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resources, or you should execute the &lt;code&gt;SOUND END&lt;/code&gt; statement to force the resource to be released.

Sounds played using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOUND&lt;/b&gt; &amp;lt;snd&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement are always played asynchronously; that is, your program continues to the next statement immediately, while the sound is playing in the background. However, if you execute a second &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOUND&lt;/b&gt; &amp;lt;snd&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement while a previous sound is still playing in the background, the new sound won't start playing until the first sound finishes.

=== Example ===
If you want your program to &amp;quot;wait&amp;quot; until a sound finishes before continuing, 
you can use the function:

&lt;code&gt;
&amp;quot;reallyLongSound&amp;quot;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'(stays in this loop until sound finishes)
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;SOUND%; SOUND &amp;lt;frequency&amp;gt;; SOUND END&lt;/code&gt;

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SPC&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
When used with PRINT or LPRINT, this outputs the number of spaces specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Example ===
&lt;pre&gt;
PRINT &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; SPC(10) &amp;quot;out there.&amp;quot;

program output:

Hello out there.
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== STOP == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STOP&lt;/b&gt; [&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement interrupts program execution and displays a dialog box that shows the line number where the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STOP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement appeared, and gives the user the option of continuing or stopping the program. If the optional string parameter is used, it will be displayed as a message in the alert. If no string parameter is used, FB displays the name of the file in which the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STOP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement was used.

&quot;Image was here&quot;

If the user clicks the &amp;quot;Stop&amp;quot; button, FB calls your stop-event handling routine (if you've designated one using the &lt;code&gt;ON STOP&lt;/code&gt; statement), and then your program ends. If the user clicks the &amp;quot;Continue&amp;quot; button, execution continues at the next statement following the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STOP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STOP&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/code&gt;is mainly useful as a debugging tool. It's not recommended for use in the &amp;quot;production&amp;quot; version of your program.

&lt;strong&gt;FB Lite behavior:&lt;/strong&gt;
When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STOP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement does not display a dialog, but instead prints a message in the Text Window indicating the line number where the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STOP&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/code&gt;occurred. At that point, the program ends; the user does not have the option to continue.

&lt;code&gt;END; ON BREAK; ON STOP&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This function returns a string element from a resource of type &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;STR#&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;resourceID%&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;should specify the resource ID number of an &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;STR#&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource in a currently open resource file. &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;index%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; indicates which string element to get; the first element is numbered 1. If the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;STR#&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource isn't found, or if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;index%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is greater than the number of strings in the resource, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STR#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function returns an empty (zero-length) string.

&amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;STR#&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resources hold lists of strings. Among other things, they're useful in helping you to localize your program so that it supports the native language of your user. You typically use a program like ResEdit to create an &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;STR#&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource and its strings; you can also add strings to an &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;STR#&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource using the &lt;code&gt;DEF APNDSTR&lt;/code&gt; statement, or remove them using the &lt;code&gt;DEF REMOVESTR&lt;/code&gt; statement.

=== Note ===
You can use the following function to determine how many strings are in an &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;STR#&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/b&gt; GetSTRcount(resID%)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;resHndl&amp;amp; = &lt;b&gt;FN GETRESOURCE&lt;/b&gt;(_&amp;quot;STR#&amp;quot;,resID%)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;LONG IF&lt;/b&gt; resHndl&amp;amp;
&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;48&quot;&gt;resCount% = {[resHndl&amp;amp;]}'Get 1st word in block
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;XELSE&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;48&quot;&gt;resCount% = 0&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;15&quot;&gt;'Couldn't get the resource
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;END IF&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;END FN&lt;/b&gt; = resCount%&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This function returns a string consisting of the characters in the decimal representation of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numericExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If the number is non-negative, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numberString$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will also have a leading space character (if the number is negative, the first character will be the minus sign). &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STR$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; formats the number in a reasonable way; if you need the number to appear in a special format, use string functions such as &lt;code&gt;USING&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;HEX$&lt;/code&gt;, etc.

Generally speaking, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STR$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the inverse of the &lt;code&gt;VAL&lt;/code&gt; function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== STR&amp;amp; == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringFromHandle$&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;STR&amp;amp;&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;handle&amp;amp;, index%&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;June 2001 (Release 5)

=== Description ===
This function returns a string element from a handle that is in the same format as a resource of type &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;STR#&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;handle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; should specify the location of the memory block. &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;index%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; indicates which string element to get; the first element is numbered 1. If the handle isn't found, or if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;index%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is greater than the number of strings in the resource, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STR&amp;amp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function returns an empty (zero-length) string.

=== Example ===
&lt;pre&gt;
This example creates and fills a handle in the form of a STR# resource and displays the results..

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;July 27, 2000 (Release 3)

=== Description ===
This function returns a string or a container consisting of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; repetitions of a single character. If you specify a string (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;char$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) in the second parameter, the first character of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;char$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is repeated. If you specify a number (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;asciiValue%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) in the second parameter, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRING$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; repeats the character whose ASCII value is &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;asciiValue%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must be in the range 0 through 255; if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; equals zero, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRING$&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/code&gt;returns an empty (zero-length) string.

=== Example ===
&lt;pre&gt;
PRINT STRING$(12, &amp;quot;LOG&amp;quot;)
PRINT STRING$(9, 70)

program output:
LLLLLLLLLLLL
FFFFFFFFF
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== STRINGLIST == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST ON
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST OFF
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;i&gt;resID&lt;/i&gt; [,&lt;i&gt;ResourceName$&lt;/i&gt;]
&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST OPT
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST NOPT
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST END&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
When source code is compiled, FB needs to know where to store quoted strings. (Quoted strings are those that appear in the source code like &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.) The strings are placed either in a STR# resource (for easy access during localization) or in blocks of data that are stored as part of the program.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST ON&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Use this command to begin storing strings in a STR# resource.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST OFF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Use this command to stop storing strings in a STR# resource and to place them in a block that becomes part of the compiled application.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Use this command to restore the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; state to whatever it was before a &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST ON&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST OFF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST =&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;i&gt;resID&lt;/i&gt; [,&lt;i&gt;ResourceName$&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;: After the compiler sees this statement, subsequent strings will be stored in a STR# resource with an ID of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;resID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and, optionally, a name of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;ResourceName$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST OPT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: This statement optimizes the string list so that there are no duplicates. It optimizes both resource based (&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST ON&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) and code based (&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST OFF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) storage. This is the most desirable state and leads to smaller applications. When the compiler sees a string appear for a second time in your source code, it will not make a new entry, but will point to the existing identical entry.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST NOPT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;i&gt;: &lt;/i&gt;Use this command to turn optimization of string off. In this case, the compiler will store separate entries for every occurrence of a string even if those occurrences are identical.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST END&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;i&gt;: &lt;/i&gt;This statement closes out the addition of strings to the current STR# resource and creates a new STR# (or uses an existing STR#) at the next consecutive ID.

&lt;/ul&gt;
=== Note ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statements are not nestable.
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;STRINGLIST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statements don't apply for string constants.

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;systemErrorCode%&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;SYSERROR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This function returns the value of the &lt;code&gt;SYSERROR&lt;/code&gt; variable, which is an internal variable that FB uses to store the MacOS result codes from disk i/o operations.

While &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SYSERROR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; usually returns toolbox result codes, it also returns three error codes that are unique to FB. These are:

&lt;pre&gt;
Example:
-9999 The file number used was outside of the legal range. 

Example: 
OPEN &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;,#-1000-8888 The program attempted to open a file using a file number that was already in use.

Example: 
OPEN &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;,#1,&amp;quot;Test&amp;quot;
OPEN &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;,#1,&amp;quot;Something Else&amp;quot; 

-6666 An illegal open type was used.

Example: 
OPEN &amp;quot;XYZ&amp;quot;,#1,&amp;quot;Test&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SYSERROR == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SYSERROR&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;i&gt;OSErrorCode%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement sets the value of FutureBasic's internal &lt;code&gt;SYSERROR&lt;/code&gt; variable. FB sets this variable automatically when you perform disk file operations. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;SYSERROR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement can be used to reset the variable to zero after one of these other operations has set it to a nonzero value. In virtually every case, you will use &lt;code&gt;_noErr&lt;/code&gt; (0) as the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;OSErrorCode%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter.

=== Note ===				
The internal &lt;code&gt;SYSERROR&lt;/code&gt; variable does not behave like an ordinary variable. For example, you cannot set its value by means of an &lt;code&gt;INPUT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; statement.

=== Function ===
	(+) 	Appearance 		(+) 	Standard 		(+) 	Console 	
=== Syntax ===
abortBoolean = THREADSTATUS[(ticks&amp;)] 
=== Revised ===
August, 2002 (Release 7) 
=== Description ===
In a threaded function, it is necessary to tell the Thread Manager when you wish to yield to other running processes. A thread which yields very little time will run faster, but will cause all other operations on the computer to run at a slower rate. The THREADSTATUS function returns a Boolean result to indicate whether or not the thread should continue operation. One reason that a thread might be asked to cease operation would be if the computer was about to shut down. When you receive a non-zero result from the THREADSTATUS statement, you should exit the threaded function immediately.

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{navigation|Book=Algebra
| current=What is math, exactly?
| previous=Algebra
| next=Who should read this book
| cat=Algebra (book)}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Of all the subjects taught in schools throughout the world, mathematics is possibly the one which has collected the image of being most feared and disliked.

So, to start, what is math?  What makes it so different from other areas of study, like languages or history?  And more importantly, why on Earth do you need to know anything about it?

== Definition ==

Mathematics is such a wide and broad field of study. To define it would be very hard.

=== Study of patterns ===

Mathematics is a study of patterns—finding patterns and explaining why such patterns exist. Patterns are everywhere: shapes (What is the area of this? What is the volume of that?), counting (How many ways are there to do this? How many are there of that?), and more.

One particularly interesting class of patterns is the patterns of numbers. Whole numbers, for example, look simple but they're not: 1, 2, 3... everyone knows what they are, everyone is familiar with their addition and multiplication. But there are subtle and profound patterns lurking.  For example, we can look at what numbers are formed when we repeatedly add 2.  2, 4, 6, 8... We can look at what numbers are formed when we repeatedly add 3: 3, 6, 9, 12... It's easy to see that every number falls into at least one of these sequences, but how many does it fall into, and which ones?  For example, 12 is in the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12...; 3, 6, 9, 12...; 4, 8, 12...; 6, 12...; and 12... What numbers fall into only one sequence?  These numbers get a special name, prime numbers, because they are only divisible by one and themselves.  Finding prime numbers is an extremely tricky question and forms the mechanism for protecting your privacy on the internet. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29.  [[w:Euclid's theorem|How many of them are there?]]  3 and 5 are 2 apart, so are 5 and 7, and 11 and 13, and 17 and 19.  [[w:Prime pairs|How many pairs are there like this?]]

There are all sorts of questions to ask about these simple sequences, and some of them lead to very profound statements about the structure of numbers.

But why are there such patterns?  Why is it that there ''has'' to be an infinite number of primes?  It's possible to imagine that this stream of numbers just stops, maybe after billions and billions of primes, maybe there are so many that people will never be able to compute them all—but why is that impossible?  Why is it that if you imagine that, then, if you are very imaginative, you will see that it is absurd?

The asking of questions about pure patterns is mathematics, as well as answering why it must be that way.

=== Art of making conjectures ===

Mathematics is an art of making conjectures and theorems—guesses about patterns. It is about explaining patterns like primes (How many are there?). There are so many conjectures and theorems, especially in geometry.

Conjectures and theorems are important in math. They say what can be done and what cannot. These things are discoveries, made by people who looked at patterns and found rules about them. For example, the numbers formed when we multiply by 2 are called the even numbers. There are special rules about them. For example, if you add any two even numbers together, you get another even number. That is what is called a theorem. It is a discovery about a pattern.

=== Study of logic ===

Mathematics is a study of logic—proving the conjectures. It is about showing why the conjectures and theorems are true.

This is important in geometry. In fact, many mathematicians want to prove many things, even up to today. There are many conjectures about patterns that still aren't proven.

=== Conclusion ===

Now, why would you want to know about it?  Simple.  Because it is fun and because it is interesting.

== Read this if you're not convinced ... ==

In a recent conversation I had with an intelligent but incredulous young man about the philosophical concept of [[w:causality|causality]] he claimed that there was such a thing as cause and effect.  He stated that there were too many causes for events to always have the same effect.  I tried to continue this conversation on general terms, but realized that I was arguing for a probabilistic view of the world.  I asked the young man to take a coin from his pocket and flip it until he got three heads in a row.  I then asked him if he would give me odds that the next flip would be tails.  He said yes, and when he flipped, the coin came up tails and I had to pay him.

When you get to the last chapter in this book hopefully you will be able to agree with me that the odds were even (1/1, 50/50) that the coin would come up heads or tails.  I was hoping that the coin would come up heads so that we could continue our conversation.  It seems that in math there is always a &quot;right&quot; answer, and depending on how much we practice getting to this answer is a matter of luck and hard work.  In algebra, we will be replacing numbers with letters in some equations, and the &quot;right&quot; answer will depend on how well we manipulate those numbers and letters.  For instance we might use algebra to determine how much money we need to take a date to the movies.  The young man I was talking to could easily solve this problem, but he would also know that his date would go smoother if he took a little extra.  Mathematics gives you the power to predict giving known information.  For instance, when going to a movie the young man could plan on taking his date to the matinee show when tickets are half price.  A question that he could ask himself might be: What time should I pick my date up?  Ideally I would be able to point out to him that by going to the matinee early he is more likely to be able to buy tickets and to use his extra money to visit the snack stand to keep his date entertained.  If the matinee is sold out when he and his date arrive, then the young man is faced with buying more expensive tickets and keeping his date entertained while they wait.  Practicing with mathematics allows us to see potential patterns ahead of time, and plan accordingly.

Because I lost my wager with the young man I decided to continue our discussion at a later time.  When you use this book I hope that you will have some moments when you think &quot;Aha! By thinking mathematically these circumstances make sense.&quot;  When you have a moment like this I hope you will encapsulate it in a word problem and add it to the chapter you are reading.  When thinking mathematically you will often feel that you have the right answer, but with enough study you will find that mathematics has theories about why [[w:of mice and men|&quot;the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.&quot;]]  The young man was correct to assume that if you use mathematics your plans will not always work out, but if you study it long enough you will find that it is a tool that helps you have things work out the way you want more often than not, and to learn how to do better with your next try.</text>

Obtain the average price of each piece (show only the piece code and the average price).

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
  SELECT Piece, AVG(Price)
    FROM Provides
GROUP BY Piece;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}


Obtain the names of all providers who supply piece 1.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
 /* Without subquery */
 SELECT Providers.Name
   FROM Providers INNER JOIN Provides
          ON Providers.Code = Provides.Provider
             AND Provides.Piece = 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
/* With subquery */
 SELECT Name
   FROM Providers
  WHERE Code IN
   (SELECT Provider FROM Provides WHERE Piece = 1);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}


Select the name of pieces provided by provider with code &quot;HAL&quot;.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
 /* Without subquery */
 SELECT Pieces.Name
   FROM Pieces INNER JOIN Provides
   ON Pieces.Code = Provides.Piece
     AND Provides.Provider = 'HAL';

 /* With IN subquery */
 SELECT Name
   FROM Pieces
   WHERE Code IN
     (SELECT Piece FROM Provides WHERE Provider = 'HAL');

 /* With EXISTS subquery */
 SELECT Name
   FROM Pieces
   WHERE EXISTS
   (
     SELECT * FROM Provides
       WHERE Provider = 'HAL'
         AND Piece = Pieces.Code
   );
}}


For each piece, find the most expensive offering of that piece and include the piece name, provider name, and price (note that there could be two providers who supply the same piece at the most expensive price).

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
 SELECT Pieces.Name, Providers.Name, Price
   FROM Pieces INNER JOIN Provides ON Pieces.Code = Piece
               INNER JOIN Providers ON Providers.Code = Provider
   WHERE Price =
   (
     SELECT MAX(Price) FROM Provides
     WHERE Piece = Pieces.Code
   );
}}


Add an entry to the database to indicate that &quot;Skellington Supplies&quot; (code &quot;TNBC&quot;) will provide sprockets (code &quot;1&quot;) for 7 cents each.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
INSERT INTO Provides 
  VALUES (1, 'TNBC', 7);
}}


Increase all prices by one cent.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
 UPDATE Provides SET Price = Price + 1;
}}


Update the database to reflect that &quot;Susan Calvin Corp.&quot; (code &quot;RBT&quot;) will not supply bolts (code 4).

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
 DELETE FROM Provides
   WHERE Provider = 'RBT'
     AND Piece = 4;
}}


Update the database to reflect that &quot;Susan Calvin Corp.&quot; (code &quot;RBT&quot;) will not supply any pieces (the provider should still remain in the database).

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
 DELETE FROM Provides
   WHERE Provider = 'RBT';
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== TIMER ==
=== Function ===

	(+) 	Appearance 		(+) 	Standard 		(+) 	Console 	
=== Syntax ===
secondsSinceMidnight&amp; = TIMER 
=== Description ===
This function returns the current time of day expressed as a number of seconds since midnight. Its value ranges from 0 through 86399. Note:
The TIMER function is useful for measuring elapsed time intervals, as long as you make appropriate adjustments in case the measured interval crosses the midnight boundary. To measure time intervals with a finer resolution than 1 second, use the Toolbox routines TICKCOUNT or MICROSECONDS. The TICKCOUNT function measures the number of &quot;ticks&quot; since startup (there are approximately 60.15 ticks per second), and the MICROSECONDS procedure measures the number of microseconds since startup.

=== Statement ===
	(+) 	Appearance 		(+) 	Standard 			Console 	
=== Syntax ===
TIMER = interval
TIMER(0) OFF
TIMER(0) END 
=== Revised ===
January 14, 2001 (Release 4) 
=== Description ===
If you have designated a timer-event handling routine (using the ON TIMER statement), the TIMER statement alters the interval at which timer events occur. If timer events have not yet been initiated (because your ON TIMER statement specified an interval of zero), then the TIMER statement also initiates timer events. If the interval parameter is greater than zero, it specifies the interval in seconds. If interval is less than zero, then ABS(interval) specifies the interval in ticks (a tick is approximately 1/60 second). If you set interval to zero, the TIMER statement
is ignored; you cannot use the TIMER statement to disable timer events once they've been initiated. Timer events are internally queued by FB until your application is ready to accept them. If you are receiving events once per second and your program is occupied with other tasks for 10 seconds, you wll receive 10 timer events at the first available opportunity. If you wish to flush the timer event queue, use TIMER(0) OFF or TIMER(0) END.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== TOOLBOX ==
=== Functions ===
	(+) 	Appearance 		(+) 	Standard 		(+) 	Console 	
=== Syntax ===
TOOLBOX [FN] functionName [(arg1 [,arg2...])]¬
[= returnParam] [`0x0000,0x0000...] 
=== Description ===
In earlier versions of FutureBASIC, access to toolbox calls was limited to modification of internal resources or LOCAL FNs that accessed the 68K traps through assembly language calls. In FB, the source for all toolbox calls is located in editable source code. By convention, these items are stored in the Headers folder (path: FB Extensions/Compiler/Headers) and are give a name that begins with &quot;Tlbx&quot;. This is not an absolute requirement. You may create toolbox calls and place them in any project include so long as they are defined before they are called. Routine Name
The name of a routine is case sensitive. This is the only instance in FB where upper and lower case letters may not be freely exchanged. The reason for this is that PPC code actually uses the text of the routine name in a look up table where older 68K code used a hexadecimal trap address. When you examine the text of a toolbox call, the name appears to be in upper case. This is because the editor uses an internal look-up table to determine how the name should be formatted. In reality, the text stored in memory looks very different. You can see this difference by placing an apostrophe in front of the text to make it a remark. TOOLBOX FN GETCICON(SHORT) = LONG `0xAA1E
'toolbox FN GetCIcon(short) =long `0xAA1E In this example, the case of GetCIcon is specific and will not work if there is any modification. You may determine what case is required by looking at the C code used by Apple in defining the toolbox. Toolbox Functions
Functions (as opposed to procedures) return a value. Unlike BASIC, the Mac's toolbox routines only return numeric variables. Common results are LONG, SHORT, and BOOLEAN. The toolbox does not return strings or records. Toolbox functions begin with TOOLBOX FN. Procedures omit the &quot;FN&quot;. Functions also provide a size for the return value with syntax like &quot;= SHORT&quot;. TOOLBOX FN FunctionName(param) = SHORT Toolbox Procedures
Procedures work much the same as toolbox functions, except that the &quot;FN&quot; prefix is omitted and the return value is no longer necessary. TOOLBOX ProcName(param) 68K &amp; PPC
Using only a text description, toolbox calls can be created and used in PPC. FB makes all of the necessary conversions into assembly language and sets up the proper look-up tables in your application. If you want the calls to work in 68K as well as PPC, then you will need to add the required assembly language to the end of the TOOLBOX statement for the selector and the trap. TOOLBOX FN Alert(SHORT,LONG) = SHORT `0xA985 While this may look complex, it is really a modification to something that looks very similar in C code. The following was taken from Apple's headers. Alert(SInt16 alertID,ModalFilterUPP modalFilter)
ONEWORDINLINE(0xA985);Note that the upper/lower case of the name in FB's toolbox function exactly matches the one from Apple (even though it will be reformatted when used in the editor). The code from ONEWORDINLINE was moved to the end of the statement after the back apostrophe (also called a grave symbol). While C requires that you predict the number of hex instructions that follow (ONEWORDINLINE, TWOWORDSINLINE, etc.) FB automatically reads the hex digits up to the end of the line or a remark, whichever comes first.

=== Statements ===

TRON [ALL]
TRON BREAK
TROFF 
=== Description ===
These statements affect which parts of your program can be traced with the Debugger tool. In order to build a program that can be traced in the Debugger, you must create your program as a project (using the Project Manager), and in the Project window you must select with a &quot;bug icon&quot; each file that you want to trace. By default, all the lines in the selected files can then be traced. However, there may be cases in which you want to limit the lines that can be traced, especially because treaceable lines make your compiled program's size larger and take somewhat longer to execute. TROFF cause subsequent lines to be untraceable. This is a non-executable statement, so it affects the lines that appear below it, regardless of their actual order of execution. It overrides previous occurrences of TRON [ALL]. TRON [ALL] causes subsequent lines to be traceable. This is the default condition for all lines in your file above the first occurrence of TROFF. This is a non-executable statement, so it affects the lines that appear below it, regardless of their actual order of execution. It overrides previous occurrences of TROFF. Note that the ALL keyword is optional. TRON BREAK is an executable statement which causes the Debugger window to appear (if it was previously hidden), and causes execution to pause. It has the same effect as setting a breakpoint in the Debugger. TRON BREAK is ignored if it appears within a section of code which is not traceable.

TRON X 
=== Description ===
The TRON X statement is a debugging tool. It examines the event queue for any recent Command-period keypresses by the user. If a Command-period keypress is found, TRON X displays a dialog giving the user the option to quit the program (this is the same dialog that is displayed by HANDLEEVENTS when the user pressed Command-period and there is no designated break-handling routine). TRON X is handy for manually breaking out of a loop. If your program seems to get &quot;stuck&quot; inside a loop for a long time, try inserting a TRON X statement inside the loop. The next time you run your program, you will be able to break out of the loop by pressing Command-period.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== TYPEOF ==
=== Function ===
	(+) 	Appearance 		(+) 	Standard 		(+) 	Console 	
=== Syntax ===
dataType = TYPEOF({variable|typeName}) 
=== Description ===
When FB compiles your program, it associates a unique integer with each data type that your program uses. The TYPEOF function returns the integer that's associated with the specified type. typeName should be the name of a type that was previously defined in a BEGIN RECORD statement or a #DEFINE statement; or the name of one of FutureBasic's built-in types (such as INT, LONG, etc.). variable can the name of any variable. In this case, TYPEOF returns the type ID number associated with the variable's type. Note that if the variable was not previously declared in a DIM statement, and has no type-identifier suffix, TYPEOF will assume that the variable's type is the default type (which is INT unless a DEF&lt;type&gt; statement applies). Example:
This program uses TYPEOF to determine what kind of data a pointer points to.
   PRINT &quot;The data you passed was: &quot;;
   SELECT varType

   END SELECT

END program output:
The data you passed was: 1623
The data you passed was: 426193
The data you passed was: Hello Note:
The integer values returned by TYPEOF are determined dynamically at compile time. You should not count on TYPEOF(someType) to return the same value every time your program is compiled.

      <text xml:space="preserve">(this page is merely a skeleton with lots of notes in parentheses which are indications for further rewriting later today; do not complain on its content until 2008-04-25 :) )

This page is intended for people who want to contribute code to Kdenlive, either occasionally or as a Kdenlive developer.

=Intended audience= 

This HOWTO is intended for '''occasional contributors''' who are only interested in doing a limited number of specific fixes as well as '''regular developers''' willing to tackle bug tracker entries on a (more or less) regular basis.

The needed setup is the same for both contributors and developers, who must

* have svn installed;
* use the latest kdenlive source code via svn;
* have development versions (headers at least, possibly source code as well) of all needed libs;
* be subscribed to the [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/kdenlive-devel kdenlive devel mailing list].

Developers also need:
* a working [http://www.sourceforge.net sourceforge.net] account (needed for being registered as a kdenlive developer)
* a kdenlive developer account (granted by the project admin)

=Getting Kdenlive source code= 

Kdenlive source code can be retrieved using svn 
Webinterface for the kdenlive svn: http://kdenlive.svn.sourceforge.net/
checkout kde3-version of kdenlive kde4-version (most work is now done here)
 svn co https://kdenlive.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kdenlive/branches/KDE4

Warning : kdenlive for kde3 will not maintained so you need to install a minimal KDE4 environment.

Also see [[Kdenlive/Getting and installing | Getting and installing Kdenlive]].

First time:

 cd &lt;somedir&gt;
 svn co ...

Next times:

 cd &lt;somedir&gt;kdenlive (make sure people notice it's &lt;somedir&gt;/kdenlive, not &lt;somedir&gt;)
 svn update

when your modifications conflict with the svn version resolve it ([http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/local/web/subversion/linux/resolvingconflicts.html Example how to use svn resolve]) or google for &quot;[http://www.google.com/search?q=svn+resolve svn resolve]&quot;

(add a note on developer's current modifications wrt svn update: when to manually merge, how to do it)

=Creating Kdenlive patches=
For a single file, run 'svn diff' with the full path of the file. Exemple:
  svn diff kdenlive/krender.cpp
You can diff several files at once:
  svn diff 'file1.cpp file2.cpp ...'
You can diff a whole directory in one go:
  svn diff 'directory' 
to create a patch file:
  svn diff kdenlive/krender.cpp  &gt; my-first.patch
Of course you can mix and match, e.g. create a single patch for a bunch of files and directories; but the bigger a patch is, the harder it is for people to review it. As a guideline, a patch should only contain modifications related to a single issue. If your local source tree contains modifications for several issues, make a pach for each issue.

=Submitting Kdenlive patches=

Occasional contributors must submit patches to devel mailing list (http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=46786) for review and inclusion.

Developers can commit svn changes directly.

= IRC-Talk =

for questions or hints you could try to aks on #kdenlive-dev if a developer is present

= Platform-specific developer notes = 

Contributors and developers: feel free to update/add platform-specific notes.

== Mandriva 2008.1 (Spring) x86_64 ==

As of 2008-04-24, Mandriva 2008.1/x86_64 provides MLT(++) version 0.2.5 but development libraries are still version 0.2.2, which is too old for kdenlive! This means that kdenlive developers on Mandriva 2008.1/x86_64 must also get MLT through SVN and compile it locally (add details on how to use user-generated MLT(++) libs for kdenlive debugging while leaving the production libs and kdenlive untouched).

Mdv2008.1's ffmpeg also lacks swscale support (amon other things) so it can also benefit from being recompiled.

* Getting and Configuring ffmpeg on Mdv2008.1/x86_64

  svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg

I took my ./configure settings from a merge of the Mdv2008.1/x86_64 ffmpeg settings and the [[Kdenlive/Getting_and_installing|Getting and installing Kdenlive] page, with the following notable points:
* forced --shlibdir to /usr/lib64 otherwise dynamic would end up in /usr/lib instead.
* forced --incdir to /usr/include otherwise pkg-config files (*.pc) would include an illegal '$PREFIX'.
* disabled static libs as they were no use. 
* removed libogg and some others which were not recognized any more by ffmpeg
* changed --enable-pp into --enable-postproc and --enable-swscaler into --enable-swscale.

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64 --shlibdir=/usr/lib64 --incdir=/usr/include --enable-shared --disable-static --enable-liba52 --enable-postproc --enable-gpl --enable-pthreads --enable-libnut --enable-libtheora --enable-libvorbis --enable-x11grab --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libfaad --enable-libfaac --enable-libx264 --enable-libxvid --enable-libamr_nb --enable-libamr_wb --enable-swscale --enable-nonfree

The make and make install steps went fine as far as I can tell. The newly installed ffmpeg and libs seem to work anyway. :)

* Getting and Configuring mlt on Mdv2008.1/x86_64

  svn co https://mlt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mlt/trunk/mlt mlt

From the suggested configure settings, I enabled mmx (no reason not to support it), used --avformat-shared (to use the ffmpeg libs I'd just installed) and disabled frei0r (not available on my system), gtk2 (I don't use Gtk), jackrack (I don't use jack) and qimage (for some reason, it cannot find some qt-mt lib if I keep it enabled; maybe that's a KDE3 vs KDE4 issue; I am still using KDE3).

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64 --enable-gpl --avformat-shared --enable-motion-est --disable-frei0r
  --disable-gtk2 --disable-jackrack --disable-qimage

Again, make and make install went fine.

* Getting and Configuring mlt++ on Mdv2008.1/x86_64

  svn co https://mlt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mlt/trunk/mlt++ mlt++

I just needed to make sure the lib directory would be /usr/lib64 (by default it would have been /usr/lib)

  ./configure --libdir=/usr/lib64

There too, make and make install went fine.


* Getting and Configuring Kdenlive on Mdv2008.1/x86_64

  svn co https://kdenlive.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kdenlive/trunk/kdenlive

...

== Fedora 10 (Cambridge) x86_64 ==

This is quite similar to Mandriva installs so I just did some cut-and-paste from the above, here.
I was not able to compile/use kdenlive as of Fedora 7 onward. Today I did it with Fedora 10 Preview and these are steps I followed [http://lucarasp.altervista.org/php5/index.php?title=Video#Installazione_su_Fedora_10_x86_64_2 (Italian Transl.)]:

* OS and repositories

As Fedora 10 is still preview, no surprise it was difficult to find up-to-date repositories: then I came into fresh new [http://rpmfusion.org RpmFusion] repository that contained almost all needed dependencies.

* Installed Devel Packages

  yum install cmake kdelibs-devel ladspa-devel libdv-devel libsamplerate libquicktime-devel libtheora-devel
  jack-audio-connection-kit-devel jack-rack soprano-devel libmad-devel faad2-devel faac-devel lame-devel lame-libs 

Maybe I'm missing many other...

* Getting and Configuring ffmpeg

  svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg

  cd ffmpeg

  ./configure --enable-gpl --enable-shared --enable-pthreads --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libfaac --enable-libfaad
  --enable-libvorbis --enable-swscale --prefix=/usr

Note that, as far as i can understand, --prefix must be declared same as for mlt

  make &amp;&amp; make install

Building ends seamlessly.

* Getting and Configuring frei0r

  wget http://propirate.net/frei0r/latest.tar.gz

  tar xvzf latest.tar.gz

  cd frei0r-plugins.1.1.22/

  ./configure
  
  make &amp;&amp; make install

* Getting and Configuring Mlt

  svn co https://mlt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mlt/trunk/mlt mlt

Then I found I have to fix pkg-config path in order to let mlt configure to find avformat libs (maybe I messed up with the above --prefix: but I'm not sure )

  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig/
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH 

qimage libraries path need tuning in order to use Qt4 (consider P.S. at end):

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-gpl --qimage-libdir=/usr/lib64/ --qimage-includedir=/usr/include/Qt --avformat-swscale
  --disable-mmx --disable-sox

Note that, in my experience, without disabling mmx and sox, compile will exit with errors.

Again, make and make install went fine.

* Getting and Configuring mlt++

  svn co https://mlt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mlt/trunk/mlt++ mlt++

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

There too, make and make install went fine.

* Getting and Configuring Kdenlive

  svn co https://kdenlive.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kdenlive/branches/KDE4

  cd KDE4

  mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build

  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

  make &amp;&amp; make install

Done!!  

P.S.(Latest news): However same procedure works on my home desktop while doesn't on the laptop at office; seems like mlt does not detect Qt4 includes correctly and build against qt3 on that laptop, thus crashing at launch. :-(

      <comment>/* Reasons for ORM */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Why use JPA or ORM?=
This is an intriguing question.  There are many reasons to use an ORM framework or persistence product, and many reasons to use JPA in particular.

====Reasons for ORM====
* Eliminates all of the 'hand' mapping in Java from a SQL ResultSet to a Java POJO greatly reducing the amount of mapping work.
* Reduces the amount of work required to the persistence code base with a domain data model and/or relational data model change.
* Leverages large persistence library to avoid developing solutions to problems that others have already solved.
* Avoids low level JDBC and SQL code.
* Leverages object oriented programming and object model usage.
* Provides database and schema independence.
* Most ORM products are free and open source.
* Many enterprise corporations provide support and services for ORM products.
* Provides high end performance features such as caching and sophisticated database and query optimizations.

====Reasons for JPA====
* It is a standard and part of EJB3 and Java EE.
* Many free and open source products with enterprise level support.
* Portability across application servers and persistence products (avoids vendor lock-in).
* A usable and functional specification.
* Supports both Java EE and Java SE.

ORM can be a hot topic for some people, and there are many ORM camps.  There are those that endorse a particular standard or product.  There are those that don't believe in ORM or even objects in general and prefer JDBC.  There are those that still believe that object databases are the way to go.  Personally I would recommend you use whatever technology you are most comfortable with, but if you have never used ORM or JPA, perhaps give it a try and see if you like it.  The below list provides several discussions on why or why not to use JPA and ORM.

====Discussions on JPA and ORM Usage====

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/Proposed}}

The current [[Perl Programming]] book only covers Perl 5. I would like to create this, a parallel book, to cover the Perl 6 language. Since there are such significant differences between Perl 6 and Perl 5, I think it warrants having two books. This book will not necessarily cover material in the same order that it is presented in the Camel book (and therefore in the Synopses). I would like to have a template that shows the list of implementations and whether they support particular features. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:06, 5 May 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">2. '''The Stranger'''
Part I

1. The sun and heat in The Stranger distort Meursault’s mood, state of mind, and actions. In any other circumstance, it seems to indicate that Meursault would not have fallen asleep but instead would have thought about his mother dying, but, “It was very hot” (Camus 3). He believes the “glare of the sky and the road” is what caused him to sleep (Camus 4).  Again the sunlight causes sleepiness when he was with the caretaker. “The room was filled with beautiful late-afternoon sunlight… I could feel myself getting sleepy” (Camus 7). The light seems to reverse its effects on Meursault, whereas most people would be more awake with more light, he was sleepier. Meursault narrates, “I asked [the caretaker] if he could turn off one of the lights. The glare on the white walls was making me drowsy” (Camus 9). Meursault reveals his understanding of the sun’s distortion on his state of mind when he says, “All of it— the sun… and my fatigue after a night without sleep—was making it hard for me to see or think straight” (Camus 17). The water at the beach seems to bring Meursault back to reality after the funeral and puts him in a realistic state of mind, though it shows lack of emotion from mourning over his mother. In Meursault’s narration of the day after the funeral, “I had a hard time getting up, because I was tired from the day before. I wondered what I was going to do and I decided to go for a swim” (Camus 19). There he sees Marie Cardona, and they go together to a comedy film the night after his mother’s funeral.

2. Meursault’s sentiments on love are mainly void of passion. He does not believe in an afterlife, and therefore life on Earth lacks meaning or a need for love. Meursault often speaks of how he wants Marie but when she asks him if he loves her, “I told her it didn’t mean anything but that I didn’t think so” (Camus 35). Though he wishes to be with her and to have her sexually, his sentiments of her is that of something that can be replaced, not something to be cherished. When Marie asks Meursault to marry her and his answer is nonchalant, Meursault notes, “She just wanted to know if I would have accepted the same proposal from another woman, with whom I was involved in the same way. I said, ‘Sure’” (Camus 42). His sentiment on romantic love is that nothing matters. Meursault may have loved his mother because he still referred to her as Maman, a child’s word to refer to the mother, and he explained that he did what was best for her but it is also evidenced that he did not really care for his mother in one way or another when he didn’t visit her to disturb her. Meursault added, “And also because it took up my Sunday—not to mention the trouble of getting to the bus, buying tickets, and spending two hours traveling” (Camus 5). His other statement that shows he did not care about his mother was when he realized, “It occurred to me that anyway one more Sunday was over, that Maman was buried now, that I was going back to work, and that, really, nothing had changed” (Camus 24).

3. Meursault’s entire regard to life as unimportant widely affects his sentiments on love as well as friendship. Meursault’s neighbor, Raymond Sintes, needs Meursault’s advice and aide and decides to tell Meursault about the man he beat up over blood sausage and wine. Meursault recalls, “Then he told me that as a matter of fact he wanted to ask my advice about the whole business because I was a man, I knew about things, I could help him out, and then we’d be pals. I didn’t say anything, and he asked me again if I wanted to be pals. I said it was fine with me: he seemed pleased” (Camus 29). Meursault’s attitude is indifferent, and his defense or reason is simply, “I don’t have any reason not to talk to him” (Camus 28). Later, after Meursault writes a letter to Raymond’s former mistress for him, Raymond called Meursault a pal. Meursault dictated, “I didn’t mind being his pal and he seemed set on it” (Camus 33). People seem to like Meursault because he is completely without judgment and befriends all sorts of people though they are distant and more like friendly acquaintances like Celeste, Salmano, and Emmanuel. Meursault does not measure friendship by any scale but merely is friends with a few people because he has no reason not to be.

4. Meursault views ambitions and drive as a thing of the past, a mindset, for students, which is destroyed as one enters adulthood and meets reality. He perceives his vocation, his urge to follow a specific career, as merely a way to pass the time and to earn money. Camus’ particular word choice makes it clear how detached his main character is from human emotion by saying, “I wasn’t dissatisfied” and “I wasn’t unhappy” (Camus 41). Meursault’s conversation with his boss proves as much. “[H]e asked me if I wasn’t interested in a change of life. I said that people never change their lives, that in any case one life was as good as another and that I wasn’t dissatisfied with mine here at all. He looked upset and told me that I never gave him a straight answer, that I had no ambition, and that that was disastrous in business” (Camus 41). The theme most prevalent in this state of mind is a blasé attitude toward life. It mainly follows existentialism, a movement in which the universe follows no purpose. This chaotic idea could possibly lead a man to commit a crime and think nothing of it. If there is no ultimate consequence, existence is pointless.

5. It is most likely that critics call Meursault an anti-hero because although he is the protagonist, he does not possess heroic qualities, ideas or stereotypical mindsets. Meursault’s only redeeming quality lies in his honesty. This quality, while noble, leads to his downfall because he cannot lie his way out of a difficult situation, but instead sees everything as it is. Meursault is not brave and will not defend the weak, turning a blind eye to Salmano abusing his dog or Raymond abusing a woman. He murders a man for no heroic purpose, and though he blames the sun and light, he does not lie up an answer to impress his condemners. He is also the opposite of a hero because no one admires him or aspires to be him. In the fight that occurs on the beach, Meursault is definitely the anti-hero, not helping his pals Raymond or Masson in the fight against the two Arabs in which Raymond is cut. Raymond hadn’t asked him to help, only saying, “If there’s any trouble, Masson, you take the other one. I’ll take care of my man. Meursault, if another one shows up, he’s yours” (Camus 53). Once the fight had begun, a true hero would have joined in the fight to defend an honor or idea or would have broken up the fight, but Meursault stood there and watched and yelled out useless warnings.

6. Meursault’s character is an absurdist, a reflection of the author, Albert Camus. The absurdist condition of Meursault and his world is that the quest for the meaning of life, and making life valuable was illogical for the individual. With no meaning of life other than simply existing, Meursault perceives life as pointless. If life is pointless, than age and love and friendship is pointless as well. This explains why Meursault neither knows nor cares his mother’s age at death. When asked he simply says, “‘About sixty,’ so as not to make a mistake” (Camus 25). If life was not pointless, than stopping his routine to mourn his mother would be logical, but because life is absurd, going to the movies and finding a mistress the first day home from the funeral does not disturb Meursault. Meursault revolves around a routine where he sees old Salmano and his dog every day, and Celeste says it is a pity and Meursault goes to work and everything is normal. Meursault’s first disruption in his daily pattern is his mother’s death, which leads him to be odd, eventually potentially contributing to Meursault murdering the Arab. Meursault is asked by Marie to marry her. Meursault did not mind one way or the other of getting married but when asked a second time if he loved her he said no. Because Marie is not an absurdist character she does not understand, and asks why he would consent to marriage without love. Meursault explained “that it didn’t really matter and that if she wanted to, we could get married” (Camus 41). It is not out of ill will but out of Meursault’s absurdist condition that he does not care one way or the other the outcome of his life or marriage. Meursault is satisfied with his life because it is meaningless anyhow to him.

Part II

1. Meursault’s lawyer’s take on his defendant was that he was being purposefully unhelpful and that he would probably lose the case if he did not bend the truth. Meursault’s one redeeming quality is that he always tells the truth, so although that should seem a worthy trait, the fact that Meursault will not make himself appear less guilty upsets the lawyer. Meursault says to his lawyer, “my nature was such that my physical needs often got in the way of my feelings… What I can say for certain is that I would rather Maman hadn’t died. But my lawyer didn’t seem satisfied” (Camus 65). Meursault’s lawyer knows that showing insensitivity at a funeral is unacceptable in the society and that it was information to be used against Meursault even though Meursault only sees it as unrelated to his case that he shot the Arab. Meursault’s lawyer did some quick thinking. “He asked me if he could say that that day I had held back my natural feelings. I said, ‘No, because it’s not true.’ He gave me a strange look, as if he found me slightly disgusting” (Camus 65). The chaplain is similarly not understanding of Meursault’s state of mind and refuses to see Meursault for what he is. The chaplain believes that he can convert Meursault’s entire lifestyle in the last moments of his life to believe in God and believe that repentance will make life worth living. The chaplain was used to saving people to God, saying, “Every man I have known in your position turned to Him” (Camus 116-117). Meursault grew annoyed that this man refused to accept him for who he was and yelled that the chaplain wasn’t on his side, a childish remark. The chaplain’s assessment was that Meursault’s “heart was blind” and that the only thing he could do for him was pray (Camus 120). 

2.  Meursault has a much quicker temper and a stronger defiance of those who do not understand him, than he did before. He also comes to a realization of his feelings toward his mother and Marie and why he does the things he does. His quick temper at the end of his life is apparent when he, upset with the chaplain, snapped. “I started yelling at the top of my lungs and I insulted him and told him not to waste his prayers on me” (Camus 120). This anger of the chaplain asking him to call him father is very different than his indifference when the priest at his mother’s funeral called him “my son”. He has also changed from not understanding his mother to a deeper understanding of her actions. His mother always said one could get used to anything but towards the end of Meursault’s life he says, “For the first time in a long time I thought about Maman. I felt as if I understood why at the end of her life she had taken a ‘fiancé,’ why she had played at beginning again” (Camus 122). Meursault’s change in attitude is one of blasé indifference to becoming passionate. “I was pouring out on him everything that was in my heart, cries of anger and cries of joy” (Camus 120). His last words epitomize his last wish, which is unusual because he does not believe wishing did anything. He finishes, “I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate” (Camus 123). 

3. Meursault’s attention to detail shows that he is observant and reflective. His attention to detail also signifies that even though his speech is simple, he is not. In his absurdist condition, he does not see everything in black and white, but sees every texture, color, and shape. He bests pays attention to detail when describing people, and when describing the heat. Describing the examining magistrate, he said, “ I looked at him and saw a tall, fine-featured man with deep-set blue eyes, a long gray moustache, and lots of thick almost white hair” (Camus 64). Meursault also pays attention to detail in order to keep from being bored in prison. He recalled, “I would remember every piece of furniture; and on every piece of furniture, every object; and of every object, all the details; and of the details themselves—a flake, a crack, or a chipped edge—the color and the texture” (Camus 79).  Meursault encounters heat and it defeats him earlier, influencing him to kill the Arab to stop the light or the heat. He described the moment by saying, “And every time I felt a blast of its hot breath strike my face, I gritted my teeth, clenched my fists in my trouser pockets, and strained every nerve in order to overcome the sun and the thick drunkenness it was spilling over me” (Camus 57). The only time that Meursault is oblivious to detail of people is when he mentions the Arabs. He does not describe them as he describes other people, showing how society in Algeria considered Arabs inferior in 1942, not worthy of the descriptions Meursault gives of the others.

4. Meursault has always been a stranger or outsider because he does not confine himself to societal norms. There are numerous instances in which he does something that seems disrespectful, but it is unintentional on Meursault’s part. Meursault says, “On my way out I was even going to shake his hand, but just in time, I remembered that I had killed a man” (Camus 64). Meursault shows his lack of understanding of the law when telling his lawyer, “At one time or another all normal people have wished their loved ones were dead. Here the lawyer interrupted me and he seemed very upset. He made me promise I wouldn’t say that at my hearing or in from of the examining magistrate” (Camus 65). Meursault is an outsider in this respect because anyone would know you do not admit you wanted someone dead when on trial for murder. Meursault does not lie, seeing it as unacceptable, yet society wills him to lie in order to save himself. Because Meursault stands for a principle, he is found guilty. Meursault is seen as a stranger in the examining magistrate’s eye who whispers, “I have never seen a soul as hardened as yours” (Camus 69).  He is also an outsider to the magistrate when asked if he believes in God and Meursault says no, “He said it was impossible; all men believed in God, even those who turn their backs on him” (Camus 69). His inability or unwillingness to lie makes him an outsider as well because anyone could lie and get themselves out of this case. He is asked by the judge if he is sorry for what he did. His seeming audacity causes him to reply to the judge, “more than sorry I felt kind of annoyed” (Camus 70).

5. Meursault’s biggest display of true emotion is his anger at the chaplain during the last hours of his life. Meursault’s greatest fault, besides the fact that he killed a man, is that he is not understood but he thinks he understand other people. When the chaplain tried to make Meursault be like everyone else, Meursault snapped. He narrated, “I was pouring out on him everything that was in my heart, cries of anger and cries of joy” (Camus 120). He also shows true emotion, that he loved his mother when discussing how he, at the end of his life, understood his mother. He said, “So close to death, Maman must have felt free then and ready to live it all again” (Camus 122). Meursault also showed that he may have had true feelings for Marie towards the end because he says, “But the face I was looking for was as bright as the sun and the flame of desire—and it belonged to Marie” (Camus 119). Meursault even shows a hint of jealousy in his fit of rage at the chaplain, asking, “What did it matter that Marie now offered her lips to a new Meursault?” (Camus 122). Meursault shows happiness dwelling on his mother and saying, “Maman used to say that you can always find something to be happy about… I found out that she was right” (Camus 113). Meursault also seems to show true emotion or understanding when thinking of a story his Maman told him about his father. His father was made sick by witnessing an execution and at first Meursault was disgusted at his father but then he understood once he saw he might be executed. His first showing of true emotion is when he said, “I wanted to see Maman right away” (Camus 4). Because he was asked to wait and because he was hot and tired, Meursault decided not to see his mother. But it was not because he did not want to, but because he could not bear it. It is most apparent that he loved his mother but did not consider that important to his case. He stated first, “I probably did love Maman” (Camus 65). The examining magistrate also asked about that. Meursault remembers, “He asked if I loved Maman. I said, ‘Yes, the same as anyone” (Camus 67).

6. The idea of hope in the second part of the novel drains slowly until there is none left in Meursault. Hope, for Meursault, is not absurd which goes against everything else in his life. It begins when Meursault does not take his case seriously and believes he will be set free. Meursault’s lawyer had told him that “my case was a tricky one, but he had no doubts we’d win, if I trusted him” (Camus 64). Hope is a prevalent theme in the novel best seen when “Marie shouted to me that I had to have hope. I said, ‘Yes’” (Camus 75). Marie has more hope, telling Meursault that he’ll be released, acquitted, they would go swimming, and they would get married. Meursault’s hope is seen shortly after his visit with Marie where he hopes of being free. “When I was first imprisoned, the hardest thing was that my thoughts were still those of a free man” (Camus 76). Meursault’s hope dwindles and he continues, “Afterwards my only thoughts were those of a prisoner” (Camus 77). Meursault eventually loses all hope when no one will understand him and he knows he is to be executed. The chaplain asked, “Have you no hope at all? And do you really live with the thought that when you die, you die, and nothing remains” (Camus 117). With Meursault’s idea of hope, the only thing he can reply is yes. After the chaplain had angered Meursault enough he snapped. Afterwards he remembers, “As if that blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world” (Camus 122).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== LPRINT == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LPRINT&lt;/b&gt; [@(&lt;i&gt;col&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;row&lt;/i&gt;)|%(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;)] [&lt;i&gt;itemList&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement sends a line of text to the printer. The &lt;code&gt;@(&lt;i&gt;col&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;row&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;/code&gt;options specify where on the page the line should be printed (see the &lt;code&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; statement); if you don't specify one of these, the line is printed at the current pen position of the printing grafPort (this is usually just under the previously-printed line).

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LPRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is equivalent to the following group of lines:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ROUTE&lt;/b&gt; _toPrinter
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; [@(col,row)|%(h,v)] [itemList]
&lt;b&gt;ROUTE&lt;/b&gt; _toScreen&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LPRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is inefficient if you are printing many lines to a page, because it reroutes the output each time &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LPRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is executed. In such cases, it's better to execute a sequence of &lt;code&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; statements, with the entire sequence preceded by a single &lt;code&gt;ROUTE _toPrinter &lt;/code&gt;statement and followed by a single &lt;code&gt;ROUTE _toScreen&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;strong&gt;FB Lite behavior:&lt;/strong&gt;
When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, the text-position parameters &lt;code&gt;[@(&lt;i&gt;col&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;row&lt;/i&gt;)|%(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;)]&lt;/code&gt; are ignored.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
You should execute &lt;code&gt;CLEAR LPRINT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;CLOSE LPRINT&lt;/code&gt; in order to cause the printed page to be put out, after you have finished printing to it.

&lt;code&gt;PRINT; CLEAR LPRINT; CLOSE LPRINT; ROUTE&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== LONG IF == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;LONG IF expr&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[statementBlock1]
[XELSE[statementBlock2]]
END IF&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
The &lt;code&gt;'''LONG IF'''&lt;/code&gt; statement marks the beginning of an &quot;if-block,&quot; which must be terminated with the &lt;code&gt;END IF&lt;/code&gt; statement. The &lt;code&gt;''expr''&lt;/code&gt; can be either a logical expression (such as: &lt;code&gt;personCount&amp;gt;17&lt;/code&gt;), a numeric expression, or a string. A numeric expression is counted as &quot;true&quot; if it evaluates to a nonzero value. A string is counted as &quot;true&quot; if its length is greater than zero.

If &lt;code&gt;''expr''&lt;/code&gt; is &quot;true,&quot; then only the statements in &lt;code&gt;''statementBlock1''&lt;/code&gt; are executed, and execution then continues at the first statement after &lt;code&gt;END IF&lt;/code&gt;. if &lt;code&gt;''expr''&lt;/code&gt; is &quot;false,&quot; then only the statements in &lt;code&gt;''statementBlock2''&lt;/code&gt; (if any) are executed, and execution then continues at the first statement after &lt;code&gt;END IF&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;''statementBlock1''&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;''statementBlock2''&lt;/code&gt; may contain any number of executable statements, and may even include other &quot;nested&quot; if-blocks.

=== Notes ===
To conditionally execute just a single statement, consider using the &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; statement instead. To conditionally execute statement blocks based on more complex conditions, use the &lt;code&gt;SELECT CASE&lt;/code&gt; statement.

Use caution when comparing floating point values to zero or to whole numbers. The following expression may not evaluate as expected:

&lt;code&gt;'''LONG IF''' x# = 1&lt;/code&gt;

In this statement, the compiler compares the value in x# to an integer &quot;1&quot;. Since SANE and PPC math both use fractional approximations of numbers, the actual value of x#, though very close to one, may actually be something like 0.99999999 and therefore render unexpected results.

      <comment>/* What I do besides Pathfinders */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Gerald G. ==

=== Personal Pathfinder Info ===
My real name is Gerald. I have been a Pathfinder leader since joining the Woodlands Pathfinder Club with my older son in the fall of 2003. That means as of the 11-12 year, I am in my ninth year of service. Woodlands Pathfinder Club is sponsored by the Ponoka SDA church in Ponoka, Alberta, Canada. Our motto is &quot;Light Your World&quot;.

I was a member of the College Heights (Lacombe) club for one or two seasons when I was Explorer age. Although I'm not sure what happened to my badges from then, I do remember earning Cycling, Archery, and Winter Camping. I was invested along with my wife as a Master Guide at our clubs investiture service, held at the beach, in the spring of 2007, and recently invested as a PLA at Alberta Campmeeting, 2009, and pinned by James Black. The Alberta Conference has been very helpful in holding seminars during staff training sessions. Two of my favorite honours to have taught since becoming a leader are Sailing and Music.

I have completed my Language Study honour, by taking Spanish classes at my local college. Hola a todos. Estoy aprendiendo español.

=== What I do besides Pathfinders ===
I graduated from Canadian University College with my diploma in Computer Technology in 1987. Since then I have worked primarily in some form of information technology. Mostly I have been a network server support analyst, but am currently a database administrator/programmer at a community college. I have also worked as a Lifeguard/Swimming instructor, Ski Patrol, and music instrument salesman/repair technician, among other things. I have done freelance work as a graphic artist, and contribute regularly to open source graphic repositories such as wikicommons and openclipart.org.

Since I work at a community college, I started taking a few music theory classes for interest, and ended up graduating with a diploma in Music (theory and composition/trumpet), in 2004. This interest on the side is the reason I like teaching the music honour. I am passionately interested in all things music. I currently play trumpet in a variety of bands and groups. I also play flute or french horn in our community concert band, and guitar for song services with the Pathfinders.

Other hobbies and sports I enjoy are hiking, backpacking, fishing, cycling, swimming, woodworking, drawing, computer clipart, geocaching, crafts, photography, and many more interests.

=== Why I contribute to the wiki-book ===
My interest in working on this wiki-book started as I found myself writing workbooks, and instuctor guides for honours myself, and wondering why the resoures to teach Pathfinders are so scarce and hard to come by. Shipping binders of paper containing rather dated information across the continent seemed like such a cumbersome way to deliver information to our Pathfinder leaders and staff. When I took my basic staff training we studied the section on recruiting volunteers, and during that session I was wondering how many more volunteers would be willing to step forward, if we could provide them with a precise, and easy to follow resources for teaching the ciriculum. What an ideal situation if there was a uniform workbook and instructors guide for each honour, or level topic, available online for directors to retrieve and print on demand. I see this wiki-book as a good start in that direction. I consider working on this project from time to time as part of &quot;Doing my honest part&quot;.

&lt;big&gt;'''Did you enjoy your service today?'''&lt;/big&gt;

== Good afternoon, how are you doing today? My name is John Q Waiter I will be the narrator for your journey today. May I start you out with something to jog your brain? ==
What does it take to be a competent server? What do we need to feel fulfilled when being served? In the service world there is a guarantee you do your job and well or you make no money.  As a customer we need to feel taken care of, we are paying to be pampered of course depending on the type of restaurant, as in  McDonalds may not bring you a refill on a water it is not expected.  Customers are demanding they are paying to be that way. The server needs to be able to adjust to all situations here are five must rules for servers.

First rule; Always have a smile, a genuine happy outlook shows through.  What you do is your lively hood how you conduct yourself and convey it to others pays your bills and keeps food on your table.

Second rule; Know what people need before they have to think about it, this may seem difficult but it is really common sense, If the glass is half full fill it, if the plate is empty take it away and ask what else they need even if you know the answer this makes the customer feel relaxed.

Third rule; be knowledgeable understand the menu and be able to show the customer your expertise in your line of work. The service industry is much underrated but not everyone can do it. 

Fourth rule; Know your customers and let situations dictate the kind of service that is needed business professionals on lunch want to be left alone to conduct business they may not want to sit and chat, a birthday party may require a lot of attentiveness you could make a great or bad memory for the customer’s special day.

Fifth rule; do not act eager show the customer that they matter if they feel that, they will reward you. When they think you are just there to see what is left on the table, you may not see much there. Always remember it is gratuity the customers have already paid for the food.

The service industry is age old, in one capacity or another. We all have times when we need taken care of small vacations of convenience; the server can make or break a customer’s experience. Not only can it make or break it for the customer, also it can make or break the restaurant as well. Word of mouth about a bad dining experience can go a long way towards a restaurant’s longevity. The server has a critical role in this aspect of the restaurants ability to maintain and grow its customer base.
As you are expanding the dining experience for the consumer, one has to keep in mind that we live in a digital world. Anything and everything can be posted online in numerous sites on the World Wide Web. One would hate to have their name or where they work listed on one of these sites. So, don’t let it happen to you.

I will not drag this out much farther, but dwell on this for a moment. In general many people may not consider the service industry as a profession, yet think in your life day to day how often you are served, how often do you depend on that person behind the counter or at the side of your table to fulfill or add to your daily needs. 

Have a wonderful day and visit again soon.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi! My name is Pavlin Panev, originally from Etropole, Bulgaria. I'm 21 years old, astrological sign Libra( on the 15-th October). I am undergraduate student studying Computer Systems and Technologies in The Technical University - Sofia, Bulgaria. I'm from group 64a in my 3-rd year, specialty Hardware Systems, and I took part in this project of our lecturer Kyril Mechkov in the discipline Specialized Computer Electronics. I think I learned a lot of new and relevant stuff and I will continue learning in this classes. For the first time in my studies in the university I understand the essence of the  components of one circuit itself. Of course I have far more to learn, but I think this project will help other like me feel the circuit idea more closely to us as human beings.

      <comment>the info under pro-abolition was still pro-slavery</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Pro-slavery arguments''' 

The slave-owners justified the use of slaves by different means. One common argument was that the Africans were recipients of the &quot;curse of Ham.&quot; 

In Latin America, black slavery became widespread after mounting pressure from the Catholic Church to cease the use of Amerindian slaves who were dying from overwork.

-It’s a necessary evil: emancipation would have even worse economic and social effects than the continuation of slavery. (Robert E. Lee)
	
	-The blacks were already better off by just being in the United States, rather than Africa. “The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, physically, socially.” (Robert E. Lee)

	-Slavery is a necessary part of their lives. “The painful discipline they are undergoing is necessary for their further instruction as a race, and will prepare them…for better things.” (Robert E. Lee)

	-Slavery is actually a good thing: every society has a portion of it’s people who live upon labor of others, and the slaves are treated well and are better off than the workers in Europe, and conflicts between capital and labor are nonexistent. (ideas of John C. Calhoun)

	-Slavery is for their own good: it was often argued that slavery protected slaves from the harsh reality of the new market economy and shielded them from suffering from “Northern wage slavery” with the immigrants.
	
	-Bible argument: southern scholars such as John C. Calhoun felt the Bible was the “ultimate justification” for slavery, as the Bible does not condemn it, and rather casually mentions slavery without criticism.

== Automating Manufacturing Systems new book..... ==

Hello Mike,

I am the sole author of the book and it has been available for a couple of years now under the GFDL. I am porting a version of it to Wikibooks. To this end I have added a license notice that should satisfy your needs. So far I have only added a small part to work out the conversion kinks.

http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~jackh/books/plcs/

Please be patient, I am new to wiki posting - I cannot seem to upload images. Is there something I need to do? Also, does the wiki support some vector formats, SVG would be preferred. Ideally I would like to be able to let others edit the figures without having to manipulate bitmaps.

[[User:Hugh jack|Hugh jack]] ([[User talk:Hugh jack|talk]]) 08:10, 15 April 2008 (UTC)Hugh_Jack
:Sounds good to me! I've removed the notice.
:You're not able to upload images until your account is four days old, but after that you can do so at [[Special:Upload]]. Even better would be uploading images to [[commons:|Commons]], since these images are freely licensed. Putting them at Commons allows all projects to use the images, so it's a bigger benefit to us if you would do that. Also, you don't have to wait to upload at Commons, just register an account.
:SVG is excellent. There are a few things which will not render properly, but they are quite rare. As well, we have some support for [[Help:TeX markup|TeX]] markup using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; which is preferred whenever possible for equations. So equations in TeX, diagrams in svg, and only drawings, photos etc. should be raster (png if possible). If you need any help with stuff, come on back! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:50, 15 April 2008 (UTC)

== Logo discussion, next phase? ==

I don't want to hassle you about this, although I'm too busy to do it myself. I think that soonish (today maybe, by the end of the week otherwise), we need to move to the next stage of the logo selection process. Here are the list of the top-10 logo families that (in my opinion) seem to have the most support so far. You may want to write up your own list and compare to mine:
:a, d/r, l, n, s, u, y/z, 1/2/3, 5/6
The tenth position could belong to either o or v, I can't tell which is more popular of the two.

I think for the next stage, we take the top 10, and give each of them a subpage of their own for discussion. Designers have about a month to select a single &quot;best&quot; example of that logo family, and once the &quot;best&quot; one is produced, we put that onto a voting page and we vote on it. To recap (mostly for my benefit):
# Create sub-pages for each logo family, possibly copy + paste all the logos to that subpage
# Each subpage must select one &quot;best&quot; logo
# We put the best logo from each subpage onto the main page no later then May 15th (or so). Proposals which fail to produce a &quot;best&quot; could be disqualified, or we could select one on their behalf.
# After that, we start the final voting round.

Do you agree with this general course of events? I can start writing up blog entries, or a post to foundation-l or whatever once we know what we're doing. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:51, 16 April 2008 (UTC)
:Both the process and the list look good. For the 10th, I'd say v is in and o is out -- same amount of commenting, but there are some negative comments at o, whereas v is almost exclusively positive. I'm thinking cross-posting a single message to textbook-l and foundation-l is good. Also a post to commons-l to see if we can get some good graphics artists involved. And then blogs if you want... I don't follow any, so I don't know what's what there; I'll let you take care of it. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:30, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

== Transclusion problems ==
Hi Mike can you take a look into [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Ikarsik|User_talk:Ikarsik]] post &quot;Hello again&quot;. We are experiencing some transclusion problems, I think I understand the reason of the page not being rendered as expected but you may know better or a way to preserve the linked structure (as in being self generated from a single location) by other means.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:24, 16 April 2008 (UTC)
:OK, I think the problem is there were too many ''layers'' of includes. The ''size'' wasn't a problem, but the depth of the transclusion hierarchy was, so I just took what was at /All Chapters and put it at /Print Version. If you're worried about people keeping it up-to-date, then to get it to work, you'll have to reduce the number of layers of transclusion. Also, I removed &lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; from /Chapter Fundamentals so it wouldn't appear on the print version (TOC overrides NOTOC), but now /Chapter Fundamentals doesn't have one. Not sure what to do about that... Sorry I can't help more. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:46, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

== [[Translation]] – A Guide to Better Documents in Another Language ==

Hello,
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This book was not intended as spam; it is based on my experience as a freelance translator. This is items that people who want text translated often are not aware of. Is this a subject that I can publish on WikiBooks? What kind of changes should I make?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Regards,
&lt;br /&gt;
Per Magnus
&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Permag|Permag]] ([[User talk:Permag|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Permag|contribs]]) 03:44, April 17, 2008.&lt;/small&gt;
:OK, I've undeleted it. I strongly recommend that you avoid talking about a particular product or service on the internet, as that would be promotional. Instead, you should think more broadly about translation as an art and a science, and cover all of that ground in the text. You'll want to talk about why machine translation is so crude, the options (not just one) of getting human translators through the internet, and then move on to teach about translation (not dealing with one or another language, but stuff that's applicable to all languages). I'll keep an eye on development &amp; try to help you along if need be. Good luck! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:34, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you, I see what you mean and will update and rearrange the document. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe the title ”Translation”  is to specific. It would be better to keep the heading “Translation – A Guide to Better Documents in Another Language” as the name of the book.

== Regarding the scanned pages. ==

Well, thanks that you let me retain the handwritten scans - I guarantee they're mine. The main purpose of scanning was just lack of time on my part.

==The test paper scans==
I have already explained on [[User_talk:Webaware]] how the test papers are NOT a copyright infringement! I'll put my arguement once more: -

* &lt;font color=green&gt;The test papers were originally intended for IIT - JEE, an examination at the national level in India. Students were not allowed to take the papers home for reasons not known. [Some tests in India do not even allow students to keep their entry passes/hall tickets with them once the examination is over]. So the papers we have with us are &lt;B&gt;RECREATED&lt;/B&gt; based on students' discussions with tutors or among themselves.&lt;/font&gt;
* If ever any book publishes the test papers, it is purely for reference. The actual content that the book publishers own copyright for is the solutions, which - I can assure you - are pathetic, dry and uninteresting.
* The above point can be emphasized through the fact that &lt;B&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;atleast&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt; five sources publish the same question papers or have published at some time or the other.These are http://www.fiitjee.com http://www.bansaliitjee.com http://www.narayanadelhi.com http://www.pcmbtoday.com. The first two offer the latest test papers on their site as freebies, solutions included. Arihant Prakashan offers solutions compiled as a reference book. The last one - MTG publications - publish the question papers along with the solutions as and when the tests are taken in their monthly education related journals.

I hope this clears any doubts regarding the copyright status of the IIT JEE Papers. &lt;font color=red&gt;I will, however, cease uploading printed pages.&lt;/font&gt; I also assume that it automatically justifies my subsequent submissions of the question papers as text.

:I'm not sure I understand the distinction you're trying make here. When someone writes that stuff down, they create something to which they own the copyright. This is called fixation. It doesn't matter whether it is based on their recollection of discussions with tutors or what have you. Simply the act of writing it down creates the copyright. Furthermore, the fact that they're published online probably means they ''are'' copyrighted. Perhaps I'm missing something here, but that seems akin to saying that &quot;I found it through Google - that website wouldn't have posted it if they didn't want it to be freely available.&quot; &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:57, 22 April 2008 (UTC)
Check my edit above in green and then read ahead. The confusion arouse because my last post assumed you read Webaware's talk page. I hope it will be easier to pass on a verdict from here. :D
* Consider source 1 - let us say Arihant Prakashan. They publish the question paper sets along with their solutions &lt;B&gt;in the form of a for sale reference book&lt;/B&gt; with a clear copyright notice on the solution. Wouldn't they have sued the other four sources for publishing the question papers in their journals or online for free if they had owned the copyrights to the papers? The point in referencing five sources was not that those papers were free but that the question papers are nobody's property - intellectual or otherwise.
* &lt;I&gt;When someone writes that stuff down, they create something to which they own the copyright. This is called fixation. It doesn't matter whether it is based on their recollection of discussions with tutors or what have you. Simply the act of writing it down creates the copyright.&lt;/I&gt; While it is perfectly true, we need to note that the papers are set by Profs at the IITs. How can third party teachers win copyrights over them by just writing them down? This is equivalent to handing over the copyrights of the Bible to some priest who memorised it and wrote it down somewhere. &lt;font color=red&gt;This, I emphasize, is not a joke or a retort - it is a perfect metaphor of the situation.&lt;/font&gt;

== Bloom Clock bot run, again :) ==

Heya Mike,

Time for another update... slightly more complicated this time though: let me know if there's a problem.

Following either of 2 categories: [[v:Category:Bcptop v. 8.3.9]] or [[v:Category:Bcpmiddle v. 7.11.6]] 

The top template is easy: just &quot;grab&quot;:

&lt;pre&gt;
| version tracking for top template (for robotic use) = 8.3.9
&lt;/pre&gt;

and replace with:

&lt;pre&gt;
| Higher taxa = 
| Cookbook link = 
| General information = 
| version tracking for top template (for robotic use) = 8.4.25
&lt;/pre&gt;

The middle template is slightly more complicated (3 replacements):

Grab:
&lt;pre&gt;
| New Region 1 = 
&lt;/pre&gt;

and replace with 
&lt;pre&gt;
| Western Bohemia = 
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Note:''' Do not replace the whole line. There may already be data entered on some pages! 

Grab:
&lt;pre&gt;
| New Region 2 = 
&lt;/pre&gt;

and replace with 
&lt;pre&gt;
| Victoria, Australia = 
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Note:''' Do not replace the whole line. There is already some data entered on some pages! 

Then finally, Grab:
&lt;pre&gt;
| version tracking for middle template (for robotic use) = 7.11.6
&lt;/pre&gt;

and replace with:
&lt;pre&gt;
| New Region 3 = 
| New Region 4 = 
| New Region 5 = 
| New Region 6 = 
| New Region 7 = 
| New Region 8 = 
| New Region 9 = 
| New Region 10 = 
| New Region 11 = 
| New Region 12 = 
| version tracking for middle template (for robotic use) = 8.4.25
&lt;/pre&gt;

The idea in the future is to just keep assigning new regions whenever a contributor is ready for one, and then robotically change the BCP page text later. You can see how I'm doing that [http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ABloom_clock_plant_middle&amp;diff=257180&amp;oldid=182354 here], if you're interested. We have a very large number of new contributors lately, so will probably need another bot run again in a month or so to re-update the middle template (and possibly add some stuff to the bottom template as well). 

Thanks again! --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:28, 25 April 2008 (UTC)

:Well, I'm still convinced you don't have the right to release that content under the GFDL, though who the copyright holder ''actually is'' is unclear. Nevertheless, it seems clear to me that someone's rights are being infringed here (probably the students'). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:15, 25 April 2008 (UTC) 
Awww...!!! Unlucky me! Why? Why does it infringe the students' rights? If we get back at it, the students have no role to play other than recall from memory what somebody else them asked in some question paper. By doing so if they do not infringe anyone's copyrights why is that we are infringing? As a matter of fact even I am a student who has answered that examination. If the invisible student has any copyrights, am I not able to release it under the GFDL? If they do not then we have got to find the copyright owners.

&lt;font color=red&gt;You &lt;B&gt;may&lt;/B&gt; be right, there is a copyright but to whom it belongs is unclear.&lt;/font&gt; The problem is
* The IITs set a question paper
* Nowhere in the examination brochure, question paper, counselling brochure or any web presence of the IITs does anyone mention or claim any copyright over the question papers.

Any doubts whatsoever and I try my best to present you with the relevant details!
--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|talk]]) 17:36, 27 April 2008 (UTC)
:Well, the questions are copyrighted by whoever wrote them in the first place, regardless of whether they're marked as such. If someone copied them (even from memory) that is technically a copyright violation. A scan of said copyright violation is therefore also a copyright violation. I'm not crystal clear on the caselaw, but if you insist, I can look it up. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:09, 27 April 2008 (UTC)

I did say I wont be uploading scans. And thanks for the little offer to look up to the legalese. Defintely yes for that.

By the way, I just got a little query. Many many questions on the question paper are standard ones, say 2+2=? for a first grade student and the likes only that they have altered the presentation a bit. What if we alter the question paper language and the presentation etc.? Can we circumvent this technical copyright violation? I say &lt;font color=red&gt;technical&lt;/font&gt; because no one will actually bother to claim copyright on this work! It is for the immense responsibility that wikimedia has to show in its content policy that we have to do censor the QPs I guess.
:Very simple stuff like that are {{tlx|PD-ineligible}} so feel free to use those! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:06, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

Finally! Well, that 2+2=4 analogy is strictly an analogy. The question papers are of a respectable level, but the thing is - they contain work that is common property.

Some time ago, I've expanded article [[MediaWiki_Administrator's_Handbook/Spam_and_Spammers]] and added sreenshots of some captcha plugins.

These screenshots were removed...

Can you please solve the problem with this screenshots?

1. These pluguins are opensource.

2. I've made this screenshots myself

2.1. As an author of these screenshots I wish to share them at any licence that is acceptebe at your site.

What else can I do in order to get these images back to the article?

I don't want to come across as objecting to every nominations you make, but since you are the one making most of them I will mostly object to yours. In the same subject I pretty much against deletion of content if not directly opposed to policy and even on some stances I will probably push the envelope on what is acceptable and will support most changes that can make Wikibooks more inclusive.&lt;br&gt;
On the copyvio I'm strongly against bringing copyvio discussions to the VfD forum, I have prety much explained why I object to it but mostly because delete votes will mostly made without any deep understanding of facts, event and consideration to contributors to the works involved.&lt;br&gt;
Ok just to make it clear to you that I'm not blinding objecting to your cleanup work but only to some of your decisions or approaches to some issues.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:12, 1 May 2008 (UTC)
:{{tlx|copyvio}} is for ''blatant'' copyright violations - that is perhaps not the case with [[Ear piercing]]. As an aside, I don't see what's wrong with !voting ''delete'' based solely on copyright concerns and not &quot;any deep understanding of facts, event and consideration to contributors to the works involved.&quot; Copyright violations are a perfectly valid reason to delete, so why would you need anything additional? &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:20, 1 May 2008 (UTC)
::No you misunderstood me, I don't propose anything special at all and I don't view {{tlx|copyvio}} as only to be used to  ''blatant'' violation (I particularly don't like the level of &quot;confidence&quot; you seem to imply with the word), it is or it is not (in doubt it is not), any one not being/representing the copyright holder doesn't have the legal obligation of researching and provide prof of ownership, some of us do it as a preemptive measure to protect the legality of the content we use, the project and Wikimedia and mostly only on clear evidence of a copyright violation.
::As I read and understand the requirements the copyvio tag is a better avenue than bringing to the accusation to a more public forum, simply using the copyvio tag (and we expect everyone does it with the needed considerations and with a good moral ground) permits the parties involved not only to be aware of the problem but also avenues to address the issue.
::I don't see any way a person would vote keep to a VfD nomination based on a copyvio allegation and don't see it as the best approach to a productive resolution of the problem, the only instance I see for calling outside (of the work/edit) intervention is to help establish the facts and VfD doesn't seem the best place for it. Bringing a copyvio to a VfD discussion is almost guaranteed to make it mush more difficult to the &quot;problematic&quot; contributor to resolve the issue, I think this is avoidable and stream lined by simply using the copyvio that will target only users interested on that specific content and increase the responsibility of the person that tags the work as such.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:43, 1 May 2008 (UTC)

=== Syntax ===
&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLOSE FOLDER&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;i&gt;wdRefNum%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement causes the specified working directory reference number to be removed from the System's list of current working directories.

A working directory reference number is a temporary number which is used to uniquely identify a certain directory (folder) on a certain currently-mounted volume. These numbers are generated by the System software on request; several FB functions (such as the &lt;code&gt;FILES$&lt;/code&gt; function) generate and return working directory reference numbers. A folder is considered to be &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; once a working directory reference number has been generated for it.

The System's list of current working directories has a limited amount of space available; executing &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLOSE FOLDER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; may in some cases help prevent the list from becoming full. In addition, a folder cannot be deleted from disk while it remains on the list: you may therefore find it necessary to execute &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLOSE FOLDER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; if you intend to delete a folder.

After &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLOSE FOLDER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; has been executed, the working directory reference number is no longer valid, and can no longer be used to identify that folder.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= CLOSE LPRINT statement =
 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLOSE LPRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
November, 2006 (FB 4, Revision 4)

=== Description ===
After output has been routed to the printer, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLOSE LPRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; informs the Print Manager that the print job is complete. The current page is printed and the print job closed. You should execute a &lt;code&gt;ROUTE _toScreen&lt;/code&gt; statement immediately before or after calling &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLOSE LPRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Notes ===
Before using &lt;code&gt;CLEAR LPRINT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLOSE LPRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, you must route printing to the screen. Closing the printer while output is pointing to the printed page is equivalent to cutting off a limb while you are sitting on it. The following fragment shows how this might be done.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ROUTE&lt;/b&gt; _toScreen&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CLOSE LPRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
=== Example ===
NEED IMG!!! &lt;img src=&quot;res/cd.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;19&quot; width=&quot;20&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; CD Example: Printer.BAS&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== statement === 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PUT PREFERENCES&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;prefFilePath$&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;prefRecord&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===


=== Description ===
This statement locates the named preferences file and writes the contents of the file from the indicated preferences record. If the file does not exist, it is created. This routine places the file in the preferences folder and works regardless of what system software is in use. The file may contain a folder in the form foldername:fileanme where a colon separates the folder name(s) from the file name.

In order to use any of the PREFERENCE commands you must include the proper header file using the following statement:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Subs PrefsFile.Incl&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;

The following example shows how to manage a set of preferences using the new PREFERENCE commands. A Boolean value and a text string are saved in the preference file when the &amp;quot;Save Prefs&amp;quot; button is clicked. If you run the program a second time, you will see that modified prefs were properly stored and retrieved.

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Image Was Here&quot;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEGIN GLOBALS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEGIN RECORD&lt;/b&gt; prefsRecord&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; prefChoice &lt;b&gt;AS BOOLEAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; prefText &lt;b&gt;AS STR255
END RECORD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; gPref &lt;b&gt;AS&lt;/b&gt; prefsRecord&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;END GLOBALS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/b&gt; readPreferences&lt;br&gt;
// set up defaults in case there is nothing to read 
// would be the case with the first run of the program)&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;gPref.prefChoice = _zTrue
gPref.prefText = &amp;quot;Text is saved with prefs&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;// read the prefs on top of the defaults
&lt;b&gt;GET PREFERENCES&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;My Pref File&amp;quot;,gPref&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= CLS =
 
== CLS == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLS&lt;/b&gt; [&lt;b&gt;LINE&lt;/b&gt; | &lt;b&gt;PAGE&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; resets the current window's clipping region to encompass the entire window, clears the entire contents of the window to the background pattern and color (usually white), and resets the pen to a position near the upper-left corner (0, 0) of the window. If the window contains controls or edit fields created by FB statements, and the window's &amp;quot;autoClip&amp;quot; attribute is turned on, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will exclude those areas from the clipping region, and will not erase them.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLS LINE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; clears a rectangle as high as the current font, from the current pen position to the right side of the window. This is handy for clearing text from the current line only. The pen position is not affected.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLS PAGE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; clears the text from the pen position to the right side of the window (as &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLS LINE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does), then clears the entire window below the pen position. The pen position is not affected.

&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; behavior:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; switches to the Text Window before executing; therefore it only clears text. If you want to clear the Graphics Window, first switch to the Graphics Window (using a statement like &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;pen.html&quot;&gt;PEN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), then call the Toolbox procedure &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/QuickDraw/QuickDraw-100.html&quot;&gt;ERASERECT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

== COLOR WINDOW == 
 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COLOR WINDOW&lt;/b&gt; {_true | _false}&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement does nothing in modern FB, but is retained for backwards compatibility with programs written in FutureBasic II. In modern FB, all windows are opened as color windows.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PUSH == 
 
=== statements === 
 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PUSH&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PUSH&lt;/b&gt; {&lt;b&gt;BYTE&lt;/b&gt;|&lt;b&gt;WORD&lt;/b&gt;|&lt;b&gt;LONG&lt;/b&gt;}(&lt;i&gt;address&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
These statements put 1, 2 or 4 bytes onto the CPU stack, and adjust the stack pointer by a corresponding amount. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PUSH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the opposite of &lt;code&gt;POP&lt;/code&gt;.

If you use the first syntax, the data is copied from &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which must be a variable. The number of bytes put onto the stack depends on the data type of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Image Was Here&quot;&lt;/b&gt;

(No other variable types are valid with &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PUSH&lt;/b&gt;(var)&lt;/code&gt;.)

If you use the second syntax, the data is copied from the memory which begins at &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;address&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which must be a long integer expression or a &lt;code&gt;POINTER&lt;/code&gt; variable. The number of bytes put onto the stack depends on which keyword you use:

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Image Was Here&quot;&lt;/b&gt;

In CPU68k compiles, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PUSH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; always adjusts the stack pointer by an even number of bytes. If you use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PUSH&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;byteVar&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PUSH&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;BYTE&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;address&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; in a CPU68k compile, the stack pointer will be adjusted by 2 bytes, even though only one byte is copied from &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;byteVar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;address&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;PUSH&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is meant for careful use by advanced programmers. Your system can crash if the
stack pointer is not adjusted carefully.

&lt;code&gt;POP&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COLOR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement sets the current window's foreground color to one of eight old-style &amp;quot;Basic QuickDraw&amp;quot; colors. &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;colorExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; should equal one of the following:

&lt;code&gt;0 (_zWhite)&lt;br&gt;
1 (_zYellow)&lt;br&gt;
2 (_zGreen)&lt;br&gt;
3 (_zCyan)&lt;br&gt;
4 (_zBlue)&lt;br&gt;
5 (_zMagenta)&lt;br&gt;
6&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;(_zRed)&lt;br&gt;
7 (_zBlack)&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; behavior:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COLOR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; switches to the Graphics Window before executing; you can't use it to change the foreground color in the Text Window nor on the printer. To change the color of printed output while running FB Lite, use the Toolbox procedure &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/QuickDraw/QuickDraw-221.html&quot;&gt;RGBFORECOLOR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COLOR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement does not change the appearance of anything that's already in the window; the new color will appear the next time you draw text or a QuickDraw shape in the window.

For greater control over the foreground color, use the &lt;code&gt;LONG COLOR&lt;/code&gt; statement.

=== Description ===
This function returns the string which is located at the indicated &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;address&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in memory; &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;address&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must be a long-integer expression or a &lt;code&gt;POINTER&lt;/code&gt; variable.

The data at &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;address&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be a string in &amp;quot;Pascal format,&amp;quot; which is the string format used by FB string variables and by MacOS Toolbox string parameters. In Pascal format, the first byte is interpreted as a number in the range 0 through 255 which indicates the length of the string's text; this length byte is immediately followed by the text of the string.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PROC == 
 
=== function === 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;procAddress&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;PROC&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This function looks for the indicated &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;label&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in your program, and returns a memory address which can be used to call the instructions which follow &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;label&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Typically, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;label&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will indicate the beginning of an &lt;code&gt;ENTERPROC&lt;/code&gt; procedure which is to be used as a &amp;quot;callback procedure&amp;quot; by a MacOS Toolbox routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;In cpu68K compiles, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PROC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns the memory address of the first program instruction that follows the label. This is the same as the address returned by the &lt;code&gt;LINE&lt;/code&gt; function. 

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;in cpuPPC compiles, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PROC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns a &amp;quot;universal procedure pointer.&amp;quot; This allows MacOS Toolbox routines in PPC machines to correctly use the referenced &lt;code&gt;ENTERPROC&lt;/code&gt; procedure as a callback procedure.

== COMPILE == 
 
=== Statement === 
 
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE&lt;/b&gt; [&lt;i&gt;tickCount&lt;/i&gt;][,&lt;i&gt;compileFlags&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
While it is possible to place your own compile statements in source code, this is better accomplished by selecting items in the editor's preference window. Placing &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statements in source code will void most of the selections made in the editor.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is used to change the way a program is compiled. The statement is optional: if you use it, it should not appear more than once in your program's source code, except possibly within different branches of a &lt;code&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/code&gt; block. It is a non-executable statement, so you can't change its effect by putting it inside a conditional execution structure such as &lt;code&gt;LONG IF...END IF&lt;/code&gt;. However, you can conditionally include or exclude it from the program by putting it inside a &lt;code&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/code&gt; block.

Typically, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is the first statement in the program.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;tickCount&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sets the preferred number of ticks to occur between operating system calls.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;compileFlags&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a list of one or more symbolic constant names (separated by spaces) chosen from the set described below. &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;compileFlags&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can also consist of a single integer constant equal to the sum of the individual symbolic constants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flag&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Default&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_pointerVars (1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Allocate a pointer in the application heap for variables (applies only when compiling a code resource).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Allocate a handle in the application heap.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_sysHeapVars (2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Allocate a handle in the System heap for variables (applies only when compiling a code resource).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Allocate a handle in the application heap.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_macsBugLabels (4)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Generate information necessary for MacsBug to display your programÕs labels and function names. This is a useful feature for debugging, but makes your compiled code slightly larger.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No MacsBug information is generated.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_strResource (8)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Store all string constants found in the program as STR# resources.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No STR# resources are created.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_dimmedVarsOnly (32)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Generate an error if any variable is encountered before it is explicitly declared with a &lt;code&gt;DIM&lt;/code&gt; statement.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No &lt;code&gt;DIM&lt;/code&gt; req'd for non-array, nonrecord vars (implicitly declared by appearance in code).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_noRedimVars(64)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Generate an error if a &lt;code&gt;DIM&lt;/code&gt; statement contains a variable that was previously encountered in the same scope (possibly in a previous &lt;code&gt;DIM&lt;/code&gt; statement).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Any &lt;code&gt;DIM&lt;/code&gt; with a previously encountered variable is ignored.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_dontOptimizeStr (256)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Prevents the compiler from removing duplicate strings when creating STR# resources in an application. This only applies if the &lt;code&gt;_strResource&lt;/code&gt; flag is also set.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Compiler removes duplicate strings.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_ChgConfig (32768)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Instructs the compiler to override the options specified in ÒPreferencesÓ dialog when compiling this program (see the next table).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The current ÒPreferencesÓ options are used.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_IncludeCDEF (65536)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Add custom CDEF resource (for Geneva 9-point text or window text) to compiled applications.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DonÕt add the resource.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_IncludeMDEF (262144)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Add custom MDEF resource (for Geneva 9-point menu text) to compiled application.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DonÕt add the resource.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_IncludeWDEF (524288)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Add custom WDEF resource (for windoid-style palettes) to compiled application.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DonÕt add the resource.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_ToolboxCall&amp;not;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Required&lt;br&gt;
(268435456)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Generates an error if references to Toolbox procedures are not preceded by the &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt; keyword.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt; keyword is optional.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_ToolboxCall&amp;not;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;NotRequired&lt;br&gt;
(536870912)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In Toolbox procedure references, the &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt; keyword is optional. This is the same as the default.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt; keyword is optional.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

=== Example ===
The following example tells the compiler to generate program labels and function names for MacsBug, and to require that all variables be explicitly declared. Tickcount is ignored if the code is used in an application.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE&lt;/b&gt; 0, _MacsBugLabels _dimmedVarsOnly&lt;/code&gt;

=== Statement === 
✔  Appearance ✔  Standard ✔  Console

=== Syntax ===

&lt;b&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;condition&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[&lt;i&gt;statementBlock1&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[&lt;i&gt;statementBlock2&lt;/i&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;COMPILE END IF&lt;/b&gt; 
=== Description ===
You can use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement to conditionally include or exclude selected lines of code from the compiled version of your program. This is useful if you need to maintain two (or more) slightly different versions of your program; &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; allows you to maintain them both within the same source file.

If the condition following &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated as &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; or non-zero, then the statements in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;statementBlock1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are included in the compilation and the statements (if any) in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;statementBlock2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are ignored by the compiler. If the condition is evaluated as &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; or zero, then the statements in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;statementBlock1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are ignored by the compiler, and the statements (if any) in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;statementBlock2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are included in the compilation.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;condition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must be in one of the following forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;constExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{DEF | NDEF} &lt;i&gt;_symbolicConstant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;TRON [= _false]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cpu68K&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cpuPPC&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;carbonLib&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;A list of any of the above separated by &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;. You may also optionally surround any valid sub-condition with parentheses.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;constExpr&lt;/code&gt; is a &amp;quot;static integer expression.&amp;quot; A static integer expression is any valid expression which consists of only:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;integer literal constants;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;previously-defined symbolic constant names;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;operators (like +, -, *, /, &amp;gt;, =);

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;parentheses

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In particular, it can't contain variables, nor function references.) If you use this form of &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then the condition will be evaluated as &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if the expression's value is nonzero.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;_symbolicConstant&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;stands for a symbolic constant name. &lt;code&gt;DEF_symbolicConstant &lt;/code&gt;is evaluated as &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if the indicated constant was previously defined. &lt;code&gt;NDEF_symbolicConstant &lt;/code&gt;is evaluated as &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if the indicated constant was not previously defined.

The condition &lt;code&gt;TRON&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated as &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if debugging has been activated for the current section of code. The condition &lt;code&gt;TRON = _false&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated as &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if debugging has not been activated for the current section of code. (See the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;tron.html&quot;&gt;TRON&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement for more details.)

If you use the keyword &lt;code&gt;cpu68K&lt;/code&gt; as the condition, it's evaluated as &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if the current compilation is being compiled into Motorola 680x0 (&amp;quot;68k&amp;quot;) machine code. If you use the keyword &lt;code&gt;cpuPPC&lt;/code&gt; as the condition, it's evaluated as &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if the current compilation is being compiled into PowerPC machine code.

=== Example ===
Because &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can cause lines (including non-executable lines) to be completely ignored by the compiler, you can use it to control such things as the declaration of variables, program labels, constants, and even entire functions. For example:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/b&gt; _needBigArray&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM&lt;/b&gt; myArray&amp;amp;(3000)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;COMPILE XELSE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM&lt;/b&gt; myArray&amp;amp;(30)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;COMPILE END IF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/b&gt; _dimensions = 3&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DEF FN&lt;/b&gt; Diagonal!(a!, b!, c!) = &lt;b&gt;SQR&lt;/b&gt;(a!*a! + b!*b! + c!*c!)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;COMPILE XELSE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DEF FN&lt;/b&gt; Diagonal!(a!, b!) = &lt;b&gt;SQR&lt;/b&gt;(a!*a! + b!*b!)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;COMPILE END IF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; blocks can be nested to a depth of 16 levels.

=Sicilian Defense=
Broadly speaking the moves 1. [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4|e4]] [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...c5|c5]] constitute the Sicilian Defence, the most popular response to 1. e4. The Sicilian avoids the more fixed center and gives considerable scope for a variety of variations.

It opening variation have many transpositions.

I have always thought you needed to burn the mantle before turning on the gas.

mantle has been burned, it is very fragile. Be careful not to touch it with finger or match.&quot;

&quot;Burn the mantle as stated on the mantle package.&quot; I read in another set of instructions.

Does this vary by mantle ?  [[User:Jazzmanian|GG]] ([[User talk:Jazzmanian|talk]]) 19:20, 25 April 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Text encoding ==
Text, in particular the characters are used to generate readable text consists on the use of a character encoding scheme that pairs a sequence of characters from a given character set (sometimes referred to as code page) with something else, such as a sequence of natural numbers, octets or electrical pulses, in order to facilitate the use of its digital representation. 

A easy to understand example would be Morse code, which encodes letters of the Latin alphabet as series of long and short depressions of a telegraph key; this is similar to how ASCII, encodes letters, numerals, and other symbols, as integers.

=== Text and data ===
Probably the most important use for a byte is holding a character code. Characters typed at the keyboard, displayed on the screen, and printed on the printer all have numeric values. To allow it to communicate with the rest of the world, the IBM PC uses a variant of the ASCII character set. There are 128 defined codes in the '''''[[C++ Programming/ASCII|ASCII character set]]'''''. IBM uses the remaining 128 possible values for extended character codes including European characters, graphic symbols, Greek letters, and math symbols.

In earlier days of computing, the introduction of coded character sets such as ASCII (1963) and EBCDIC (1964) began the process of standardization. The limitations of such sets soon became apparent, and a number of ad-hoc methods developed to extend them. The need to support multiple writing systems (Languages), including the CJK family of East Asian scripts, required support for a far larger number of characters and demanded a systematic approach to character encoding rather than the previous ad hoc approaches.

=== What's this about UNICODE? ===
[[Unicode]] is an industry standard whose goal is to provide the means by which text of all forms and languages can be encoded for use by computers. Unicode 6.1 was released in January 2012 and is the current version. It currently comprises over 109,000 characters from 93 scripts. Since Unicode is just a standard that assigns numbers to characters, there also needs to be methods for encoding these numbers as bytes. The three most common character encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, of which UTF-8 is by far the most frequently used.

In the Unicode standard, '''[[w:Plane (Unicode)|planes]]''' are groups of numerical values (code points) that point to specific characters. Unicode code points are logically divided into 17 planes, each with 65,536 (= 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) code points. Planes are identified by the numbers 0 to 16&lt;sub&gt;decimal&lt;/sub&gt;, which corresponds with the possible values 00-10&lt;sub&gt;hexadecimal&lt;/sub&gt; of the first two positions in six position format ('''''hh'''hhhh''). As of version 6.1, six of these planes have assigned code points (characters), and are named.

'''Plane 0''' - Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)&lt;br&gt;
'''Plane 1''' - Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP)&lt;br&gt;
'''Plane 2''' - Supplementary Ideographic Plane (SIP)&lt;br&gt;
'''Planes 3–13''' - Unassigned&lt;br&gt;
'''Plane 14''' - Supplement­ary Special-purpose Plane (SSP)&lt;br&gt;
'''Planes 15–16''' - Supplement­ary Private Use Area (S PUA A/B)&lt;br&gt;

Currently, about ten percent of the potential space is used. Furthermore, ranges of characters have been tentatively mapped out for every current and ancient writing system (script) the Unicode consortium has been able to identify. While Unicode may eventually need to use another of the spare 11 planes for ideographic characters, other planes remain. Even if previously unknown scripts with tens of thousands of characters are discovered, the limit of 1,114,112 code points is unlikely to be reached in the near future. The Unicode consortium has stated that limit will never be changed.

The odd-looking limit (it is not a power of 2), is not due to UTF-8, which was designed with a limit of 2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; code points (32768 planes), and can encode 2&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; code points (32 planes) even if limited to 4 bytes but is due to the design of UTF-16. In UTF-16 a &quot;surrogate pair&quot; of two 16-bit [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables#Bits and bytes|words]] is used to encode 2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; code points 1 to 16, in addition to the use of single words to encode plane 0.

==== UTF-8 ====
[[w:UTF-8|UTF-8]] is a variable-length encoding of Unicode, using from 1 to 4 bytes for each character. It was designed for compatibility with ASCII, and as such, single-byte values represent the same character in UTF-8 as they do in ASCII. Because a UTF-8 stream doesn't contain '\0's, you may use it directly in your existing C++ code without any porting (except when counting the 'actual' number of character in it).

==== UTF-16 ====
[[w:UTF-16|UTF-16]] is also variable-length, but works in 16 bit units instead of 8, so each character is represented by either 2 or 4 bytes. This means that it is not compatible with ASCII.

==== UTF-32 ====
Unlike the previous two encodings, UTF-32 is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; variable-length: every character is represented by exactly 32-bits. This makes encoding and decoding easier, because the 4-byte value maps directly to the Unicode code space. The disadvantage is in space efficiency, as each character takes 4 bytes, no matter what it is.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Software Internationalization ==
[[w:Internationalization and localization|Internationalization and localization]] refer to how computer software is adapted for other locations, nations or cultures. This means specifically those that are non-native to the programmer(s) or the primary user group

In specific, internationalization deals with the process of designing a software application in a way that it can be configured or adapted to work with various languages and regions without heavy changes to the code base. On the other hand localization deals with the process of enabling the configuration or auto adaptation of the software to a specific region, timezone or language by adding locale-specific components and text translation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An alternative to converting eps files for use with pdftex or pdflatex, is to have Gnuplot produce SVG files, and then use rasterizer from the Batik project convert them into PDF.

== Regarding a new oiint command ==

Why recommend a home brewed symbol when there is a font that contains the symbol and matches in appearance with the cm fonts? The proposed definition is wrong on many fronts. First, it should use \intop rather than \int. Second it should do subscript correction if intlimits is active (or if the user explicitly types a \limit). For this purpose you could borrow some code from the definition of \iint and \iiiint defined in ams packages. Thirdly, the definition should not use an explicit \displaystyle. The macro may be used in $...$ in which case \int and the proposed \oiint will look different.  Fourthly, the whole symbol should be wrapped in a \mathop, otherwise there might be a linebreak between the two ints.

== First tip ==

Thanks for that first tip about LaTeX in Roman font. It's a kludge, but a very flexible one that makes it possible to &quot;personalize&quot; any of the built-in macros. What I needed was a way to stick \ensuremath and \xspace on the \pi symbol so I could use it in text without switching modes, and this did the job nicely.

==Spell Checker Preferences==

I am fine with people suggesting that &lt;tt&gt;hunspell&lt;/tt&gt; is preferable to &lt;tt&gt;ispell&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;aspell&lt;/tt&gt;, but then there should be a reason given, not just an argument from dubious authority.</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Aorta RT Tolerance'''&lt;/big&gt;


*'''Pittsburgh; 2008''' PMID 18299113 -- &quot;Tolerance of the aorta using intraoperative iodine-125 interstitial brachytherapy in cancer of the lung.&quot; (Trombetta MG, Brachytherapy. 2008 Jan-Mar;7(1):50-4.)
**Retrospective. 278 patients who underwent intrathoracic I-125 brachythearpy. 29 had I-125 impregnated mesh (nomographically guided geometric array) that contacted &gt;50% aorta. Mean prescribed dose 114 Gy (85-120) at 0.5 cm. Mean aortic volume receiving entire prescribed dose 17.2 cm3, mean surface 34.4 cm2. 5/29 received EBRT mediastinal boost. Median F/U 3.7 years
**Outcome: 1/29 (3%) fatal hemorrhage from suspected great vessel rupture. Brachytherapy was supplemented with 45 Gy EBRT overlapping the implant volume over aorta. No other patients even minor events, no long term sequelae
**Conclusion: Intrathoracic I-125 safe, may be used even in close proximity to aora. Tolerance of aorta may &gt;120 Gy over lifetime of the implant. Overlapping EBRT should be avoided</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Spinal Cord RT Tolerance'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Anatomy: Ventral area (typically highest sterotactic dose) is mostly sensory tracts. Most of motor function is carried by lateral corticospinal tracts, located in the postero-lateral portion. Motor nuclei are in the anterior horns
*Behaves as a serial organ at field lengths &gt;1 cm
*Stereotactic tolerance: at least 10 Gy to 10% volume (defined as +/- 6 mm above treatment target)
*Whole cord, single fraction tolerance: 8 Gy in 1 fraction no long-term toxicity from spinal cord compression series; 10 Gy in 1 fraction no toxicity in NSCLC patients
*Fractionated tolerance: historically 45/25, but 5% NTCP possibly as high as 57-61 Gy in absence of chemotherapy (Schultheiss, 1995). More recent calculations (Schultheiss, 2008) suggest cervical cord D5 to be 59 Gy, and D50 69 Gy. This suggest probability of myelopathy at 45 Gy is 0.03% and at 50 Gy is 0.2%. Thoracic cord could not be fit, but points were to the left of the cervical spine, suggesting higher tolerance
*In terms of re-irradiation, using BED (a/b=2 Gy) calculations, cumulative spinal dose in range BED 130-150 Gy (65-75 Gy in 2 Gy/fx) if given &gt;6 months apart may be reasonable, if patient accepts higher risk of myelopathy to achieve higher chance of tumor control (Nieder, 2006)

*'''Stanford; 2009''' (1996-2005) PMID 19165076 -- &quot;Delayed radiation-induced myelopathy after spinal radiosurgery.&quot; (Gibbs IC, Neurosurgery. 2009 Feb;64(2 Suppl):A67-72.)
**Retrospective. 1075 patients, benign or malignant spinal tumors, treated with CyberKnife. DVH reviewed
**Outcome: radiation-induced myelopathy in 6 patients (0.6%), mean 6 months after SRS. Prior RT in 3 patients. No specific dosimetric factors identified, but half occurred with BED &gt;8 Gy
**Conclusion: Delayed myelopathy uncommon; recommend limiting volume of spinal cord treated above 8 Gy BED

*'''Henry Ford, 2007''' PMID 17167762 -- &quot;Partial volume tolerance of the spinal cord and complications of single-dose radiosurgery.&quot; (Ryu S, Cancer. 2007 Feb 1;109(3):628-36.)
**Retrospective. 230 lesions in 177 patients, treated with single fraction 8 - 18 Gy, prescribed to 90% isodose line encompassing target volume. Spinal cord defined 6 mm above and below target volume. Median F/U 6.4 months. 1-year survival 49%
**Characteristics: Average treated volume 5.9 mL. Average dose to 10% spinal cord volume 9.8 Gy in 18 Gy group. Volume receiving &gt;80% prescribed dose 0.07 mL (1.3% of contoured volume). No difference between cervical, thoracic, or lumbar regions
**Toxicity: 1 case of radiation-induced cord injury in patients surviving &gt;1 year, 13 months out (16 Gy, 10% dose 9.6 Gy, point dose 14.6 Gy; experienced CR, then further chemo carbo/taxotere, herceptin, zometa, faslodex). RLE weakness 4/5. Symptomatic improvement with dexamethasone
**Conclusion: Partial volume tolerance is at least 10 Gy to 10% of volume (defined as +/- 6 mm above target)

**Retrospective. 1304 patients. Treated with 8/1, 20/5, 30/10, 37.5/15, or 40/20. Median F/U 13 months for surviving patients
**No late toxicity, acute toxicity didn't exceed Grade I

The Medical Research Council Lung Cancer Working Party.&quot; (Macbeth FR, Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 1996;8(3):176-81)
**Retrospective. 1048 patients treated with palliative RT on 3 randomized trials. Seven regimens (10/1, 17/2 in 8 days, 27/6 in 11 days, 30/6 in 11 days, 30/10, 36/12, 39/13)
**Myelitis: 5 cases (0.5%); estimated cumulative risk at 2 years 2% but wide confidence intervals. 3 in 17/2, 2 in 39/13
**Alpha/beta: &lt;3 Gy, possibly close to 2 Gy
**Conclusion: recommend LQED2 &lt;= 48 Gy

**Retrospective. 124 patients re-irradiated for MSCC in-field recurrence, C-spine excluded. First RT 8/1 or 20/5 or 30/10 or 37.5/15 or 40/20 depending on medical center. All stable/improved after first RT. All motor deficits at time of Re-RT, 69% ambulatory. Second RT 8/1 (38%), 15/5 (23%), 20/5 (24%), 21/7 (2%), 20/10-24/12 (9%). Cummulative BED(a/b=2) 77.5-143 Gy, 92% &lt;=120 Gy. Median F/U 11 months
**Outcome: Motor function improved 36%, stable 50%, deteriorated 14%. Predictors for motor function: effect of 1st RT, ECOG PS, time-to-motor deficits, visceral mets. Re-RT dose or cumulative BED no impact on function or OS
**Late toxicity: No radiation myelopathy observed
**Conclusion: Spinal irradiation appears effective and safe when cumulative BED &lt;120 Gy (a/b=2, corresponds to 60 Gy in 2 Gy/fx). Single fraction reasonable if poor estimated survival

**Dose modeling. 5 series for cervical spine, 11 series for thoracic spine. 
**Cervical Outcome: cervical cord D50 69.4 Gy (66.4-72.6), slope k=18.8 (very steep), alpha/beta 0.87 Gy. Using this data, probability of myelopathy at 45 Gy is 0.03%, at 50 Gy is 0.2%. D5 is 59.3 Gy. There is a sensitizing effect from HBO
**Thoracic Outcome: Couldn't obtain good fit to data. However, using same alpha/beta, points generally lie to left of cervical curve, suggesting higher tolerance
**Conclusion: Cord tolerance calculated (D5 ~59 Gy); using the low alpha/beta, one would expect advantage from decreasing dose/fraction to &lt;2 Gy

***Literature analysis. 40 patients re-irradiated. Cumulative BED (a/b=2 cervical, a/b=4 thoracic) 108-205 Gy (median 135 Gy, equivalent to 67 Gy in 2 Gy/fx). Median F/U 20 months
***Outcome: radiation myelopathy 11/40 (27%) after median 11 months (4-25 months). Myelopathy only in patients if one course &gt;= BED 102 Gy or if retreatment &lt;2 months. 
***Risk score developed: cumulative BED, greatest BED &gt;102 Gy, interval between RT
***Myelopathy by risk score: &quot;Low risk&quot; 0%, &quot;Intermediate risk&quot; 33%, &quot;High risk&quot; 90%

**Spinal cord: common limit 45/25 is conservative and can be relaxed if it improves tumor control. 5% NTCP probably 57-61 Gy in absence of chemo
**Brain: necrosis rarely below 60 Gy, imaging changes &gt;50 Gy. Neurocognitive changes lower, especially in children

&lt;big&gt;'''Inner Ear RT Tolerance'''&lt;/big&gt;


*Gardner Robertson scale is used for hearing evaluation. Non-servicable hearing is typcically &gt;50 dB audiogram and &lt;50% speech discrimination
*Sensorineural hearing loss begins to occur around 45 Gy, and is significantly increased at ~60 Gy
*Patients treated with curative doses for H&amp;N can experience damage to all parts of the auditory system, at rate ~30%
*For single fraction, cochlea/modiolus dose should be kept &lt;5.3 Gy and possibly &lt;4.2 Gy (else increased chance of high frequency hearing loss), ventral cochlear nucleus &lt;= 9 Gy (else increased chance of low frequency loss)


==Gardner Robertson Scale==
*Grade I (good-excellent) 
**pure tone audiogram (dB) : 0-30 
**speech discrimination (%) : 70-100 
*Grade II (serviceable) 
**pure tone audiogram (dB) : 31-50 
**speech discrimination (%) : 50-69 
*Grade III (non-serviceable) 
**pure tone audiogram (dB) : 51-90 
**speech discrimination (%) : 5-49 
*Grade IV (poor) 
**pure tone audiogram (dB) : 91-max 
**speech discrimination (%) : 1-4 
*Grade V (none) 
**pure tone audiogram (dB) : not testable 
**speech discrimination (%) : 0 
*If PTA and speech do not correlate, use lower class.

**Retrospective. 62 H&amp;N patients. RT alone 34%, concurrent cisplatin 40 mg/m2 QW 44%, concurrent cisplatin 100 mg/m2 Q3W 21%, concurrent Erbitux 1%
**Outcome: RT only: No significant hearing loss &lt;40 Gy. If cisplatin, high frequency SNLH at 10 Gy, significant hearing loss by 40 Gy
**Conclusion: High-frequency SNHL profoundly damaged in patients with concomitant cisplatin

**Retrospective. 325 patients treated for H&amp;N tumors. Median F/U 5.4 years
**Toxicity: overall 42%; external ear 33%, middle ear 29%, inner ear 27%. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in 15%
**Predictors for SNHL: age, cochlear dose, chemo-RT. 10-year risk dose &lt;60 Gy 3% vs. &gt;60 Gy 37% (SS). Chemo-RT 30% vs. RT alone 18% (SS). Threshold for SNHL not determined
**Conclusion: RT toxicity in all parts of auditory system. Median dose for incidence 60-66 Gy
**Comment (PMID 17674992): 60 Gy probably too high, as prospective studies suggest 32-50 Gy

**Prospective. 35 patients, curative RT for H&amp;N cancers. Baseline auditometry, then 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after RT. Median dose ipsilateral ear 47.4 Gy (14.1-68.8), contralateral ear 4.2 Gy (0.5-31.3 Gy). Follow up 2 years
**Outcome: Dose &gt;=45 Gy had hearing loss of ~210 dB, mostly in higher frequencies. Model predicts ~19 dB hearing loss at 45 Gy, but depends on age and other factors. 
**Conclusion: High-frequency (&gt;= 2000 Hz) worsens significantly after RT in dose-dependent fashion

**Prognostice factors for maintaining hearing: GR Class I, speech discrimination score &gt;= 80%, pure tone average &lt;20 dB, age &lt;60. Significantly better hearing preservation of GR Class if central cochlea dose &lt;4.2 Gy
**Conclusion: GKS preserves serviceable hearing in majority of patients; a low dose to cochlea enhances hearing preservation

*#Start at the neural foramina from C5 to T1; this should extend from the lateral aspect of the spinal canal to the small space between the anterior and middle scalene muscles
*#For CT slices, where no neural foramen is present, contour only the space between the anterior and middle scalene muscles
*#Continue to contour the space between the anterior and middle scalene muscles; eventually the middle scalene will end in the region of the subclavian neurovascular bundle
*#Contour the brachial plexus as the posterior aspect of the neurovascular bundle inferiorly and laterally to one to two CT slices below the clavicular head.
*#The first and second ribs serve as the medial limit of the OAR contour

**Case report and literature review

===Hyperbaric Oxygen===
*'''UK MRC''' -- hyperbaric oxygen vs control
**Randomized, Phase II. 34 patients, radiation-induced brachial plexopathy. Median time to onset 3 years, median time to HBO 11 years. Arm 1) hyperbaric oxygen: 100% oxygen @ 2.4 ATA x 100 minutes x 30 dives vs Arm 2) Control: same number and pressure, but gas mix equivalent to 100% oxygen at surface
**'''2001''' PMID 11230889 -- &quot;Double-blind randomized phase II study of hyperbaric oxygen in patients with radiation-induced brachial plexopathy.&quot; (Pritchard J, Radiother Oncol. 2001 Mar;58(3):279-86.)
***Outcome: No difference up to 12 months post-treatment, though some improvement. Two cases with chronic lymphedema reported major and persistent improvement
***Conclusion: HBO doesn't slow or reverse RIBP</text>

[Epub ahead of print])
**For full trial results, please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Prostate/External_Beam_RT/Dose_Escalation|prostate dose escalation]] page
**Subset analysis. 40 patients with urinary obstruction (19 low dose arm and 21 high dose arm). Dose-difference maps
**Outcome: Early events within 2 years (47%) predicted by baseline complaints and TURP. Late events after 2 years (53%) predicted by bladder surface receiving &amp;ge; 80 Gy and especially with dose to bladder neck in the trigone
**Conclusion: Late urinary obstruction associated with local dose to trigone

**Retrospective. 128 patients treated to 78 Gy. Endpoint Grade 1+ late GU toxicity within 2 years of treatment
**Toxicity: Grade 1+ chronic GU toxicity in 15%. No plateau, continued increase with time 
**DVH (dose-bladder volume histogram) data fit better than DWH (dose-bladder wall histgram) to toxicity. Recommend using whole-bladder DVH for clinical treatment planning. Urethra (suggested to be important in late GU toxicity) not contoured
**Hotspot model (hottest 3%): if &lt;78 Gy then 8 year toxicity 25%, if &gt;=78 Gy then 50%
**Lyman model: TD50 = 77.6 Gy, n=0.001, m=0.022

&lt;big&gt;'''Testicular RT Tolerance'''&lt;/big&gt;
*Also please see [[Radiation Oncology/Toxicity/Pelvis| Toxicity/Pelvis]]


*Spermatogenesis
**Radiation sensitivity to single fraction diminishes rapidly with progression along maturation pathway
***Spermatogonia: 0.1-0.2 Gy; spermatocytes 10x less sensitive: 2-3 Gy; spermatids 40x less sensitivie: 4-6 Gy
***Azoospermia after low doses (&lt;2 Gy) takes 60-70 days due to damage to spermatogonia. After higher doses (&gt;4 Gy), azoospermia develops much faster due to concurrent damage to spermatids
***Recovery of spermatogenesis is driven by recovery of spermatogonia and is dose-dependent. Sperm recovery after &lt;1 Gy takes 1-1.5 years. After 4-6 Gy, it may take 2-5 years. After 6-8 Gy, permanent azoospermia likely although University of Washington data from TBI show spermatogenesis can recover after 10 Gy single fraction in 20% patients
**Spermatogenesis more sensitive to fractionated damage than single fraction damage due to long (~16 day) cell cycle of stem cells
***Fractionated doses 0.7-0.9 Gy lead to oligospermia/azoospermia but with frequent recovery at 1-1.5 years. Permanent azoospermia may occur after fractionated doses as low as 1.2 Gy, and is likely &gt;2 Gy. However, University of Washington data from TBI show spermatogenesis can recover after 12-14 Gy fractionated in ~17% patients 
*Endocrine function 
**Subtle Leydig cell dysfunction can be seen after cumulative 2 Gy in fractionated therapy, although testosterone serum levels are clinically not impaired
**Testosterone production impaired at 14 Gy in 2 Gy/fx

==Effect on Spermatogenesis==
'''''Review'''''
*'''Manchester, 2005''' (UK) PMID 15784814 -- &quot;Spermatogenesis after cancer treatment: damage and recovery.&quot; (Howell SJ, J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2005;(34):12-7.)
**Review. Spermatogonia: 0.2 Gy
**FSH levels: 0.2 - 0.7 Gy cause transient dose-dependent increase in FSH and decrease in sperm concentration. Normalized in 12-24 months
**Azoospermia: no threshold dose identified; doses &gt;1.2 Gy reduced likelihood of spermatogenesis recovery


==Effect on Testosterone==
*'''Review: Princess Margaret, 1995''' PMID 7792393 -- &quot;Leydig cell function and radiation: a review of the literature.&quot; (Izard MA, Radiother Oncol. 1995 Jan;34(1):1-8.)

*'''Copenhagen, 2002''' (Denmark) PMID 11896102 -- &quot;Effect of graded testicular doses of radiotherapy in patients treated for carcinoma-in-situ in the testis.&quot; (Petersen PM, J Clin Oncol. 2002 Mar 15;20(6):1537-43.)
**Prospective. Dose reduction starting at 20/10 in 2 Gy steps. Results verified by biopsies
**Remission in all patients at 20, 18, and 16 Gy. One relapse at 14 Gy after 20 months
**Toxicity: Leydig cell function - stable testosterone decrease for &gt;5 years after RT, at rate ~4%/year. Median time-to-decrease 3 months. No obvious dose-reponse between 14-20 Gy. No impact on serum estradiol or DHT. Need for androgen substitution similar at all RT dose levels; 43% of available patients required androgen substitution for clinical symptoms of androgen insufficiency
**Conclusion: Androgen production impaired even at 14 Gy

**Retrospective. 27 males with soft tissue sarcoma, treated with surgery + adjuvant RT. Dose 45/25 + 9-18 Gy boost. No adjuvant chemo. Direct TLD measurement in 17 patients, extrapolations in rest. Testicular dose from scatter RT ranged from 0.01 - 25 Gy. Dose groups &lt;0.5 Gy, 0.5-2 Gy, and &gt;2 Gy
**Serum FSH: peak at 6 months, then rapid decline 6-12 months, then slow decline thereafter. If dose &lt;0.5 Gy, return to baseline, if dose 0.5-2 Gy or &gt;2 Gy, not complete recovery and dose dependent
**Serum LH: peak at 6 months, then decline 6-18 months, then further gradual decline. Statistically significant elevation from baseline only if dose &gt;2 Gy
**Serum testosterone: No significant change
**Conclusion: Subtle Lyedig cell dysfunction may occur at fractionated doses &gt;2 Gy




*'''University of Washington''' 
**'''1983''' (1970-1980) PMID 6412404 -- &quot;Late effects on gonadal function of cyclophosphamide, total-body irradiation, and marrow transplantation.&quot; (Sanders JE, Transplantation. 1983 Sep;36(3):252-5.)
***Retrospective. 137 patients, bone marrow transplant, survival &gt;1 year after transplant, after puberty. 72 men conditioned either with chemotherapy (n=31) or chemo+TBI (n=41). TBI 9.2-17.5 Gy
***Outcome:
****Chemo conditioning: normal LH 97%, normal FSH 65%, spermatogenesis 67%
****Chemo + TBI conditioning: normal LH 88%, normal FSH 24%, spermatogenesis 6%. All men had gonadal failure for 5 years after TBI, 2/7 patients followed &gt;5 years recovered spermatogenesis. 1 patient fathered 4 normal children
***Conclusion: Cyclophosphamide doesn't prevent normal gonadal function in most men; TBI does in majority of patients
**'''1996''' (1971-1992) PMID 8639928 -- &quot;Pregnancies following high-dose cyclophosphamide with or without high-dose busulfan or total-body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation.&quot; (Sanders JE, Blood. 1996 Apr 1;87(7):3045-52.)
***Retrospective. 618 postpubertal men, treated with BMT. TBI in 75%. TBI 10/1, 12/6, 14/7, or 15.75/7 fractions
***Outcome: recovery of testicular function for TBI men 17% (CY 61%, BUCY 17%, TBI-10 20%, TBI-12 16%, TBI-14 18%). Partners of 35 male patients (CY 80%, BUCY 6%, TBI 14%) became pregnant, resulting in 82% live births (4 spontaneous and 7 elective abortions). Pregnancy rate for male TBI patients 5/618 (0.8%). Abortion rate comparable to general population. Partners of TBI patients didn't seem to have high risk pregnancies
***Conclusion: Testicular recovery after TBI ~17%, pregnacy rate for partners ~1%

*'''Swedish Hospital Seattle, 1974''' (1963-1973) PMID 4428015 -- &quot;Effect of graded doses of ionizing radiation on the human testis.&quot; (Rowley MJ, Radiat Res. 1974 Sep;59(3):665-78.)
**Prospective. 67 volunteers, health 25 - 52 year old. Single dose escalation to human subject testis 0.8 Gy to 6 Gy, contralateral testis served as control
**Gonadotropins: plasma FSH slightly elevated at 0.2 Gy, highly elevated at 0.75 Gy; plasma LH elevated at 0.75 Gy. Plasma testosterone no significant change
**Spermatogenesis: At 0.5 Gy, marked oligospermia; At 0.8 Gy total azoospermia; at 2-3 Gy, recovery took ~30 months; at 4-6 Gy, recoverey took &gt;5 years; at 6-8 Gy irreversible azoospermia. At 6 Gy, histologic recovery of germinal cells took place ~1.5 years before sperm were produced

**Outcome: 5-year bPFS favorable risk 85%, intermediate risk 58%, unfavorable risk 38% (SS)
**Late rectal toxicity (81 Gy group): 3D-CRT 14% vs IMRT 2% (SS); no impact of IMRT on GU toxicity
**Conclusion: IMRT associated with minimal rectal toxicity, represents most favorable risk-to-benefit ratio

===DVH Models===

**Rectum segmentation recommendation: Above anal verge to turn into sigmoid
**Models: LKB parameters n=0.09, m=0.13, TD50=76.9
**DVH constraint recommendations: V50 &lt;50%, V60 &lt;35%, V65 &lt;25%, V70 &lt;20%, V75 &lt;15%. Hypofractionated schedules should be adjusted using conservative rectum a/b = 3

***Planning comparison. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) vs dose-wall histograms (DWH) in 128 patients treated with 3D-CRT. Fit to 4 models (Lyman, mean-dose, parallel-architecture, cutoff-dose). Minimum 2 year F/U
***Slightly better performance for DWH model. Intermediate dose cut-off predicted as V32 &gt;80%
***Conclusion: NTCP models fit slightly better with DWH as opposed to DVH 
**'''2004''' (1992-1999) PMID 15050331 -- &quot;Characterization of rectal normal tissue complication probability after high-dose external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.&quot; (Cheung R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Apr 1;58(5):1513-9.)
***Retrospective. 128 patients treated with 3D-CRT to 78 Gy. Endpoint Grade 2+ rectal bleeding. Minimal F/U 2 years
***Toxicity: Grade 2+ bleeding 23%

*'''Milan, Italy; 2009''' PMID 19211196 -- &quot;To bleed or not to bleed. A prediction based on individual gene profiling combined with dose-volume histogram shapes in prostate cancer patients undergoing three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy.&quot; (Valdagni R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Aug 1;74(5):1431-40. Epub 2009 Feb 11.)
**Retrospective. 30 patients, 3D-CRT to &gt;70 Gy. Low-risk bleeding group (V70 &lt;20% and V50 &lt;55%) and bleeding; high-risk group (V70 &gt;25% and V50 &gt;60%) and bleeding, and high-risk group and no bleeding. PCR on lymphoblastoid RNA from peripheral mononucleated cells
**Outcome: nine genes downregulated in low-risk bleeder group; four genes upregulated in high-risk non-bleeder group
**Conclusion: Predictive value of gene panels promising

===Rectal Balloons===
*'''Nijmegen, The Netherlands''' (2002) -- 3D-CRT +/- endorectal balloon
**Randomized. 48 patients, treated with 3D-CRT to 67.5/30. Arm 1) No endorectal balloon (ERB-) vs. Arm 2) with endorectal balloon (ERB+). PTV = prostate + SV + 9 mm margin. Rectosigmoidoscopy at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years. 146 endoscopies and 2,336 mucosal areas analyzed

Epub 2006 Dec 8.) Median F/U 2.5 years
***Outcome: ERB group significantly lower rectal wall volume exposed to high doses. Late rectal toxicity G1: ERB- 58% vs. ERB+ 21%; G2 4% vs. 0%; G3 4% vs. 0%. Overall G1+ rectal toxicity 67% vs. 21% (SS)
***Endoscopy: Telangiectasia ERB- vs ERB+ @ 6 months 16% vs. 24%; 1 year 45% vs. 28%; 2 years 39% vs. 24% (SS). High grade telangiectasia @ 1 years 20% vs. 10%; 2 years 19% vs. 9% (SS). Significantly less high grade telangiectasia at lateral and posterior part of Rwall
***Conclusion: ERB reduced rectal wall volume exposed to &gt;40 Gy, resulting in reduction of late mucosal changes and reduced late rectal toxicity

*'''Nijmegen, The Netherlands'''
**'''2009''' PMID 19523704 -- &quot;Anal wall sparing effect of an endorectal balloon in 3D conformal and intensity-modulated prostate radiotherapy.&quot; (Smeenk RJ, Radiother Oncol. 2009 Jun 10.)

**Retrospective. 116 patients, IMRT 76/35 @ 2.17 Gy/fx. Rectal balloon 100 cc air. Film phantom to simulate 4cm air cavity created by rectal balloon. Median F/U 2.6 years
**Dosimetry: Dose reduction by 15% at distal air-tissue interface, 8% at 1 mm, and 5% at 2 mm. Coverage of posterior prostate wall comparable
**Clinical: Late GI toxicity G1 10%, G2 7%, and G3 2%, no G4. DVH analysis average V70 13%, all &lt;25%
**Conclusion: Rectal balloon reduced anterior, posterior, and lateral rectal wall sparing. Late rectal toxicity low

***Outcome: Endoscopic mucosal damage control 36% vs. HA injection 5% (SS), rectal bleeding 12% vs 0% (SS)
***Conclusion: Increased distance resulted in smaller rectal dose, less mucosal damage, and no rectal bleeding
**'''2007''' PMID 17707267 -- &quot;Transperineal injection of hyaluronic acid in anterior perirectal fat to decrease rectal toxicity from radiation delivered with intensity modulated brachytherapy or EBRT for prostate cancer patients.&quot; (Prada PJ, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Sep 1;69(1):95-102.)
***Retrospective. 27 patients treated with IMRT + HDR boost. Transrectal hyaluronic acid injection to perirectal fat under U/S guidance to create 1.5 cm space between rectal wall and prostate. Urethral and rectal TLDs placed during HDR
***Outcome: No toxicity from HA injection, no change or migration at 1 year. Mean distance between rectum and prostate 2.0cm along entire length of prostate. Median rectal TLD dose decreased from 47% of urethral dose to 39% (SS), and from 7.1 Gy to 5.1 Gy during 11.5 Gy HDR boost
***Conclusion: Increased rectum-prostate distance significantly decreased rectal dose during HDR brachytherapy

This Wikibook is dedicated to the teaching of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_language Punjabi], a language of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_languages Indo-Aryan] group of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Iranian_languages Indo-Iranian] branch of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages Indo-European] family of languages. Punjabi is spoken by natives of Punjab in India, where it is written in [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi|Gurmukhi]] script, and of Punjab in Pakistan, where [[Punjabi/Shahmukhi|Shahmukhi]], an adapted derivative of Arabic script is used. With the spread of Punjabi diaspora far and wide it is now the fourth most spoken language in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England England] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales Wales] and third most spoken in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada Canada]. It is spoken internationally by an estimated 100 to 125 million people and is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers tenth natively most spoken language] in the world.

== Help Improve this book. ==
This Wikibook has been created to help readers learn Punjabi. Readers are requested to suggest improvements and submit materials for early completion of the book and making the book useful to the reader. Thanks in anticipation

== Pronunciation of Punjabi words ==

This book is meant for non-native learner of Punjabi language. I have tried to give romanised (i.e. in roman letters) pronunciation of Punjabi words. The advantage of such an approach, I thought would be ease of the reader and his guaranteed familiarity with the system. But I have not been able to acheive any amount of consistency for obvious reasons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have been weighing various other options. One such option is to straight away adopt IPA. The other option is to fix the use of various roman letters for both Punjabi vowels and consonants and then retain the romanised pronunciation. I invite one and all to guide me in this behalf.

jaspal 14:04, 7 May 2008 (UTC)

:Gurmukhi is a near phonetic script. If someone has to learn IPA, it will probably be a lot of effort. Will it not be easier to learn Gurmukhi straight away start using it for pronunciation as well? Jaspal Singh 17:24, 16 August 2008 (UTC)

:: I think you should use romanisation, but in the script tutorial you should additionally give IPA for those who are familiar with it, so that they get a better idea of how to pronounce things. And sound files would be really great, if you know a Punjab with a microphone. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) 20:19, 16 August 2008 (UTC)

== Teaching Punjabi and teaching the script ==

Good job, this page is quite comprehensive! I am wondering though if you'd like to go a step further. For example, your description of the Gurmukhi script is probably better than what could be found in textbooks usually: you divide the letters into groups and even give exercises for practise. However, I found that the easiest way to learn a foreign script, a method that can reliably teach any alphabet within 2-4 hours and without any tedious repetition, is to introduce only one letter at a time whenever possible and to provide exercises in the shape of recognizable words. See for example the approach used in the Greek and Korean Wikibooks. I can assist you in developing similar lessons for the Gurmukhi script if you like.

As for teaching the language, it would be really useful to have full-fledged lessons, so that students get exposure to the language, the words and grammar in context and in manageable bites. If you are not sure how to go about this, I'd be glad to give you some pointers and assist you in developing a lesson plan. I am a professional lesson developer for [http://www.GermanPod101.com GermanPod101.com] and I've also created lessons and lesson plans for various other projects, including several Wikibooks.

Best wishes,

Judith - [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) 15:51, 9 June 2008 (UTC)
Dear Jaspal,

Its great work. However, the usage of the letters 'chhuchha' depicting 'chauffer' and 'phupha' depicting 'phone' are not correct. 'chhuchha' is used as in 'chhaan' i.e shade, where for chauffer the letter used should be 'susse pair bindi'. Similarly the 'ph' in phone is more softer and pronounced with open lips, where as 'phupha' in Punjabi is pronounced with the pursed lips.

:Thanks whoever wrote this comment. I will make the correction shortly. But just in case somebody can suggest English words for illustrating these sounds that will be great. In anticipation.....

:Jaspal Singh 18:37, 27 August 2008 (UTC)

::Can ਛੈਵਰਲੇ (Chevrolet) be appropriate example of 'chhuchha' sound. In the present scheme of things ਵ, ਰ and ਲ are not introduced till lesson 5. But that will be a minor irritant if an english speaker learning Pinjabi can be helped understand this sound appropriately. Waiting for comments and advice. Jaspal Singh 05:48, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

== Teaching Punjabi and teaching the script ==

Please accept my apologies for being late in reponding. I greatly value your suggestions and the offer of help. I also agree to your suggestion for introducing script letter by letter. I must also share my plan of dividing the book  into three different parts containing script, the common situational talk and the grammar in that order. This however will take some time as I devote only my free time to this voluntry effort. You are welcome to make suggestions or may also edit directly into the book. 

I request you to edit the Author section at the end of the book to incorporate your self as a coauthor.

I greatly value your offer and look forward to work with you. 

Regards.

Jaspal Singh 18:11, 16 July 2008 (UTC)

: Awesome! I created [[Punjabi/Writing lessons plan]] so we can coordinate planning for the script lessons. Please add any words you can think of there. I'll let you know when I have an idea for a general lesson plan (situational talk with grammar and vocabulary explanations, teaching the language one step at a time). Thanks so much for your good work! [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) 20:57, 19 July 2008 (UTC)

: Very good job on the re-write! You found a lot of helpful English words. I'm particularly impressed with &quot;khaki&quot; and &quot;Kazakh&quot; - finding words for the /kh/ sound is hard in any language. I tried the lessons and it's already much easier to study the letters now. What would help now: 
* diagrams of how to draw the letters 
* sound files to illustrate the pronunciation
Also, if you explained the vowels before the first lesson or before the second lesson, the lessons would be much easier, because students could spend all that time recognizing and thereby practicing the vowel sounds in every single word you present afterwards. &lt;br&gt;
If you come across a recognizable word that only contains letters that have been presented before, it's very useful to let the student guess the word - don't just tell him what it means. If the student has to actively think and decipher words himself, the letters will stick so much better; plus it's a success for him. This is the reason I recommended teaching letters in an order other than the traditional rows, because then you can always have the student guess the words. For example, start by teaching A and give &quot;ah!&quot; as an example. Then, teach N and let the student guess &quot;Anna&quot; (don't just say it's the name Anna, let him read for himself). Then, teach M and let the student guess &quot;mama&quot; and &quot;Annam&quot; and &quot;Manama&quot;... it's kind of like that game where you have a word, add one letter and make a new word, add another letter and make another word, and so on. This is certainly a big advantage when learning a new script. However, I also see that the rows allow for better comparison of similar sounds like kh and gh and ghh and the like, so it's not all bad. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) 19:28, 12 August 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks! Your words of appreciation have been inspiration and the good advice a source of strength. 
:I have moved on to vocabulary module and written some lessons there. Once I am through or substantially through with that I will for sure come back to the script so that I can make use of your technique which I am impressed with. I am also thinking in terms of relegating the grammar module to an Appendix status like I found in the [[Chinese (Mandarin)]] wikibook so that I can create some reading (practice) lessons at a more prominent position. Regards. Jaspal Singh 18:21, 14 August 2008 (UTC)

== Shahmukhi ==

As I understand, Punjabi is written in two scripts: Gurmukhi (Punjab, India), and Shahmukhi (Punjab, Pakistan).  
Maybe we could add the Shahmukhi or, if Pakistani Punjabi's vocabulary is too different than Indian Punjabi (because of probable increased Arabic/Persian word borrowings), you can specify that you are teaching Indian Punjabi. Just a suggestion.  
[[User:YoshiroShin|YoshiroShin]] ([[User talk:YoshiroShin|talk]]) 03:27, 27 July 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks Yoshiro. I perfectly agree. I wish Shahmukhi could be added to this wikibook. However I will need some help from my friends from Pakistan to do that. I invite one and all to add Shahmukhi as a script in this wikibook. They can add words not likely to be found in vogue on Indian side of Punjab. 

:As of now I am rewritting the Gurmukhi script part of this wikibook as suggested by Junesun above and as soon as it is complete I will give a link to it from the main page of the book and I shall add comment suggested by you. Thanks again for interest in the book. 
:Jaspal Singh 17:07, 27 July 2008 (UTC)

Actually now that I think about it, I think it may be better to have two separate Wikibooks for Gurmukhi Punjabi and for Shahmukhi Punjabi because: 
:1. It will probably get extremely crowded in this Wikibook if we had both in one; 
:2. The vocabulary will be too different; and 
:3. Grammar may also be altered to be Persian-like which would make this pretty much a different language.  Take into account Hindi and Urdu: Urdu has plenty more Arabic/Persian loans, and sometimes utilizes Persian grammar (as seen in Qaumi Tarana [http://en.wikipedia.org/Qaumi_Tarana]).

:[[User:YoshiroShin|YoshiroShin]] ([[User talk:YoshiroShin|talk]]) 18:12, 27 July 2008 (UTC)



Yes, though I think Qaumi Tarana is not realy a Punjabi composition. In fact many people in India think that Punjabi spoken in Amritsar(in Punjab, India) is much more near Punjabi of Lahore(in Punjab, Pakistan) than Punjabi spoken in say Patiala. This is true also as same dialect of Punjabi namely Majhi is spoken in Amritsar and Lahore both being part of same Majha region of undivided India. I would therefore presume that as far as vocabulary is concerned there is not much difference between Punjabi spoken in Indian Punjab and Pakistan Punjab. But your other point seems valid that both scripts in one book may make it crowded. Regards, have a nice time. 

Jaspal Singh 15:07, 28 July 2008 (UTC)



:&quot;Yes, though I think Qaumi Tarana is not realy a Punjabi composition.&quot; I guess you were being sarcastic there, seeing as I never said that Qaumi Tarana was a Punjabi composition, because that would be funny...................................................

:'''But anyway,''' since you find one of my points valid, how 'bout you turn the page &quot;Punjabi&quot; into a page that links to &quot;Gurmukhi Punjabi&quot; and &quot;Shahmukhi Punjabi&quot;, and then move everything on this page over to &quot;Gurmukhi Punjabi&quot;?

:That way, both will be technically in the same book, and it will look really good to someone wanting to learn Punjabi.  All he has to do is type in &quot;Punjabi&quot; in the search area, and then he will immediately have a choice of which Punjabi he wants. 

:I think it's a good idea.

:[[User:YoshiroShin|YoshiroShin]] ([[User talk:YoshiroShin|talk]]) 00:53, 29 July 2008 (UTC)


My sincerest apologies if I have sounded sarcastic though I did not mean that. When I the wrote comment I thought you are suggesting that 'Shahmukhi Punjabi' is awfully different from 'Gurmukhi Punjabi'. By saying that Shahmukhi can be added to this wikibook what I realy mean is that Shahmukhi script can be provided as a separate part of this book. As I have emphasized earlier Pakistan Punjabi and Indian Punjabi are realy not two separate languages. Allow me to reiterate that vocabulary of language spoken on both sides of border is same though written in different scripts. Therefore it will be perfect to provide intructions on both scripts in one book, though in separate parts. But having said that the language spoken on both sides of the border is same, I wonder if it will be useful to have 'Gurmukhi Punjabi' and 'Shahmukhi Punjabi' separately. I have yet to convince myself about that. I was wondering if we can have a way out where by the same word or same rule of grammar etc. can be taught by giving both Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi versions of the word etc. Initially though it looks it will be too cumbersome. Just think about that.

Since you have taken the trouble and have shown interest in the book, I am giving here link 
to re-written [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi|Gurmukhi script]] part of the book, though it is still incomplete. Your comment shall be highly valued.

Jaspal Singh 14:28, 29 July 2008 (UTC)


:How about on the main page, you place links to different sections on the book (a little like what they have at the Sanskrit Wikibook [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sanskrit]), and at the beginning you can place a link to the &quot;learning Gurmukhi&quot; part and another to a &quot;learning Shahmukhi part&quot;, and under those you can place links dividing up your language lessons and within those, sentences and words can be supplied in both Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi at the same time, and the reader can choose which to read while going through the book. 
:Another example showing this is at the Mandarin Chinese Wikibook ([http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Mandarin]).  There, the author supplies Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters altogether in the same lessons and the reader can choose which he (or she) wants to follow.
:Taking into account your (definitely probably correct) claim that Pakistani and Indian Punjabi have basically the same vocabulary, I think this is a better idea than the one I previously suggested. 
:What do you think?
:Oh, and just to let you know, I don't know Punjabi, and I am actually studying Hindi, but I have an okay amount of knowledge of the Perso-Arabic script (for Urdu purposes) so I might be able to help out.  
:Therefore, I might try to add in some stuff once in a while, but the rest should be left to the Punjabi speakers (who know a lot more than I would about Punjabi).  I'm just making some formatting suggestions.  
:[[User:YoshiroShin|YoshiroShin]] ([[User talk:YoshiroShin|talk]]) 18:25, 29 July 2008 (UTC)


Wonderful idea Yoshiro. I will be doing that in due course, providing a stub for Shahmukhi. Meanwhile if you can let me know if you approve of the re-written [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi|Gurmukhi script]] I shall be able to recast the book.
Jaspal Singh 15:47, 30 July 2008 (UTC)


:I actually like the format of the re-written [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi|Gurmukhi script]] very much.  I think it's great.  
:[[User:YoshiroShin|YoshiroShin]] ([[User talk:YoshiroShin|talk]]) 18:46, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

Thanks for being with me and your word of appreciation. Hope to keep up dialog in future too. Will be back with stub for Shahmukhi. Have a nice time.

Jaspal Singh 16:49, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

== Recasting this Wikibook ==

Based on the suggestions made by Judith - [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) I have reworked the Gurmukhi script part of this wikibook introducing letters one by one and using example that are familiar to English knowing readers. [[User:YoshiroShin|YoshiroShin]] ([[User talk:YoshiroShin|talk]]) recommended that we should have Shahmukhi script as part of this book so that it is easier to serach. He himself is writing Shahmukhi lessons. I have recasted the other parts of the book. For better organization of the book the following format is being considered. 

*[[Punjabi/Introduction|Punjabi Language &amp; This wikibook]]
*[[Punjabi/Gurmukhi|Writing System : Gurmukhi]]
*[[Punjabi/Shahmukhi|Writing System : Shahmukhi]]
*[[Punjabi/Language|Language Lessons]]
*[[Punjabi/Vocabulary|Vocabulary]]
*[[Punjabi/Grammar|Grammar]]

Each of the above Sections/Parts of the book will have pages devoted to different lessons. Each page will contain links to all lessons contained in the Section/Part prominently displayed on it. Before actually recasting the book in the proposed format I seek suggestions to make the presentation of the book more meaningful. 

Jaspal Singh 01:39, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

== New Lesson ==

Hi, everybody. I have added one more module [[Punjabi/Vocabulary|Vocabulary]] to this book and created first lesson viz., [[Punjabi/Vocabulary/Numbers|Numbers]] to it. 

PS : Suggestions for improvement are welcome please.

Jaspal Singh 17:46, 12 August 2008 (UTC)


:Cool so far.  If I see anything that I could provide suggestions for improvement on, I'll let you know.

== Question ==
Does the [[Punjabi/Vocabulary/Relations]] article just contains some of the Relations, or does it need to include every relation because there are some missing. --[[User:Gman124|Gman124]] ([[User talk:Gman124|talk]]) 04:43, 5 February 2009 (UTC)
:The lists on vocabulary pages are not exaustive. But you may please add more items to them if you think some more will be useful for readers or let me know which ones you want so that I can do it. -- Jaspal Singh 15:16, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

=== Is the real diode a perfect component? ===

[[Image:Real_diode_single.jpg|left|thumb|210px|&lt;center&gt;A &quot;harmful&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; across a diode.&lt;/center&gt;]]

A forward voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; appears across a real diode when a current flows through it... What is this voltage drop - useful or harmful? Sometimes it is useful; other times it is harmful...

'''&quot;Useful&quot; examples.''' When we make voltage stabilizers, we need this voltage drop. In these cases we do all that is possible to create and increase this useful voltage drop appearing across various diode component: diodes, LEDs, zeners, multiple diodes connected in series...

'''&quot;Harmful&quot; examples.''' In other cases, when we use a diode as a switching element, we do all that is possible to remove and to remove this harmful voltage drop... Then we need an ideal diode without forvard voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Making the simplest parallel diode limiter ===

[[Image:Imp_diode_step1_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;The forward voltage drop VF across a real diode disturbs the input source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Why do we connect a reasistor R between the input voltage source and the diode (load)?

What does the combination (V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; + R) represent? What is it?

==== Making an almost ideal &quot;op-amp&quot; diode ====

===== An op-amp acting as a varying voltage source =====

What can act as a varying voltage source in our electronic circuit? What can &quot;help&quot; the imperfect diode by adding so much voltage as it loses across the diode? At last [[#Lab 3: &quot;Inventing&quot; a negative feedback BJT current source|Lab 3]] we were using transistors for such a purpose; let's now, for the sake of change, use an op-amp...

[[Image:Op-amp_ideal_diode_intro_step3_1000.jpg|left|thumb|780px|&lt;center&gt;An op-amp can &quot;help&quot; the imperfect diode by adding a voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; in series with the input voltage source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Now the op-amp has to &quot;insert&quot; the &quot;helping&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; into the circuit; so, how to connect it?

===== Finishing the op-amp circuit =====

Eureka! We have invented an (almost) ideal diode without (any) forvard voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;!

With the same success we can destroy the &quot;harmful&quot; voltage drop across a resistor. What a circuit can we &quot;invent&quot; in this way? Write its name here....

=== Making the harmful voltage drop act as an input ===

[[Image:Photoresistor_nfb_board_lora_1000.jpg|right|thumb|430px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating a photoresistor connected in the feedback loop (by [[User:Lkirilova|Lora Kirilova]]).&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Generalizing the powerful &quot;helping&quot; idea ===

[[Image:Ideal_diode_idea_whiteboard_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;A recipe: ''imperfect component + varying battery = perfect element''.&lt;/center&gt;]]

We are already true magicians as we can transform any imperfect component into an almost ideal one! In this lab, we have transmuted a real diode (ordinary, LED, zener, any combinations of them, etc.), a resistor and a photoresistor into... a piece of wire:) having no any voltage drop across it! But with the same success we can make a &quot;botomless&quot; capacitor (an op-amp inverting integrator)... For this purpose, we just incorporate a varying battery to the imperfect component that compensated the losses inside the component. All the op-amp inverting circuits exploit this clever trick.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

**Retrospective. 5,149 femarle CCCS 5-year survivors not surgically sterile and cohort of 1,441 randomly selected female siblings
**Outcome: RR for ever being pregnant 0.81 (SS)
**Negative predictors: hypothalamic/pituitary RT dose &gt;=30 Gy (RR 0.61), ovarian/uterine RT dose &gt;5 Gy (RR 0.56) or RT dose &gt;10 Gy (RR 0.18), treatment with lomustine or cyclophosphamide, or summed alkylating agent dose (AAD) 3-4
**Conclusion: Fertility decreased among female pediatric cancer survivors

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== tan ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
double tan( double arg );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The tan() function returns the tangent of ''arg'', where ''arg'' is given in radians. If ''arg'' is infinite, tan() will return NAN and raise a floating-point exception.

      <text xml:space="preserve">At 46°C a sample of ammonia gas exerts a pressure of 5.3 atm. 
What is the pressure when the volume of the gas is reduced to 
one-tenth (0.10) of the original value at the same temperature? 


Sol:
T=46+273 =319K
P1=5.3atm
V1=V
v2=0.10V 
P2=?

P1V1=P2V2

P2=P1V1/V2

P2=5.3*V/0.10V

P2=53L

ANSWER IS 53L

      <text xml:space="preserve">Does this actually work? I was skeptical but decided to try it with a Windows 95 laptop and Ubuntu server. I got to the &quot;Set them both up to use your modems&quot; step, which doesn't to work, but for HyperTerminal (or any telecom communications program) to use your modem, it has to have a dial tone... Maybe I'm missing something... --[[User talk:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 18:26, 27 April 2008 (UTC)

...you can set the modem to ignore no dial tone

== Something Wrong? ==

I got the right sound coming from the modem but they didn't seem to talk to each other. They timed out with &quot;NO CARRIER&quot; message.

== Confirmed ==

It works! With Windows Vista to Windows '98, two 56k dial-up PC card and PCI card modems. But the rate had to be set really low, 40 bytes per second, though it will probably work much better repeatedly tried and reconfigured. [[User:Clark89|Clark89]] ([[User talk:Clark89|talk]]) 05:16, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

== Crossed or straight cable ==

What type should be the cable? I've read that most &quot;wall socket &lt;-&gt; phone&quot; cables are crossed. Or maybe it doesn't matter? I've tried crossed cable to directly connect modems but it haven't worked. --[[User:Piomar|Piomar]] ([[User talk:Piomar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Piomar|contribs]]) 22:48, 31 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

This creates a healthy, inexpensive and easy stew with depths of flavor. This recipe is fairly low on the heat scale, but feel free to add more cayenne pepper to up its spiciness.
==Ingredients==
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Lentil|red split lentils]]
* 4 cups Water
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
* Tablespoon margarine
* Tablespoon olive oil
* 2 large potatoes, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
* Teaspoon [[Cookbook:turmeric|turmeric]]
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]]
* 28 ounces can diced tomatoes
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:garam masala|garam masala]]
* 1 teaspoon honey or sugar
==Procedure==
# In a large pot, combine and cook water, lentils, salt and bay leaf. Remove bay leaf.
# In a large frying pan, combine cubed potatoes, turmeric, cayenne pepper and olive oil and fry for 5-10 minutes. 
# Add to the pot with the lentils, and then combine all ingredients and cook until the potatoes are soft and tender. Excellent served with chapatis or rice.</text>

Example:
One of the most useful USR functions is USR _fileAddr. You can use the LOCAL FN shown here to display information about an open file. LOCAL FN DisplayFileInfo(fileID)

=== Function === 
 
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===
Move all waiting items to arrays or simple variables

&lt;i&gt;action&lt;/i&gt; = &amp;not;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;FINDERINFO&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;countVar%, nameVar$, typeVar&amp;amp;, dirRefNumVar&lt;/i&gt;%)&lt;/code&gt;

Find out how many items are waiting to be picked up

&lt;code&gt;countVar = 0&lt;br&gt;

=== Description ===
If the user launched your application by double-clicking a document icon, or by dragging document icon(s) to your application's icon, or by selecting document icon(s) and then selecting &amp;quot;Open&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Print&amp;quot; from the Finder's &amp;quot;File&amp;quot; menu, then you can use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FINDERINFO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function to determine which document file(s) were involved, and whether they should be opened or printed.

You should call &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FINDERINFO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; once, soon after your program starts. You should also check during null events to see if additional files have been added to the list. This can take place when an &lt;code&gt;_openDoc&lt;/code&gt; event is sent from another application or when the user drags a file onto the icon of your running application.

• &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;action&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - The result of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FINDERINFO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function is one of the following:

• &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;countVar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - This variable is used to send a value to and receive a result from &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FINDERINFO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

The parameters for &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FINDERINFO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are used to both send and receive values. In order to send a value of &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; for the count, you must first set the variable, then check it on return.

&lt;code&gt;count% = 0&lt;br&gt;
action = &lt;b&gt;FINDERINFO&lt;/b&gt;(count%,fName$,fType&amp;amp;,vRefNum%)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;There are&amp;quot; count%&amp;quot; files in the queue.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Before your application can support Finder-launched documents, you need to set up certain special resources (&lt;code&gt;BNDL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FREF&lt;/code&gt;) in your application's resource fork. Also, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FINDERINFO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will not work unless the &amp;quot;High-level event aware&amp;quot; flag is turned on in your application's &lt;code&gt;SIZE&lt;/code&gt; resource #-1. See the &quot;Finder Interface&quot; chapter in Macintosh Toolbox Essentials for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== log ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
double log( double num );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function log() returns the natural (base e) logarithm of ''num''. There's a domain error if ''num'' is negative, a range error if ''num'' is zero.

In order to calculate the logarithm of x to an arbitrary base b, you can use:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
double answer = log(x) / log(b);
&lt;/source&gt;

					&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;folderRefNum%&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;FOLDER&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;path$, refNum%&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br&gt;

=== Revised ===
June 14, 2000 (Release 3)
=== Description ===
Depending on the parameters used, this function does several things with folders (directories). It can:&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Return a reference number for the current default directory.
					&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Return a reference number for a directory that you specify.
					&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Change the current default directory.
					&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Create a new folder.
					&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Return the parent volume
				&lt;/ul&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOLDER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns a reference number, it will either be a volume reference number (if the directory is a root directory), or a working directory reference number (if the directory is not a root directory). You can use this reference number to identify the directory when you use other FB statements such as &lt;code&gt;OPEN&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;This table summarizes the effects of the various parameter combinations. Note that when you use a nonzero number in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNum%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, you can specify either a working directory reference number, a volume reference number, or a drive ID number. When you specify a volume reference number or a drive ID number, it represents the root directory on the specified volume.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
							&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;non-zero reference number&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;Same number as &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNum%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;/tr&gt;
					&lt;tr&gt;
						&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;Create a directory relative to &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNum%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
							&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;partial path&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
							&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;non-zero reference number&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;If the path and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNum%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; refer to an existing folder, its reference number&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;/tr&gt;
					&lt;tr&gt;
						&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;Create an arbitrary directory&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
							&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;full path&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
							&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;any non-zero number&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;If the path is invalid or path and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;refNum%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; refer to an existing file, zero&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;/tr&gt;
				&lt;/table&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					The reference number returned in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;folderRefNum%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a temporary number, which is only valid until your program quits. You cannot use this same number to refer to this folder at a later date. If you need to keep track of a file's location over time, create an alias record for the file.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= ENTERPROC statement =
 
== ENTERPROC == 
 
=== Statement === 
 
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===
Syntax 1:

&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;statementLabel&amp;quot; &lt;b&gt;ENTERPROC&lt;/b&gt; [(&lt;i&gt;intVar1&lt;/i&gt; [,&lt;i&gt;intVar2&lt;/i&gt; ...])] [statementBlock] &lt;b&gt;EXITPROC&lt;/b&gt; [= &lt;i&gt;intVar3&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;

Syntax 2:

&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;statementLabel&amp;quot; &lt;b&gt;ENTERPROC FN&lt;/b&gt; fnName[(&lt;i&gt;intVar1&lt;/i&gt; [,&lt;i&gt;intVar2&lt;/i&gt; ...])] [= &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;] [statementBlock] &lt;b&gt;EXITPROC&lt;/b&gt; [= &lt;i&gt;returnValue&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ENTERPROC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement marks the beginning of a procedure block, which must end with an &lt;code&gt;EXITPROC&lt;/code&gt; statement. A procedure block is used to implement a function that uses the Pascal calling convention, which is a certain way that the function manipulates the stack. The most common use for this kind of function is to implement Toolbox &amp;quot;callback&amp;quot; procedures (often called &amp;quot;application-defined routines&amp;quot; in Inside Macintosh). Such callback procedures must use the Pascal calling convention.

An &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ENTERPROC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; procedure block can only appear within the &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; scope of the program; not within a &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt;. Each of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'s must be either a short (2-byte) integer variable or a long (4-byte) integer variable, or a &lt;code&gt;POINTER&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;HANDLE&lt;/code&gt; variable. The &lt;code&gt;statementBlock&lt;/code&gt; can contain any collection of FB statements except another &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ENTERPROC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;EXITPROC&lt;/code&gt; block (i.e., procedure blocks cannot be nested). The scope of all the variables referenced in the procedure block is either global (if the variable was declared earlier in a &lt;code&gt;BEGIN GLOBALS&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;END GLOBALS&lt;/code&gt; block) or local to the procedure block itself.

A procedure block is called when some caller (typically a Toolbox routine) refers to the procedure's address in memory; your program can use the &lt;code&gt;PROC&amp;quot;statementLabel&amp;quot; &lt;/code&gt;function to get that address. Typically, your program would pass that address to the Toolbox routine, to identify the procedure block as a &amp;quot;callback&amp;quot; procedure. When the procedure block is called, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc. are assigned values which are passed by the caller. When the &lt;code&gt;EXITPROC&lt;/code&gt; statement is reached, control is returned back to the caller, and if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;returnValue&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) was specified, its value is returned to the caller.

It's important that you know the number and types of parameters (if any) that the caller expects to pass to your procedure block, and that you set up the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar2&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;(etc.) parameters in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ENTERPROC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement accordingly. Likewise, you should know whether the caller expects your procedure block to return a value and, if so, whether the caller expects a 2-byte or a 4-byte value. If you use Syntax 1, you should specify a variable of the appropriate size in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; if the caller expects a return value; otherwise you should omit &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intVar3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If you use Syntax 2, you should specify the name of a 2-byte or 4-byte type (such as &lt;code&gt;INT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;POINTER&lt;/code&gt;) in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter, and specify a &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;returnValue&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; expression of that type, if the caller expects a return value; otherwise, you should omit the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;returnValue&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If you do not set up the input parameters and the return parameters correctly in your &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;ENTERPROC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;EXITPROC &lt;/code&gt;statements, then your program is likely to crash when the procedure block is called. See &lt;a href=&quot;app.%20c%20data%20types.html&quot;&gt;Appendix C&lt;/a&gt;: Data Types and Data Representation, for a list of valid 2-byte and 4-byte variable types.

If you use Syntax 2, you can also execute a procedure block by using the &lt;code&gt;FN &amp;lt;userFunction&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement, although there is generally little reason to do this (it's usually better to use a &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt; when you want to create a procedure that will be explicitly called by your program).

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When your program starts up, it will not automatically &amp;quot;skip over&amp;quot; the lines in a procedure block, the way it skips over the lines in a &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt;. In order to prevent your procedure block from being executed inadvertently, you should either branch around the procedure block using &lt;code&gt;GOTO&lt;/code&gt;, like this:

&lt;code&gt;GOTO &amp;quot;Detour&amp;quot; &amp;quot;myProc1&amp;quot; ENTERPROC(var&amp;amp;) : EXITPROC &amp;quot;myProc2&amp;quot; ENTERPROC(var1%, var2&amp;amp;) : EXITPROC = result&amp;amp; &amp;quot;Detour&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;

or you should place the procedure block after an &lt;code&gt;END&lt;/code&gt; statement, like this:

&lt;code&gt;'[main part of program here] END '======= Procedures ======= &amp;quot;myProc1&amp;quot; ENTERPROC(var&amp;amp;) : EXITPROC &amp;quot;myProc2&amp;quot; ENTERPROC(var1%, var2&amp;amp;) : EXITPROC = result&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;January 2, 2001 (Release 4)

=== Description ===
This statement causes the program to jump to the statement following the indicated label. Unlike the &lt;code&gt;GOTO&lt;/code&gt; statement, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXIT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement makes sure that any loops, &lt;code&gt;LONG IF&lt;/code&gt; blocks, &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt;'s, etc., that are being &amp;quot;jumped out&amp;quot; of get properly closed, so that the stack will be in a consistent state.

If an &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXIT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Label&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; is in the main program, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Label&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; must be inside the main. If an &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXIT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Label&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; is in a &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Label&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; must be inside the same &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt;. If an &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXIT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Label&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; is nested inside one or more &lt;code&gt;SELECT [CASE]&lt;/code&gt; statements, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Label&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; must be after the last &lt;code&gt;END SELECT&lt;/code&gt;.

Any exceptions to the above conditions could result in substantial penalties or crashes.

=== Description ===
When used inside a &lt;code&gt;FOR/NEXT&lt;/code&gt; loop, &lt;code&gt;WHILE/WEND&lt;/code&gt; conditional, &lt;code&gt;DO/UNTIL&lt;/code&gt; conditional, or in a &lt;code&gt;SELECT CASE&lt;/code&gt; structure, this statement causes the program to jump immediately to the line following the &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WEND&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UNTIL&lt;/code&gt;, or&lt;code&gt; END SELECT&lt;/code&gt; statement. This is useful when, you wish to break out of a loop because a certain condition has been met. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXIT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a safe way to do it.

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOR&lt;/b&gt; x = 1 &lt;b&gt;TO&lt;/b&gt; 10&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;IF FN BUTTON THEN EXIT FOR&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;NEXT&lt;/b&gt; x&lt;/code&gt;

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
double pow( double base, double exp );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The pow() function returns ''base'' raised to the ''exp''th power. There's a domain error if base is zero and ''exp'' is less than or equal to zero. There's also a domain error if base is negative and ''exp'' is not an integer. There's a range error if an overflow occurs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''There is no broken template...'''

It seems someone had inserted a category halfway up the article, and I confused it for a template.  I have now moved it to the bottom of the document.  The specified sub-category does not currently show, as there is not yet a marketing category.

'''Why is a Strategic Marketing Plan needed?'''

Since its inception, the Marketing Project has seen an amazing amount of creativity, discussion, and actual achievement. However, there have been frequent complaints that there has been no overall framework or context for this activity. This means it's not easy for newcomers to see where they can find a niche and make a contribution. There's also a danger that the same debates are repeated, rather than reaching an agreed position and being able to develop ideas in depth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== sqrt ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
double sqrt( double num );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The sqrt() function returns the square root of ''num''. If ''num'' is negative, a domain error occurs.

=== Statement === 
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXIT FN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
When used inside a &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt; function, this statement causes the program to jump immediately to the &lt;code&gt;END FN&lt;/code&gt; statement. The function then exits, passing back the value (if any) specified in the &lt;code&gt;END FN&lt;/code&gt; statement. This is useful when, for example, you wish to break out of a loop and quit the function immediately; &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXIT FN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a safer way to do this than using something like &lt;code&gt;GOTO&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You should not use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXIT FN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement outside of a &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt; function.

REM

(')

(//)

&quot;/*&quot;

&quot;*/&quot; 


=== Description === 

The REM statement (and its variations) provide a way for you to insert remarks into the source code which are ignored by the compiler. Remarks have absolutely no effect on how your program runs, but they can be very useful in helping readers to understand how your code works. If you use the REM keyword, or the apostrophe (') or double-slash (//) token, everything following it on the same line is treated as a remark; therefore, it's not possible to put a non-remark statement after remarks on the same line. The apostrophe and double-slash variations work identically to each other. In the FB Editor, remarks that begin with the apostrophe, the double-slash, or the &quot;/*&quot; token are automatically tabbed to the Remarks column of the Editor window if they're preceded by a statement. Remarks that begin with REM are not tabbed. When you use the &quot;/*&quot; and &quot;*/&quot; tokens, the &quot;/*&quot; indicates the beginning of the remarks, and the &quot;*/&quot; indicates the end of remarks. Because it uses two tokens, this variation allows you to do some things you can't do with other variations. Specifically: You can write remarks that span multiple lines, using only one pair of tokens. 

For example: /* This is the first line of remarks. 
The remarks continue on this line.
This is the last line of remarks. */ One disadvantage of using the &quot;/*&quot; and &quot;*/&quot; tokens is that you have to make sure you don't inadvertently include a &quot;*/&quot; token in the middle of your remarks. If you do, the compiler will assume that the remarks end there. For example: /* This is the first line of remarks.
We have /*accidentally*/ put a remark-closing token in the middle of the remarks. When the compiler encounters this, it interprets the &quot;*/&quot; token following &quot;accidentally&quot; as the end of the remarks, and it attempts to compile the remainder of that line and the following line, leading to compile errors. 

Note: You cannot put remarks after a DATA statement on the same line. Everything following the DATA keyword on the same line is considered part of the DATA statement.

RENAME 

=== Description === 

Changes the name of a file or folder from the name specified in oldPath$ to the name specified in newPath$. The oldPath$ and newPath$ parameters are used along with refNum% and dirID&amp; to determine the location of the item to be renamed: see Appendix A: Specifying Files and Directories, for more information. You cannot use RENAME to move an item into a different directory: oldPath$ and newPath$ must both refer to items in the same directory.

RESOURCES 

=== Revised === 

May 30, 2000 (Release 3) 

=== Description === 

This is a non-executable statement that performs two main functions:
It specifies your program's file type and creator;
It identifies an existing file (pathname) containing resources that should be copied into the resource fork of your application file or code resource file, when FB builds your file.
The RESOURCES statement is optional. If you don't include it in your program, FB builds an application file of type &quot;APPL&quot;, with creator signature &quot;xxxx&quot;, containing a standard set of resources. Resources may also be added by dragging a resource file into the project manager window. You can include multiple RESOURCES statements in your program. FB uses the first encountered RESOURCES statement to determine the file type and creator. The pathname parameter can be a full or partial pathname which specifies a file that contains resources; or which specifies an alias to such a file. If you use a partial pathname (for example, a simple file name), the path is assumed to be relative to your project folder. When FB builds your application file, it copies all the resources from the pathname file into the resource fork of the file that it builds. Note that if you don't specify the pathname parameter, you still must specify an (empty) pair of double-quotes. Using multiple RESOURCES statements
It's sometimes convenient to have FB copy the resources from several different resource files. You can accomplish this by including multiple RESOURCES statements in your program, each specifying a different pathname parameter. If your program includes multiple RESOURCES statements, the second and all subsequent RESOURCES statements should not specify any parameter other than pathname. If your program includes multiple RESOURCES statements, there is the possibility of a &quot;collision&quot; between resources. This happens when a resource in one pathname file has the same type and same ID number as a resource in another pathname file. When this happens, the resource that was encountered later replaces the resource that was encountered earlier, when FB builds your file. You should keep this in mind when deciding in what order to place your RESOURCES statements. New feature in Release 3: If your resource has an ID of 32512-32767, the compiler will renumber it when it sees the conflict. That way, you can refer to it by name and pick it up with GETNAMEDRESOURCE. This is important for those that want to distribute source code with required resources. 


Example: You have two resource files in your project. 

myRes1.rsrc myRes2.rsrc myRes1.rsrc contains:
_&quot;PICT&quot; ID 501   Name &quot;One&quot;
_&quot;PICT&quot; ID 502   Name &quot;Two&quot;
_&quot;PICT&quot; ID 32512Name &quot;Fred&quot; 
myRes2.rsrc contains:
_&quot;PICT&quot; ID 501   Name &quot;OneOne&quot;
_&quot;PICT&quot; ID 502   Name &quot;TwoTwo&quot;
_&quot;PICT&quot; ID 32512Name &quot;Barney&quot; 
Your final application will contain:
_&quot;PICT&quot; ID 501   Name &quot;OneOne&quot;&lt;- Note that OneOne replaced One
_&quot;PICT&quot; ID 502   Name &quot;TwoTwo&quot;&lt;- Note that TwoTwo replaced Two
_&quot;PICT&quot; ID 32512Name &quot;Fred&quot;   &lt;- First version of 32512 saved
_&quot;PICT&quot; ID 32513Name &quot;Barney&quot;&lt;- Second version of 32512 renumbered Some useful resources


When building an application, FB automatically includes a standard set of resources that applications require. You can enhance your application by also including resources like the following (all of which can be created using ResEdit):

-VERS- 
&quot;vers&quot; resources with ID's 1 and 2 contain version information which is visible in Finder windows and in the &quot;Get Info&quot; window. See the &quot;Finder Interface&quot; chapter of Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials, for more information.

-SIZE-
&quot;SIZE&quot; resources with ID's -1, 0 and 1 contain important information about your application's memory size, what kinds of events it can respond to, and more. FB always includes a &quot;SIZE&quot; resource whenever it builds an application, but you may want to override the features in the default &quot;SIZE&quot; resource by providing one of your own. See the &quot;Event Manager&quot; chapter of Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials, for more information.

-BNDL, FREF, ICN#-
Use these resources to assign special icons to your application and to the documents that your application creates. These resources also determine what kinds of documents can be dragged to you application's icon in the Finder. See the &quot;Finder Interface&quot; chapter of Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials, for more information.

RESTORE 

=== Description === 

This statement is used in conjunction with the DATA and READ statements. It resets an internal pointer which tells FB where to find the next DATA item to read. This allows your program to READ the same DATA item(s) more than once if necessary. If you omit the expr parameter, the DATA pointer is reset to point to the first item in the first DATA statement. If you specify expr, the DATA pointer is reset to point to the item immediately following the expr-th item. Thus RESTORE 1 points to the second item; RESTORE 2 points to the third item; and so on. 

Example:
DATA Able, Baker
DATA Kane, Dread
DATA Echo
FOR i = 1 to 5
   READ x$
   PRINT x$,
NEXT
PRINT
RESTORE 3
READ x$, y$
PRINT x$, y$ program output:
AbleBaker   KaneDreaEcho
Dread Echo

RETURN 

=== Revised === 

October 2, 2000 (Release 4) 

=== Description === 

You should include at least one RETURN statement in every subroutine that is called by a GOSUB statement. RETURN causes the subroutine to &quot;exit&quot;; that is, it causes execution to continue at the statement following the GOSUB that called the subroutine. You may also return to a specific location using RETURN &quot;label&quot;. This pops the return address from the stack, then jumps to the requested address.

subString$

RIGHT$(string$,numChars)

subContainer$$ 

RIGHT$$(container$$,numChars) 

=== Revised === 

May 30, 2000 (Release 3) 

=== Description === 

This function returns a string or container consisting of the rightmost numChars characters of string$ or container$$. If numChars is greater than the length of string$ or container$$, the entire string$ or container$$ is returned. If numChars is less than 1, an empty (zero-length) string is returned. 

Note: You may not use complex expressions that include containers on the right side of the equal sign. Instead of using: c$$ = c$$ + RIGHT$$(a$$,10) Use: c$$ += RIGHT$$(a$$,10) 

Example:
PRINT RIGHT$ (&quot;Nebraska&quot;, 3) program output: ska

randomInteger%

RND(expr%) 

=== Description === 

This function returns a pseudo-random long integer uniformly distributed in the range 1 through expr&amp;. The expr&amp; parameter should be greater than 1, and must not exceed 65536. If the value returned is to be assigned to a 16-bit integer (randomInteger%), expr&amp; should not exceed 32767. The actual sequence of numbers returned by RND depends on the random number generator's &quot;seed&quot; value; see the RANDOM statement for more information. Note that RND(1) always returns the value 1. 

Example:
To get a random integer between two arbitrary limits min and max, use this statement: randomInteger = RND(max - min + 1) + min - 1 (Note: max - min must be less than or equal to 65536.) To get a random fraction, greater than or equal to zero and less than 1, use this statement: frac! = (RND(65536)-1)/65536.0 To get a random long integer in the range 1 through 2,147,483,647, use this statement: randomInteger&amp; = ((RND(65536) - 1)&lt;&lt;15) + RND(32767)

=== Description === 

This statement launches the application specified by path$, refNum% and dirID&amp;, and puts it into the foreground, making it the active process. The program that launched the application does not quit, but is put into the background.

RUNTIME 

END RUNTIME 

=== Description === 

The FB compiler has been created in such a way that it expects and calls upon specific functions located in the header folder. As an example, the statement WINDOW CLOSE wNum is routed to a runtime function named RUNTIME FBWindowClose(wNum&amp;). A RUNTIME function behaves much like a local function, but the &quot;RUNTIME&quot; name indicates to FB that the function is part of the language. You may not add new syntax to FB by creating new RUNTIME functions. Only the compiler can make these calls. But you can modify these pieces of code as you would any source code. When all of the necessary headers have been compiled and FB is ready to begin examining your source code, the END RUNTIME statement tells FB that it no longer needs to track and record RUNTIME functions. 


As you examine the RUNTIME functions, you may notice that only long integer parameters are used. This serves three purposes:

Long integers can be passed faster than any other type of parameter
RUNTIME functions know in advance what type of parameter is expected. For instance, a RUNTIME function might expect a string pointer, but never a string.
The use of long integers insures that variables will fall on long integer boundaries which greatly speeds the execution of PPC code.

To re-route text and graphics:

ROUTE [#]_toPrinter

ROUTE [#]_toScreen

ROUTE [#]_toBuffer [+ 0... 4 ] 

To re-route text:

ROUTE [#]serialPort

ROUTE [#]fileID 

=== Revised === 

May, 2001 (Release 5) 

=== Description === 

This statement causes text printed by subsequent PRINT statements to be sent to the indicated device. If you specify _toScreen or _toPrinter, subsequent drawing commands are also sent to the indicated device. If you specify _toBuffer, only text printing commands are sent to the indicated device. 


&lt;u&gt;Using ROUTE_toPrinter:&lt;/u&gt;
 ROUTE _toPrinter opens a new print job unless a print job is already open. When you first open a new print job, the printer adopts the font and graphics characteristics that are in effect in the current screen window. Subsequent PRINT statements, as well as graphics commands such as BOX, CIRCLE and PLOT, are sent to the printer. Subsequent statements which affect the appearance of text and graphics, such as TEXT, PEN and COLOR, apply to the printed output. Subsequent QuickDraw Toolbox commands such as FRAMERECT apply to the printed output. 

Note: To actually put out the current printer page, use the CLEAR LPRINT statement after sending text and drawing commands to the printer. 


&lt;u&gt;Using ROUTE_toScreen:&lt;/u&gt;
 After using ROUTE to direct output to the printer, or to a serial device or a file, you can use ROUTE _toScreen to re-direct output back to the screen window again. 

Note: Statements which affect the appearance of text and graphics, such as TEXT, PEN and COLOR, apply separately to the screen window and to the printer. The settings in one device don't affect the settings in the other, except when you first open a new print job. 


&lt;u&gt;Using ROUTE serialPort and ROUTE fileID:&lt;/u&gt;
 These statements cause text printed by subsequent PRINT statements to be sent to the specified open device. They don't affect the destination of graphics commands. This group of statements: 
ROUTE deviceID 
PRINT itemList1 
PRINT itemList2:
PRINT itemListN

ROUTE _toScreen has the same effect as this group of statements: PRINT #deviceID, itemList1

PRINT #deviceID, itemList2:
PRINT #deviceID, itemListN 


&lt;u&gt;Using ROUTE_toBuffer:&lt;u&gt;
 You can use the FB ROUTE _toBuffer statement to print information directly to a handle. You may use any one of five handles by setting the route statement in the range of _toBuffer through _toBuffer + 4. When routed to a buffer, only text commands are sent to the handle. Graphic commands are ignored. Information printed to a buffer ends up in one of five handles stored as globals in the FB runtime. This array is named gFBbuffer(n) where n is a numeric expression in the range of 0...4. The following example prints text to buffer number 2. 

ROUTE _toBuffer + 2,
PRINT &quot;Hello&quot;
PRINT &quot;Goodbye&quot;
ROUTE _toScreen 

When this snippet has been executed, gFBbuffer(2) will contain a handle that points to a moveable block of 14 bytes: Hello&lt;CR&gt;Goodbye&lt;CR&gt; Note that carriage returns are added or suppressed in writing to a buffer just as they would be in writing to a file or to the screen. If you want to dispose of a buffer, use DEF DISPOSEH. 


&lt;u&gt;DEF DISPOSEH(gFBbuffer(2)) FB Lite behavior:&lt;/u&gt;
 When you use the &quot;FB Lite&quot; runtime, built-in graphics statements such as BOX, CIRCLE and PLOT are always directed to the Graphics Window; using ROUTE _toPrinter won't cause such commands to be directed to the printer. If you want to send graphics to the printer while using &quot;FB Lite,&quot; first execute ROUTE _toPrinter, then use QuickDraw Toolbox routines such as FRAMERECT, FRAMEOVAL, LINETO, etc. 

Note:
The WINDOW statement and the WINDOW OUTPUT statement implicitly execute a ROUTE _toScreen statement. Also, any user action which activates a screen window (such as clicking on its title bar) will implicitly cause a ROUTE _toScreen. If you want to make sure that output is not inadvertently directed to the screen window, you should check for _wndActivate events in your dialog-event handling routine, and re-direct the output as necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;A nieve approach, the rectangular window, involves simply truncating the dataset before and after the window, while not modifying the contents of the window at all. However, as we will see, this is a poor method of windowing and causes power leakage.&quot;

nieve == naive?  

power leakage == spectral leakage?  I am far from being an expert but it seems to me that statisticians would talk about 'power leakage' but most dsp texts would refer to 'spectral leakage'.  To an electronics person, spectral leakage makes a lot more sense.

A particular favorite reference is 'A Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing'. http://www.dspguide.com/  It is aimed at people who actually want to implement dsp.  Most textbooks ignore spectral leakage.  It's a major gotcha.  If you don't know about it, your attempts at fft are doomed!</text>

IF expr THEN {dest1|statement1 [:statement2 ...]} ¬
   [ELSE {dest2|statement3 [:statement4 ...]}] dest1 and dest2 are either line numbers or quoted statement labels. 
=== Description ===
Conditionally executes one or more statements, or jumps to an indicated line, based on the value of expr. If expr is evaluated as &quot;true&quot; or as nonzero, then the program either jumps to the line indicated by dest1, or it executes statement1, statement2, etc. If expr is evaluated as &quot;false&quot; or as zero, and you've included the ELSE clause, then the program either jumps to the line indicated by dest2, or it executes statement3, statement4, etc. Each of the statement's can be any executable statement except a &quot;block&quot; statement such as FOR, WHILE, DO, etc. expr can be either a numeric expression, a &quot;logical&quot; expression, or a string. A logical expression normally contains &quot;data comparison&quot; operators, and can be evaluated as being either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false.&quot; Here are some examples of logical expressions: x! &gt; 19.7
myName$ = &quot;RICK&quot;
6*7 &lt;= 42In FB, numeric expressions and logical expressions are interchangeable. When a numeric expression is used in the context of a logical expression, then it's considered &quot;true&quot; if it's nonzero, or &quot;false&quot; if it's zero. For example: IF x+3 THEN BEEP Here, the BEEP will be executed if and only if x+3 is not zero. When a logical expression is used in the context of a numeric expression, then it's evaluated as -1 if it's true, or as 0 if it's false. For example: found = (fileName$ = seekName$) Here, if fileName$ equals seekName$, the value -1 is assigned to found; otherwise, found is assigned a value of 0. You can use the operators AND, OR, NOT within expr. Note, however, that these three are considered to be arithmetic operators, not logical operators. This can lead to some unexpected results if you're not careful. For example, this expression: firstNumber&amp; AND secondNumber&amp; may evaluate to zero (false), even when both firstNumber&amp; and secondNumber&amp; are each nonzero (true). When you wish to use AND, OR, or NOT in the context of a logical expression, you should use operands which always evaluate either to -1 or to 0. For example: firstNumber&amp; &lt;&gt; 0 AND secondNumber&amp; &lt;&gt; 0 This expression behaves &quot;logically,&quot; because (firstNumber&amp;&lt;&gt;0) is always -1 or 0; and likewise (secondNumber&amp;&lt;&gt;0) is always -1 or 0. The expr can also be a string. When a string is used in the context of a logical expression, it's evaluated as &quot;true&quot; if and only if the length of the string is greater than zero. Note:
The IF statement is a one-line structure. To create a conditional structure spanning multiple lines, use the LONG IF statement. Use caution when comparing floating point values to zero or to whole numbers. The following expression may not evaluate as expected: IF x# = 1In this statement, the compiler compares the value in x# to an integer &quot;1&quot;. Since SANE and PPC math both use fractional approximations of numbers, the actual value of x#, though very close to one, may actually be something like 0.99999999 and therefore render unexpected results.

=== Statement ===
		Appearance 			Standard 			Console 	
=== Syntax ===
INC(intVar)
intVar ++
numericVariable += IntegerValToAdd === Revised === May 30, 2000 (Release 3) 
=== Description ===
This statement increments intVar by 1; that is, it adds 1 to the value in intVar, and stores the result back into intVar. intVar must be a (signed or unsigned) byte variable, short-integer variable or long-integer variable. If intVar is already at the maximum value for its variable type, then INC(intVar) will cycle it back to its minimum value. Example:
INC(x&amp;) and... x&amp; ++ and... x&amp; += 1 ...are equivalent to: x&amp; = x&amp; + 1 The following expressions are also equivalent. x&amp; = x&amp; + 100
x&amp; += 100 Note:
The += syntax may not be used for arrays of strings, containers, or records (though it may be used in the concatenation of simple strings or containers). Where arrays are involved, only numeric values may take advantage of this syntax. This syntax is valid for values other than 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Proposal==
===The niche===
There is a fairly small range of textbooks on the topic of [[w:Outdoor education|outdoor education]], typically North American. These books regularly go out of print, thus much good material is lost to the community. The proposed concept for this wikibook is to harness the outdoor education community knowledge to create a combined [[wikipedia:Open educational resources|open]] outdoor education textbook for use in secondary- and tertiary-level outdoor education training.

Where good quality, freely usable content already exists online (e.g., on university websites), this book may simply link to that material. However, the book also provides a way to host materials which make appropriate textbook content.

Over time, books and articles which are out of print and/or for which copyright permission allows, may be converted and uploaded, providing they fit with the book structure. Original, intact previous publications are, however, probably best uploaded to WikiSource. Content uploaded into wikibooks should be editable and modifiable.

===What this book is===
# An introduction to outdoor education.
# A [[wikipedia:Free culture|free culture]] text which covers the major topics in outdoor education.
# Targetted for people studying outdoor education or training to be outdoor educators.

===What this book is not===
# Commerical
# Lessons plans - such content would be more appropriate on the accompanying [[wikiversity:Topic:Outdoor education|outdoor education]] wikiversity page.

INC {LONG|WORD|BYTE} (addr&amp;) Description:
This statement increments the long integer, short integer or byte which begins at the specified address in memory; that is, it adds 1 to the value in memory and stores the result back into the addressed location. If the long integer, short integer or byte is already at its maximum possible value, then the statement will cycle it back to its minimum value. Example:
INC LONG (myAddr&amp;) ...is equivalent to: POKE LONG myAddr&amp;, PEEK LONG(myAddr&amp;) + 1 Also: INC WORD (myAddr&amp;) ...is equivalent to: POKE WORD myAddr&amp;, PEEK WORD(myAddr&amp;) + 1

== Lab 3: Building a full-wave bridge circuit ==

''Thursday, April 03, 2008, 13.45 h''

'''Participants of this lab:''' Andrey Rachev, Ivelin Ivov, Ivaylo Katrazanov, Rumyana Naydenova, Sasha Madov, Miodrag Hristich, Andon Radulov, Galin Gyurov, Kamen Avramov, Dimitrina Nedelcheva, Slavka Petrova, Zdravko Georgiev, [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]], Ivaylo Atanasov and Miglena Nesterova.

=== Investigating an LED ===

[[Image:Investigating_led_whiteboard_64a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating an LED on the whiteboard.&lt;/center&gt;]]

In this exercise, we have recreated the famous circuit of ''full-wave bridge''. In order to visualize its operation (where currents flow), we have decided to replace the ordinary rectifying diodes by LEDs with different colors. Also, we have used another LED for a load. Firstly, we have investigated the very LED to make ourselves familiar with its behavior. We have found that its performance is good for our purposes, it would shine and work without problems. It was clear that we had to connect a protecting resistor in series with the bridge circuit. [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

=== Building the circuit on the whiteboard ===

[[Image:Full-wave_led_bridge_whiteboard1_64a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Building the circuit on the whiteboard (Step 1).&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Step 1.''' We started building the circuit on the whiteboard by connecting the ''load'' (the tested red LED). Here we assumed that DAC 1 was producing a positive voltage from 0 up to 10 V (this was the positive half-wave). Note how we have outlined the inverse S shape of the &quot;positive&quot; part of the future bridge. [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

[[Image:Full-wave_led_bridge_whiteboard2_64a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Building the circuit on the whiteboard (Step 2).&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Step 2.''' Then we assumed that DAC 1 was producing a negative voltage from 0 up to -10 V (this was the negative half-wave) and connected the true S shape of the rest &quot;negative&quot; part of the future bridge. Only, a short-circuit turned out:( What should we do then? We began thinking...&lt;br&gt;
We had already known that diodes can act as decoupling elements (switches); so, we put two red-colored LEDs in the two opposite &quot;positive&quot; bridge legs acting as rectifying and visualizing diodes for the positive half-wave. We expected that since all the three diodes (including the &quot;load&quot;) were connected in the same direction they would enable the current to flow in the right direction and would shine during the positive half-wave.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

'''Step 3.''' But it was not sufficient...:( To remove the conflict, we had to put further two (now, green-colored) LEDs in the two opposite &quot;negative&quot; bridge legs acting again as rectifying and visualizing diodes for the negative half-wave. We solved the short-circuit problem; we managed to &quot;invent&quot; the famous ''full-wave bridge'' rectifying circuit!

You can see on the picture how we made the full wave bridge – never mind if the current  flows from –  to  +  or from + to -, our red load LED will always shine! Now we can carry out a real experiment to see if our circuit will really work. [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

=== Mounting the circuit on a prototyping PCB ===

[[Image:Full-wave_led_bridge_mounted_64a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A full-wave bridge rectifier implemented by LEDs.&lt;/center&gt;]]

This was a true hands-on exercise where we mounted the real circuit on a real prototyping PCB; we soldered the two rectifying LEDs and the LED load on the board and connected them by wires. Thus we finally got a real full-wave bridge rectifier that didn't need any measuring devices. Imagine it should indicate its state (the current direction) by the very diodes! We were eager to get to know, if it would work really as we had assumed? It would be very interesting to test it. [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

=== Investigating the circuit by ''Microlab'' ===

[[Image:Full-wave_led_bridge_acting_64a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating the LED rectifier by ''Microlab'' system.&lt;/center&gt;]]

After we supplied the circuit by ''Microlab'' system we were ready to investigate the circuit operation.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Positive input voltage ====

[[Image:Full-wave_led_bridge_board1_64a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating the LED rectifier by ''Microlab'' (positive input voltage).&lt;/center&gt;]]

It was working as we expected - the three red LEDs were lighting when we put a positive input voltage, the other two LEDs were extinguished. Everything was OK, as we wanted to be. [[User:PavlinPanev 64]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Negative input voltage ====

[[Image:Full-wave_led_bridge_board2_64a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating the LED rectifier by ''Microlab'' (negative input voltage).&lt;/center&gt;]]

Then we tested the circuit at negative input voltage; again the result was excellent as we had  expected. We were content with ourselves as we did our job very good. The famous full-wave bridge was working not only in theory but in real! [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

== [[Circuit Idea/Building an Emitter Follower|Lab 3]]: Building an emitter follower ==

''Tuesday, April 01, 2008, 16.45 h''

authors: Angel,Virginia &amp; Vladimir
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Building a negative feedback follower ===

==== Looking for analogies of negative feedback phenomenon ====

'''Speaking.''' We are getting started with an explanation of the term ''negative feedback''. The first thing we ask each other is if there is a similar phenomenon in real life. Thus we have found we might consider human speech as an example: you have to listen to your voice in order to control its volume. In this way you are able to communicate with those around you appropriately. The noisier the surrounding environment is, the louder your voice becomes and vice versa. This basic idea explains roughly the essence of negative feedback.

'''Driving.''' Another example of the idea of negative feedback might also be the following situation. Imagine you are getting in your car and striving to drive with 50km/h. Let us now suppose that we have a current state X and we want to achieve another goal state Y. In order to complete this task we should monitor the process of its development and control it in a desirable way by adjusting all necessary parametres. You are in state X and you would like to achieve state Y. But what do you need?

==== Generalizing the analogies into a block diagram ====

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:X_Y_ENERGY.PNG|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;A negative feedback follower consists of power source E, a regulating element R and a subtractor (-).&lt;/center&gt;]] --&gt;


The first thing you need is ENERGY. It's necessary but not enough. You need also a visualization of your speed in order to control it. In other words you need a REGULATOR.

But what is the regulator doing? It compares the difference between the ''purpose state'' and the ''current state''; then, it does what can do to eliminate it. When this difference is equal to zero, we have an equilibrium – this shows that the goal state has been achieved.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Building an electrical follower ===

The most simple regulator is the so called ''follower''. Now we have to think about how we can realize a follower.

==== Is the humble wire a follower? ====

An obvious example of electric follower is... a simple wire (?!?). This remedy is simple: if you want the potential of point B to follow the potential of point A, just connect them to each other by piece of wire. But is that wire a perfect follower? The answer is “no”. We will provide reasons why with the next example.

[[Image:IS THE WIRE A FOLLOWER1.PNG|center|thumb|700px|&lt;center&gt;The bare wire is a perfect follower only, if there is not a load connected to the end of wire.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The wire as you know has its own resistance. Let us now connect a resistor (1 ohm), our wire (1 ohm) and a voltage source(10V) like it is shown in the second picture. After measuring the output voltage we see that it has been reduced with the voltage drop caused by the wire’s internal resistance. The reason for this is clear – the current flowing in the circuit.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Building an emitter follower on the whiteboard ===

So we decide to make use of another (this time more “perfect”) regulator – an emitter follower. Having already come to the idea of constant regulating and adjusting a desired value according to the changes in its environment, we proceed with a real scheme with a transistor. The transistor here acts as the regulating element of the negative feedback follower above. The essence is that it “observes” the potential in point A and changes the potential in point B (by changing its own resistance) so that to keep an almost zero difference between them. But let's  give a description of our practical laboratory exercise.

=== Putting the powerful idea into practice ===

''(How our laboratory exercise passed over)''

[[Image:Clipboard01_sources.png|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;The transistor acts as a regulating element.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Preparation.''' In order to reveal to us the &quot;secrets&quot; of ubiquitous transistor, our teacher [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Cyril Mechkov]] provided us with the opportunity to build our own test circuit and observe its behaviour. As curious students who usually enjoy taking things apart, we were desperate to &quot;invent&quot; our own emitter follower and get a preconception of the so called ''negative feedback''. We already knew some of the basic applications of the transistor having already studied digital circuitry but most of us lacked any practical experience. Having realized that, firstly prof. Mechkov briefly outlined the idea of the laboratory session and then gave us a soldering iron, a test board and all the necessary equipment to carry out the investigation of our device. The old Apple II based PC proved ideal for the experiment - it not only served as a power supply:) but together with the MicroLab system was able to &quot;watch&quot; our scheme and draw real-time voltage diagrams. Armed with this powerful &quot;weaponry&quot; we felt like real inventors!

[[Image:Clipboard02_grafika121.png|right|thumb|500px|&lt;center&gt;The emitter voltage follows the base one shifted by V&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Investigation.''' Some of the girls were terrified when Miroslav (a colleague) switched on the scheme, but fortunately nothing exploded;) Everything was well under control. After connecting our newly constructed emitter follower to the prototyping board we started the investigation by gradually varying its power supply (ranging from -10 to 10 Volts). As you can see from the pictures in the region of the positive values the transistor's behaviour coincides with theory. The voltage drop of the emitter-base junction always &quot;strives&quot; to remain the same - exactly 0,7 Volts. In accordance with Kirchoff's laws the potential of the output emitter was just like we expected - the input voltage minus the voltage drop. By analogy, the same linear dependency was observed in the negative input range. The lab results in that case are reproduced in the picture below.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Clipboard03_next_source.png|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;The imperfect voltmeter &quot;pulls&quot; up the transistor's emitter.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Problem.''' However, quite unexpectedly we suggested double-checking the scheme by connecting an old-fashioned analogue votmeter in parallel to the digital VOM. Miroslav then attached one of the crocodile clips to the emitter and the other to the ground of the board (notice that the emitter - collector power supply is bipolar). At first, the new result on the screen seemed quite strange - in the negative region there was a section with a constant potential. Something had made the emitter base junction reverse biased. Professor Mechkov smiled being aware of the &quot;mischevous intruder&quot; in the voltage diagram but wanted us to find out the cause. We didn't hesitate for long and changed the old-fashioned voltmeter with a Chinese 3$ one.

Voila! The key to the &quot;mystery&quot; was finally discovered - the reason for switching off the transistor was the voltmeter's internal resistance. In the case of the old electromagnetic device it was about 20 kOhms. This internal resistance had become the main reason for the advent of a current flow through one of the power supplies, our load and the voltmeter. This newly appeared current kept the potential at the output unchanging when the base supply was low enough (see the picture). We realized the n-p-n transistor can only &quot;source&quot; current; it can't sink current.

[[Image:Clipboard04_grakika2.png|right|thumb|500px|&lt;center&gt;There is a clipping on the output curve because of backbiasing of the base-emitter junction.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Clipboard05_shema5.png|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;There is a clipping on the output curve because of backbiasing of the base-emitter junction.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Strengthening the problem.''' Having discovered this effect, we decided to replace the voltmeter with a lower resistor (100 Ohms) in order to simulate a voltage breakdown through the reverse biased base-emitter junction. In that particular case the transistor acted like a zener diode stabilizing the output voltage in certain ranges. A reproduced PC based simulation is shown on the last picture. 

[[Image:Clipboard06_poslednagrakika.png|right|thumb|550px|&lt;center&gt;A zener voltage breakdown occured when we went too far with backbiasing...&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Conclusions ===

'''The final conclusion from the laboratory exercise was that a simple emitter follower might not be so simple and predictable in certain situations. We gathered some really valuable experience by observing the changes in our transistor's behaviour - at first it acted as an emitter follower, then it became a zener diode finally it turned into a voltage controlled switch. The small transistor was like a skilful magician but one playing tricks with current. Electronics is really fascinating, isn't it!'''

==== The history of the transistor ====

&lt;em&gt;&quot;The Transistor was probably the most
important invention of the 20th Century,
and the story behind the invention is one
of clashing egos and top secret research.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;
	  	  	 

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;The problem started in the 1907 when the AT&amp;T (American Telephone and Telegraph) faced the competition erupting from the expiration of Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patents. And the solution was transcontinental telephone service. In 1906, the eccentric American inventor Lee De Forest developed a triode in a vacuum tube. It was a device that could amplify signals, including, it was hoped, signals on telephone lines as they were transferred across the country from one switch box to another. AT&amp;T bought De Forest's patent and vastly improved the tube. It allowed the signal to be amplified regularly along the line, meaning that a telephone conversation could go on across any distance as long as there were amplifiers along the way. But the vacuum tubes that made that amplification possible were extremely unreliable, used too much power and produced too much heat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;
After the end of World War II, a team of scientists was collected to develop a solid-state semiconductor switch to replace the problematic vacuum tube.  This team included a mix of physicists, chemists and engineers. On November 17, 1947, Walter Brattain, an experimental physicist who could build or fix just about anything, made an experiment into a thermos of water. The silicon contraption he'd built was supposed to help him study how electrons acted on the surface of a semiconductor. The wet device created the largest amplification Brattain had seen so far. By turning on a positive voltage he increased the effect even more; turning it to negative could get rid of it completely. It seemed that whatever those electrons had been doing on the surface to block amplification had somehow been canceled out by the water - the greatest obstacle to building an amplifier had been overcome.
Unfortunately this giant jump in amplification only worked for certain types of current - ones with very low frequencies. That wouldn't work for a phone line, which has to handle all the complex frequencies of a person's voice. So the next step was to get it to work at all kinds of frequencies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;
In fact the device worked as if there was no oxide layer at all. And as Brattain poked the gold contact in again and again, he realized that's because there wasn't an oxide layer. He had washed it off by accident. Brattain was furious with himself, but decided to fiddle with the point contact anyway. To his surprise, he actually got some voltage amplification - and more importantly he could get it at all frequencies! The gold contact was putting holes into the germanium and these holes canceled out the effect of the electrons at the surface, the same way the water had. But this was much better than the version that used water, because now, the device was increasing the current at all frequencies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;
Brattain had managed to get a large amplification at some frequencies and he'd gotten a small amplification for all frequencies - now he just had to combine the two. He knew that the key components were a slab of germanium and two gold point contacts just fractions of a millimeter apart. Walter Brattain put a ribbon of gold foil around a plastic triangle, and sliced it through at one of the points. By putting the point of the triangle gently down on the germanium, he saw a fantastic effect - signal came in through one gold contact and increased as as it raced out the other. The first point-contact transistor had been made.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify&quot;&gt;
He showed this little plastic triangle at a group meeting on December 23. It was official - this tiny bit of germanium, plastic and gold was the first working solid state amplifier.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

==== Building the circuit on the whiteboard ====

===== Transistor as an amplifier =====

[[Image:Transistor_switch_whiteboard_68a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Building a transistor switch on the whiteboard.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;The first part of this laboratory exercise was to build a transistor switch on the whiteboard. And we started with a conversation about the behavior of the transistor. The lecturer asked us what are the real functions of a transistor and what a transistor consists of. Those who knew it were just few. What we knew from the previous year was that the transistor amplifies electrical current. But in the exercise we took a deep look in its structure and understood that the transistor is nothing more than electrically driven resistor. Actually there is no real amplification. The real function of a transistor is to regulate not to amplify. (The text is written by [[Radoslav Danchev]])&lt;/p&gt;

In laboratory classes we imagined transistors the way they are normally explained in electronics - like a variable resistors. They are electrically-managed resistors, known as active transistors. Normaly, the voltage across the transistor would increase its value, but actually it fades. The transistor decreases the supply voltage. It seems that the transistor can regulates it - this is one of the main funcions of transistors.

===== Making transistor act as a switch =====

After discussion of what is transistor, we started talking about the meaning of the transistor switch. We concluded that this is an element with two states - OFF and ON. When the switch is off, no current flows through it, and therefore the transistor is off. The depletion region across the emitter-base junction is large. There is no potential differences between the base and emmitter. The emitter-collector terminals act as open. The second state is ON - then the transistor turns on as hard as it can. A voltage is present across the base-emitter junction. The depletion region across the emitter-base junction shrinks as much as possible. 
Here is a presentation about transistor switch : http://www.wisc-online.com/objects/index_tj.asp?objID=SSE3703 
It is very interesting! Take a look!

Eventually, we understood what exactly transistor and transistor switch are, along with their general purpose. So we started building one. The building scheme is in the photo. [[User:Hristina Malakova68|Hristina Malakova68]] ([[User talk:Hristina Malakova68|talk]])

===== Assembling a transistor switch by simpler converters =====

:Here are some questions about the circuit of the transistor switch. What does the base resistor R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; actually do in this circuit? Can we apply 1000 V or even more to the transistor switch input? What does the collector resistor R&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; actually do in this circuit? A tip: present the transistor switch as a circuit composed by three converters (a [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter#V-to-I converter acting as an input device|voltage-to-current]], a current-to-current and a [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter#I-to-V converter acting as an output device|current-to-voltage]] converter). See the pictures below. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 14:32, 20 April 2008 (UTC)

==== Mounting the circuit on a prototyping PCB ====

[[Image:Transistor_switch_pcb_68a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A transistor switch on a prototyping PCB.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The picture above shows how we have built a transistor switch. It was very interesting task for us. Some of my collegues took part in this. I watched them with extreme attention. First, the lecturer found a prototyping printed circuit board (PCB), which he gave to us. After that we started building up our &quot;invention&quot;. We soldered the supply voltage to the PCB. Then we put n-p-n transistor on the board. It was very difficult to solder its pins... but we made it!

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Investigating the circuit ====

Then we put a lamp to use it like a collector load. The lamp had current charge of 100mA. We attached a button to control switching on and off the lamp. We soldered the button between the plus of the supply and the base of the transistor. When the lamp is off then the button is off, too. The transistor in this case is cut off. We attached also a contact point where we could measure the output (collector) voltage of our transistor switch. This was the final touch we made on our &quot;invention&quot;. Our transistor switch worked very well and we tested it a couple of times. It was quite amazing. It was worth doing it.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Drawing conclusions ====

Finnaly we concluded that if we want our transistor switch to work properly, we have to observe some circumstances:

#The transistor must be saturated very well. Otherwise it would start warming up.
#If Rb isn't small enough, the transistor would be blocked and it would start warming up. Its behavior would be like an amplifier.
#The transistor must be in its two final states - saturated (fully ON state) or cut off (OFF state).

== Lab 4: How to make perfect circuits by series NFB ==

=== Is the real diode a perfect component? ===

[[Image:Real_diode_single.jpg|left|thumb|210px|&lt;center&gt;A &quot;harmful&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; across a diode.&lt;/center&gt;]]

A forward voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; appears across a real diode when a current flows through it... What is this voltage drop - useful or harmful? Sometimes it is useful; other times it is harmful...

'''&quot;Useful&quot; examples.''' When we make voltage stabilizers, we need this voltage drop. In these cases we do all that is possible to create and increase this useful voltage drop appearing across various diode component: diodes, LEDs, zeners, multiple diodes connected in series...

'''&quot;Harmful&quot; examples.''' In other cases, when we use a diode as a switching element, we do all that is possible to remove and to remove this harmful voltage drop... Then we need an ideal diode without forvard voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Making the simplest series diode rectifier ===

==== Implementing the powerful idea into an electrical circuit ====

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Making an almost ideal &quot;op-amp&quot; series diode rectifier ====

What can act as a varying voltage source in our electronic circuit? What can &quot;help&quot; the imperfect diode by adding so much voltage to the input voltage as it loses across the diode? At last ''Lab 3'' we were using transistors for such a purpose; let's now, for the sake of change, use an op-amp...

[[Image:Dist_follower_diode_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Compensating the harmful forward voltage drop VF across a real diode by surplus voltage.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Now the op-amp has to &quot;insert&quot; the &quot;helping&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; into the circuit; so, how to connect it?

[[Image:Dist_follower_diode_microlab_884.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Investigating the &quot;ideal&quot; diode by ''Microlab''.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Eureka! We have invented an (almost) ideal diode without (any) forvard voltage V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;! Let's investigate it by ''Microlab'' system.

In addition to the positive and negative terminals it has also two mystic terminals named NFB. What are they? Why and when do we need them?

== [[Circuit Idea/Group 65b#Lab_3: Building the simplest transistor current source|Lab 3 (Group 65b): Building the simplest transistor current source]] ==

''Tuesday, April 08, 2008, 10.30 h''

=== What a current source is ===

[[Image:Ideal current source 65b.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;How does a constant current source behave?&lt;/center&gt;]]

We begin our lab with general questions: &quot;What is a current source? What do we want it to do?&quot; How does a current source behave? How do we figure out that some device is a current source? How do we make a current source?&quot; Simply speaking, we have to form a notion about ''constant current source''.

What have you known about the current source from the basic course of electricity? Here is the well-known symbol of a current source (see the picture). How to make a good guess that it is a current source? If I give to you a (black) box with two leads and I say that it is a current source, how do you convince yourselves that it is really a current source? ''Vladimir: It will begin warming...'' Why do you think so? And what will happen, if we connect the two leads (a short circuit - case 1 on the picture)? Is it dangerous for the current source (comparing with a voltage one)? ''Vladimir: Yes, it is... Atanas: No, it isn't...'' Indeed, there is nothing dangerous for a current source, if we short its two leads. As the current source is designed for a given current, it keeps up (limits) the current thus protecting itself.

Then, maybe the opposite condition - an open circuit (case 3 on the picture) - will be dangerous as the current source will try to pass the same current as before. In this situation, the current source is misled: it doesn't see the open circuit; it &quot;thinks&quot; there is something connected there. It just &quot;sees&quot; that no current flows and raises its internal voltage up with the &quot;hope&quot; to pass a current through the harmful &quot;thing&quot;. Of course, the current source does not manage to pass any current through the open circuit and reaches the final (compliance) voltage; a saturation and even a breakdown occurs. Thus, the compliance voltage represents the maximum voltage that the current source can reach when strives to produce the desired current.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Passive current source ===

[[Image:Simplest_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Building the simplest current source (a draft).&lt;/center&gt;]]

''Atanas'' has said that, if we connect a resistor in series to the voltage source there will no problem with the short connection. Well, let's place a resistor; thus we obtain the simplest current source. Choose for concreteness the favorite pretty values for the electrical quantities: V = 10 V and R = 10 kΩ to obtain I = 1 mA.

'''Ideal load.''' First, make a short connection at the output of the circuit. Since there is no voltage drop across the load, all the input voltage V is applied across the resistor R. As a result, the current is exactly as Ohm's law says:

&lt;center&gt;I = V/R = 10 V/10 kΩ = 1 mA&lt;/center&gt;


[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm#step2 Keeping a constant current by using an ideal current load]&lt;br&gt;
[[Circuit_Idea/Passive_Voltage-to-Current_Converter#Basic_electrical_idea:_voltage_causes_current|Passive voltage-to-current converter (Voltage causes current)]]

[[Image:Passive_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;The load decreases the current (a draft).&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Imperfections.''' What are the problems of this humble circuit? Let's connect a load having some resistance to see what happens. As we can see, a voltage drop appears across the load and the current decreases.

The real load introduces some voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, which affects the excitation voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, not all the input voltage is applied across the current-setting resistor R but only the voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, here the voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; determines the current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; instead the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the current decreases:

&lt;center&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/R = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/(R +  R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;

This passive circuit is imperfect; it can't stand against the load &quot;intervention&quot; especially, if the load varies. It is a static, fixed, non-adaptable circuit... What do we do then?

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Dynamic current sources ===

What a new idea might arise now? Let's begin reasoning... The problem pops up when we connect a load and, what is worse, if we begin varying its resistance. Note the load may be not only a steady or varying resistor; it might be a capacitor that is charging, a diode (ordinary, zener, LED, base-emitter junction, etc.) or even a voltage source (e.g., a rechargable battery)... It is not so important what exactly the load is; it is only important that a voltage drop appears across the load and this voltage drop confuses things.

==== Basic &quot;dynamization&quot; idea ====

If we look around, we can see that most things in this world are changeable, adaptable, dynamic... According to this observation, we have to make our current source react somehow to the load &quot;intervention&quot;, to resist to its attemption to lower the current. That means something inside the current source has to change, in order to compensate the disturbing voltage drop across the load. What can change in this simple electric circuit?

===== Varying (dynamic) internal voltage =====

[[Image:Bootstrapped_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Keeping up a constant current by dynamic voltage.&lt;/center&gt;]]

''Vladimir: We might change the voltage...'' Yes, it is the one possible solution. Vladimir suggests, if the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; across the load begins rising, the internal voltage V&lt;sub&gt;VAR&lt;/sub&gt; of the current source to begin rising as well in the same direction with the same rate so that the difference V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; between them to stay constant. This is the first idea: dynamic current source with following internal voltage. Till when will this magic continue? Of course, until V&lt;sub&gt;VAR&lt;/sub&gt; finally reaches the positive supply rail. After that point, our wonderful &quot;voltage-dynamic&quot; current source becomes an ordinary one.

Have you heard the legend about [[w:Baron Munchhausen|Baron Munchhausen]] that was using his own boot straps to pull himself out of the sea? Our circuit is just one possible implementation of Munchhausen's [[w:bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapping]] idea in electronics.

Is there a negative feedback here? No, it isn't. The varying voltage source follows blindly the load voltage; it does not &quot;interested&quot; in the magnitude of the current.

:I am not sure if a coil can be treated as a way to &quot;produce&quot; dynamic voltages for keeping the current constant (at least temporarily). Or is there practical way of doing so in real circuits?
:Thanks,
:/bruin

::Yes, an inductor behaves exactly as a dynamic voltage source that opposes the changes of the input (exciting) voltage source so that to keep the current constant. Both the time-dependent elements (inductors and capacitors) behave as opposing voltage sources; only, inductors oppose the input voltage in the beginning while capacitors - in the end of the transitional process. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 17:36, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:R_dynamic_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Keeping up a constant current by dynamic resistance.&lt;/center&gt;]]

===== Varying (dynamic) internal resistance =====

Do you have another idea? What else can change in this humble circuit when the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; rises and, as a result, the current lowers? ''Atanas: Let's vary the resistance R...'' Great idea! The resistance R is another attribute that can change to keep the current constant.

Actually, we have to make the current source change its internal resistance so that to keep a constant sum R + R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;; as a result, the current I = V&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt;/(R + R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) will stay constant. Again, till when will this magic continue? If R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; reises, R will lower until it becomes finally zero. After that point, our wonderful &quot;resistance-dynamic&quot; current source becomes an ordinary one.

Since the resistor R has the property to keep up a constant current, they name it ''current-stable resistor''. Agin, is there a negative feedback here? No, it isn't. The varying resistor changes blindly its resistance; it does not &quot;interested&quot; in the magnitude of the current.

Since the resistor R has the property to keep up a constant current, they name it ''current-stable resistor''. Let's realize this idea as it is simpler and more obvious than the idea of a dynamic voltage source considered above.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== A transistor acting as a current-stable resistor ====

[[Image:Trans_output_whiteboard1_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;How does the transistor's output part behave?&lt;/center&gt;]]

What electronic component has such a current-stable behavior? ''A student: The operational amplifier...'' No, no, it has to be a simpler element. Remember in this lab cicle we consider diode and transistor circuits; so, it has to be a diode or a transistor. A hint: the one has a behavior of a voltage source (more precisely, of a voltage-stable element); the other has a behavior of a current source (current-stable element). Well, which of the two behaves as a current-stable element? Of course, the transistor...

Well, let's then see why the transistor has such a behavior. You have already studied  a subject about semiconductor elements; so, you have to know how it behaves. Do you have any reminiscence of it? What can a transistor do? ''A student: ...to amplify...'' No, it might sound paradoxical but the transistor does not amplify; it attenuates!?! The only thing that a transistor can do is to change its present resistance thus dissipating a power and, as a result, regulating the current through or the voltage across the load.

Here is an n-p-n transistor connected in series with a load R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and a power supply V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a three-terminal element (a ''triode'') while a diode is a two-terminal element. A triode is too complicated for our reasoning:) so, we break down it into two two-terminal parts: an ''input base-emitter part'' and an ''output collector-emitter part''. Each of them has an IV characteristic; now we are interested in the output characteristic of the collector-emitter part. Why they name it &quot;IV characteristic&quot;? Because we can do two things with it: to apply a voltage across it and to measure the current through it or to pass a current through it and to measure the voltage drop across it. Also, they name this curve ''output characteristic'' because it represents the output transistor's part. How does it look? Let's present the circuit operation graphically.

For this purpose, we have to superimpose two characteristics - one of the source and one of the load. First, let's draw the IV characteristic of the voltage source acting here as a power supply. What is it? It is a vertical line that is shifted with the magnitude of the voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, we have to show the presence of the load by inclining the line to the left according to the load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. The resulting curve represents an IV characteristic of a real voltage source having a voltage V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; and an internal resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (they name it &quot;load line&quot;). After, we have to plot the transistor's output characteristic on the same coordinate system. The crossing point is known as an ''operating point''; it represents the present magnitudes of the voltage and the current.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Trans_output_va_1_65b_lab3.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;IV curves (RL varies).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Trans_output_va_2_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;IV curves (both RL and RT vary).&lt;/center&gt;]]

When we vary the load, the load line rotates and the operating point moves horizontally along the transistor's output characteristic. But why? How does it do this magic? What does the transistor actually do to achieve such an effect? Can someone explain? Let's try.

When we lower the load resistance the load line stands up; the transistor does the opposite - it increases its present collector-emitter resistance R&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; (or just R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) so that to keep up a constant total circuit resistance. We may show R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; by another line that begins from the coordinate system origin (the trick is to think of the present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; as an ohmic one). So, this line will rotate around the origin and incline as well.
As a result, the crossing point moves along a new almost horizontal line - the output transistor characteristic. This line is imaginary, unreal, artificial but we can see only this line; it represents the behavior of a current-stable resistor.

The BJT transistor as a three-legged creater (??? [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 12:28, 27 May 2008 (UTC)) looks much like a light switch (2 legs for IN and OUT, and one for the ON/OFF button), and basicly that's what it is - a switch. But this one here is like those fancy light switches with a rotating knob or even the more fancy ones - with a metal &quot;touch-plate&quot;, which can be used to set a different light intensity in a continuous range by rotating the knob, or keeping your finger on the metal plate for a short time. But unlike these mechanically controlled switches, the transistor is an electrically controled one - on this scheme the output collector-emitter(C-E) current is controlled by the input base current or the base voltage, whichever suits us more.

So here comes the simple idea - if we apply a constant base voltage, we will set a constant C-E current. When the C-E voltage increases (e.g. due to decrease in voltage on the load resistor R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;) the C-E resistance will increase too (remember we set the C-E current to constant using a constant base voltage). So what do we get - a dynamic varying resistor which keeps a constant current flow. In short - a ''current-stable resistor''. Which is exactly what we need in order to make a constant current source. 

This behaviour is shown on the '''IV''' diagrams below. They can be explained as a mechanism with the '''I''' line acting as a &quot;fixed rail&quot;, on which the crossing of the two &quot;pivots&quot; - '''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' lines - point '''A''' slides.  As we decrease the load ('''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''' that is) point '''A''' slides down the '''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''' line, up the '''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' line, and to the right on the '''I''' line. This means that the transistor resistance increases, so the whole resistance of the circuit remains the same, and therefore the current flow remains the same. As we do the opposite - guess what - exactly the opposite things happen ;)

Looks scary at first sight :) But none of the elements involved bites, and everyone has it's role.

:Maybe, it looks scary because we have placed here the final, complete and perfect circuit solution?

In the middle, surrounded by a blue line is the &quot;boss&quot; of the circuit - the varying load resistor '''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'''. It's he who leads the concert, and the whole curcuit is built for him - to satisfy his needs and desires for constant current.
The nameless resistor just beneath the boss is his &quot;bodyguard&quot; - just in case someone curious moves the slider of the &quot;boss resistor&quot; to its very end and try to short-curcuit the power source through the transistor.

Everything outside the blue line is the BJT current source itself - a whole team of elements working for the &quot;boss&quot;. There's the &quot;hero&quot; of the curciut - the workhorse - the mighty '''bipolar junction transistor (BJT)''', who does all the dirty job (donkey work:) of keeping the constant current. Connected to its base is his &quot;manager&quot; (modern heros need to have managers), the varying resistor (potentiometer) '''P''', who is basicly a varying voltage divider, and by the means of base voltage '''V&lt;sub&gt;b''' &lt;/sub&gt; tells the transistor what to do. In this case - using a constant base voltage the manager tells him to keep the current flow at a constant rate. The &quot;manager&quot; also has a &quot;bodyguard&quot; - '''R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''' keeping the power source safe from short-curcuit's caused by someone playing with the potentiometer '''P'''.

Then there are our watchfull eyes - the voltmeter V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, used to keep an eye on the voltage drop on the load resistor (the boss), another voltmeter V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, watching over the voltage drop on the transistor's collector-emitter junction, and an ammeter, which gives us a sneak-peak on the current flow.

Last, but not least - the power source '''V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;''', who brings the whole curcuit to life :) -- [[User:V.konushliev|V.konushliev]] ([[User talk:V.konushliev|talk]]) 13:22, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

=== Mounting the circuit on a PCB ===

It was easy so far but now we have to materialize the circuit on a prototyping printed circuit board. Can someone solder? If yes, please! Here are soldering iron and solder. How do we solder? Look at this links: [http://www.aaroncake.net/electronics/solder.htm 1], [http://www.mediacollege.com/misc/solder/ 2]. You may use also various tools...

The transistor is n-p-n type packed in metallic body. The collector is connected to the body; so, you might measure the collector voltage by touching the body. You may supply the circuit by the computer or by an external power supply. What do you prefer? If you use the PC supply, there are two fixed voltages (+12 V and -12 V). Maybe, it is better to use the two varying lab supplies because we might provoke our transistor current source by varying the supply voltage. If you prefer, you might use a single power supply...

[[Image:Students1_65b_lab3.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Mounting the simplest BJT current source on a PCB.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Student1_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Mounting the simplest BJT current source on a PCB.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

For our educational purposes it is preferable to arrange the elements in a similar way to the circuit diagram drawn on the whiteboard. For example, place the negative rail at the bottom and the positive one at the top; drive the transistor from the left and take the output from the right, etc. Now, let's make some photos..

[[Image:Student2_65b_lab3.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Mounting the simplest BJT current source on a PCB.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Simplest_trans_current_source_pcb_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The simplest BJT current source is already mounted on a PCB.&lt;/center&gt;]]

What do we connect as a load? Let's it to be something varying - this 10 kΩ rotating &quot;potentiometer&quot; will suit us. Connect it as a rheostat (a two-terminal varying resistor). By the way, why the slider is connected to the one end? What is the idea of this connection? Also, as it is very likely someone to burn out it, connect a protecting resistor in series with the potentiometer.

How to set the input voltage? How to make a lower voltage by a higher one? Of course, by another potentiometer supplied by the same power supply (here it is connected as a real potentiometer).

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Investigating the circuit... ===

In the beginning, we may draw and superimpose the current loops over the circuit diagram. Then, in order to measure the currents and voltages, we have to connect ammeters and voltmeters.

I have an idea for a syncrinised presentation - I will &quot;move&quot; the slider of the input potentiometer on the whiteboard; at the same time, you will move the real slider on the PCB. In the beginning, the input voltage is 0 V; so, no any base current flows. The transistor is &quot;closed&quot;. Increase carefully the input voltage and look at the input transistor characteristic; imagine we walk along it:) At some moment, a current will begin flowing through the base-emitter junction and β times bigger collector current will flows through the load.

What happens, if you go too far? The transistor will saturate. So, we have to stay in the middle where the transistor operates in the active region.

What elements constitute our current source? These are all the elements excluding the very load, of course... Well, now we have to see, if it is a constant current source. How?
We have to disturb, &quot;provoke&quot; it and to observe its reaction to our &quot;intervention&quot;. But let's afford an opportunity to [[User:V.konushliev|Vladimir]] to tell what has happened in the laboratory (he can do it very well).

''The text below is written by a [[User:V.konushliev|student]] from this group:''

Everything here is based on the simple law of Ohm &lt;math&gt;R=V/I&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Multimeters_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Two voltmeters and one ammeter help us to investigate the circuit.&lt;/center&gt;]]

==== ...by varying the load resistance RL... ====

... we observe a change in V1 and V2, but no change in the ammeter. We're happy: the current flow is constant :) How did that happen?

When we increase the load resistance '''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''' so does its voltage drop, which can be seen on voltmeter V2 (logically simple - more resistance generates more pressure). As V2 shows an increment, V1 respectively shows a decrement (their sum represents the voltage of the power sourse Vcc). Since we made the transistor act as a current-stable resistor, it &quot;senses&quot; the decrement of the C-E voltage drop and obediently reduces its resistance, so the sum of resistances in the circuit branch remains the same. Therefore the current flow remains the same too.

When we decrease the load resistance, exactly the opposite happens (V2 shows a decrement, V1 shows an increment, the transistor rises its resistance, the sum of resistance remains the same, and so does the current flow).

==== ...by varying the supply voltage VCC ====

...we observe the same pleasing facts: no change in the ammeter, although V1 and V2 show changes.
We're happy again: the current flow is still constant :)

This time both the voltmeters V1 and V2 showed increments of voltage drops, with the increment of the supply voltage '''Vcc'''. The transistor again &quot;senses&quot; the change in voltage drop and rises its resistance. But if the transistor reacts the same way as in the case above, how does the current remain the same, if there is no change in '''R&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'''?
The difference comes with the fact, that the &quot;manager&quot; of the transistor tells him to rise it's resistance even more, by applying a larger base-emitter voltage. Of course this is due to the fact, that the &quot;manager&quot;, as a simple voltage divider, divides a larger voltage ('''Vcc'''), and therefore gives a larger result ('''Vbe''').
At the end, the sum resistance of the curcuit branch rises enough to compensate the increment in supply voltage '''Vcc''' and keep the current flow the same.

And again, with the opposite input (decrement of '''Vcc''') the opposite phenomena is observed, but the result stays the same - constant current flow. A job well done by the BJT and it's &quot;team&quot; :)

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

:[[User:V.konushliev|Vladimir]], now I am realizing that I have misled you to some extent in this experiment. The circuit is not as correct as it seems. It would be more consistent, if we have made all the possible to make the input &quot;manager&quot; keep a constant voltage. Here we rely on the constant power supply; so, we shouldn't change its voltage. We should supply the potentiometer by another voltage source or replace the input ''voltage-divider circuit'' by a ''voltage-stabilizing one'' (e.g., by connecting a diode into the lower leg). This would be a prelude to the famous current mirror circuit (see [[Circuit Idea/Group 66b#Lab 3: Trying to create a &quot;diode&quot; current mirror|group 66b]] and [[Circuit Idea/Group 67b#Lab 3: &quot;Inventing&quot; a BJT current mirror|group 67b]]). Please, edit your explanation according to these circumstances.

:[[User:V.konushliev|Vladimir]], I have a suggestion to. Would you contribute the ''Circuit idea'' [[Circuit Idea/Simplest Transistor Current Source|story]] about the simplest transistor constant current source (and not only it)? Your writing style is unique; so, you might tell your lively story in a separate page as a different viewpoint at this famous circuit.

I was surprised to see a transistor with 4 resistors, when the simplest transistorised current source is a tr with one resistor from Vcc to base. Maybe a rename is in order?

[[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 13:29, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

== Lab 4: Op-amp circuits with positive feedback ==

=== What negative feedback is ===

[[Image:Nfb_block-diagram.jpg|left|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;The simplest negative feedback follower.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Non-inverting_amplifier_65a_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A non-inverting amplifier is a typical negative feedback circuit.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The idea of the negative feedback is to manage to keep the balance. The circuit with negative feedback actually takes the role of ''active regulating element'' – never mind what the resistance is it keeps this balance (what do you mean here? [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 17:09, 27 April 2008 (UTC)). All that an op-amp tries to do is simply to act as a real thinking human being.

Look at the picture. The difference ∆V between the input voltage Vin and the output voltage Vout is applied to the op-amp differential input. The thing is that the op-amp tries to keep ∆V very close to 0 volts so that the op-amp compensates the difference. However it cannot be more than the voltage on the amplifier itself (what do you mean here? [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 17:09, 27 April 2008 (UTC)). Hote that the op-amp does not take energy from the input voltage source to supply the load; instead, it uses its own power supply. The input currents are very low (nano- and pico-ampers); so, we can say they are voltage inputs.

The negative feedback follower just repeats the input value, no matter what the obstacles are. In this way, it acts as a real human being. [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Converting a negative into a positive feedback circuit ===

==== General idea ====

What happens, if we make a mistake when apply a feedback from the output to the input of the subtractor and, as a result, it becomes a summer? In life this means to fool someone to do things in the wrong direction (for example, to do something bad instead to do something useful and v.v.). He/she &quot;thinks&quot; that he/she reacts in a proper way but actually he/she does exactly the opposite!

We can reproduce this situation in electronics, if we swap (usually, involuntarily) the op-amp's inputs. As a result, the op-amp is &quot;disoriented&quot;; like human beings, it &quot;thinks&quot; that it reacts in a proper way but actually it does exactly the opposite.

In this way, we can introduce the great idea of the positive feedback. It is extremely useful (for example, all the flip-flop RAMs are based on this powerful idea). [[User:PavlinPanev 64|PavlinPanev 64]]

==== Converting a non-inverting amplifier into an inverting comparator with hysteresis ====

Similarly, what happens, if we make a mistake when build a non-inverting amplifier swapping the inverting and non-inverting inputs? Let's try.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== How to investigate the circuit ====

This means that all the source code snippets appear in the PDF as large blank areas. I have only tried a few free programs, nothing professional yet.

== Warning ==
[While pretty excellent up until that point -- especially as a hands-on example of real-world UV-unwrapping -- this tutorial cuts off midway, possibly merely a sixth of the way through the entire process.]


== Overview ==

This tutorial will teach you how to effectively utilize textures and materials in Blender to create realistic eyes for characters. This tutorial was inspired by a great Maya tutorial in the Gnomon Workshop series by Alex Alvarez. My goal with this tutorial is to teach you how to get those same stunning results using Blender. Please check out Alex's tutorial as well, as it is very informative and covers more detail than I will be covering here. This tutorial assumes you know your way around the Blender interface and so I will not explain each key command as I go, but will instruct you in what steps to take and point out details such as key commands only when it seems relevant to do so. In addition, you will need some sort of image manipulation software, as this tutorial relies heavily on image-based textures, which we will be preparing outside of Blender. I will be using Photoshop, but feel free to use GIMP or whatever you're comfortable with. 



Above is an example of what can be achieved using the techniques described in this tutorial. 

OK, let's dig in...

----

== Reference Material ==

Let's Take a moment to familiarize ourselves with the anatomy of the human eye. Do a Google image search and examine whichever diagram is to your liking. Now, you don't have to pay attention to every single feature, but do take note of the '''cornea''', the '''iris''', the '''pupil''', and the '''sclera'''. These are the only parts that are visible to us when we look at a person's eyes, and therefore the only parts we will actually need to create. Many of the diagrams you find out there will be disproportionate, and so in order to know how large to make our features in relation to one another, it is best to view a large number of diagrams, a large number of eye photos, and also photos of plastic models of the eye, as plastic models tend to be truer to scale than 2D drawings. I also found a photo of a guy popping his eyes half-way out of his head. All of these together gave me a good feel for what the appropriate proportions are for a human eyeball. To some extent though, cornea size and sclera shape will vary on a person-to-person basis, so there is no precisely correct size, per se.

----

== Building The Eye ==

Creating a UV sphere. 24 segments, 24 rings, and a radius of 1 is recommended. The top of the UV sphere will become the cornea of the eye. So now let's go into '''side view''', in the '''orthographic''' view, and with the topmost vertex selected and '''proportional falloff''' enabled, '''grab''' and raise this vertex along the '''Z axis'''. Don't click to finalize the edit just yet - first we will use the '''mouse wheel''' to control how much falloff is going to be applied. This process can require some finess and multiple adjustments until the bump of the cornea is anatomically correct. You will want to set the falloff shape to &quot;'''sphere'''&quot;.

[[Image:Falloff Edit.jpg]]

Below is a render of the curve I ended up going with. You can use it as a guide when modeling if it helps you. ''This is with a SubSurf of 3 applied'', so keep that in mind.

[[Image:Cornea Curve.jpg]]

Now, some people may prefer to use a NURBS sphere for the geometry of their eyeball. If you are comfortable with NURBS modeling, and texturing NURBS models, go right ahead. It will give you a smoother and more rounded eyeball. I prefer not to complicate things with NURBS when polys will do just fine, and am guessing most of you feel the same, so I'm sticking with polys. This does however bring us to the topic of the SubSurface modifier and how it will affect your eyeball. When SubSurf is applied to a UV sphere such as our own, it causes the previously spherical shape to become slightly oblong. In other words, the eye will become nearsighted. This is barely noticeable, but it does happen, as a result of the way SubSurfing affects a UV sphere. You could create a UV sphere with more rings to ease this if it bothers you. It looks fine for our purposes though, to be honest. See the comparison in the animated GIF below. 

[[Image:UV SubSurf.gif]]

There is one last issue to address with regard to using a polygon-based eyeball. That is the small triangles that persist on the poles of the eyeball. These stubborn tris will remain and you will find that they result in an ugly and unnatural pinched effect when a specular highlight appears over the center of the cornea. Adding a SubSurface modifier will not make them go away. This didn't become apparent until after I did some texturing work and test renders, but I want to point it out to you now, before we get into all that. (See examples below)

[[Image:Cornea Triangles.jpg]]

This can be remedied by adding more rings where those edges come together. Select only the edges in the very center of the cornea and '''Subdivide Smooth'''. Now '''deselect''' and again '''select''' the new innermost edges. '''Subdivide Smooth''' again. You can even do this a third time if you find it necessary. Rotate the model around in the viewport and do a couple of test renders to make sure the specular highlight doesn't reveal any artifacts.

[[Image:SubDivide Smooth.jpg]]

Now repeat this process at the opposite pole of the eye (the optic nerve area).

We are now ready to begin texturing the eyeball.

----

== UV Mapping ==

In '''Edit Mode''', we will define the seams for our eye. Select the edges you want to mark as seams and type '''Ctrl E''', then choose '''Mark Seam''' from the menu. 

[[Image:UV Seams.jpg]]

With all of your mesh selected, type '''U''' to unwrap. We can now see our unwrapped UV layout in the '''UV/Image Editor''' window. (For older versions of Blender, you might need to select '''UV Face Select''' mode to unwrap, but it's better if you download the latest.)

[[Image:UV Unwrap.jpg]]

Those two islands we see are the cornea and optic nerve area. We can move them out of our way by selecting any vertex on them and typing '''L''' to select all linked vertices. Then '''G''' to grab as usual. 

[[Image:UV Layout Edit A.jpg]]

Select a column of verts on the sclera region of our UV layout. Type '''W''' to bring up the '''Weld/Align''' menu. Choose '''Align X'''. This is how we will go about straightening this contorted shape into a usable guide to map our textures.

[[Image:UV Layout Edit B.jpg]]

'''Grab''' and move your straightened column of verts over to the left. 

Constraining to the X axis, by typing the &quot;'''X'''&quot; key after you grab, is a good habit to get into while straightening these out. 

[[Image:UV Untangling.jpg]]

Straightening out all of these vertices into a usable grid shape will take you some time. It's one of the more tedious steps of this tutorial, but it's worth it in the end because having a rectangular grid will prove very helpful when we are texturing our eyeball. You'll want to use Blender's grid as a reference and just align the rows and columns to it exactly. Well, you can't get it ''exactly'' aligned, since there is no snap-to-grid feature, but you can eyeball it and everything will work out fine. The grid lines must be perfectly straight though, so always constrain to either the X or Y axis when moving anything. You can scale the whole thing up later, once each row and column is evenly spaced. Be sure to leave some space between your UV layout and the border of the layout area - don't &quot;bleed&quot; it to the edge or you will have texturing problems later. 

[EDIT by nick_chang207]: You can align them perfectly; all you have to do is select all the rows and coloumns one by one, (you can use Alt + R) and then select the axis along which you want them to be aligned. For example, select the top column and then press 'S' to scale, then 'Y' to align it to the Y axis, and then '0' to align them. For the rows, do the same thing, only select the 'X' axis instead of the 'Y' axis this time. Its pretty easy this way.

[Edit by redset] If it's not clear, you can actually untangle this way too - simply Alt+RMB to select a row of edges, S Y 0 and Return (or left-click) to align them all, then G Y to move them up to a grid line. Repeat this for each row of edges, then work across the columns using the X key to align your scaling and movement to the X axis instead. You'll end up with a nice neat grid, and if you aligned them to gridlines you can just scale the entire island up to fill as much space as you need.

It's important to pay attention to which way the UV layout is facing. Chances are the top of the sclera region is actually what you will want to be the bottom. It doesn't technically matter which way it's facing, but you will probably want it to look intuitive when you are painting the textures. I had to rotate that piece 180 degrees to get the cornea pole on top and the optic nerve pole on the bottom.

[Edit by redset] Mine actually seemed to be the right way up - I found you could check by going to the 3D view (or having split windows so you can see the 3D and UV views at the same time) and making sure every vertex is selected, then holding shift and clicking to deselect a vertex on the model, close to the optic nerve or the cornea. Back in the UV view the vertex will disappear from your UV map, so you can work out how the map corresponds to the actual mesh surface. There might be an easier way to check but I'm new to this myself! (Just select all again to get the whole map back)

Once you're done, '''save your .blend file''' and then '''save your UV Face Layout'''. This is done in the '''Scripts Window: Scripts &gt; UV &gt; Save UV Face Layout'''. The &quot;UV Image Export&quot; dialog box will appear. I recommend choosing a size of '''2048''' pixels. 

[[Image:Save UV Face Layout.jpg]]

== Preparing A Template For Texturing ==

Now launch your image editor and open the UV face layout you just saved. (You probably saved it as a .tga file, since that is Blender's default format for UV layouts) So we are now looking at a black and white UV grid. We want to get rid of the white regions so we can see through them to the layers below. The quickest way to do this is to set the blending mode to &quot;multiply&quot;. If that works for you, go for it. Personally, I like my transparency to be represented by the checkered pattern, and for that we will need true alpha transparency. In Photoshop this can be done by going to the menu and choosing '''Select &gt; Color Range'''. Using the eyedropper, '''click any white part''' of the image, '''set Fuzziness to zero''', and '''click &quot;OK&quot;'''. 

[[Image:Select Color Range.jpg]]

Now '''delete the selected white regions''' by choosing '''Edit &gt; Clear''' from the menu.

''nooby note: The same actions can be done in the GIMP editor by going to menu, choose '''Select &gt; By Color''' and click any white part to select the white area. Then go to menu again and choose '''Colors &gt; Color to Alpha''' and '''click &quot;OK&quot;'''.''

''another nooby note: In PhotoShop you can also modify the layer's blending options so that areas of white or black will become transparent:''
''When you first open the image in photoshop it will be a single layer image, and the layer name will be 'background' - '''Double click''' it and '''give it a name like &quot;UV-Grid&quot;'''. THEN '''select the &quot;UV-Grid&quot; layer''', '''Right-Click''' -&gt; '''&quot;Blending Options&quot;''', in the bottom area of the dialog set the top value for the slider on &quot;'''Blend If -&gt; This Layer'''&quot; setting on grey to be a little lower (most likely 254). This means any values on &quot;this layer&quot; that are greater than 254 will be blended with the underlying layers. - Make sure you create your other layers BELOW this layer so the grid will always be on top.''

One other element that will be useful to have in our template is a layer of markers that denote where the equator of the eye is, because what looks like the middle on the UV layout is not actually the middle. To find the middle, go back into Blender and count the rings of your eye mesh, starting at the seam of the cornea. Once you get to the equator, take note of how many rings it took to get there. Go back to your image editor and mark that area. You can mark it with a guide, or mark it with a coloring of some sort - as long as it's clear to you that it indicates the equator of the eye mesh. It may also be useful to mark the point where the transparency of the cornea should begin. 

[[Image:Marking The Middle.jpg]]

== First Bump Map - The Sclera ==

'''Create a material''' for your eyeball. Then within that material '''create a texture'''. Name this texture something like &quot;''BumpMap(Procedural)''&quot;. Set the texture type to '''clouds'''. A noise size of '''0.25''' with a noise depth of '''2 or 3''' is fine, and you can experiment with other values if you like. The other texture settings can be left at their defaults.

Now we are going to bake this procedural texture to get an image-based UV texture that we can edit in our paint program. Why? Because there is not an even level of bumpiness around the eyeball. The sclera has bumps, while the cornea doesn't. If your cornea was bumpy, your vision would be distorted. We want our 3D eyeball to accurately convey this subtle difference when light is reflected from the surface.

Before baking the texture, there are some parameters we must specify. In the materials panel click the '''Map To''' tab. The Color button is depressed by default, so you can leave it as is. Make sure this is the only depressed button. Then '''change the color to black'''. 

[[Image:Texture Bake MapTo.jpg]]

Now go to the '''Material''' tab. Change the diffuse color to '''white''' and click the '''Shadeless''' button. 

Note: In this particular case it doesn't actually matter which of these colors is set to white and which is set to black. The end result is basically the same, and you can always invert the image later. 

[[Image:Texture Bake Material.jpg]]

Check the Material Preview window to make sure it looks right. 

[[Image:Texture Bake Preview.jpg]]

Time to bake your eye. Make sure your eyeball object is selected and go into '''UV Face Select Mode'''. Then '''split your screen''' and set one viewport to the '''UV/Image Editor'''. From the menu at the bottom of the UV/Image Editor, choose '''Image &gt; New'''. Enter a name like &quot;''ScleraBumpBake''&quot; and set both the Width and Height to '''2048''' (to match your UV guide). Click &quot;OK&quot; and a new all-black image will appear behind the UV grid. 

[[Image:Blender new image.jpg]]

Go to '''Scene panel &gt; Render &gt; Bake tab''' and click the '''Textures''' button. Then set the margin to '''10''' and click the '''BAKE''' button. You will see the black image in the '''UV/Image Editor''' fill in with your bump texture. From the menu choose '''Image &gt; Save As'''. 

[[Image:Bake And Save.jpg]]

Now would also be a good time to '''save your .blend file'''.

... Looking at a problem in a different way can sometimes lead to new  
ideas.  Just to give a simple example (Fig. 1), consider the attenuator  
(Figure a) and the well-known non-inverting amplifier (Figures b and  
c) shown in the pdf attachment.

The equation (4-1) for the attenuator shows that the input voltage V1  
is attenuated to V2 depending on the values of the two resistors.   
Equation 4-1 can be solved for V1 as in Equation 4-2, where V1 is  
great than V2, so that amplification has occurred.  Of course this  
can’t happen with two resistors because it would involve the creation  
of energy.  However, if the required energy is supplied from an  
external source, such as an operational amplifier (resulting in a  
conventional non-inverting amplifier as in Figure b, more usually  
drawn as in Figure c) the equation can be satisfied.

I often manipulated circuits in this way, drawing a “box” with the  
input and output I required and then figuring out what I needed to do  
to get the desired result.  This may seem obvious, but the idea was  
think about supplying energy to an attenuator to make it an amplifier  
after rearranging the equation told me what was needed.  This type of  
thinking can enable one to create...

Subject: How to reverse circuit ports by applying negative feedback (Re: Re: Deboo integrator)


Dear Gordon,


Reading your last email, I was deeply struk by your idea of how to transmute a voltage divider into a non-inverting amplifier. Will you believe me that for the first time I consider a valuable circuit idea with someone? Today's people do not like to think about fundamental ideas and principles. Every time when I tried to discuss some basic circuit idea I run upon the rocks...

[[Image:Reversed_divider_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2. A &quot;reversed&quot; voltage divider.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Surprise.''' Imagine my amazement when I was reading your excellent explanations (I suppose that the scanned page is from your book) because the same great idea conceived in my mind in the early 1990s! Then I was writing down (regrettably, in Bulgarian) all the ideas arising in my mind on squared sheets of A5 paper. I have scanned especially for you the yellowed record that I made on May 14, 1992 at my home (I was writing the circumstances surrounding the recorded idea on the top of the sheet; now, I continue doing the same). 

'''&quot;Reversed&quot; voltage divider.''' This is the title of the record, which is eloquent; the drawing too. As you can see, I have drawn (likewise you on Fig. b) the circuit with an unusual shape to show the basic idea in the best way; also, I have colored the added op-amp in a different blue color. The idea is the same: to make the passive voltage divider work conversely we supply it by an additional (properly supplied) op-amp that observes the difference between the divider's output voltage and the actual input voltage. As a result, the op-amp adjusts its output voltage Vout so that an R2/(R1 + R2) part of it to be equal to the input voltage Vin. Thus, the old output voltage VR2 is always equal to the new input voltage Vin; the old divider's input voltage serves as a new output voltage Vout = (R1 + R2)/R2.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Non-inv_lever_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3. A lever &quot;divider&quot;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Mechanical analogy.''' On another sheet, I have described a lever analogy of a non-inverting amplifier that exploits the same powerful idea. A man is looking continuously at point A (the output of the &quot;lever divider&quot;) and is comparing its height Hin' with the input height Hin. If there is a difference between them, the man moves the end of the lever (the point B) to make Hin' = Hin. As a result, Hout/Hin = (l1 + l2)/l1. By the way, this second-class lever analogy is more truthful than the third-class lever analogy of non-inverting amplifier presented by Tony Kuphald in his [http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/electricCircuits/Semi/SEMI_8.html#xtocid156014 Lessons in Electric Circuits].

'''Human analogies.''' Thinking about the essence of this phenomenon, I began discerning similar manifestations in many everyday situations (some of them -quite funny:)&lt;br&gt;
'''''Secretary &gt; boss.''''' Imagine a male chief that has a beautiful female secretary (or v.v.:); so, he indulges the pretty woman satisfying all her wishes. As a result, the boss thinks that he manages the secretary but, actually, the secretary leads the chief by the nose:)&lt;br&gt;
'''''Wife &gt; husband.''''' Similarly, husbands that indulge their wives think that they manage their wives; actually, wives manage their husbands:) Generally speaking, women lead men by the nose in this world:)&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:My cat Futie.jpg|right|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4. My cat Futie leads me by the nose:(&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''''Cat &gt; owner.''''' I am also a victim of this phenomenon. I think that I manage my (female) cat Futie; but giving a portion of food to &quot;her&quot; every time when &quot;she&quot; says &quot;miaou&quot; actually, the cat leads me by the nose:(

'''Generalization.''' Finally, I made a general conclusion that systems with negative feedback have the unique property to reverse the cause and effect relations between the input and output quantities of the objects. In this way, they can &quot;reverse&quot; the objects. Imagine a block diagram where a converter implementing a function y = f(x) is connected in the feedback loop; as a result, the whole nfb system will implement the reverse function Y = F(X), where Y = x, X = y and F = 1/f. 

'''Applications.''' For our purposes in electronics, we can use this technique to swap the converter's ports (especially of the one-way devices) by connecting them into the feedback loop. From this viewpoint, an [[w:Voltage-to-current converter#Keeping a constant current by applying a negative feedback|active voltage-to-current converter]] is actually a reversed [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter|passive current-to-voltage converter]], an op-amp non-inverting amplifier is a reversed voltage divider (your idea), an op-amp integrator is a reversed differentiator and v.v., an op-amp logarithmic converter is a reversed antilogarithmic converter and v.v., an analog-to-digital converter is a reversed digital-to-analog converter, etc. Another very interesting example is a transdiode that is actually a transistor connected in the op-amp feedback loop; in this odd and never explained circuit configuration, the collector current is the input quantity (?!?) while the base-emitter voltage is the output quantity (?!?) Maybe, the same trick is used in the input part of a current mirror - the active diode, which is actually a transistor with parallel negative feedback (again, although it seems strange, the collector current serves as an input quantity while the base-emitter voltage serves as an output quantity)...

'''Popularization.''' Gordon, I am sure you will say &quot;Oh&quot; when you see the picture below (Fig. 5):) Here is the story about it.

[[Image:ShortPaper22_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5. A story about reversing the causality by applying negative feedback.&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the end of 1990s, I prepared a series of 22 short 1-page articles under the title ''How to invent circuits''. I designed them for ''Popular electronics'' (later ''Poptronics'') magazine. Only, ''Poptronics'' ceased and I refused all the print undertaking and moved to the web. A few years later I put all the ready stories into a pdf file. As you can see, the story on the page 14 (with a title ''Compensating by injecting a current'') is dedicated to your great integrator. The last story (''Let's reverse causality!''), which is not completed, is dedicated to the present idea. See the picture on the right - it is exactly as your picture! Is it not amazing that the same idea and the same picture can conceive in different minds? Below the left figure is written in red &quot;a normal divider&quot;; above the right figure is written &quot;a reversed divider&quot;.

In the beginning of 2000s I began creating [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com circuit-fantasia.com]. Then I included this basic idea in a hierarchical circuit idea [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/menus/old-menus/modified-circuits.html classification] (time was when I was thinking that this collection was my supreme achievement but others were not thinking as me; so, I did not obtain the recognition that I had expected). Later, I used this technique (likewise you) as a possible way to &quot;invent&quot; the non-inverting amplifier. By the way, another possible way of &quot;inventing&quot; is to &quot;disturb&quot; an op-amp voltage follower by putting an attenuation R2/(R1 + R2) into the feedback loop. As a result, it &quot;reacts&quot; to this intervention by (R1 + R2)/R2 amplification (see [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/current-ske-8.htm Class Exercise 8: Op-amp Amplifiers with Negative Feedback]). I have named this great principle &quot;attenuation causes amplification&quot;. Actually, it represents the main property of negative feedback systems to compensate disturbances).

'''Circuit idea.''' I have reserved a special place for this &quot;reversing causality&quot; phenomenon in the contents of [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] (see the section about negative feedback). I imagine that this part has to contain an introductory &quot;philosophical&quot; story and a series of specific stories dedicated to various circuits based on this idea. I would like to include in some way your materials in these stories. There are a lot of possibilities to do that.

For example, you can develop a story about &quot;inventing&quot; a non-inverting amplifier based on your idea exposed on the scanned text. It may consist of a text based on the image or a few paragraphs and the very scanned image included. If you do not want to do that, I might cite your text and include the original image into the story. Or, I can share with readers in the discussion page how I thought that... but ...

Gordon, believe me, your way of thinking in this material is even more valuable than the same idea. Thinking in this way, young people can invent new circuits. But yet, have you reveal this great idea? Have you written this text (I mean the scan)? Is this published and where? Can I place a link pointing to the source where it is published? It is extremely useful for [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]], if you send me more clever circuit ideas...

Sets the foreground color or background color for the current output window. Each of the three color components can range from 0 (darkest) to 65535 (lightest), and they combine to make any conceivable shade. If you set &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;foregroundFlag&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;_zTrue&lt;/code&gt;, or omit the parameter, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LONG COLOR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sets the foreground color.

When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LONG COLOR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; switches to the Graphics Window before executing; you can't use it to change the color in the Text Window nor on the printer. To change the color of printed output while running FB Lite, use the Toolbox procedure RGBFORECOLOR.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LONG COLOR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not immediately change the appearance of the window. If you set the foreground color, the new color will appear the next time you draw text or a QuickDraw shape (it won't affect the color of anything that's already drawn). If you set the background color, the new color will appear the next time you erase all or part of the window (for example, with the &lt;code&gt;CLS&lt;/code&gt; statement).

You can use the Toolbox procedures GetForeColor and GetBackColor to find out the current foreground or background color for the current window.

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;naturalLog#&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;LOG&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
Returns the natural logarithm of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The natural logarithm uses the transcendental number &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; as its base. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOG&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; always returns a double-precision result.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOG&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the inverse of the &lt;code&gt;EXP&lt;/code&gt; function. That is: &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOG&lt;/b&gt;(EXP(x))&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
To find the logarithm of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for an arbitrary base &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, use this formula:

&lt;code&gt;theLog# = &lt;b&gt;LOG&lt;/b&gt;(expr)/&lt;b&gt;LOG&lt;/b&gt;(n)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the ID number of an open file, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns the total number of records in the file. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;_modemPort&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_printerPort&lt;/code&gt; (and the specified device is open), &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns the total number of records currently in the device's input buffer. If there is a &amp;quot;partial&amp;quot; record at the end of the file (or input buffer), it is included in the count.

The returned record count is based on the record length given in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;recordLength&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, if it's specified. If this parameter is omitted, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; uses the record length that was specified in the &lt;code&gt;OPEN&lt;/code&gt; statement when the file or the port was opened. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;recordLength&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is omitted and no record length was specified in the &lt;code&gt;OPEN&lt;/code&gt; statement, a default record length of 256 is used.

To determine the total number of bytes in the file or in the serial input buffer, use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOF&lt;/b&gt;(deviceID,1)&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== LOCAL FN == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;['''CLEAR'''] '''LOCAL FN''' ''functionName'' [(''arg1'' [,''arg2'' ...])]
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[''statementBlock'']
END FN [= ''expr'']&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement marks the beginning of an FB local function. The end of the local function is marked by the &lt;code&gt;END FN&lt;/code&gt; statement. A local function is a named collection of statements which can be accessed and executed as a unit by referring to the function's name (see the &lt;code&gt;FN &amp;lt;userFunction&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement). All variables and arrays referenced in a local function (except those explicitly declared as &quot;global&quot;) are local to the function, which means they do not have any influence outside of the function; any identically-named variables which appear outside of the function are actually different variables, and occupy a different place in memory, than the function's local variables. (An exception to this rule occurs when an array is listed as one of the function's formal parameters; see more about this below.) When your program &quot;calls&quot; (executes) a local function, you can pass data into the function by means of its parameter list (also called its argument list), and you can receive a value back from the function by means of its return value. Local functions allow you to encapsulate complex programming tasks; they're a fundamental and extremely powerful programming construct.

In addition to marking the beginning of the function, the &lt;code&gt;'''LOCAL FN'''&lt;/code&gt; statement also declares the function's name, the data type of its return value (if any), and the number and types of its input parameters (if any). A local function can be placed anywhere in the program, except inside another local function; you should also not place a local function inside a &quot;block&quot; structure such as &lt;code&gt;LONG IF...END IF&lt;/code&gt;, etc. The statements in &lt;code&gt;''statementBlock''&lt;/code&gt; can contain anything except the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;A &lt;code&gt;LOCAL&lt;/code&gt; statement;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;An &lt;code&gt;ENTERPROC...EXITPROC&lt;/code&gt; block;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Another local function.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding the &lt;code&gt;'''CLEAR'''&lt;/code&gt; keyword causes all of the function's local variables and arrays (except the parameter variables &lt;code&gt;''arg1''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;''arg2''&lt;/code&gt; etc.) to be initialized to zeros, null strings or empty records, each time the function is called. Otherwise, the local variables and arrays will have unpredictable initial values. (You can accomplish the same effect by using the &lt;code&gt;LOCAL &lt;/code&gt;statement with the &lt;code&gt;CLEAR &lt;/code&gt;keyword; see the &lt;code&gt;LOCAL &lt;/code&gt;statement for more information.)&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;functionName&lt;/code&gt; must be unique; that is, it must be different from the name used in any other &lt;code&gt;'''LOCAL FN'''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ENTERPROC FN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LONG FN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DEF FN USING&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DEF FN &amp;lt;expr&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;statement anywhere else in the program. If the function is to return a value, then you should specify the data type of the return value by including an appropriate type-identifier suffix at the end of &lt;code&gt;functionName&lt;/code&gt;. For example, a local function which is to return a string value might be declared as follows:

&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''LOCAL FN''' FullName$(idNum&amp;amp;)&lt;/code&gt;

The default data type of a function's return value is &quot;long integer&quot;; if the function is to return a long integer value, you can either include the &quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; type-identifier suffix or omit it. No type-identifier suffix should be appended to &lt;code&gt;functionName&lt;/code&gt; if the function does not return a value.

In order to execute the statements in &lt;code&gt;statementBlock&lt;/code&gt;, your program must &quot;call&quot; the function using the &lt;code&gt;FN &amp;lt;userFunction&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;statement. The &lt;code&gt;FN &amp;lt;userFunction&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;statement can appear anywhere in your program, as long as the function it calls is either defined (using the &lt;code&gt;'''LOCAL FN'''&lt;/code&gt; statement) or prototyped (using the &lt;code&gt;DEF FN &amp;lt;prototype&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement) somewhere above the &lt;code&gt;FN &amp;lt;userFunction&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement. This restriction is required in order to allow your program to compile; however, the actual order of execution of your program's statements is not affected by where you place your &lt;code&gt;'''LOCAL FN'''&lt;/code&gt;'s.

'''Function Parameters'''
Each of the parameters &lt;code&gt;''arg1''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;''arg2''&lt;/code&gt; etc. can have any of the following forms:



The parameters in the &lt;code&gt;'''LOCAL FN'''&lt;/code&gt; statement are called the function's &quot;formal arguments.&quot; They must not be global variables. You should not declare the formal argument variables in a &lt;code&gt;DIM&lt;/code&gt; statement; they are implicitly declared by the &lt;code&gt;'''LOCAL FN'''&lt;/code&gt; statement.

When your program calls the function, the arguments passed to it in the &lt;code&gt;FN &amp;lt;userFunction&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement are called the &quot;actual arguments.&quot; They must match the function's formal arguments in number, and they must be of &quot;compatible types&quot; (see &lt;code&gt;FN &amp;lt;userFunction&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for more information). Each time the function is called, values are assigned to its formal arguments as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If the formal argument is a simpleVar, the value of the actual argument is copied into simpleVar.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If the formal argument is of the form &lt;code&gt;ptrVar AS POINTER [TO someType]&lt;/code&gt;, then the actual argument should be either a record variable or a long-integer expression. In the first case, the record's address is copied into ptrVar; in the second case, the long integer's value is copied into &lt;code&gt;ptrVar&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If the formal argument is of the form &lt;code&gt;@longVar&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;@ptrVar AS POINTER [TO someType]&lt;/code&gt;, then the actual argument must either be a variable (possibly a record variable), or a long integer expression preceded by &quot;=&quot;. In the first case, the variable's address is copied into &lt;code&gt;longVar&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ptrVar&lt;/code&gt;. In the second case, the value of the long integer expression is copied into &lt;code&gt;longVar&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ptrVar&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If the formal argument is &lt;code&gt;array(dim1 [,dim2 ...])&lt;/code&gt;, then the actual argument must be the base element of an array of the same type, which has the same number of dimensions. The base element is the element in which all subscripts are set to zero. The entire array is then accessible to the local function, and (important!) any changes made to the array's elements within the function will persist after the function exits.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the local function has no parameters, you should omit the parentheses after &lt;code&gt;functionName&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.

'''Passing an Array of Unknown Size'''
Sometimes it's useful to write a local function which operates on an array passed in its parameter list, without knowing in advance the size of the passed array. For example, suppose you wish to write a function which sorts the elements of a long integer array, and you want it to work regardless of the declared size of the passed array.

When you declare an array as a formal parameter, FB ignores the value of the array's first declared dimension in the &lt;code&gt;'''LOCAL FN'''&lt;/code&gt; statement. For example, suppose we have a function defined like this:

&lt;code&gt;'''LOCAL FN''' '''SetElements'''(anArray&amp;amp;(1,7), max&amp;amp;)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'Set each element to 1492 in the array:
'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;FOR''' i&amp;amp; = 0 '''TO''' max&amp;amp;
'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;FOR''' j = 0 '''TO''' 7
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;anArray&amp;amp;(i&amp;amp;,j) = 1492
'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;NEXT'''
'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;NEXT'''
'''END FN'''&lt;/code&gt;

When we pass a long integer array to &lt;code&gt;FN SetElements&lt;/code&gt;, the passed array can have any size as its first declared dimension, as long as it has a second dimension declared as 7. For example:

&lt;code&gt;'''DIM''' arrayOne&amp;amp;(1250,7), arrayTwo&amp;amp;(465,7)
'''FN SetElements'''(arrayOne&amp;amp;(0,0), 1250)
'''FN SetElements'''(arrayTwo&amp;amp;(0,0), 465)&lt;/code&gt;

Within the function, we can safely manipulate elements in the array as long as the subscripts we use don't exceed the declared dimensions of the actual array that was passed. Thus, in &lt;code&gt;FN SetElements&lt;/code&gt;, we can set the first subscript in &lt;code&gt;anArray&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; to values much greater than 1, even though&lt;code&gt; anArray&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; was &quot;declared&quot; with dimensions (1,7).

Note: you do not have equal freedom with the second, third, etc. dimensions of the parameter array. If the array is multi-dimensional, the second and subsequent dimensions must be declared with the same values in both the &quot;formal&quot; array parameter (in the &lt;code&gt;'''LOCAL FN'''&lt;/code&gt; statement) and the external &lt;code&gt;DIM&lt;/code&gt; statement that declares the actual passed array.

'''Returning a Value'''
If you specify an &lt;code&gt;''expr''&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;'''END FN'''&lt;/code&gt; statement, the function will &quot;return&quot; the value of &lt;code&gt;''expr''&lt;/code&gt;. This can be any expression which is compatible with the type-identifier suffix (if any) that appears in &lt;code&gt;functionName&lt;/code&gt;. When your function &quot;returns&quot; a value, it means that you can reference the function (using &lt;code&gt;FN &amp;lt;userFunction&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) as part of a string or numeric expression, and the function's return value will be substituted in the expression. For example:

&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;maxPuppets = 6 * '''FN''' storeCount%(x)&lt;/code&gt;

Here, if &lt;code&gt;FN storeCount%(x)&lt;/code&gt; returns a value of 7, then the value 42 will be assigned to &lt;code&gt;maxPuppets&lt;/code&gt;.

'''The Lifespan of Local Variables'''
The memory space for a function's local variables is reserved when the function is called. This memory is released after the &lt;code&gt;'''END FN'''&lt;/code&gt; statement is executed. Therefore, you should never make reference to a local variable's address after the function has finished executing; in particular, you should never pass a local variable's address back to the routine that called the function. For example:

&lt;code&gt;'DON'T DO THIS!
'''LOCAL FN''' myFunction&amp;amp;(x,y,z)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''DIM''' r#
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;r# = '''SQR'''(x*x + y*y + z*z)
'''END FN''' = @r#&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;rAddr&amp;amp; = '''FN''' myFunction&amp;amp;(x,y,z)&lt;/code&gt;

After the preceding is executed, &lt;code&gt;rAddr&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; points to an area of memory (the old address of &lt;code&gt;r#&lt;/code&gt;) which is no longer reserved, and which should not be used.

On the other hand, it is permissible to pass a local variable's address into another local function. This works because the first local function has not yet finished executing when it calls the second local function. Therefore, the memory space holding the first function's local variables is still reserved intact while the second function executes.

&lt;code&gt;'THIS IS OKAY:
'''LOCAL FN''' FirstFn
'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM''' 255 myString$
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'Pass address of local var into another FN:
'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;FN''' SecondFN(@myString$)
'''END FN'''
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;:
'''LOCAL FN''' SecondFn(strAddr&amp;amp;)
'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;BLOCKMOVE''' @gString$, strAddr&amp;amp;, '''LEN'''(gString$)+1
'''END FN'''&lt;/code&gt;

'''Recursive functions'''
You can have several functions executing simultaneously, in the sense that one function can call a second function, which can call a third, and so on. If you design your function calls in such a way that a function can call a function that is already executing, then you have a &quot;recursive function.&quot; The most obvious (but not the only) example of a recursive function is any function which calls itself. When that happens, we say that two (or more) &quot;instances&quot; of the function are executing simultaneously.

In FB, every currently executing &quot;instance&quot; of a local function maintains its own private set of local variables, and they don't interfere with the local variables of any other executing instance of that function. Calling a function recursively is very much like calling a &quot;different&quot; function which just happens to contain exactly the same program lines.

Although recursive functions may at first seem like a bizarre concept, they are perfectly acceptable, and often very useful. For example, here is a short program which prints all the permutations of the characters contained in a given input string; note that &lt;code&gt;FNpermute_r &lt;/code&gt;calls itself. It would be very difficult to write such a program without using recursive functions.

&lt;code&gt;'Function prototypes:
'''DEF FN''' Permute(aString$)
'''DEF FN''' permute_r(prefix$, suffix$)&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;'''INPUT''' &quot;Enter a word: &quot;; theWord$
'''FN''' Permute(theWord$)
'''END'''&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;'''LOCAL FN''' Permute(aString$)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'Prints all permutations of the letters in aString$
'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;FN''' permute_r(&quot;&quot;, aString$)
'''END FN'''&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;'''LOCAL FN''' permute_r(prefix$, suffix$)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'Prints all permutations of prefix$+suffix$
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'that start with prefix$
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''LONG IF''' suffix$ = &quot;&quot;
'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PRINT''' prefix$
'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;XELSE'''
'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;FOR''' i = 1 to '''LEN'''(suffix$)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'Move the i-th letter of suffix$ over to newprefix$:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;newprefix$ = prefix$ + '''MID$'''(suffix$, i, 1)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;newsuffix$ = '''LEFT$'''(suffix$,i-1) + '''MID$'''(suffix$,i+1)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'Now print all permutations that
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'start with newprefix$
'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;FN''' permute_r(newprefix$, newsuffix$)
'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;NEXT'''
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''END IF'''
'''END FN'''&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Returning Multiple Values
&lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;code&gt;END FN&lt;/code&gt; statement can return only a single numeric or string expression. But many times, it's useful to have a local function which can return more than one value. The way to accomplish this is through the function's parameter list. If you give the function access to the address of some external variable or array, then the function can alter the contents at that address, effectively modifying the value of that variable or array.

There are three ways to pass an address to your function:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If you pass an entire array (using the &lt;code&gt;array(dim1 [,dim2 ...]&lt;/code&gt;) syntax in the formal parameter list), then your function implicitly has access to the address of the passed array. Any changes you make to the array's elements inside your function are actually made to the external array, so the changes persist after the function exits.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If you use the &lt;code&gt;@var&lt;/code&gt; syntax in the function's formal parameter list, and specify a variable when you call the function, then the variable's address is copied into var. Your function can then modify the contents at that address.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;You can explicitly pass any address into a long integer or &lt;code&gt;POINTER&lt;/code&gt; formal parameter.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'''Example:'''
&lt;code&gt; CD Example: LOCALFN.BAS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== LOCAL == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;[&lt;b&gt;CLEAR&lt;/b&gt;] &lt;b&gt;LOCAL&lt;/b&gt; [&lt;b&gt;MODE&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement is an alternative way to indicate the beginning of the scope of a local function. If used, it must appear somewhere above the &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt; statement. All non-global variables which are declared between the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement and the &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt; statement have a scope local to the function. Adding the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLEAR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MODE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;keywords has the following additional effects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLEAR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; keyword causes all of the function's local variables and arrays (except parameter-list variables) to be initialized to zeros, null strings or empty records, each time the function is called. Otherwise, the variables will have unpredictable initial values. You can accomplish the same effect by adding the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLEAR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; keyword to the &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MODE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; keyword prevents the use of global variables within the function. That is, all variables inside the function will be local variables, even those which have the same names as global variables. This is a good practice when you're writing a function that you might wish to use in a number of different projects, because it removes the possibility of the function's local variables being misinterpreted as globals.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;DIM&lt;/code&gt; is the only kind of statement that you should put between the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement and the &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt; statement. Executable statements placed between &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt; will never be executed.

You cannot declare any of the variables in the function's parameter list using a &lt;code&gt;DIM &lt;/code&gt;statement after the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement.

A compiler preference allows you to fill &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt;s with &lt;code&gt;$A5A5&lt;/code&gt; for debugging. With this item checked, all functions that do not begin with &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CLEAR LOCAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; have every variable filled with this value. It's a great debugging tool.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== LOC == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;result&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;LOC&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This function returns one of two things, depending on the value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the file ID number of an open file, the function returns the current location of the file mark as an offset from the beginning of the current record. For example, if &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOC&lt;/b&gt;(fileID)&lt;/code&gt; returns zero, the file mark is located at the beginning of the record. The file mark indicates where in the file the next input or output operation will occur.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies an open serial port (i.e., if its value is &lt;code&gt;_modemPort&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_printerPort&lt;/code&gt;), then the function indicates the status of the carrier signal. If returns &lt;code&gt;_zTrue&lt;/code&gt; if the carrier is detected, or &lt;code&gt;_false&lt;/code&gt; if the carrier is not detected.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
You can use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; along with &lt;code&gt;REC&lt;/code&gt; to determine the exact location of the file mark within the file.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINE INPUT#&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement reads a line of text data from the open file or open serial port specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and stores the data into the string variable &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; equals zero, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINE INPUT#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; reads data from the keyboard. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINE INPUT#&lt;/b&gt;0,stringVar$&lt;/code&gt; is identical to &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINE INPUT&lt;/b&gt; stringVar$&lt;/code&gt;.

If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies a file, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINE INPUT#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; reads a line of text from the file, beginning at the current &amp;quot;file mark&amp;quot; position (which is usually at the beginning of the line), and ending when a carriage-return character is encountered, or the end of the file is encountered, or 255 characters have been read, whichever occurs first. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINE INPUT#&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/code&gt;then assigns the entire string of characters to &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. the file mark is then advanced to a position just past the last character read.

If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies a serial port (i.e., if its value is &lt;code&gt;_modemPort&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_printerPort&lt;/code&gt;), then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINE INPUT#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; behaves in a similar way, except that the concepts of &amp;quot;file mark&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;end of file&amp;quot; generally don't apply.

Note that &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINE INPUT#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is similar to &lt;code&gt;INPUT#&lt;/code&gt;, except that special characters such as commas, quotes and leading spaces are not interpreted as data item delimiters, but instead are copied directly into &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
If the file mark is already at the end of the file when you execute &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINE INPUT#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, FB generates an &amp;quot;Input past end of file&amp;quot; error. To prevent this situation, check the value of &lt;code&gt;EOF(deviceID)&lt;/code&gt; before executing &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINE INPUT#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;INPUT#; LINE INPUT; EOF; OPEN&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement behaves similarly to the &lt;code&gt;INPUT&lt;/code&gt; statement, except that the entire line of text entered by the user (including any commas, quotes and leading spaces) is stored into the single variable &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. See the &lt;code&gt;INPUT&lt;/code&gt; statement for a description of the parameters that precede &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;code&gt;INPUT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINE INPUT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are considered rather &amp;quot;old-fashioned&amp;quot; ways to interact with the user. Programs with good user-interface design usually utilize Edit Fields instead.

=== Description ===
This function looks for the indicated &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;label&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in your program, and returns the memory address of the first program instruction that follows the label. The returned address can be used with the &lt;code&gt;CALL &amp;lt;address&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement (in cpu68K compiles). If you want to use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in this way, the label should indicate the beginning of an &lt;code&gt;ENTERPROC&lt;/code&gt; procedure.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
To get an entry point address for an &lt;code&gt;ENTERPROC&lt;/code&gt; procedure which is to be used as a &amp;quot;callback procedure&amp;quot; for a MacOS Toolbox routine, use the &lt;code&gt;PROC&lt;/code&gt; function instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== LIBRARY == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LIBRARY&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;LibraryName&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;LIBRARY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
Libraries are routines that are stored either in the Extensions folder of the System Folder or in the folder with the compiled application. Libraries are accessed through FB's standard toolbox assignment mechanism. Libraries may be dragged into the project window and included in the compiled application.

The first syntax: &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LIBRARY&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;LibraryName&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; tells FB to begin using toolbox calls from &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;Library Name&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Only one library at a time is ever accessible. When the toolbox statements have been set up using &lt;code&gt;TOOLBOX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TOOLBOX FN&lt;/code&gt;, the second syntax is used to return to the default library.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LIBRARY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; command is a mechanism that establishes links to a precompiled library. It doesn't matter who created the library (Apple's libraries are most common) or what language it was written in. It's just a file full of subroutines. The creator of the library will usually provide a set of function calls that may be used after the library is opened. Each of these is made available to your FB application with a &lt;code&gt;TOOLBOX&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;TOOLBOX FN &lt;/code&gt;command.

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;code&gt; CD Example: PPC SharedLib Example&lt;/code&gt;

The following example is already part of the FB headers and does not need to be entered. It is offered here as an example only.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LIBRARY&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;QuickTimeLib&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;TOOLBOX FN&lt;/b&gt; EnterMovies = OSErr `0x7001,0xAAAA
&lt;b&gt;TOOLBOX&lt;/b&gt; ExitMovies `0x7002,0xAAAA
&lt;b&gt;TOOLBOX FN&lt;/b&gt; GetMoviesError = OSErr `0x7003,0xAAAA&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LIBRARY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Checking For Available Library Commands&lt;/strong&gt;
After executing a &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LIBRARY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement, you may wish to determine if a particular routine is available. The following example shows how that can be accomplished. A source code example for a library written in C is included on your CD. Our simple shared library creates a toolbox call named &lt;code&gt;SharedBeepNTimes.&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LIBRARY&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Shared Library&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;ToolBox&lt;/b&gt; SharedBeepNTimes(WORD) `0xA9FF
&lt;b&gt;LIBRARY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; result,err,connID&amp;amp;,MainAddr&amp;amp;, symAddr&amp;amp;
&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; symClass`,symClassFill`,symCount&amp;amp;,msg$,i&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;*** Getting connection to shared library ***&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;err = &lt;b&gt;FN GetSharedLibrary&lt;/b&gt;(&amp;quot;Shared Library&amp;quot;,&amp;not;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;_&amp;quot;pwpc&amp;quot;,0x0005,connID&amp;amp;, MainAddr&amp;amp;, msg$)&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LONG IF&lt;/b&gt; err
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;*** No Library entry by that name... ***&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;XELSE&lt;/b&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;err = &lt;b&gt;FN CountSymbols&lt;/b&gt;(connID&amp;amp;, symCount&amp;amp;)
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;*** Checking for Entry. ***&amp;quot;

&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;NEXT&lt;/b&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;err = &lt;b&gt;FN FindSymbol&lt;/b&gt;(connID&amp;amp;, &amp;quot;SharedBeepNTimes&amp;quot;,&amp;not;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;symAddr&amp;amp;, symClass`)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;LONG IF&lt;/b&gt; err
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;*** No code entry by that name... ***&amp;quot;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;*** Entry found, trying it... ***&amp;quot;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;SharedBeepNTimes&lt;/b&gt;(1)// &lt;b&gt;CALL&lt;/b&gt; sharedLibrary
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Done...&amp;quot;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;END IF&lt;/b&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== LET == 

=== Syntax ===
1.&lt;code&gt;[&lt;b&gt;LET&lt;/b&gt;] &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;expr&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;2.&lt;code&gt;[&lt;b&gt;LET&lt;/b&gt;] &lt;i&gt;var;length&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;address&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LET&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement assigns a value to the variable &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, replacing whatever value &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;had before. Note that the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LET&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; keyword is optional.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If you use Syntax 1, the value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is assigned to &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a numeric variable, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be any numeric expression; if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is outside the range or precision that can be stored in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then the expression will be appropriately converted.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a POINTER variable, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be _nil (zero), or another POINTER variable of the same type, or any valid address expression.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a HANDLE variable, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be _nil (zero), or another HANDLE variable of the same type, or any valid address expression whose value is a handle.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a string variable, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be any string expression. You should make sure that the length of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not exceed the maximum string size that will fit into &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a &amp;quot;pseudo&amp;quot; record (declared using &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; var.constant&lt;/code&gt;), then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must be a record variable declared with the same length as &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; record (declared using &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; var &lt;b&gt;AS&lt;/b&gt; recordType&lt;/code&gt;), then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must be a record variable of the same type as &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use Syntax 2, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;length&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; bytes are copied into &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, from the memory location starting at &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;address&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;length&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter must be a static integer expression (i.e., it cannot contain any variables). Note that FB does not check whether &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;length&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;actually equals the size of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;length&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is too small, an incomplete value will be copied into &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;; if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;length&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is too big, data will be copied into addresses beyond &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'s location in memory (this can be dangerous).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== LEN == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringLength&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;LEN&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;|&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
May 30, 2000 (Release 3)

=== Description ===
This function returns the number of characters contained in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. In the case of an empty string, zero is returned.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
To determine the maximum number of characters that can be put into a string variable, use:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SIZEOF&lt;/b&gt;(stringVar$) - 1&lt;/code&gt;

The maximum number of characters allowed in a container is theoretically 2 gigabytes, but is normally limited by available memory.

=== Revised ===
May 30, 2000 (Release 3)

=== Description ===
This function returns a substring or subcontainer consisting of the leftmost &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;characters of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is greater than the length of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LEFT$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns the entire string or container. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is zero, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LEFT$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns an empty (zero-length) string.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
You may not use complex expressions that include containers on the right side of the equal sign. Instead of using:

&lt;code&gt;c$$ = c$$ + &lt;b&gt;LEFT$$&lt;/b&gt;(a$$,10)&lt;/code&gt;

Use:

&lt;code&gt;c$$ += &lt;b&gt;LEFT$$&lt;/b&gt;(a$$,10)&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MAXWINDOW == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAXWINDOW&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
Sets a limit on how large the user can make a window by dragging its &amp;quot;grow box.&amp;quot; After &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAXWINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is executed, the user will not be able to drag the window's size wider than &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;pixels nor taller than &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; pixels (these dimensions refer to the window's &amp;quot;content region&amp;quot;; they don't include the &amp;quot;structure region&amp;quot; (frame) of the window). The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAXWINDOW&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/code&gt;statement applies to all currently open windows and all subsequently opened windows, until another &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAXWINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is executed.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAXWINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not apply to windows which don't have a grow box. Also, it does not limit the dimensions of a window which is resized by clicking its &amp;quot;zoom box&amp;quot; (see the &lt;code&gt;SETZOOM&lt;/code&gt; statement to learn how to do this).

If there is any currently open window (with a grow box) whose dimension(s) exceed &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;and/or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAXWINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will not shrink it immediately. The window will shrink the next time the user clicks on its grow box.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
If you need to apply different size limits to each of several open windows, then you will need to execute &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAXWINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;each time such a window becomes active. In your dialog-event handling function, watch for the &lt;code&gt;_wndActivate&lt;/code&gt; event, then execute &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAXWINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the appropriate parameters depending on which window has become active. See the &lt;code&gt;DIALOG&lt;/code&gt; function for more information.

Typically, you will express a &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;constant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as a 4-digit hexadecimal number. Each &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;variable&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is translated into an instruction which loads the variable's address into register A0.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MACHLG&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is valid only for a &amp;quot;cpu68K&amp;quot; compile, and you should use only MC680x0 machine language instructions in the argument list (not PPC instructions). FB generates an error if you attempt to use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MACHLG&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in a program compiled with the &amp;quot;cpuPPC&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cpuFAT&amp;quot; options. To get around this problem, you can put the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MACHLG&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement inside a &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;COMPILE LONG IF cpu68K&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; block; in that case, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MACHLG&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; instruction will be ignored in a PPC compile.

&lt;b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
It's recommended that you use FutureBasic's &amp;quot;Inline Assembler&amp;quot; syntax rather than the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MACHLG&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement when you need to insert machine language instructions. Not only does this make your code easier to read, but it also allows you to insert PPC instructions as well as MC680x0 instructions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MAYBE == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;trueOrFalse&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;MAYBE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This function is a special random number generator that returns either &lt;code&gt;_zTrue&lt;/code&gt; (-1) or &lt;code&gt;_false&lt;/code&gt; (0), with equal probability. Before your program calls &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAYBE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for the first time, you should execute the &lt;code&gt;RANDOMIZE&lt;/code&gt; statement to &amp;quot;seed&amp;quot; the random number generator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MEM == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;info&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;MEM&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
Returns information about available heap memory or about an &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; string array. In addition, if you specify the value &lt;code&gt;_maxAvail&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MEM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function will force all purgeable resources to be removed from memory.

Specify one of the following values in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to get information about the application's heap memory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;m/MEM_function02.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IMAGE imgs/MEM_function02.gif&quot; width=434 height=138&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specify one of the following values in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to get information about an &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; string array. In this table, &lt;code&gt;indexID&lt;/code&gt; represents the ID number (0 through 9) of the array you're interested in. If the specified &lt;code&gt;INDEX$&lt;/code&gt; array has not yet been initialized (using the &lt;code&gt;CLEAR&amp;lt;index&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement), &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MEM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns zero for all of the items in this table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;m/MEM_function04.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IMAGE imgs/MEM_function04.gif&quot; width=430 height=262&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MOD == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;remainder&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;MOD&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;modulus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator subtracts from &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; the largest multiple of &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;modulus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) which is less than or equal to &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, and returns the result as remainder. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;is negative, then a negative result is returned in remainder.

Note that if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and modulus are both integers, the result of &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is just the remainder of the integer division operation &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt; / &lt;i&gt;modulus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MKI$ function == 
 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;MKI$&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;intExpr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MKI$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (&amp;quot;MaKe Integer string&amp;quot;) returns a string which has the same internal bit pattern as &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;; each character in the returned string will represent 8 bits from &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The returned string will have a length of 1, 2 or 4 characters, depending on which of &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR BYTE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR WORD&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR LONG&lt;/code&gt; is currently in effect. If &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR BYTE&lt;/code&gt; is in effect, you should make sure that &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is within the range of numbers that can be expressed in a single byte; similarly, if &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR WORD&lt;/code&gt; is in effect, you should make sure that &lt;code&gt;intExpr&lt;/code&gt; is within the range of numbers that can be expressed in a &amp;quot;word&amp;quot;-length (2-byte) integer.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MKI$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is useful for translating the 4-letter file types, creator codes, resource types, etc. that are frequently used in MacOS Toolbox routines. These codes are typically transmitted in the form of long-integer values; by using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MKI$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function you can translate these long integers into strings for display purposes (be sure to set &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR LONG&lt;/code&gt; before doing this).

If &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR BYTE&lt;/code&gt; is in effect, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MKI$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns the same thing as the &lt;code&gt;CHR$&lt;/code&gt; function.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
When &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR LONG&lt;/code&gt; is in effect and 4-character strings and long-integers are being converted, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MKI$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is essentially the inverse of the &lt;code&gt;CVI&lt;/code&gt; function. Note, however, that the behavior of &lt;code&gt;CVI &lt;/code&gt;does not depend on the current setting of &lt;code&gt;DEFSTR BYTE/WORD/LONG&lt;/code&gt;.

=== See Also ===
&lt;code&gt;CVI; DEFSTR BYTE/WORD/LONG; CHR$; STR$; VAL&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MINWINDOW == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MINWINDOW&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
Sets a limit on how small the user can make a window by dragging its &amp;quot;grow box.&amp;quot; After &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MINWINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is executed, the user will not be able to drag the window's size narrower than &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; pixels horizontally nor shorter than &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; pixels vertically (these dimensions refer to the window's &amp;quot;content region&amp;quot;; they don't include the &amp;quot;structure region&amp;quot; (frame) of the window). The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MINWINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement applies to all currently open windows and all subsequently opened windows, until another &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MINWINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is executed.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MINWINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not apply to windows which don't have a grow box. Also, it does not limit the dimensions of a window which is resized by clicking its &amp;quot;zoom box&amp;quot; (see the &lt;code&gt;SETZOOM&lt;/code&gt; statement to learn how to do this).

If there is any currently open window (with a grow box) whose dimension(s) are smaller than &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MINWINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will not expand it immediately. The window will expand the next time the user clicks on its grow box.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you need to apply different size limits to each of several open windows, then you will need to execute &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MINWINDOW&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/code&gt;each time such a window becomes active. In your dialog-event handling function, watch for the &lt;code&gt;_wndActivate&lt;/code&gt; event, then execute &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MINWINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the appropriate parameters depending on which window has become active. See the &lt;code&gt;DIALOG&lt;/code&gt; function for more information.

&lt;code&gt;MAXWINDOW; DIALOG function; SETZOOM&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MENU PREFERENCES == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU PREFERENCES&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;itemID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
Feb 2002 (Release 6)

=== Description ===
In OS X, preferences are no longer accessible from the bottom item of the Edit menu. They are traditionally moved to the application menu. This means that you would have to do a large amount of coding to insure that your program followed the proper guidelines for both System 9 and OS X. Instead, you may use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU PREFERENCES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement. If you are operating in System 9, this command does nothing. If your application is being run in OS X, the preference menu is moved to the application menu. Further, if the user selects the preference item, the menu choice is converted to the specified &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;itemID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; so that your program can react without special coding.

A full example of using the new PREFERENCE commands can be found on on the &lt;code&gt;PUT PREFERENCES&lt;/code&gt; help page.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
This will not work properly if the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;itemID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is anything other than the last item of the edit menu. FB must delete the old preference item and this would change menu IDs in your program if other selections followed it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MID$ and MID$$ == 
 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;subString$&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;MID$&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;startPos&lt;/i&gt; [,&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt;])&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;subContainer$$&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;MID$$&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;startPos&lt;/i&gt; [,&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt;])&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;June 15, 2000 (Release 3)

=== Description ===
This function returns a substring or subcontainer of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, consisting of characters which begin at position &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;startPos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If you specify &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then a maximum of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; characters are returned; otherwise, all the characters from &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;startPos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the end of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;are returned. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;startPos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is less than 1, then it's treated as 1. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;startPos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is greater than the length of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then a null (zero-length) string is returned.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You may not use complex expressions that include containers on the right side of the equal sign. Instead of using:

&lt;code&gt;c$$ = c$$ + &lt;b&gt;MID&lt;/b&gt;$$(a$$,10)&lt;/code&gt;

Use:

&lt;code&gt;c$$ += &lt;b&gt;MID&lt;/b&gt;$$(a$$,10)&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;MID$&lt;/b&gt;(&amp;quot;Rick Brown&amp;quot;, 2, 3)&lt;br&gt;
myContainer$$ = &amp;quot;Rick Brown&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;MID$&lt;/b&gt;(myContainer$$, 2, 3)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;MID$&lt;/b&gt;(&amp;quot;Rick Brown&amp;quot;, 6)&lt;/code&gt;

program output:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ick&lt;br&gt;
ick&lt;br&gt;
Brown&lt;/code&gt;

✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console
=== Syntax ===
&lt;b&gt;COMPILE SHUTDOWN&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Optional Quoted Remark&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;

=== Description ===
You may have some code that is specifically designed for one platform or another. For instance, 68K assembly cannot be compiled into a PPC application. In such cases, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE&amp;nbsp;SHUTDOWN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; would abort the compile process with an error and show the offending line complete with the optional quoted remark.

=== Example ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/b&gt; cpuPPC&lt;/br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;COMPILE SHUTDOWN&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;This won't work in PPC.&amp;quot;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;COMPILE XELSE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;`&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;move.l&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;d0,-(SP)
&lt;b&gt;COMPILE END IF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Description ===
Compile statements are directives to the compiler to change the way it evaluates and compiles code. (See &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;compile.html&quot;&gt;COMPILE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for a complete list of compiler directives.) Compile flags do not literally exist as accessible variables in the application but are used to set internal flags during compilation.

You can use this function to check specific flags which may be required by your application or to provide notes to another programmer about how to improve or streamline their code.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LONG IF COMPILEFLAGS&lt;/b&gt;(_dimmedVarsOnly) = _false&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;It is much better to check &amp;quot;Use only &amp;not;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIMensioned variables&amp;quot; in the preferences window.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;


END IF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

In addition to all of the standard compiler flags, this function can return additional information.

&lt;code&gt;_FB3CpuCode&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;= 0x00020000&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'0=68K/1=-PPC&lt;br&gt;
_FB3ErrorCount&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;= 0x00040000&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'# of errors so far&lt;br&gt;
_FB3WarningCount = 0x00080000&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'# of warnings so far&lt;br&gt;
_FB3FloatDivChar = 0x00100000&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'&amp;quot;/&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
_FB3HideWarnings = 0x00200000&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'show/hide warnings&lt;/code&gt;

=== Function === 
 
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;versionNum&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;COMPILERVERSION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This function returns the current version of the compiler. The number is internally set before each compiler is shipped. The purpose of this function is to determine whether or not a specific functionality is present before a particular command is executed.

If, for example, you wanted to invoke a routine that was not added to the compiler until version 3 release 2, you would check the version as follows:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LONG IF COMPILERVERSION&lt;/b&gt; &amp;lt; 0x03020000&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;You need a newer compiler to run this.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;XELSE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;REM&lt;/b&gt; new operation goes here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;END IF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPILERVERSION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function always returns a long word which is formatted as follows:

Byte 1 = Version number&lt;br&gt;
Byte 2 = Release number&lt;br&gt;
Byte 3 = Revision Number&lt;br&gt;
Byte 4 = Fix

=== Description ===
Returns the compounding factor for the given interest rate and number of periods. The interest rate should be expressed as a fraction of 1; for example, 5.2 percent should be expressed as 0.052.

=== Note ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPOUND&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; uses the following formula:

&lt;code&gt;compoundFactor# = &lt;/code&gt;(1 + &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;periods&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Statement === 

✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPRESS DYNAMIC&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;arrayName&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Revised:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
May, 2001 (Release 5)

=== Description ===
When space is required for a dynamic array, it is allocated in chunks. The size of these chunks is determined by the global variable &lt;code&gt;gFBDynamicGrowInc&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;gFBDynamicGrowInc&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is set to 1000 and you use a single element, 1000 elements are allocated. No additional elements are allocated unless and until you pass the 1000 mark. If you needed to access the 1001st element, an additional 1000 elements would be allocated.

The preallocation of space in large chunks can make dynamic arrays operate at a much faster pace because the handle used to accommodate the information is not resized as often.

When you want to regain RAM set aside for a dynamic array that has not yet been addressed, use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMPRESS DYNAMIC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The size of the handle used to hold information is reduced. Internal counters that track the maximum number of elements available before resizing are also corrected.

== Constant declaration == 
 
=== Statement === 
 
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;_constantName = &lt;i&gt;staticExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This is a non-executable statement which assigns the value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;staticExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the symbolic constant indicated by &lt;code&gt;_constantName&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;_constantName&lt;/code&gt; must indicate a name which was not defined anywhere previously in the program, and which is different from all pre-defined FB symbolic constant names. The name must be preceded by an underscore ( &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; ) character. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;staticExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must be a &amp;quot;static integer expression&amp;quot;; it cannot contain any variables nor function references.

The constant declaration statement is one of several ways to assign values to symbolic constant names. Other ways include using the &lt;code&gt;DIM RECORD&lt;/code&gt; statement and using the &lt;code&gt;BEGIN ENUM&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;strong&gt;Revised:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
February, 2002 (Release 6)

=== Description ===
If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is positive, it's interpreted as the resource ID of a '&lt;code&gt;crsr&lt;/code&gt;' (first choice) or a '&lt;code&gt;CURS&lt;/code&gt;' resource (alternative choice), and this statement changes the current cursor to the indicated cursor. The following cursor resources are found in the System file, and are always available:

For Appearance Manager calls, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;cursorType&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must be &lt;code&gt;_themeCursorStatic&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_themeCursorAnimate&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Error Messages (Appearance Manager)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;If you attempt to use an illegal value in the cursor statement, you will see the following dialog:

&lt;img src=&quot;c/CURSOR_statement07.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;132&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;

This type of dialog will only appear when you select Run from the Command menu. It will not show up if you use an illegal value in the program after selecting Build. This prevents the error message from appearing on your end user's screen, but still makes it available during the coding process.

&lt;strong&gt;Forcing a Cursor Event:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;intExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is negative(for example:&lt;code&gt;CURSOR=-_watchCursor), &lt;/code&gt;then the cursor is changed to the one whose ID is &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;intExpr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, and a cursor event is generated, which can be trapped by checking for events of type &lt;code&gt;_cursEvent&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;DIALOG &lt;/code&gt;function. You cannot generate a &lt;code&gt;_cursEvent&lt;/code&gt; when switching to the &lt;code&gt;_arrowCursor&lt;/code&gt; (since its resource ID number has no negative!)

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you've designed a &lt;code&gt;csrs&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;CURS&lt;/code&gt; resource of your own which you want to make available to your program, do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assign a positive resource ID number to the resource (don't use any of the numbers in the above table. You should use an ID number of 128 or higher.)

&lt;li&gt;Copy the resource to the resources file which you reference in your program's &lt;code&gt;RESOURCES&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CURSOR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement to activate your cursor within the program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Indonesians have a generic term for calling their forefathers in the past, leluhur (literally, ‘the virtuous ones’) or nenek-moyang (literally, ‘the clever grandmothers ‘). In fact, they are really clever and virtuous. Our first kind of Homo sapiens who lived in 6000 centuries BC, Homo Wajakensis, had thought of abstract thing such as ‘death’. It is said that the Indonesian word mati or mate (death) had been a well-known word to the Old World of Middle East that the Koran of Islam—the Arabic literary classic of 7 century AD—mentioned it as mawt, Arabic pronunciation of the Old-Polynesian mate or mati, besides the word kapur (English, camphor) which was mentioned in the Koran as kâfûr when describing joys in Paradise. We inherit many mythologies of origin, which tell the first thought of the origin of death.

In the Mesolithic age, our leluhur had understood reality as unity. They did not separate yet ‘the signifier’ (the concept we make) and ‘the signified’ (reality outside us)—using the terms of Saussure. Reality is one. Having understood this way, our leluhur made painting of a pig in the cave of Pattakere (South Sulawesi). They drew in the cave a pig with an arrow breaking its heart, hoping that what they drew would be real: they would succeed in hunting the pig with their arrows later or the next day. They thought what they drew would be real. The drawing, in their mind, is reality, because ‘the signifier’ is always ‘the signified’.[12] In the same way they decorated their bodies with red color, thinking that red color meant blood and blood meant source of life. If they colored bodies with red, they believed that they would have life energy more and more added.[13]

In the Neolithic era (3500–2500 BC), our leluhur had more developed. They had understood the spirituality of universe. They created smoothly-grinded stone axes, used for their religious rites and for talisman, since they believed that the axes had got spirit or ‘soul inside’. In Java, souls were believed to reside in stone ornaments.[14] In the Mentawai Islands (West Sumatra), our leluhur believe that everything possesses a soul—not only living beings such as men and animals, but also objects such as stones, trees, rivers, caves, the stars, the moon, the sun, rain, the rainbow, the wind. The soul is a brother, a shadow, a counterpart of everything existing in the world. The soul is an independent entity, quite capable of detaching itself from its physical brother or counterpart. The souls of different entities can meet with each other, and influence each other. When a man’s soul leaves his body, it sees many things, meets with other souls, talks to them, and listens to them, and when it comes back to the body, it may tell the man of its experiences. These are then the dreams men dream. The soul may even go wandering and traveling while the man is awake. The Mentawaian would understand when a man or a woman is moody—his or her soul is experiencing something unpleasant in its wanderings. The Batak calls the soul his tondi; the Minangkabau calls sumange; the Torajan calls tanoana, while The Nias has his noso. [15]

In the Bronze-Iron age, our leluhur had reached the knowledge of ‘two worlds’: ‘the world of dead men’ and ‘the world of living beings’. It is known from the paintings on their bronze kettledrums. They painted on kettledrums a ship, but not for sailing oceans. The ship, it is believed, is for carrying the soul of a dead man from this world of living beings to the world of dead men.[16] The motif of the boat is not only on their kettledrums, but also is to be found in the architecture of houses. In Savu Island, a house has a bow and aft, and the motif of the ship of the dead or the ship of the souls (men on a boat) is found among the Dayak (especially in the tiwah festive day) and the Lampong, while the Torajan call their coffin a prau (boat).[17]

Almost at the same age came the Megalithic age, when our leluhur began worshipping their ancestors. They felt the need to choose leader of community, since their social organization had been well established. They selected as the leader the strongest man in his body and soul, the richest of all inhabitants, the most attentive to his people. When a man was chosen to be leader of community, he had a right to build a monument to commemorate his existence, a menhir. Through this menhir, when he was dead, a generation after can commemorate his merits and deeds to his community. The menhir used for commemorational aim later changed into its use for worshipping. His people believed that the leader would always watch over them and protect the community from any danger. They then began worshipping the leaders. They also developed more the belief of the residence of soul. They believed that the leaders’ souls (which became their ancestors) resided in the highest mountain ever. That’s why their menhir is always shaped like multi-leveled structure (Indonesian, punden berundak-undak), that is, to symbolize the height of the residence of souls. Under the punden, our leluhur always buried the bodies of ancestors, so as to easily worship them.[18] The shape of punden is verily Indonesian original. The Borobudur Temple, having been wrongly believed as an Indian-style building, had been build instead on the scheme of punden berundak-undak. In the burial located under the menhir, our leluhur also put glass beads, iron and bronze tools in the same grave, since they believed those to be things to wear and to use in ‘the world of the dead’.[19]

So far as our leluhur is concerned, we can conclude that our leluhur of the past time had reached instinctively and intuitively by their budi some high level of spirituality, which later would be of very much use in their encounter with the foreign philosophies of India and of Persia.          

Chinese immigrants came to Indonesia in 1122-222 BC, but they wholeheartedly assimilated to Indonesian way of life. They became part of our leluhur too. Meanwhile, Indian foreigners came to Indonesia in 320 BC and they began to attract our leluhur with their sophisticated system of philosophy. I can understand how our leluhur were very attracted by this Indian philosophy. I have been studying Hinduism and Buddhism recently and I cannot help admiring at these philosophies so much. Only at a short glance of reading these Indian authoritative texts, I believe, anyone can get verily attracted. So did our leluhur in the past.

Our leluhur had known already that the universe was full of spirits. Ancestors, when being dead, were also spirits. They also believed that the spirits or the souls had special residences. And, they reached the understanding of the ‘two worlds`. All these beliefs were more developed by the adoption of the Indian philosophy. Indian Hindus, actually, in many parts gave them new ‘names` for the things our leluhur had known or they materialized what our leluhur had spiritualized. Leluhur called spirits or souls with many names; Hindus materialized and personified them and called them deva (god) or devi (goddess), manifestations of Brahman. Leluhur had belief in punden berundak-undak as the highest residence of spirits; Hindus called it anew as Mahameru Mountain. Leluhur had known ‘the world of the dead` and ‘the world of the living`; Hindus called them as Shiva (manifestation of the Infinite Transcendental Spirit) and Kali (the finite world of Nature). What our leluhur verily lacked was the concept of Supreme Spirit, which was also the One. Hindus mentioned Him as Brahman.

Our leluhur owed Indians too in devaraja cult. Some kings like Sanjaya of Hindu-Mataram, Airlangga (1007-1049) and his descendants from Kameshvara I to Kertajaya, asked some Brahmins to consecrate them through complex Hindu rituals and to insert ‘divine essence` to their bodies, in order that they could incarnate Shiva (the god of destruction, the god of reproduction, the god of asceticism, the god of meditation, the god of dancing art, the god of salvation, manifestation of Brahman) and Vishnu (the god of preservation, the god of sustainment, manifestation of Brahman).[20]

The utmost spiritual achievement that our leluhur had gained in 8 century AD is the concept of the unity of truth of religions. Hinduism and Buddhism—two different philosophies of the same Indian origin—were considered by our leluhur as containing the same truth. King Vishnu (775-782), who was a devout Buddhist, did not feel ashamed to name himself with a Hindu god`s name. Sambhara Suryavarana, a Buddhist writer who lived in the Kingdom of Hindu Medang, overtly praised a Hindu King Sindok in his Buddhist sacred literature Sang Hyang Kamahayanikan. Mpu Prapãnca (1335-1380) wrote Negarakertagama, in which he blended Shaivism and Buddhism, while Mpu Tantular, a writer who lived in the era of Hayam Wuruk (1350-1389), wrote Kakawin Sutasoma, who also intentionally blended Shaivism and Buddhism.[21] Mpu Tantular said in his Kakawin Sutasoma:

Rwâneka dhâtu winuwus Buddha Wiswa,

Bhinnêki rakwa ring apan kena parwanosen,

Mangka ng Jinatwa kalawan Siwatatwa tunggal,

Bhinnêka tunggal ika tan hana dharma mangrwa.[22]

(It is said that the well known Buddha and Shiva are two different substances,

They are indeed different, yet how is it possible to recognize their difference in a glance,

since the truth of Jina (Buddha) and the truth of Shiva is one,

they are indeed different, but they are of the same kind, as there is no duality in Truth.)

 Our leluhur of Java learned and mastered the Indian esthetics (kavya) very fast. They applied their learning by founding clubs of ‘poet laureate’. The royal poets are called kawi-kawi or mpu, and their poetry called kakawin. The poets are so called, because they used in their poetry-writing Bahasa Kawi—esthetic Old Javanese language created and utilized amongst kawi-kawi clubs. These kawi-kawi believed in the divine inspiration, by which they were ‘guided’ to make very esthetic poems. They believed that deva or devi would fall down to earth, bless them, manifest within and ‘reside’ in their kakawin as well, like residing in temples. They prayed Indian devas like Vishnu, Shiva, Kama, Ratih or sometimes Sarasvati before writing kakawin on the firm belief that by doing so those devas would happily help them compose very artistic poems. No wonder then that their kakawins have godly quality.[23] Mpu Panuluh, a kawi who wrote a very wonderful kakawin, explained how he wrote his Kakawin Hariwangsa:

To far, faraway mountain peaks I always wander to do my worship, longing for communication with the world of gods. My heart is focused on worshipping god Vishnu, hoping that He would willingly come down to my heart as He would to a lotus. My worship of Vishnu through this Samadhi (meditation) only has one purpose, that is, I hope I can manage in writing a kalangö (an esthetic work) and I hope He willingly helps me through His power write a poem, by which I can establish my stand amongst those who deserve to be called kawi (esthetic poet).[24]

For 7 centuries our leluhur had learned many things from the Indian civilization and culture. They were fast and creative learners. Called creative in the sense that, after receiving many Indian elements, our leluhur developed them more, but even formulated new stream of thought which would verily accord to the indigenous thought. It is undeniable truth, however, that we had learned many things of India and we cannot easily escape from its attracting spell. Therefore, when a wave of Islamic thought began to band in fifteenth-century Indonesia, only its Sufism was very well welcomed by our leluhur, since it resembled the Indian spirituality in very many aspects of it. Wali Songo or ‘The Nine Muslim Saints’, who left Persia and India for Indonesia in 15th century, were best welcomed by our leluhur, for they taught the same monism like the Indian one, although with different terminology and idioms. This is beautifully expressed in the words of Ki Ageng Pengging, one of our leluhurs who eagerly learned Sufistic monism from Syekh Siti Jenar of India:

Kyageng Pengging tan riringa

Angengkoki jati ning Mahasukci

Allah kana kéné suwung

Jatine among asma

Ya asmané manungsa ingkang linuhung

Mengku sipat kalih dasa

Agama Buda Islami

Karonina nora béda

Warna roro asmané mung sawiji.[25]

(Without hesitation Ki Ageng Pengging said

that he is the All-Holy.

“God is not found here or there.

In fact, ‘God’ is only a name,

that is, a name for  Great Man

who has twenty attributes.

Buddha and Islam

are never different.

The forms are two, but the names are one”)

Our leluhur learned the Islamic heritage as eagerly as they learned the Indian one. But, as they did so to Indian, they only accepted the Islamic civilization if it fitted the indigenous thought well. I don’t want to repeat what P.J. Zoetmulder has genuinely revealed in his book Pantheïsme en Monisme in de Javaansche Soeloek-Litteratuur (recently translated into English), in which he showed that our leluhur had invented complex philosophical concepts of emanation through seven levels of divine manifestation (martabat tujuh) and radical monism. I humbly ask readers to read and recite this genial work.

Our leluhur continued to be the fountain of spiritual knowledge by their inner faculty of budi, until they were stopped to be considered as ‘the virtuous ones’ and had been object of mockery. This happened when Adat (the compilation of leluhur’s traditional wisdom) has been subject to criticism by Muslim reformers inspired by Wahhabite ideals emerged in West Sumatra in the decade of 1800s. By their poisonous teaching of eradicating the indigenous civilization, later generations of Indonesia were inspired to be rebellious children who sacrificed their own civilization to get ‘the false Arabian Paradise’.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Probably the two most terrifying concepts in the
freshman world are Calculus and Programming. They
certainly were for me. I was a C student when it
came to Calculus and a B student when it came
to programming.
Let me assure you that both concepts are quite
simple, notwithstanding my grades as a freshman.
In fact, both calculus and programming are so
simple, my freshman grades are most embarrassing.

Let's
start with calculus.
I don't know how or why I got it into my head
that calculus was a difficult subject.
As pointed out by
Sylvanus P. Thompson (herein SPT) in the
analogous chapter of ''Calculus Made Easy'' (herein CME),
you simply have to understand 
the two symbols you will encounter over
and over again when discussing Calculus.
They are
&lt;math&gt;\int&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. The first symbol,
&lt;math&gt;\int&lt;/math&gt;
(the ''integral'' symbol), simply means
'to sum up'. The second symbol, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; (the
''differentiation'' symbol), means simply
'a tiny piece of'. Placed together, as in

    &lt;math&gt;\int x^2\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

they
simply means to 
sum up all the tiny pieces of the 
curve &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Let me add that the purpose of differentiation is just
to find the slope of a curve and that
the purpose of integration is to find the area under
a curve. That's all.

With regards to programming, it also
is rather simple. To write a program,
one simply calls ''functions'' to do the
work you need to do. Sometimes the function
you need to call already exists. Sometimes it
doesn't
and you have to build it. But guess what?
You are going to build the function from
other functions, some of which already exist
and some that do not.
Simple, right?

I've used the word simple and its variants
an awful lot, but I do so because it ''really'' is
all so simple.

      <comment>/* Recursion */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Recall from the last chapter that the symbol ''d''
with respect to Calculus means 
'to take tiny pieces of'. Let's
practice taking small pieces of 
a number and, at the same time,
learn some programming.
And, because you must, as future
Computer Scientists, you ''must'' learn to let go and be wild,
we will take a small piece of a small piece,
and a small piece of ''that'' very small piece, and so on and so on,
''ad infinitum''.

----
At this point, you should
[http://sway.cs.ua.edu install Sway]
on your system.
----

==Using the Sway Interpreter==

We begin by starting the Sway interpreter, Sway being
the ''Programming Language'' you will learn. Once started,
the interpreter rewards you with a ''prompt'':

    sway&gt;

This prompt signals to you to enter some code. When you
do so, the interpreter will tell you the result of
running (or ''evaluating'' or ''executing'') that code.

    sway&gt; 3;
    INTEGER: 3

To exit the interpreter, type &lt;Ctrl-d&gt; or a &lt;Ctrl-c&gt;.
These key strokes are generated by holding the Control
key down while at the same type tapping the 'd' or 'c'
key at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;
If you restart the Sway interpreter, you can
recover your previous commands by using the up
arrow on your keyboard. If you go too far up,
you can use the down arrow to move through the
list of previous commands in the opposite direction.
You can edit the previous commands as well.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Here, we have entered a 3 followed by a semicolon (the semicolon
tells the interpreter that we are done entering code).
Sway (actually the Sway interpreter)
responds by saying 3 is an integer with a value 
of 3. Of course, we already knew all that, so the interpreter
doesn't seem to be all that useful. But did you know that
43 times 112 is 4816?

    sway&gt; 43 * 112;
    INTEGER: 4816

Sway does! Let's use the fact that the interpreter
is pretty good at math to figure out what a small part of a
big number is. Let's assume that a small part is
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{16}&lt;/math&gt;
of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;
Computer Scientists love numbers that are a power of 2, as in
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on. The inverses of those numbers
are much loved, as well.
&lt;/ref&gt;
First, let's figure out what 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{16}&lt;/math&gt;
is as a decimal number, or ''real'' number,
since that will be easier to type in:

    sway&gt; 1/16;
    SOURCE CODE ERROR
    file stdin,line 1
    an expression was expected, found token of type BAD_NUMBER
    error occurred prior to: 16;[END OF LINE]

Uh oh. Sway did not like the '1' followed so closely by the '/'.
In fact, Sway requires spaces around things like
division signs in most instances. Let's try again:

    sway&gt; 1 / 16;
    INTEGER: 0

Better, at least we got an answer instead of an error.
However, it doesn't seem that the interpreter is that good at
math after all. If we put on our Sherlock Holmes cap and 
ponder, we see that the interpreter said the result of 
dividing 1 by 16 is an integer, but we know it should be
a real number. It turns out that the Sway language, like
most programming languages, uses a rule that combining two
things of the same type yields a result of the same type.
In this case, zero happens to be the largest integer that
is less than the desired result. In other words, the interpreter
truncated the fractional part of the real number and gave
us the integer that 
was left. Let's experiment and see if this is so:

    sway&gt; 7 / 2;
    INTEGER: 3

Seems to be. So getting back to our original problem, how
do we find out what is 1 divided by 16 as a real number?
Let's enter the numbers as real numbers instead of integers:

    sway&gt; 1.0 / 16.0;
    REAL_NUMBER: 0.0625000000

That's much better!

Now let's figure out what a small part of
a million is (using our assumption of what is small):

    sway&gt; 1000000 * 0.0625;
    REAL_NUMBER: 62500.0000000000

Sixty-two and a half thousand. Still big in an absolute sense,
but much smaller that a million. Being wild and crazy, let's
take a small part of a small part:

    sway&gt; 1000000 * .0625 * .0625;
    REAL_NUMBER: 3906.2500000000

About 4000. Much smaller.

----
You should familiarize yourself with
[[The Sway Reference Manual/Primitives|Sway primitives]] and
[[The Sway Reference Manual/Combining Primitives|combinations]], including
Sway's [[The Sway Reference Manual/Precedence and Associativity|precedence and associativity
]] rules,
at this point.
----

==Using Variables==

Shall we continue taking ever smaller parts?

Before we do, I must admit that I am, at heart, a lazy person,
as are most Computer Scientists.&lt;ref&gt;
Lazy, as in I abhor doing work that could (and should)
be automated.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Typing in all those numbers is just too much work! I am
going to use two short symbols to represent both the million and the
fraction:

    sway&gt; var x = 1000000;
    INTEGER: 1000000
    sway&gt; var f = .0625;
    REAL_NUMBER: 0.0625000000

What I've done is created a ''variable'' to stand in for
the million and a variable to stand in for the fraction,
''x'' and ''f'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;
A variable can be thought of as a name for something else. However,
it is ''not'' the something else, just as your name
is not you, but a handy way for people to refer to you.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Now I can use those variables
instead of the numbers. Let's check to see if I did things
right:

    sway&gt; x * f * f;
    REAL_NUMBER: 3906.2500000000

Looks like I did. Let's go a step further:

    sway&gt; x * f * f * f;
    REAL_NUMBER: 244.1406250000

It seems variables are a nice way to reduce the amount of
typing needed. The only drawback is remembering what a
variable stands for. This is why it is so important
to name your variables in such a way as to make it
easy for you to recall their meanings. Generally,
single letter variable names are '''not'' a good idea
(although there are exceptions to this rule).
----

see [[The Sway Reference Manual/Variables and Environments|Sway variables]].

==Using functions==

We could go further with this, but you have yet to understand the
depths of my laziness. Even typing in &lt;tt&gt;* f&lt;/tt&gt; repeatedly
is too much for my sensibilities. I am going to define (or write) a
function to do the work for me (you can cut and paste this
function into the interpreter if you are lazy like me and
don't want to type it in yourself):

    function smaller(amount,fraction)
        {
        inspect(amount * fraction);
        }

Whether you paste it in or type it in,
you should get the following response from the interpreter:

    sway&gt;     function smaller(amount,fraction)
    more&gt;         {
    more&gt;         inspect(amount * fraction);
    more&gt;         }
    FUNCTION: &lt;function smaller(amount,fraction)&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;more&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; prompt indicates that the Sway interpreter
is expecting some more code.

There are two things you must do when dealing with functions,
(1) ''define'' them and (2) ''call'' them. Here, we have just defined a
function; now we need to call it. We will call it by typing
the name of the function followed by a parenthesized list
of ''arguments''.
Sometimes we say this is &quot;passing the
arguments to the function&quot;.

When calling the function ''smaller''&lt;ref&gt;
the variable ''smaller'' is not really a function, but a handy
name for the function we defined. But rather than say
'the function named by the variable ''smaller''', we often say
'the function ''smaller''. Technically, that is incorrect,
but is simpler to say.
&lt;/ref&gt;,
the values of the arguments will be
''bound'' to the variables ''amount'' and ''fraction'', which are
found after the function name in its definition. These variables
are known as the ''formal parameters'' of the function.
This passing
and binding, in essence,
defines those variables for us.
Note that the arguments and formal parameters do need to
be separated by whitespace; the comma serves as a separator.

After these implicit variable definitions,
the code between the curly braces {} will be evaluated
as if you had typed them in directly to the interpreter. This
is why I said in the previous chapter that a function does
the work for you. If we look at the code (or body) of the
function we just defined, we see that a function named
''inspect'' is being called. Since we haven't defined
''inspect'', we can assume that this function already
exists within the interpreter. By its name, we can guess
that it will tell us something about what happens when we
multiply ''amount'' by ''fraction'':

    sway&gt; smaller(x,f);
    amount * fraction is 62500.000000
    REAL_NUMBER: 62500.000000

There is a whole lot going on here that needs explanation. The
first is that the value of ''x'' (1000000) was bound to the
formal parameter ''amount'' of the function ''smaller''.
Likewise, the value of ''f'' (0.0625) was bound to the formal
parameter ''fraction''. Then the body of the function ''smaller''
was evaluated, triggering a call to the ''inspect'' function.
What ''inspect'' does is print out its literal argument, followed
by the string &quot; is &quot;, followed by the value of its argument.
Since the call to inspect is that last thing ''smaller'' does,
whatever ''inspect'' returns is returned by ''smaller''. This
return value appears to be the evaluated argument.

Note that interpreter reported two things. The first is
the string produced by ''inspect''. The second is the
report of the return value as we have seen before.
We call an action that has an effect outside the called function
(in this case, the printing by ''inspect'') a ''side effect''.

[[The Sway Reference Manual/Variables and Environments|Sway Functions]].

==Recursion==

Now, at this point, you are probably thinking that, not only
am I lazy, I must be a rather dim bulb as well, because I spent
a lot more effort writing the ''smaller'' function and calling
it than I would have simply typing:

    sway&gt; x * f;
    REAL_NUMBER: 62500.000000

If that was all I was going to do, you would be quite right
in your assessment. But I am not finished yet. Now I am
going to make ''smaller'' much, much more powerful:

    function smaller(amount,fraction)
        {
        inspect(amount * fraction);
        smaller(amount * fraction,fraction);
        }

Notice that I have added a call to the ''smaller'' function after
the call to the ''inspect'' function.
When a function calls itself, it is said to be a ''recursive''
function, that it exhibits the property of ''recursion'' and
that at the point of the ''recursive'' call,
the function ''recurs''.&lt;ref&gt;
Some poor souls will use the verb 'recurse' instead of
the proper 'recur'. Recur means to call oneself, recurse
means to swear again. Do ''not'' make this mistake, otherwise
people will deem you ignorant.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Notice further that the first argument to ''smaller'' in that
internal call will send a (hopefully) smaller number to the
''smaller'' function. In ''that'' call, ''smaller'' will be
called again with yet an even smaller number, and so on.
Let's try it:

    sway&gt; smaller(1000000,.0625);
    amount * fraction is 62500.0000000000
    amount * fraction is 3906.2500000000
    amount * fraction is 244.1406250000
    amount * fraction is 15.2587890625
    amount * fraction is 0.9536743164
    amount * fraction is 0.0596046448
    amount * fraction is 0.0037252903
    amount * fraction is 0.0002328306
    amount * fraction is 1.4551915228e-05
    amount * fraction is 9.0949470177e-07
    ...
    amount * fraction is 0.0000000000e+00
    amount * fraction is 0.0000000000e+00
    amount * fraction is 0.0000000000e+00
    amount * fraction is 0.0000000000e+00
    amount * fraction is 0.0000000000e+00
    amount * fraction is 0.0000000000e+00
    amount * fraction is 0.0000000000e+00
    amount * fraction is 0.0000000000e+00
    encountered a fatal error...
    stack overflow.

Wow! Unless you have very quick eyes, all you
saw is the bottom part of this output.
What happened? 
What we did was to define a function that fell into
an ''infinite loop'' when we called it. An infinite loop
occurs because we never told our function when to stop
calling itself. Thus, it tried to call itself ''ad infinitum''.
Of course, a computer has a limited amount of memory, so
in this particular case, the calls could not go on
forever.&lt;ref&gt;
There are clever languages in which some infinite recursive
loops do not use up computer memory. Someday, Sway will
be that clever and this section will need to be rewritten.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Let's redefine our function so that it pauses after every
inspection so we can slow down the output:

    function smaller(amount,fraction)
        {
        inspect(amount * fraction);
        pause();
        smaller(amount * fraction,fraction);
        }

You can start up the Sway interpreter again and paste
in our revised function definition.

Now when we call our function we see this output (assuming
you repeatedly hit the enter key on your keyboard):

    sway&gt; smaller(1000000,.0625);
    amount * fraction is 62500.0000000000
    
    amount * fraction is 3906.2500000000
    
    amount * fraction is 244.1406250000
    
    amount * fraction is 15.2587890625
    
    amount * fraction is 0.9536743164
    
    amount * fraction is 0.0596046448
    
    amount * fraction is 0.0037252903
    
    amount * fraction is 0.0002328306

You can stop the interpreter by typing in a &lt;Ctrl&gt;-c which is
entered from your keyboard by holding the Control key down while
tapping the 'c' once.

We can see that &lt;tt&gt;amount * fraction&lt;tt&gt; gets very small very quickly.
If you start
again and keep going, you will see that &lt;tt&gt;amount * fraction&lt;tt&gt;
eventually reaches zero.
Theoretically, it doesn't, but at some point
the quantity gets smaller that can be represented by Sway,
so Sway reports zero.

----
You should read more about
[[The Sway Reference Manual/Recursion|recursion]] and
learn about [[The_Sway_Reference_Manual/Conditionals#If_expressions|''if'' expressions]] before continuing.
----

Let's try a new version of the function, this one calls
itself a given number of times before stopping:

    function smaller(x,f,n)
        {
        if (n == 0)
            {
            :done;
            }
        else
            {
            inspect(x);
            smaller(x * f,f,n - 1);
            }
        }

This time, we have a new formal parameter ''n'', which represents
the number of times to the function recursively calls
itself again. We've also changed the call to ''inspect''
to print out the value of ''x''.
Note that the recusive call not only makes ''x'' smaller, it
makes ''n'' smaller as well.
When ''n'' gets small enough, the function returns the symbol
''done''.

We must remember to add an extra argument to the call.
Let's send in 8 as the number of times to recursively call:

    sway&gt; smaller(1000000,.0625,8);
    x is 1000000
    x is 62500.000000
    x is 3906.2500000
    x is 244.14062500
    x is 15.258789062
    x is 0.9536743164
    x is 0.0596046448
    x is 0.0037252903
    SYMBOL: :done

Yay! Our program stopped recuring infinitely. Formally, the ''if''
inside the function has two cases: the ''base'' case, which does not
contain a recursive call and a ''recursive'' case, which does.
Infinite recursive loops occur when the base case is never reached,
usually due to some misstatement of the base case condition or
a misunderstanding of the range of values taken on by the formal
parameter being tested in the base case condition.

==Back to Calculus==

What did this exercise with finding ever smaller numbers have to
do with calculus? Well, the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; symbol means 'take
a tiny piece of'. How tiny? Infinitesimally small, or in other
words, the value computed by an infinite number of recursive calls
to ''smaller''. Of course, this is smaller than we can fathom,
but that is not a big deal. We can't fathom how our brains work,
but we get along OK, or at least most of us do.

==Questions==

All formulas are written using Grammar School Precedence.

'''1'''.
What happens when you combine an integer and a real number?

'''2'''.
This question and subsequent questions refer to the last version of smaller.
Why did the call to ''smaller'' return a real number?

'''3'''.
Redefine ''smaller'' so that it prints out nine inspections rather than eight,
for the same initial value of 8.

'''4'''.
What happens when zero is passed as the count to ''smaller''?

'''5'''.
What happens when -1 is passed as the count to ''smaller''? Why?

'''6'''.
What happens if the recursive call in ''smaller'' is replaced by &lt;tt&gt;smaller(x *f,f,n)&lt;/tt&gt;? Why?

'''7'''.
Write a Sway function to represent &lt;math&gt; y = 2 x ^ a &lt;/math&gt;, and evaluate it for &lt;math&gt; x = 1, 2, 3 &lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt; a = 2, 4, 6 &lt;/math&gt;.

'''8'''.
Using the Sway function for &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; in the previous problem, write a new Sway function &lt;math&gt; z = a y &lt;/math&gt;, 
and evaluate as before. 

'''9'''.
A series is a sequence of terms that are added together. If as more
and more terms are added together, the sum of the terms get closer
and closer to a number ''k'', then, ''k'' is said to be the limit of
that series. The book explains this with Zeno's paradox. Let's say you
start a distance 1 away from a wall and with each step, you travel half
the remaining distance to the wall (why is this a paradox?).
Using recursion and Sway, define a
function ''zeno''(''n'') that demonstrates this process. The argument
to zeno is the number of steps taken and the return value should be the
total distance travelled. What is the limit of the ''zeno'' series?

'''10'''.
Let
&lt;math&gt;g(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;h(x) = (g(1+x) - g(1-x))/(3 x)&lt;/math&gt;.
Calculate
&lt;math&gt;h(1)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;h(2)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;h(3)&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;h(0.5)&lt;/math&gt;. 
Express
&lt;math&gt;h(x)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of
&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
Draw a graph of ''h'' in the range &lt;math&gt;-2 \leq x \leq 2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''11'''.
The formula for the chance of an ''NPC'' (Non-Player Character)
landing a crushing blow in the World of Warcraft (a popular Massively
Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game or ''MMORPG''), 
is
&lt;math&gt;(\mathit{NPCLevel} * 5 - \mathit{PlayerDefense}) * 2%  - 15%&lt;/math&gt;.
For a level 70 NPC, express this as a function of
&lt;math&gt;PlayerDefense(x)&lt;/math&gt;
and give the value of defense that makes the chance 0. 

'''12'''.  
The amount of experience to level a character is
&lt;math&gt;
h(x) = g(x) * (1344 - ((69 - x) * ((69 - x) * 4 + 3))) + 155
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' is the character level and where &lt;math&gt;g(x) = 5x + 45&lt;/math&gt; is the basic amount of experience
earned for dispatching a mob of level equal to the character.
Calculate &lt;math&gt;h(61)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h(69)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h(0.5)&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;h(1)&lt;/math&gt;.
Express &lt;math&gt;h(x)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of ''x''.
Plot a graph of ''h'' for &lt;math&gt;61 \leq x \leq 69&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipesummary|Pasta recipes|4|30 minutes|1|image=[[File:Spaghetti served with meat sauce.jpg|300px]]}}
{{recipe}} | [[Category:Pasta recipes|Pasta recipes]]

==Ingredients== 
*One container of pasta sauce, usually about 2.5 cups or 24 ounces
*About four servings of spaghetti - amount may vary by package, but generally about 8 ounces or 224 grams.
*1 litre of water per 100 grams of pasta, so about 2.25 litres, or about 10 cups.
*About 1/4 cup water for the sauce

==Procedure==
#On a stovetop, bring the water to a boil on high heat. 
#Reduce heat to medium and add the pasta.
#While the spaghetti is cooking, pour desired amount of sauce into pan and set stove to medium. Add about 1/4 cup water, just enough to thin it out but not enough to dilute the taste.
#Set a timer for 7 minutes. When the timer goes off, fish out a strand of spaghetti and bite into it. What you're going for here is al dente, meaning that the pasta is just soft enough to eat; no longer crunchy in the middle, not mushy and over-done.
#When the sauce begins to bubble, reduce the heat to its lowest setting and cover. 
#Once the pasta is ready, carefully drain it through a colander into a sink. 
#Serve sauce over pasta in bowls.

==Tips==
*Add a liberal amount of salt to the pasta water before cooking, as this is the only chance you will have to season the pasta.
*Before cooking the sauce, consider [[Cookbook:sauté|sauté]]ing some finely minced onions, garlic, ground beef (or pork/sausage/veal/etc.), cheese (parmesean/mozzarella/etc.), mushrooms, or anything else that catches your fancy. Then add the sauce. 
*Cooking is about experimentation, never be afraid to try anything once!

      <comment>Questioning definition of NOT</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">''NOT: If a statement is preceded by &quot;NOT,&quot; then it is evaluating the opposite truth value of that statement. The symbol for &quot;NOT&quot; is For example, if the statement p is &quot;Elvis is dead,&quot; then ¬p would be &quot;Elvis is not dead.&quot; The concept of &quot;NOT&quot; can cause some confusion when it relates to statements which contain the word &quot;all.&quot; For example, if r is &quot;¬&quot;. &quot;All men have hair,&quot; then ¬r would be &quot;All men do not have hair&quot; or &quot;No men have hair.&quot; Do not confuse this with &quot;Not all men have hair&quot; or &quot;Some men have hair.&quot; The &quot;NOT&quot; should apply to the verb in the statement: in this case, &quot;have.&quot;'' 

_____________

I suggest that someone review this definition of NOT.

The truth-tables at the bottom of the Wiki page indicate that the negation of a true statement is a false statement, and vice versa.  This is consistent with notions of classical deductive logic.  Yet the above-quoted definition of NOT seems to contradict it.

The definition states that the negation of the proposition p &quot;All men have hair&quot; is &quot;All men do not have hair.&quot;  Assume that some, but that all, men have hair.  In this case, both the proposition p and its negation are false.  This contradicts the truth tables.  

In contrast, if &quot;All men have hair&quot; is false, then it seems intuitive to conclude that &quot;NOT all men have hair&quot; (or &quot;Some men do NOT have hair&quot;) is true.  That is, the NOT should apply to a proposition as a whole, not to the verb of the proposition in particular.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I liked the comparisons you made between the monster and upper class society, I also feel that the story was a look at humanism and the eternal desire to have companionship. Victor created the monster and then turned his back on him leaving him to fend for himself and to be excluded from the world around him. He never knew a kind or gental touch and went to great lengths to try to acquire it. He even tracked Victor down and demanded a femal counter part to share in his diformaty and solitude. The monster struggled with loneliness and solitude, he ultimitaly became evil to gain attention from his master. Everything leads back to human emotion and desire for companionship.</text>

You've reached the profile page of '''scrolls''', a technical writer from somewhere in '''Canada'''.

Since I write software manuals by day, I figured this would be a good place to practice my trade on other topics as well. Although considering how much writing I do during the day, I'm not sure I'll do much writing here, but nevertheless, I thought signing up for an account was a good thing to do ''just in case''.

'''This short piece is intended to communicate a few of the more basic points about styles for authors starting out with Wikibooks.   The system's style-sheets are not accessible for edit by authors but a considerable amount of CSS styling is still possible by the addition of HTML and Wikitext tags to the page.''' 

==Basics==
*'''Styles:''' These are sometimes called CSS style ''rules''.   They are delivered to the browser along with the Wikibooks' web-pages. They are sent in text files called ''style-sheets'', though fortunately they can be typed directly onto the Wikibooks edit area as well.
*'''User style-sheets form an exception'''.   Those who are familiar with this use of their browsers could modify the ''local'' display of a wiki web-page, but not the ''stored'' version that can be viewed by others.
*'''HTML tags and Wikitext tags can be added to the edit area of the work'''.   Authors can use either Wikitext or HTML tags in their work; in fact many of the HTML tags that are in general use could be used.   Wikibooks uses the ''Wikitext'' mark-up most of the time, but it is translated to HTML before it is sent to the browser for use. 
*'''Wikibooks authors are limited to in-line styles.'''   Authors do not have access to the style-sheets for the Wikibooks system.   They must write their styles into Wikitext tags or HTML tags that they add to the edit area of their pages.   If however, they know of classes of styles that already exist they can declare them in tags for use too.
*'''Templates can contain styles too.'''  Templates are named blocks of prepared text, with or without styles, that can be inserted into an authors work with a special format.  Complex tasks involving in-line styles, especially those that are to be used frequently can benefit from their use.   Templates made by others are available to all.
*'''In-line styles have a fairly high priority'''.   In fact, for those familiar with the subject, each in-line style declaration has a specificity that is one-thousand times that of a simple tag-selector, one-hundred times that of declarations within a ''class'' block, and ten times that of declarations within an ''id'' block.   That is to say, they override other author styles unless those other styles have an ''!important'' marking.
*'''HTML attributes are styles too.'''  Before the use of CSS styles HTML attributes were the main way to style web-pages.   Many of these attributes are no longer available in HTML5, but a few still are.   Because their future is uncertain, Wikibooks  prefers the use of CSS styles.
*'''Use a CSS styles reference'''.   To find the styles to apply in your work, the best way by far is to refer to a reference list.   A comprehensive list and tutorial for CSS styles can be found both within wikibooks itself and at the [http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp '''World Wide Web Consortium CSS Reference'''].

==In-line CSS Styles==
All in-line styles, whether written in HTML tags or Wikitext makes use of the ''Style'' attribute.   There should be only one style declaration in an element if confusion is not to result.

The following code is typical of an in-line style declaration for text to which paragraph tags have been added. It is used here to set the font name and its spacing.
&lt;pre style=&quot;color:black; border:1px solid lightgrey; background:white;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; line-height:1.75em; letter-spacing:0.1em;&quot;&gt;The text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
The main points to note about the style declaration are these:
*'''The style-block is always equated to the attribute ''style'' .'''
*'''The entire style-block is set in parenthesis'''. 
*'''There is a colon between each property and its value.'''
*'''Individual declarations are separated by semi-colons'''.
*'''Values that contain spaces must themselves be set in parenthesis'''
*'''A space can exist after a semi-colon.'''
*'''The last semi-colon is optional'''.
*'''Any number of declarations can be listed.'''
&lt;br&gt;
Some structures written in wikitext, such as tables, use a slightly different format but the style-part is the same.   Those with an interest in such formats should refer to the page [[Editing_Wikitext/Tables|'''Tables''']], and for a reference list and tutorial on CSS styles, refer to the site [http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp '''World Wide Web Consortium CSS Reference'''].

==Common Styling Tasks==
This section describes the basics of the more common styling tasks encountered by the new Wikibooks writer.   Writers are encouraged to add to this section with their useful findings.  Thus. in a healthy writing environment it should increase with time. 

===Styling Paragraph Text===
The most common task by far in Wikibooks styling involves changing the appearance of text.   There are two main methods available to the writer, the addition of ''paragraph tags'' that are then styled, or the similar use of ''span'' tags.   Both methods use a style expression of the type previously described and the layout of each is shown below.
&lt;pre style=&quot;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:16pt; color:blue;&quot;&gt;This is one whole paragraph....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;letter-spacing:0.15em; font-family:Garamond;&quot;&gt;This is text within a paragraph....&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;    
The ''span'' technique is usually reserved for short strings of text whereas styled ''paragraphs'' have more general use.   Paragraphs are examples of block elements, so they can have widths, margins, and other dimensions set for them.   The span tag is an example of an in-line element, without block styles.

If there are several paragraphs to style, rather that styling each, it is best to add a set of ''div'' tags around the work and to style that.    Then, provided that it is possible to do so, the styles will be inherited from the division tag.   The inheritance of styles is beyond the scope of this section but is covered elsewhere in [[The_CSS_Cascade#Inheritance_of_Styles|'''The CSS Cascade - Inheritance of Styles''']]. 

===Styling the 'Pre' Tags===
The ''Pre'' tags can be added to text when we need to preserve its exact layout.   That is to say, where the browser must be discouraged from doing formatting of its own.  Examples include the the writing of verse, lyrics, code listings, and various other purposes.   This kind of text is referred to as ''pre-formatted'' text to distinguish it from ''un-formatted'' text, the usual thing, where the browser wraps text at the end of lines.   These tags also have the effect of deactivating functional code like tables, and all other tags.   The basic code is just:
{{block|ta=left|background=ivory|&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; background:transparent; border:none;&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;
The time has come
the walrus said to
speak of many things...
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
The pre tags can be CSS-styled to produce different fonts, borders, and backgrounds, in addition to the full set of width, padding, margins and alignment that is common for all block elements.   See the example below, where a few styles have been added.   The ''white-space'' property makes sure that long lines are wrapped, instead of forcing the page width to widen.
{{block|ta=left|background=ivory|&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size: 1.1em; background:transparent; border:none; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;pre style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgrey; font-family:Arial; white-space:pre-wrap; background:beige;&quot;&amp;gt;
Text goes here...
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
More methods for pre-formatted text can be found at [[Editing_Wikitext/Preformatted_Text|'''Preformatted Text''']].

===Shifting the TOC===
One of the most useful things that styles can do is to shift the Table of Contents (TOC) to some precise point on the page.  This becomes essential when lists appear  at the top of a page.   In order to avoid the inevitable distortion of bullet-points the TOC can be simply moved to the right hand side of the page, as opposed to its habitual position on the left.

The usual method to do this is to place the Table of Contents in a table cell, and to then move the table to any place on the page that suits.    A table is chosen rather than a division because a table can change in size easily, to accommodate a changing TOC width.  Templates have been made that exploit this idea, including Template:Tocright.   Using HTML tags, the general form is just:
&lt;pre style=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
__TOC__
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Notice that the TOC inclusion is in capitals and has ''four'' underscores, ''two'' on each side.

For positioning on the ''right'' of a page the table could be styled as follows:     
&lt;pre style=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
__TOC__
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The float property places the table on the right of its container, the page, and allows text to wrap around it.  The text will start to wrap, starting with the line of text that follows the code block.   The margin property sets the spacing between the table container and the wrapped text.

Further information can found on the TOC at   [[Editing_Wikitext/Headings|'''Headings''']].

===Dividing the Page===
Pages can be divided into partitions.   This is useful when applying styles to large sections, and for making smaller box-like shapes.  

The size of the enclosed section is not important.   For example, the author's section of the page itself could be divided into two parts as follows.   Here, one part has been given a different background color from the remainder.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:beige; border:1px solid lightgrey; padding:10px;&quot;&gt;
First page part...
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:linen;  border:1px solid lightgrey; padding:10px;&quot;&gt;
Second page part...
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;   
The existing text and structures will be indented within these new colored containers by 10 pixels, about one tenth of an inch or so depending upon the resolution of screens.

==Useful CSS Classes==
Sadly, there are few if any useful classes that can add interest to an author's work.   There is a real need for a set of table classes; the condescension of the ''Wikitable'' class is really not sufficient.   It is a matter for web-masters to improve the availability of classes, since others have no access to the modification of style-sheets.   However, would it appear from the long standing of the basic table style that they think that they are ''just fine as they are''?

      <text xml:space="preserve">6.2 Geometry graph The geometry graph only list the objects, including lights in the workspace. Here you can lock, hide, duplicate and rename objects. The graph becomes more important as the number of objects in your scene increases.

The '''geometry graph window''' contains a vertical listing of all the objects currently in the geometry window. (If there are no objects at all, this window will be empty.) Adjacent and to the right of each object listed are three icons. One for object selection, one for object visibility, and one for wireframe mode. Left clicking the icon toggles its status. Right clicking the icon toggles the status of all other icons.

Considering the convienience and usefulness of this particular window, it is recommended by most users that you keep it open and to the left or right of the geometry window workspace. This way you have a fast alternate method to select, see whats selected, or hide things without having to go through many actions or menus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Plugins expand the functionality of Wings3D with capabilities not found in the basic Wings3D installation. They can do things such as adding new tools, import/export capabilities, or other features that may be considered too unusual or experimental for inclusion into a regular Wings3D release. Typically, they consist of an [[Erlang Programming|Erlang]] [[.beam]] file, but may include supporting files. They are installed by either directly copying the file to the Wings3D plugin directory or by using the dialog available through the '''Edit|Plug-in preferences''' menu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">On the ending part (or least it was when I just visited) about the nature of normals, you might consider pointing out that a normal could be pointing one of two ways in regards to faces. Wings3D hides normal backfaces by default, so you'd observe some clipping or no surfaces at all (inverted cube is a good example.) But to remove all uncertainty, there's also an option to view the normals. And I also believe that there are normals in regards to the selection types. An edge's normal can be a different vector than that of a face or vertex. Only thing is, would mentioning that in the exercise be more confusing to new users?

      <text xml:space="preserve">USR ABS(expr) 

&lt;b&gt; Description &lt;/b&gt; This function returns the absolute value of expr. 

The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero: the absolute value of -23 is 23; the absolute value of 16 is 16. 

USR ABS is slower than the ABS function, but it is included for backward compatibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;USR APPLESCRIPTGETRESULT&lt;/b&gt; 

&lt;b&gt;Revised&lt;/b&gt; June, 2003 (Release 8) 

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt; - This routine returns a handle pointing to the data in memory returned by an AppleScript script executed with USR APPLESCRIPTRUN or USR APPLESCRIPLOADANDRUN. If there is no result or if the routine fails to retrieve the data, the value returned by USR APPLESCRIPTGETRESULT is _nil. You are responsible for the disposing of the handle returned (if any). You must be aware that the routine empties the AppleScript internal buffer. You could possibly use the USR APPLESCRIPTGETRESULT function to retrieve the text source of your entire script right after storing it into the AppleScript buffer using the ROUTE and PRINT statements, however you cannot expect to compile and execute the script afterwards, since the buffer would be empty. In a general manner, you must call the USR APPLESCRIPTGETRESULT function after a script has been executed whether an error occurred or not and dispose of the handle returned if any and if necessary. 

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;
The following example will return the list of all the folders located at the root level of your hard drive: 

INCLUDE &quot;Subs AppleScript.Incl&quot; DIM AS STR255 

DIM AS HANDLE textH

DIM AS RECT r WINDOW 1

CALL SetRect

CALL InsetRect( r, 32, 32 )

&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;NEED LINK!!!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
EDIT FIELD 1,&quot;&quot;,@r ROUTE _toAppleScript

PRINT &quot;the name of every folder of the startup disk&quot;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;NEED LINK!!!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
ROUTE _toScreen err = USR APPLESCRIPTRUN

H = USR APPLESCRIPGETRESULT

LONG IF H
   TESetText([H],FN GetHandleSize(H), TEHANDLE(1))
   DisposeHandle( H )
   CLS
XELSE
   EDIT$( 1 ) = message$

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;USR APPLESCRIPTLOADANDRUN&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Revised&lt;/b&gt; June, 2003 (Release 8) 

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt; - This routine loads and executes the AppleScript script specified by resID% and located in the file specified by fSpec. If the routine fails to launch the script errorFlag is set to a non-zero value. If the script returns a result, you can get a handle pointing to the data using the USR APPLESCRIPTGETRESULT function. Note that the script might also return an error in the AppleScript buffer, therefore you should always empty the buffer after a script has been executed getting the result with USR APPLESCRIPTGETRESULT then disposing of the handle returned if any. fSpec is an FSSpec record specifying an existing file. If you pass _nil for the fSpec parameter, the script will be retrieved from the resource fork of the running application. 

Note:
Usually, resID% is set to 128 which is the default resource ID for Apple's compiled scripts. However, if you pass 0 for this parameter, the routine will assume an ID of 128, thus USR APPLESCRIPLOADANDRUN(0,0) is functionally equivalent to USR APPLESCRIPLOADANDRUN(appSpec,128). In order for the script to function properly, your program must have entered its main event loop before it attempts to run the script.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;USR APPLESCRIPTRUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;( errorMessage$ )&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Revised&lt;/b&gt; June, 2003 (Release 8) 

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt; - This function compiles and executes an AppleScript script that has been previously stored in FB's AppleScript internal buffer with the ROUTE statement. The result returned by the routine is in the form of a flag that indicates whether the script was successfully compiled (_noErr) or if the operation has failed (non-zero value). The errorMessage$ parameter will contain the result of the script (if any) or a human friendly error message from AppleScript. The errorMessage$ variable is set up to contain up to 255 characters, consequently if the result of the script is larger than the maximum allowed, you will not get the full data returned by the script. In such case you may wish to use the USR APPLESCRIPTGETRESULT routine to get a handle to the entire result. In any case you must call that function to empty the AppleScript buffer and dispose of the possible handle returned. Example:

The following example will return the file access path of the running application: 

INCLUDE &quot;Subs AppleScript.Incl&quot;

DIM err

DIM reply$ or DIM reply AS STR255 &lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;NEED LINK!!!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ROUTE _toAppleScript

PRINT &quot;path to me as string&quot;

ROUTE _toScreen err = USR APPLESCRIPTRUN

IF err = _noErr THEN PRINT reply$ resultHandle = USR APPLESCRIPTGETRESULT

IF resultHandle THEN CALL DisposeHandle( resultHandle ) 

Program output: Macintosh HD:AppleScriptRun folder:FB_Temp Note:
In order for the script to function properly, your program must have entered its main event loop before it attempts to run the script.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;Usr AppleScriptStore&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(fSpec, resID%, scriptName$)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Revised&lt;/b&gt; August, 2002 (Release 7) 

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt; - This routine saves a compiled script into the resource fork of the file specified by fSpec with a resource ID and a resource name specified respectively by resID% and scriptName$. Once you have filled the AppleScript internal buffer with the Route and Print statements, you may wish to store the script permanently in compiled format for later use. The resulting script file can be run with the &lt;b&gt;Usr AppleScriptLoadAndRun&lt;b&gt; routine as well as with any application that can run &lt;b&gt;AppleScript&lt;/b&gt; scripts such as &lt;b&gt;Apple Script Editor&lt;/b&gt;. fSpec is an FSSpec record that specifies a file. If the file doesnÕt exist, it is created. If you pass _nil for the fSpec parameter, the resulting compiled script will be stored in the resource fork of the running application. resID% is usually set to 128 (the default resource ID for AppleÕs compiled scripts), and if you pass zero for this parameter the routine will assume an ID of 128. The routine will override any existing script having the same ID in the file specified. 

For example, &lt;b&gt;Usr AppleScriptStore&lt;/b&gt; would store or replace in the resource fork of the running application a script with resource ID 128 whose resource name would be ÒMy ScriptÓ. You can pass a null string for the scriptName$ parameter.

&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt; In order for the script to function properly, your program must have entered its main event loop before it attempts to run the script. The AppleScript routines are made available to your program with the following Include statement: 

&lt;b&gt;Include&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Subs AppleScript.Incl&quot;

&lt;b&gt;Revised&lt;/b&gt; June 2001 (Release 5)

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt; - This function takes the picture information from one disk file and translates it into a different format. A new file is built with the correct file type and creator in the location that you determine. If the final four parameters are left blank, QuickTime will bring up a &quot;Save As...&quot; dialog so that you may specify the type of file, its name, and its location. The following example opens a graphic file and translates it into any specified format. 

&lt;b&gt;Include&lt;/b&gt;
 &quot;Subs Image Files.Incl&quot; gFBUseNavServices = _zTrue
&lt;b&gt; WHAT IS THIS!!!&lt;/b&gt;

dim fName$,err
dim @vRef% fName$ = files$(_fOpen,,&quot;Locate a picture&quot;,vRef%) long if fName$[0]
  err = USR CONVERTIMAGEFILE(fName$,vRef%,&quot;&quot;,0,0,0)

end if Note:
Before you can use this function, you must include it in your project with the following statement: 
include &quot;Subs Image Files.Incl&quot;

&lt;b&gt;Revised&lt;/b&gt; FEBRUARY, 2002 (Release 6) 

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt; - This function copies a file from one location to another. If the copy is successful, the function returns _noErr (zero). If the copy fails, a file error code is returned. In the process of this operation, the original file is left intact. The source and destination folders may be the same if the file name is different. 

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;

The following example allows the user to select a file and a new destination before calling the USR COPYFILE function. 

&lt;b&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Util_Files.incl&quot; DIM filename$,folderName$,destName$
DIM @vRefNum%,destVref%
DIM err fileName$ = FILES$(_fOpen,,&quot;Select a file to move&quot;,vRefNum) LONG IF LEN(fileName$)
   folderName$ = FILES$(_fFolder,,,destVref%)    LONG IF LEN(folderName$)
destName$ = &quot;Copy of&quot; + filename$
err = USR COPYFILE(fileName$, vRefNum, ¬
0, destName$, destVref, 0)
LONG IF err
PRINT &quot;File was not copied.&quot;
XELSE
PRINT &quot;File copy successful.&quot;
END IF
   END IF

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;USR DYNAMICITEMSIZE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;( arrayPtr&amp; )&lt;/i&gt; 

&lt;b&gt;Revised:&lt;/b&gt;
November; 2006 (FB 4, Release 4) 

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt; - This function returns the element size specified when the array was DIMensioned. This is a runtime equivalent of SIZEOF( gMyDynamicArray ), which is actually a compiler directive. It is for use in generic functions where only the address of the dynamic array is known to avoid the necessity of passing the size as a parameter. 

Note:
Whether currently populated or not, a dynamic array must have held data at some point before being passed to this function.

arrayPtr&amp; is a pointer to any FutureBASIC Dynamic Array previously dimensioned using DYNAMIC or DIMÊDYNAMIC. In typical usage, this address will come from a parameter to the calling function, such as ( @arrayPtr AS PTR ), to which the name of a dynamic array would be passed.

&lt;b&gt;See Also&lt;/b&gt; DEF DYNAMICINSERTITEMS; DEF DYNAMICREMOVEITEMS; SIZEOF

a4 is a joke of an opening. I understand the desire for this wikibook to be exhaustive but the fact that there are some major lines missing and yet this page exists is ridiculous. [[User:Tomson|Tomson]] ([[User talk:Tomson|talk]]) 00:14, 30 April 2008 (UTC)
::While I totally agree it's a joke move. There are a few reasons for the page
::*Unusual 1st moves are are required for presentation on [[Opening_theory_in_chess#All_possible_first_white_moves]]
::*Same issue in the navigation template.
::*If the page didn't exist someone would create it and if they followed some of the advice written by some other here, they would copy the page that linked to it, i.e the main [[Opening_theory_in_chess]] page which is not an easy way to start with a new page.
::*Unusual moves(not just 1.a4) get a lot of traffic, many times what you'd expect, quite strange and can't really find out why. I guess people are just curious. Why for example did you come and look at the page? It does show it's viewed a lot, even if as a chess player it's an irrelevant move.
:::On wikibooks you could image people clicking a4 because it's on the main page and navigation template. But that's not true on wikipedia that doesn't really have a navigation between openings.
:::And guess what, on wikipedia views of 1. a4 are higher they views of the Sicilian Accelerated Dragon. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 16:44, 30 April 2008 (UTC)
:::: I wound up here, because someone actually did pull it on me, and I couldn't imagine why. I still can't. [[User:Mechroneal|Mechroneal]] ([[User talk:Mechroneal|talk]]) 22:22, 15 July 2008 (UTC)
:::::Same here - the game didn't last long though... [[User:Alan16|Alan16]] ([[User talk:Alan16|talk]]) 16:44, 14 August 2009 (UTC)
::::::why I play it: at a lower level (around ELO:12-1400), where the shortcomings of this opening aren't as fatal, it's advantage is that it throws people out of book openings, forcing them to rely on their opening ''skills'' rather than opening ''knowledge'': if you haven't memorized opening books, it can allow you to beat platers who are 'better' because they have, but haven't developed any actual opening ''skill''. I've played several games that go 1.a4 e5 2.b4 Bxb4 3.Ba3 Bxa3 4.Rxa3 resulting in white being a pawn down and black having no idea how to proceed if he's relying on playing from memorized openings --[[User:Arkelweis|Arkelweis]] ([[User talk:Arkelweis|talk]]) 09:56, 7 November 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would be in favor of deleting this page entirely. This can hardly even be considered an opening. There is no strategy involved and no benefits. Is there even any historical support for calling this the &quot;crab&quot; opening? Some novice wikipedian is having a laugh by putting this entry in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;USR FILEEXISTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(fileName$, vRefNum%, dirID&amp;)&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Revised&lt;/b&gt; February, 2002 (Release 6) 

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt; - Your program may determine whether or not a file exists using this function. A non-zero value is returned when the file is present. You need to pass the fileName and the vRefNum% in all cases, but the dirID&amp; can usuually be zero. To determine if a file named &quot;My File&quot; is present in the application folder you would use the following code. LONG IF USR FILEEXISTS(&quot;My File&quot;, SYSTEM(_aplVol), 0)
   PRINT &quot;File exists!&quot;
&lt;b&gt;END IF&lt;/b&gt; Note:
You will not be able to use this function unless you include the proper header file as follows: 

&lt;b&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Util_Files.incl&quot; 

&lt;b&gt;See Also&lt;/b&gt; USR FSFILEEXISTS

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;USR FONTHEIGHT&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt; - This function returns the current &quot;font height&quot; in pixels. This is based on the current font ID and font size for the current output window or printer. The font height is the full height of a line of text, measured from the top of one line to the top of the line below it. It is not the same thing as the &quot;font size,&quot; although there is often a relationship between the font size and the font height. The font height is the sum of the font's &quot;ascent,&quot; its &quot;descent&quot; and its &quot;leading.&quot; See the &quot;Font Manager&quot; chapter in Inside Macintosh: Text for more information. 

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;
USR FONTHEIGHT is useful for determining how many lines of text will fit within a rectangle of a given height. This LOCAL FN returns the number of text lines that can fit in the current window: LOCAL FN MaxLines
   wh = WINDOW(_height)
   fh = USR FONTHEIGHT
   max = wh \\ fh
   END FN = max

&lt;b&gt;Revised&lt;/b&gt; February, 2002 (Release 6) 

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt; - Your program may determine whether or not a file exists using this function. A non-zero value is returned when the file is present. You need to pass a file spec record which can be created using FN FBmakeFSSpec or by using a file spec version of the FILES$ function. To determine if a file named &quot;My File&quot; is present in the application folder your would use the following code. 

INCLUDE &quot;Util_Files.incl&quot; DIM fs AS FSSpec
FN FBmakeFSSpec(SYSTEM(_aplVol),0,&quot;My File&quot;,fs)
LONG IF USR FSFILEEXISTS(fs)
   PRINT &quot;File exists!&quot;

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt; - Rather than deleting a file, it is often desirable to move it to the trash. In this way, your user has a chance to retrieve it from the trash if he changes his mind. This particular version of the function requires a file spec record for operation. 

See Appendix H for information on file spec records.

You will not be able to use this function unless you include the proper header file as follows:

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt; - This function captures a picture of a portion of the screen using the screen's current color depth, and returns a handle to the picture. Given the handle, you can then draw the picture (using the PICTURE statement), or save the picture as a &quot;PICT&quot; resource (using the ADDRESOURCE Toolbox routine), etc. The captured picture is bound by the rectangle which is specified in rect (which should be an 8-byte variable such a RECT type), or which is pointed to by rectAddr&amp; (which should be a long-integer expression or a POINTER variable). The rectangle should be expressed in the local coordinate system of the current output window. The captured picture is also limited to the &quot;clip region&quot; of the current output window. Therefore, what actually gets captured is the intersection of the clip region and the specified rectangle. The captured picture is not limited to the visible contents of the window. Whatever is on the screen within the specified rectangle (and within the clip region) will get captured. By appropriately adjusting the rectangle and the clip region, you can capture any part of the screen you want. 

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;

This program captures a snapshot of the entire screen, then displays the snapshot at 1/2 scale in a small window. DIM rect.8, pt.4

sWidth = SYSTEM(_scrnWidth)

sHeight = SYSTEM(_scrnHeight)

'Define rect as entire screen, in local co-ord's:

The very beginning moves of the King's gambit state that the king pushes his f-pawn for the sake of getting the chance to play d4; where doe sthat move take place? Here it would be disasterous upon Qh4+. [[User:Tomson|Tomson]] ([[User talk:Tomson|talk]]) 01:19, 30 April 2008 (UTC)
:Where does it say that? Anyway the move 2. f4 means that d4 becomes unlikely. Would be more likely after 2. Nf3 or c3 which support a possible d4 push and by playing 2. f4 there is pressure on the Kingside first to deal with before d4 can be played. That being said there are some lines in the Kings gambit accepted and also the Falkbeer(3. f4 d5) where d4 can be played. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 16:25, 30 April 2008 (UTC)
::I've found what your referring to the King's Gambit, [[w:King's Gambit]]. White is threatening to play d4 but doesn't get around to it for some time in the main line as there are more important things. Initially after 2. f4 exf4 3. d4 would be a mistake because of 3...Qh4 and so instead white plays 3. Nf3 but unless black plays relatively passively (3...d6 or 3..h6) white doesn't get around to playing  d4 for several more moves. Debateably it should not be played anyway as the main line goes 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ne5 d6 6. Nxg4 Be7 7. d4 ( 7.d3 is considered a more solid and better try here I believe).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Requirements and characteristics==
What are, in general, the different requirements of the extraction of the clock from an incoming (encoded) bit stream?&lt;br /&gt;
They are essentially related to two different phases of the CDR operation:
# Acquisition of the phase lock
# Tracking of the acquired phase timing once the acquisition is sufficient.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''CDRs and parts per million of frequency mismatch'''&lt;br&gt;

Parts per million, denoted as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_million| ppm], is used to give a relative measure of the frequency difference of two oscillators.&lt;br&gt;
For example if an oscillator runs at 155 MHz and another at 155.13 MHz, they differ by  (155.13 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; – 155 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)/(155 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)  = 8,38006832978792 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; which is the same as 838 ppm.&lt;br&gt;
The free running frequency of a slave CDR may differ no more than 50 ppm from the frequency of its
remote master (not a stringent requirement if assisted by a low cost quartz crystal), or 10000 ppm (easy even with an
RC oscillator home made!), or differ less than 1 ppm, still without big cost concerns.&lt;br&gt;
For instance, less than 0.5 ppm
accuracy for a local (not locked) oscillator is becoming standard for GPS receivers inside mobile phones nowadays.
Less than 0.1 ppm means quasi professional equipment.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Acquisition===
To study the acquisition phase, the best mathematic tool is the '''unit step response''' of the loop.&lt;br&gt;
As long as the received signal is not present, the CDR is kept idle by the LOS control signal, which is generated by the first stages of the receiver, (LOS = Loss Of Signal).&lt;br&gt;
When the LOS is deactivated, the CDR is released and the acquisition phase begins.&lt;br&gt;
The phase of the incoming signal has at that moment (in all practical cases) a random difference from the phase of the local oscillator of the CDR. The CDR then reacts (like any control system does react) to the abrupt step change of the input signal.&lt;br&gt;
[[Clock and Data Recovery/Design values used in practice#Just two architectures|There are only two CDR architectures of practical use, and the acquisition behaviors of the two are markedly different.]]&lt;br&gt;

One of the two architectures (the simplest one, called &quot;[[Clock and Data Recovery/Design values used in practice|first order loop of type 1]]&quot;) has the best acquisition performances.&lt;br&gt;
Its response to an abrupt change of phase (step input), even if combined with a frequency difference between the timing of the received signal and the free running frequence of the local oscillator (ramp input), is always free from initial overshhoots.&lt;br&gt;
In fact the phase difference during the acquisition is always a decreasing function and the acquisition transient of this type of circuit is always free of initial &quot;slips&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Acquisition 1st order.png|center|900px]]
''There are other CDRs (based on the more sophisticated architecture, called &quot;[[Clock and Data Recovery/Design values used in practice|second order loop of type 1]]&quot;) whose acquisition is inevitably long and sometimes a series of slips precedes the achievement of a stable acquisition.''&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Acquisition after some slips back and forth total lock delay 2 pi.png|center|900px]]
''Although the presence of slips at the beginning of the acquisition is considered acceptable in some application ([[#Regenerator CDRs|Regenerator CDRs]]), it should be restricetd only to cases of real necessity for two reasons:''
* '' it is impossible to model it because of the intrinsic hard non linearities (and therefore it is difficult to have absolute confidence in it)''
* '' it is really inelegant!''

===Tracking===
[[File:Unstable acquisition with periodic slips.png|center|900px]]
&lt;center&gt;''Poor tracking: when the input jitter becomes larger, the loop slips twice, then locks-in again.''&lt;/center&gt;
====All CDRs====
To study the tracking state, the fundamental characteristic of all CDRs is:
* the ability to operate correctly (that is with a low enough Bit Error Rate = BER) in the presence of a given jitter. This is called '''Jitter Tolerance''' (or Jitter Acceptance), and is often specified  as a mask of jitter amplitude versus jitter frequency. The circuit must operate correctly at any condition defined by a jitter amplitude and a jitter frequency within the boundary set by the mask. In other words, the locus of the conditions of onset of BER shall be measured and found above (=at higher jitter magnitudes than) the boundary set by the mask.
{{Anchor|Regenerator CDRs}}

====Regenerator (*) CDRs====
&lt;small&gt;''(*) A regenerator CDR is a slave CDR that is used as a master for at least another CDR further downstream.''&lt;/small&gt;


When the CDR regenerated clock times the regenerated data stream that is resent further on (which is a common case), two other characteristics are important as well:
* the filtering of jitter frequencies above the frequency range involved in the lock-in and tracking. This is called '''Jitter Transfer''' &lt;u&gt;function&lt;/u&gt;, and there often exists a &lt;u&gt;mask&lt;/u&gt; setting an upper limit for the curve that characterizes our circuit ''(the jitter transfer function is the ratio, at any given frequency, of the magnitude of the sinusoidal jitter at the output to the magnitude of the sinusoidal jitter at the input).''
:The presence of a filter block in the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order PLL allows one more degree of design freedom (instead of &amp;tau; only, &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;zeta; can be chosen). The 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order architecture is used when particular requirements (for jitter and/or noise and/or effects of non-linearities filtering) make the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order PLL inadequate. The quantity &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; essentially defines the cut off frequency of the low pass effect that such PLL has on the incoming jitter.

 
* the amount of '''Generated Jitter''' inside our circuit (phase noise added to the retrieved timing signal). Often specified as:
** a rms or peak value for the output wander ( &lt; 10 Hz) with zero input wander, and 
** as a curve of maximum magnitude vs frequency for jitter (&gt; 10 Hz). 

See, for instance, the TDEV (Time Deviation) and the MTIE (Maximum Time Interval Error) used by the ITU-T inside its Recommendations &lt;ref&gt;ITU-T Recommendation G.810 (08/96) Definitions and terminology for synchronization networks, 4.5.17 time deviation (TDEV or sx)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;ITU-T Recommendation G.810 (08/96) Definitions and terminology for synchronization networks 
, 4.5.15 maximum time interval error (MTIE)&lt;/ref&gt;for wander limit definition,  and &lt;ref&gt;. ITU - T G.823 The control of jitter and wander within digital networks which are based on the 2048 kbit/s hierarchy, 5 Network limits for traffic interfaces, and 6 Network limits for synchronization interfaces&lt;/ref&gt; for output jitter as well.

&lt;small&gt;The ITU-T, in its Recommendations [http://www.itu.int/publications/sector.aspx?lang=en&amp;sector=2 Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)], is an invaluable source of theory and practical knowledge on the subject. It primarily deals with the requirements of large, geographical, networks, and therefore these Recommendations are especially useful, and exact in their quantitative references, for the engineer that studies Telecom digital networks, but they can also provide a lot of insight if other fields of application of CDRs are being targeted.&lt;/small&gt;

===Acquisition and tracking===
====Normalized frequency and time scales====
The mathematical models proposed in the following pages often use normalization of the frequency and time scales. This approach focuses on the fundamental concepts: concepts that become then easier to grasp, remember and use.&lt;br&gt;

De-normalization puts the actual value of the natural angular frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, that applies to the specific case under study, in the place of the value of 1 rad/sec used for modeling.&lt;br&gt;
The time τ that appears in the time functions shall be readjusted in the same way, rescaling 1 sec to its actual value of  1/(ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) sec. 

&lt;u&gt;The angular frequency with which the signal pulsed are received, ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, on the other hand, does not always appear in the models.&lt;/u&gt;

In fact the frequency of the received pulses f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (= ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/(2π)) is a fundamental circuit characteristic of the phase comparator and of the VCO, that are circuits which operate at f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (= ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/(2π)).&lt;br&gt;
The filter block only instead does not have to process frequencies around f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, and very often only processes frequencies at least one or two decades lower that  f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
But, as a result of closing the loop and investigating the relation between phase of the input signal and phase of the output signal in the jω domain, the whole PLL is characterized and studied only in the same range of frequencies that the filter processes!&lt;br&gt;
Not infrequently the actual value of f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is neglected in some descriptions of the PLL operation and does not even appear in most of the modeling equations.&lt;br&gt;
All in all, the line pulse frequency f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; appears in this book less often than one may expect!

====When f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be neglected====
# '''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the frequency of the discrete time representation'''
The study of CDRs is the study of discrete time systems, that are sampled at the frequency of the received pulses f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
The jω representation of the system behavior is therefore meaningful up to f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, and then shall be considered to repeat itself periodically at higher frequencies, without additional information to offer.

# '''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; as the best possible tracking'''
The value of f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is fundamental especially in its relation with [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR' VCO|the VCO free running frequency f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;br /&gt;
This relation, in association with the PLL gain, [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR' VCO#Frequency accuracy of the VCO for tight jitter rejection of the PLL|sets the design lower limit for the bandwidth of the closed loop]].&lt;br /&gt;
The f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; difference is the cause of steady state offsets in some of the PLL nodes and appears - in the most common types of PLL, those of type 1 - as a steady state offset between input and output that is in fact a [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/The error function#The steady state error due to fp – ffr difference and the steady state error of sampling time|steady state deviation of the sampling time at the CDR input, away from the optimum instant]]. In those PLLs, as it decreases the noise immunity, it is kept to a minimum by design.

#'''Lack of regularity of the incoming pulse stream'''
There are also, in addition to the above considerations, a few moments during the CDR operation when the relation between '''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''' and the loop bandwidth '''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' (i.e. ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;/(2π)) is important for the performances and even for the theory of operation.&lt;br /&gt;
It is not a big surprise that such moments are those when the received pulses lack in regularity or continuity!&lt;br /&gt;
Three are these important moments when f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; has necessarily to be kept into account:There
# Start of reception.    The receiver starts when a signal with sufficient power is detected by the LOS (Loss Of Signal) block, more precisely at the moment when the LOS is de-asserted.
## Burst mode. If the transmission system is meant to operate with intervals of no signal power alternated with intervals of normal transmission ([[Clock and Data Recovery/Design values used in practice/Burst transmission mode|Burst Mode System]]), then the CDR is based on a [[Clock and Data Recovery/Introduction/Models can only be linear..| 1st order control loop]]. This type of implementation is best fit for efficient acquisition, but is not remarkable in presence of micro-interruptions or of long sequences of pulses without level transitions.
## Continuous mode. If instead the start of reception is a exceptional occurrence in our system ([[Clock and Data Recovery/Design values used in practice/Continuous transmission mode|Continuous Mode System]]), then the CDR is based on a [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL|2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order control loop]]. This implementation suffers from longer acquisition phases, but is more resilient to micro-interruptions and to long sequences of pulses without level transitions.
# Micro interruptions. These are short periods during which the transmitted signal does not reach the receiver (for many, different and often queer reasons!). When such interruptions last sufficiently, the CDR may drift out of lock. When the signal re-appears, a new acquisition must start. The micro-interruption will be prolonged by the new acquisition phase. It is also possible that the CDR has slipped one or more clock cycles during the interruption: this has heavy consequences downstream where a new frame sync shall be achieved because of the slip(s): the micro interruption duration is multiplied in its propagation downstream! The risk of propagating and widening the interruptions downstream is sometimes mitigated by circuits inside the CDR that take advantage of the fast detection of the micro interruption by the LOS circuitry.[[Image:The LOS unlocks the CDR.png|thumb|center|720px]]This type of circuit forces the phase lock loop open during the LOS assertion, and lets the VCO to continue free-running without phase discontinuity, until the signal re appears. At that moment the VCO may have drifted very little and the CDR can restart sampling with a good enough phase.
# Lack of level transitions in the received signal (for a considerable number of pulses). This aspect is fundamental when the bits to be transmitted are sent as a pulse (bit 1) or as a no pulse (bit 0) [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-return-to-zero|Non Return to Zero NRZ]].&gt; 
##'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_code| Line codes]'''   When the information bits are transformed into signal pulses according to a “line” code, sometimes even with more than just two signal levels, it is less probable (with some codes it is outright impossible) than a long sequence of bit 1, or of bit 0, or another special sequence of bits, results into a signal without change of level (=without signal “transitions”). 
##'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambler| Scrambler]'''   Sometimes the flow of bits to be transmitted is altered (=scrambled), before being converted into signal pulses. The scramber circuit converts any long sequence of identical bits into a sequence with frequent changes of polarity, but also renders the probability of a long sequence of identical bits inside the scrambled flow practically negligible.&lt;br&gt;
##[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model| In the '''OSI stack'''] other processes elaborate the flow of bits to be transmitted. They are located at higher levels of the OSI (Open System Interconnection model) stack; first the process corresponding to lowest OSI levels adds bits to the information bit flow, and then each of the others increasing levels in the stack follows. In ascending order:
:::*level 1: S/N improvement by FEC, scrambling, TDM framing,..
:::*level 2: Ethernet 8B/10B byte encoding, Ethernet frame and interframe bytes, CRC,..
:::*Level 3: Internet Protocol framing,..
:::*level 4: Transfer Control Protocol framing,..




In spite of all that, CDRs are frequently specified, designed and characterized in order to stay in phase lock even in presence of long sequences of identical signal pulses in the received signal (in the order of thousands of pulses and sometimes even more).

The phase error may increase to some extent, but a good lock will be recovered as soon as transitions reappear. In the meantime the recovery (=decoding) of the received pulses should take place correctly.

What happens when the received signal does not exhibit, from a certain instant on, any more transition?

The phase comparator circuit does not produce any significant output, and the PLL operates in “open loop” condition.

In all slave CDRs the  sampling moment drifts away from the optimal position that corresponds to the locked condition of the  PLL.&lt;br /&gt;
The sampling instant leaves the center of the received pulses, as the lock control is interrupted and no longer keeps input phase and local oscillation phase together.

After a while, errors may begin to appear in the data flow that comes out of the CDR, and even slips finally appear (slip = a lost or an added clock cycle with respect to the transmit clock).&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;It may seem that sampling samples of the same polarity should not lead to errors, even if the sampling instant drifts as described above.&lt;br /&gt;
:This is not true in many cases: consider for instance the common case of NRZ transmission where low frequencies and d.c. have been removed from the received signal. The sequence of received pulses with the same polarity becomes something like a decaying exponential waveform that eventually disappears under the noise floor.&lt;br /&gt;
:Either an alarm circuit intervenes to declare a LOS, or the CDR jitters randomly and outputs random bits!&lt;br /&gt;
:The slips that inevitably take place in that condition are by themselves a problem. If a section of the network downstream is slaved to this CDR, errors will result wherever (upstream for instance) the original clock domain is re-entered.&lt;/small&gt;

As long as the sequence of identical pulses persists the situation worsen until the frequency of slips corresponds to the difference:
&lt;center&gt;frequency of received pulses – frequency of the free running sampling frequency.&lt;/center&gt;

In some extreme cases, where the above difference is small, some transmission may still be possible, but with a heavy penalty in terms of error-ed bits and slips (= frequent retransmission of the blocks that are detected in error).

===The jitter tolerance of an equipment {{Anchor|The tolerance function}}===

In digital networks it is established practice ''&lt;small&gt;(see for instance some of the ITU-T Recommendations G7xx [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G/e])&lt;/small&gt;'' to specify (e.g. &lt;ref&gt;ITU-T Rec. G.813 (03/2003) in particular Appendix II&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;-G.825-2000.03-The control of jitter and wander within digital networks which are based on the synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH): 6.1 Jitter and wander tolerance for STM-N input ports&lt;/ref&gt;), and to characterise by measurement &lt;ref&gt;Ransom Stephens, “Tektronics Jitter 360° Knowledge Series” from http://www.tek.com/learning/ &lt;/ref&gt;, the jitter that can be tolerated at the input ports of an equipment.

At any frequency of interest, a sinusoidal input jitter is added to the phase of an otherwise flawless incoming signal, and the jitter [[w:Amplitude|amplitude]] is increased as much as the equipment can tolerate. Beyond that limit, the received data stream is not regenerated perfectly and error bits or slips begin to appear. The same procedure is repeated at different jitter frequencies, to cover all the frequency band of interest for the jitter tolerance and the results are interpolated to obtain a continuous curve.

'''The boundary of the area (in the plane of jitter frequencies and magnitudes) where the CDR operates without bit errors is then called the curve of jitter tolerance of that equipment'''.

The errors can either be generated by sampling the received pulses too far from the optimum point, or by slips. In both cases, the tolerance limit has been exceeded.
* '''Slips''' can either come from exceeding the range of the phase comparator, or by exceeding the range of an elastic buffer. The slip is a catastrophic event in terms of BER because, after its occurrence, 50% (statistically) of the regenerated bits are seen as errors and 50% (statistically) are seen as fictitiously correct. The BER is as high as it can ever be (until the framing circuits are able to get in sync again). 
* '''Error-ed bits'''.  The CDR under test extracts the clock directly from the pulses of the received signal, and then uses it to regenerate the pulses received.  The tolerance limit will be reached when the clock that samples the incoming pulses is too far (too early or too late) from the optimum point (the point of “maximum eye opening”, that approximately coincides with the central point between transitions).  Such distance from the central sampling point, beyond which errors begin to occur, is called &lt;span id=&quot;lateral eye opening&quot;&gt;'''lateral eye opening &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;LEO&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;. Error-ed bits will give evidence that the tolerance limit has been exceeded (even if they only pop up sparsely in small bursts at the moments of peak amplitude of the jitter sinusoidal oscillation).
==== Remarks ====
# The jitter tolerance curve '''always has a &quot;low-pass&quot; shape'''. The tracking ability of an equipment is best at low frequencies and is low at high frequencies.
# '''At high frequencies''', where no more tracking takes place, the equipment can only tolerate the jitter that does not bring the sampling instant to the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Introduction/Definition of (phase) jitter#Eye diagram|eye corners]]. With zero jitter, the sampling point is offset from the central point by the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs#Loop type and steady state error|steady state error]], if the steady state error is non zero. If the steady state error is zero, the sampling point is in the eye center.&lt;br /&gt;The tolerance at high frequencies is just '''a horizontal asymptote''', and the asymptote value indicates, for the equipment port under measurement, the difference:&lt;center&gt;'''&amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;LEO&lt;/sub&gt; - steady state error''' &lt;/center&gt;
#:where the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs#Loop type and steady state error|steady state error]] is the possible error corresponding to an offset of the frequency of the incoming pulses from the free-running frequency of the local oscillator. 
#:Such error is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\omega_p - \omega_{fr}}{G}&lt;/math&gt;  [rad] in a slave system of type 1, and is 0 [rad] in a phase aligner system or in any type 2 system.

## '''- 20 dB/decade'''. This indicated that the receiver is a slave (the local oscillator can follow an infinite phase accumulation, as long as its frequency can track the incoming pulse frequency). The - 20 dB/decade slope tells that the PLL is a '''type 1''' loop.
## '''- 40 dB/decade'''. This indicated that the receiver is a slave (the local oscillator can follow an infinite phase accumulation, as long as its frequency can track the incoming pulse frequency). The - 20 dB/decade slope tells that the PLL is a '''type 2''' loop.
# The tolerance curve sometimes looks like the slope of [[w:Terrace (agriculture)|terraced rice field]], with more than one flat section after the first left slope. This indicates that more than one CDR is present along the regeneration path between the injection of the test signal, and that some of them operate at different bit rates.

=== The tolerance function, a simulation of the the tolerance curve ===
In a feedback loop, like in a PLL for CDR use, the operation is linear, and the linear modeling remains valid, as long as all blocks in the loop operate within their linearity range.

Increasing the input signal amplitude, a point will be reached where one block reaches the limit of its range of linear operation.

Increasing further the input signal amplitude, the linear model loses its adherence to the real system and the actual operation deviates from the modeled behavior.

When investigating the effects of the timing variation of the input signal (the input jitter), the tolerance function (that can be derived using the border between linear operation and the most important hard non-linearities - see below) is of particular interest. 
It corresponds to the important characteristic of the CDR that is often a precise requirement, specified and measured as a function of the magnitude of the input sinusoidal jitter at different frequencies. 
The mathematical function can be very close to the measured curve, and can therefore represent a fundamental engineering tool.

Reaching with the signal level the onset on hard non-linearity inside an internal block often corresponds to the appearance of errored bits in the regenerated data stream. 
The input signal supplied the CDR has then exceeded the level of the CDR tolerance (such level is a function of the frequency of the input signal).

A mathematical derivation of such jitter tolerance function can be made finding out:
#	the block in the loop that is first to reach its limit of non-linear operation and to generate errored bits or slips;
#	the amplitude of the (phase) signal inside such block that reaches the limit of linear operation (such amplitude is a function of &amp;omega;)
#	the input signal amplitude (function of &amp;omega;) that generates such internal signal amplitude.


In mathematical terms, defining as &lt;u&gt;W(j&amp;omega;)&lt;/u&gt; the signal &lt;u&gt;at a generic node&lt;/u&gt; of the CDR model that is , and as &lt;u&gt;&amp;plusmn; &amp;Phi;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;tol&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;u&gt; the deviation tolerated at that node&lt;/u&gt;,

the tolerance function is the locus, for every angular frequency &amp;omega;, of the magnitude of the input signal X(j&amp;omega;) that produces a W(j&amp;omega;) that reaches, at one or both of its sinusoidal peaks, the tolerance level for that node:

&lt;center&gt; '''Jitter tolerance  =  |X(jω)|&lt;sub&gt;''|W(jω)| = &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;tol&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''''' &lt;/center&gt;
is exactly the input (to the CDR) needed for the internal signal to touch the tolerance limit at least at its positive or negative sinusoidal peaks.

Different shortcomings may identify different tolerance functions. They are then combined into one considering, at every frequency, the lowest value among their values.

The function so obtained is called '''the jitter tolerance function'''.

In order to derive a tolerance function that simulates well the tolerance curve obtained by measurement, there are 3 (three) fundamental shortcomings of the linear model must be considered :
*The limited range of the phase comparator
*The pulse regeneration (= the eye corners and the steady state sampling offset)
*The limited range of the (possible) elastic buffer.

====The limited range of the phase comparator====
The border of normal operation of a phase comparator is reached when the distance in phase between its two inputs exceeds a certain value.

It does not depend on the absolute value of either input, but on their difference only.

The phase comparator is built so that its range covers without discontinuity the period T of one line pulse, and the PLL is designed so that zero difference between the comparator inputs corresponds to the perfect lock of the loop:
&lt;center&gt;  &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = -T/2 , +T/2 &amp;rArr; = -&amp;pi; , + &amp;pi; . &lt;/center&gt;

When &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is exceeded by the error signal x(t)-y(t), the phase comparator output falls into the next period of its characteristic and its output indicates to the PLL that the closest locking point is now the center of the nearby pulse.

If the transient is short enough the loop has no time to react, the error signal comes back quickly within range, and the output goes back to the original segment of the comparator characteristic. A large burst of errors have affected the CDR, but at the end there is no slip of the recovered clock

If instead the transient lasts long enough for the loop to react, then lock will be achieved at the center of the new segment of the comparator characteristic: a slip has occurred. 


Mathematically such limit of linearity of the phase comparator characteristic defines one of the tolerance curves of the closed loop.
Such tolerance can be modeled as the locus -for every frequency- of the magnitudes of sinusoidal input signals X(j&amp;omega;) such that :
&lt;center&gt;|X(j&amp;omega;) - Y(j&amp;omega;)| = |&amp;Epsilon;(j&amp;omega;)| = &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But, in the particular case of the measurement of the tolerance curve, as well as in the derivation of the tolerance function, the range extremes of the phase comparator are never reached!

Its range may be exceeded during real operation, in particular during the early phase of a difficult acquisition of phase lock, but it will not be reached while finding the tolerance limit. 

In fact, the range of error-less sampling corresponds a sub-range of the phase comparator range. Sampling errors do appear as a consequence of sinusoidal jitter when the lateral eye margin is reached, while the comparator range limit is always larger.  
The following figure helps identify the quantities involved and clarify the related concepts, and the following sub-paragraph addresses the loop tolerance associated with the sampling phase margin.

====The pulse regeneration (= the eye corners and the steady state sampling offset)====
[[File:Eye_lateral_aperture.pdf|thumb|center|900x300 px|alt = The pulse regeneration may not take place at the best instant because of a timing deviation. There is margin against a bit error resulting from a misplaced sampling instant. Looking at the eye diagram it is easy to identify the margin.|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;The pulse regeneration may not take place at the best instant because of a timing deviation.&lt;br /&gt;
There is margin against a bit error resulting from a misplaced sampling instant.&lt;br /&gt;
Looking at the eye diagram it is easy to identify the margin.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

The tolerance function due to the lateral closure of the eye diagram can be modeled by an equation like the one resulting from the comparator range, but using a tighter range limit, and taking also into consideration the possible sampling offset that exists in some cases.

The input jitter that is not tracked by the PLL leaves a residual (sinusoidal) error between input (that represents the eye center) and output (that represents the sampling instant).

Overall, the output y(t) is not able to track exactly the input x(t) because of two shortcomings:
#a d.c. offset (the steady state error) and
#its (sinusoidal) phase variation is not able to replicate exactly the input (sinusoidal) phase variation, and a (sinusoidal) error of the same frequency remains.

When the sinusoidal error adds to the steady state error the sampling may take place before the beginning transition or after the end transition of the pulse.


&lt;small&gt;Just one, or a few, or a high density of errors are equally relevant in the identification of the tolerance limit. 
In other words, the limit is meant to have been reached when the sampling takes place in what could be a wrong instant, even if the irregular jitter of the beginning or of the end of the pulse do not necessary imply an error at every bit time, but with a lower frequency of occurrence.&lt;/small&gt; 
&lt;small&gt;''(It should be remarked that the &quot;irregular jitter&quot; of the transitions happens at random -due to line noise and I.I.- but to a large extent faster than the sinusoidal jitter of the tolerance measurement or simulation)''.&lt;/small&gt;
 
&lt;center&gt;'''|X(jω)|&lt;sub&gt;|X(jω)-Y(jω)| = &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;leo&lt;/sub&gt; = |X(jω)|&lt;sub&gt;|&amp;Epsilon;(jω)| = &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;leo&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/center&gt;
where &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;leo&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.

When the error signal instantaneously exceeds &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;leo&lt;/sub&gt;, error bits are generated in the CDR with a certain probability.

When the error signal exceeds &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and a slip consolidates, the BER remains very high as long as the framing circuits downstream of the CDR re-align (in a real transmission network) or as long as the sequence recognition circuits of the BER tester  re-align (in a tolerance curve test set-up) .


''The curves in the figure above can be seen as examples, with the exclusion of the flat asymptote towards low frequencies.''&lt;br /&gt;
''The tolerance due to the lateral eye closure decreases with increasing frequency and flattens out at high frequencies.''&lt;br /&gt;
''The clamping of the curves at low frequencies if present because the circuits described incorporate an elastic buffer (see section here below).''

====The limited range of the (possible) elastic buffer====
In general, a buffer may come in various forms, grouped here below in three categories of decreasing added delay:
* Buffer memories used to store and forward large amounts of bits, like packets of a TCP/IP protocol.&lt;br /&gt;
*:They are often organised by byte, and are written and read with clocks running at the byte rate.
*:The memory is so deep -and the added delay is so large with respect to the bit period- that they easily absorb the timing jitter or the frequency mismatch between the write and the read clocks.
*:These buffers could be located inside a single clock domain or at the border of two different domains.

* Elastic buffers between clock domains.&lt;br /&gt;
*:They are meant to absorb or at least to mitigate the effects of jitter, wander and drifts between the clocks of the two domains. 
*:Their depth is chosen to absorb the clocks drifts with as rare slips as possible. These elastic buffers are not as deep as a buffer memory but much deeper than a phase adder in a phase aligner (see below).&lt;br /&gt;
*:As there is no prior knowledge of the drift sign, their end of range triggers a reset to the central point. 
*:They deal with serial transmissions and are essentially based on shift registers clocked with the incoming clock and read with the local clock.
*:Their tolerance is studied using linear phase ramps.

* '''Phase adders for Phase aligner CDRs.''' 
*:Only a clock domain is involved and there are no d.c. drifts between the incoming signal and the local clock. 
*:They are meant to absorb just the a.c. jitter that has been generated in a relatively short timing loop inside an equipment or in a downstream/upstream loop of an access network. 
*:Their tolerance is studied with sinusoidal jitter i.e. with Fourier transforms.
*:The border of linear operation (= of the tolerance) of a phase adder is typically found when the algebraic sum of the phases of its two inputs reaches the minimum or the maximum value allowed for the output range of the adder.
*:It does not depend on the value of either input, even though in practice such limits of tolerance are often reached when one input simply swings too wide.
*:The mathematical model shall be:
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;Magnitude of [I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(j&amp;omega;) + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(j&amp;omega;)] = |I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(j&amp;omega;) + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(j&amp;omega;)| = &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
::where +/- &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; are the largest values that the adder can process linearly.
::As there is no drift at all, but just alternating jitter, at the end-of-range the adder saturates (as explained below for the delay line implementation).
::The model (of steady state condition), with |I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(j&amp;omega;) + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(j&amp;omega;)| = 0 for the mid output point, is chosen because it matches the corresponding hypothesis that, if the initial delay was not the mid point, then a transient out-of-range with subsequent re-centering has occurred.
:::'''The phase adder of a PLL is a delay line'''
:::In PLLs the phase adder is implemented &lt;u&gt;in the form of a delay line&lt;/u&gt;. The input of the delay line is one input of the adder, while the other input simply controls the amount of delay added to the signal that enters the delay line.
:::Such adders can &lt;u&gt;tolerate an added delay&lt;/u&gt; between zero and the maximum length of the delay line, D&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: right; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt; &lt;small&gt;The delay can also be measured as a phase, in units of radians at the angular frequency of interest.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;If a delay is known in seconds, then it can be be converted into radian&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;multiplying it by the angular clock frequency: [sec] * [rad * sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;] = [rad]&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
:::The tolerance limit will be in such cases modeled as:
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt; 0 &lt; added delay &lt; D&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
:::When the tolerance extremes are exceeded, the delay lines simply saturates in the sense that it either does not add any delay or that it keeps on adding its maximum delay D&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;. In terms of signal phases, the output remains constant at its minimum or maximum value.
:::In the case of a phase phase lock loop incorporating the delay line, this means opening the loop until the input jitter changes its direction of variation. The delay range is frozen while the input jitter waveform insists in the same direction and until it starts getting back. At that moment the lock resumes, but the delay range is now translated towards the average value of the incoming jitter by the amount of the sidetracking. 
:::This achieves some sort of translation of the delay range towards re-centering around the average value of the input the jitter. It is important to observe that this takes place in a discontinuous mode, because the loop keeps on re-locking into the center of the closest pulse in the delayed waveform presented to its phase comparator. This adds an imprecision of &amp;plusmn; &amp;pi; to the positioning of the delay line with respect to the incoming signal, and consquently to the loop jitter tolerance.
:::The granularity of the delay line can be as coarse as about 1/3 of the line pulse period (&amp;pi;/2 - &amp;epsilon; in theory), or as fine as fraction of one percent of such period. This granularity adds with the imprecision of the point above in reducing the resulting tolerance.
:::To model the phase tolerance curve associated to the delay line in the phase alignerthe following points are considered:
::: - Initial conditions. Sufficient re-centerings have occurred in the past, and presently the delay is centered with the inevitable imprecision of &amp;plusmn; &amp;pi;
::: - A granularity of &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;gran&lt;/sub&gt; characterizes the delay line;
::: -  total delay that the delay line can adjust is D&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;:
:::The tolerance limit imposed by the phase adder to the phase aligner is a fixed amount at all frequencies and is modeled as follows:
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt; '''|X(j&amp;omega;)| &lt; (D&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/2 - &amp;pi; - &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;gran&lt;/sub&gt;)''' &lt;/div&gt;


''The curves in the figure above can be seen as examples of tolerance of phase adders in the flat part at low frequencies..''&lt;br /&gt;
''Such clamping of the curves at low frequencies if present because the tolerance of the elastic buffer (present in the circuits of the figure) is independent from the jitter frequency and only depends on the length of the buffer.''
''The tolerance due to the lateral eye closure further reduces the tolerance at mid and high frequencies and ultimately flattens out at very high frequencies (see section here above).''

===Considerations===

* It should be emphasized that the '''jitter tolerance function''' is:
** '''neither a transfer function''' (its output is not generated with input frequencies of unit amplitude)
** '''nor a part of the mathematical model''' in the strict sense&lt;br /&gt;(because it depends on non-linearities for its definition, although it is computed within the boundary of the circuit linear operation, and&lt;br /&gt;because it may be different for different architectural variants belonging to the same model architecture. See the example of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 phase aligner that has a different tolerance from the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 slave).
* In the cases where the tolerance function is determined only by the maximum difference acceptable inside the phase comparator, the tolerance limit is a consequence of the one sided eye opening and not of the comparator range (that is larger).
:Exceeding the comparator range (&amp;plusmn;&amp;pi;) generates slips (= very high BER) while exceeding the lateral eye opening only generates error bursts that can be rather short. But the lateral eye range is reached always before the comparator range is exceeded: the tolerance function (as well as the tolerance curve!) corresponds to the errors that occur at the eye corners. Phase comparator slips (and associated errors) do occur in a CDR, but beyond the limit of tolerance set by the lateral eye aperture.
:Such high frequency jitter tolerance is visible (and is measurable) as the horizontal asymptote at the highest frequencies of jitter. From a certain frequency up, the PLL does not track at all, the jitter imposed to the input signal moves back and forward the signal transitions (already affected by I.I., noise etc.) and the sampling clock does not move.&lt;br/&gt;
:The tolerance function derived from the eye opening in such case still replicates very well, in magnitude, characteristic asymptotes and corner frequencies the diagram that is obtained with an actual measurement.
* Where &lt;u&gt;more than one non-linearity&lt;/u&gt; define each a region of tolerance for a CDR, then the overall CDR tolerance will correspond to the &lt;u&gt;intersection of&lt;/u&gt; those &lt;u&gt;tolerance regions&lt;/u&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The study of the CDR system frequency responses ''(that is the functions that have j&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; as the independent variable)'' gives in actuality a representation of the CDR behaviour in the presence of sinusoidal jitter.&lt;br&gt;
====Sinusoidal jitter is best for modeling and to retain some margin, but real jitter is essentially noisy====
Some periodicity in the bit stream due to framing, or to periodic data patterns,  may induce -via intersymbol interference- periodic components of jitter, but the real jitter will be essentially noisy.&lt;br&gt;
**in general, system descriptions (like jitter, error, noise transfer functions and the jitter tolerance function) in the frequency domain are the most used, effective  and are familiar to all electronic engineers
**in particular, sinusoidal jitter represents the worst case jitter with respect to jitter tolerance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Therefore sinusoidal jitter considerations are the most adequate and even give some margin with respect to the reality of the circuit application.
&lt;br&gt;
The use of the CDR system frequency responses, that is the most important tool used in this book, may therefore be seen as a pretty good and safe tool to describe the CDR behavior.&lt;br&gt;

====A linear wander must often be included to model and to simulate correctly====
A CDR always deals with two clocks: the one embedded in the received data stream, and the local clock.&lt;br /&gt;
*Sometimes (e.g. in [[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains#phase aligner|phase aligners]]) the local clock is kept synchronous with the clock embedded in the received data stream because they belong to the same [[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains|clock domain]].&lt;br /&gt;
*In other cases (e.g. in [[Clock_and_Data_Recovery/Buffer_Memory_(Elastic_Buffer)/Clock_domains#Master_and_slaves_.28slaves:_regenerators_or_end_points.29|regenerators and end point CDRs]]), the local clock  would run at a frequency of its own (uncorrelated with the incoming frequency of the remote master, embedded in the received data stream), unless forced by the PLL to deviate from its [[Clock_and_Data_Recovery/Buffer_Memory_(Elastic_Buffer)/Clock_domains#Free_running_mode|free-running]] frequency and to lock itself to the incoming signal.&lt;br /&gt;
:In these cases either the input jitter shall include a component (= a phase ramp):

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;\phi (t) = (f_p - f_{fr}) t &lt;/math&gt;    {{spaces|10}}[ rad ]&lt;/center&gt;
::where f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the frequency of the received pulses ''(i.e. the frequency of the clock embedded in the received pulse stream)'' and f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; is the free-running frequency of the local oscillator,&lt;br /&gt;
:or f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; in the model of the VCO shall be correspondingly offset from f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

===The reference models===

Today' CDR circuits are implemented using a PLL architecture, and are realized mostly or entirely with CMOS digital circuitry.&lt;br&gt; 
The complexity of the circuitry is often so large that -not unfrequently- the architecture is not clearly identified and consequently the circuit operation is not fully understood.&lt;br&gt;
It is very useful to make reference to relatively simple circuits that implement the CDR in a first or second order PLL architecture.&lt;br&gt; 
The comprehension of the characteristics of the model and of the mathematical equations that describe its behaviour are well suited for the understanding of almost all the actual circuits and not unfrequently even allow a better design of them.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

===Mathematical descriptions===

Block diagrams can be used to describe a physical system,  or its schematic diagram can be used, or the set of mathematical equations characterizing its parts.&lt;br&gt;
However mathematical models, in the form of systems equations, are needed when detailed relationships are required.

Every control system may theoretically be characterized by mathematical equations.&lt;br&gt;
The solution of these equations represents the system’s behavior.&lt;br /&gt;
Often this solution is difficult if not impossible to find.&lt;br /&gt;
In these cases, certain simplifying assumptions must be made in the mathematical description.

====Linear models====
''(Applicable to &quot;small signal&quot; conditions - linear equations and formulae - s and jω functions)''&lt;br&gt;

For a large number of control systems those approximations and simplifications lead to systems that can be described  by linear ordinary differential equations. Techniques for solving these equations are well documented in the literature of mathematics and engineering.

More precisely, in a large subset of its field of operation, the PLL fulfills certain conditions: it is [[w:Superposition principle|linear]], [[w:Time-invariant system|time invariant]], [[w:Causality#Engineering|causal]], sometimes altogether abbreviated into [[w:LTI system theory|LTI]].

Under these conditions the model is simplified:
# the differential equations become algebraic polynomial equations in the transformed domain.
# all solutions in the t domain are functions = 0 for all t &lt; = 0,
# if the system is in steady state, the [[w:Laplace transform|Laplace transforms]] (functions of ''s'') overlaps exactly the corresponding [[w:Laplace transform#Fourier transform|Fourier transforms]]. It is enough to substitute ''s'' with ''0 + j&amp;omega;'' in the former to obtain the latter. 

:&lt;small&gt;In this book, the basic notions of the '''[[Circuit Theory/Laplace Transform|Laplace Transform]]''' are used to analyze of the circuits presented, identify poles and zeros etc.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/br&gt; 
:&lt;small&gt;For  '''steady state''' phenomena (jitter transfer, jitter tolerance, noise shaping), the analysis is still made in the transformed domain, using the simpler [[Circuit Theory/Fourier Transform|Fourier Transform]] (obtained for s = 0 + j&amp;omega;)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The simplification consists in the use of a real function of a real variable, the '''magnitude of the function''' of interest:&lt;br /&gt;1. Real independent variable. In steady state not all possible values of ''s'' are to be considered, but just those of its imaginary part &amp;omega;, that is a &lt;u&gt;real&lt;/u&gt; variable. The function of &amp;omega; that is obtained still assumes complex values, like magnitude and argument or real and imaginary parts.&lt;br /&gt;2. Real dependent variable. If the system is a [[Wikipedia:Minimum phase#Relationship of magnitude response to phase response|minimum phase system]] (a reasonable assumption), just the [[Wikipedia:Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]''&lt;/u&gt; (= absolute value) of the system frequency response shall be used, as it contains all the information.&lt;br /&gt;The magnitude is normally represented in a [[Wikipedia:Bode plot|Bode magnitude plot]].&lt;br&gt; The argument is neglected by the PLL engineers.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;For '''transient''' phenomena, the functions in the Laplace domain are reverse transformed to obtain solutions in the form of time function (in this book, mostly the '''Unit Step Response''').&lt;/small&gt; 

In modern communication systems the implementation of the clock and data recovery circuits (CDR) is primarily digital, and the circuits can be very complex (in particular the loop filters and the local oscillator).

The designer sometimes may find it difficult to choose the right architecture and also to understand, in some conditions, the operation of the circuit itself.

Downstream in the product development, the engineers in charge of verification, validation, characterization and testing often do not even attempt to identify the fundamental architecture of the loop.

The best way to solve this is to choose a system architecture that corresponds to the structure of a well understood model of CDR, and to refer to its mathematical description to understand the closed loop operation in all conditions and to actually design the system circuitry blocks.

Reference to the fundamental structure and to the linear modeling that can be applied  will also make easier and more effective the subsequent engineering tasks of industrialization, operation and maintenance.


The three model architectures of first [[Control Systems/System Metrics#System Order|order]], [[Control Systems/System Metrics#System Type|type]] 1, and of second [[Control Systems/System Metrics#System Order|order]], [[Control Systems/System Metrics#System Type|type]] 1 and 2, offer the best compromises  between stability and performance for practical CDRs.
 
They can also be well described mathematically and their operation can be easily understood. 


Once familiar with their operation, the circuit designer will be able to decide what circuit choices to make, in terms of structure of the blocks and even of the order of its CDR.


'''Linear models of the circuit blocks → linear model of the whole circuit'''&lt;br /&gt;
Each circuit block can be described by a linear model in a certain range of the input signal as long as its parameters remain constant.

When -as is often the case in CDRs – the blocks are designed to operate with linear relation of input to output, the whole systems can be described by a linear model in a wide range of operation.

This book presents in detail three linear models, for the case where both the phase comparator block (based on a sawtooth and linear between the points of jumps to the previous and the next tooth) and the VCO (based on a frequency controlled oscillator with a continous control and linear within the frequency extremes of the control range) can be described by a linear model.&lt;br /&gt;
The three models belong to the two fundamental architectures:
* [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR based on a first order PLL|1st order (type 1) loop]]
* [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL|The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL]]
*: [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 1|2nd order type 1]]
*: [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 2|2nd order type 2]]


'''Non linearities of some circuit blocks prevent their modeling → resort to the linear model of the architecture is still useful'''
 
The usefulness of a linear model certainly applies to a system whose blocks can be individually modeled with linear equations.

But the usefulness of &quot;linear&quot; models extends beyond the study of the linear circuits they are meant to describe.

Even if for one or more blocks a linear model is not possible, the “linear” model of the whole structure can still be useful.

In many practical cases constraints of available technology or of cost prevent the use of “linear” phase comparators and/or of “linear” VCOs.

A non linear system (like a PLL based on a  [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator#Deliberately non-linear phase comparator|bang-bang]] phase detector) can be investigated using a linear model, with the restriction that the linear model is only useful in a limited range of the input signal variations.
 
It is necessary that the system is restricted to a &quot;small signal&quot; condition, where the hard non-linearities do not make the system deviate too much from linearity.


Modeling of these blocks with linear equations is therefore limited only to very small variations of the signal close to the operating point.The parameters of the block(s) can be considered constant as long as the signal moves very liitle around the operating point.

Still the linear models of the “linear” case are useful (apart from being the only closed form tool available!).

&lt;u&gt;The familiarity acquired with the model of the “linear” architecture can be very helpful to understand how the “non linear” circuit behaves in the neighborhood of a certain operating point&lt;/u&gt;.

When the signal excursions are large and the non linear aspects cannot be neglected, the linear models are no longer valid but simulations are stiil a valid tool left to the engineer.

====Simulators can include some non-linearities====
''(Applicable to &quot;large signal&quot; conditions, simulations are to be recomputed case by case)''&lt;br&gt;

The formal modeling of systems is based on a mathematical model, which attempts to find analytical solutions enabling the prediction of the behaviour of the system from a set of parameters and initial conditions.&lt;br&gt;
When the signals are large, the non-linearities of the circuit blocks can not be neglected and linear models are no longer practical.&lt;br&gt;
Computer simulation is then used as an adjunct to, or substitution for, modeling systems for which simple closed form analytic solutions are not possible, for instance when some hard non-linearities are essential to make a prediction. This is typically the case of the acquisition phase of a CDR.&lt;br&gt;
'''''To make a good prediction of the acquisition phase of a 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; or 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order CDR, some simple simulation and modeling programs have been developed.'''''&lt;br&gt;
Some of the figures that follow in this book have been generated using them.&lt;br&gt;

:&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Rev.1 differs from Rev.2 in two main characteristics:''
*'' Rev. 1 uses normalized values (values that always range close to 1) for the loop parameters (&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;zeta;). Consequently G and &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; are also close to 1. The model is therefore more abstract and requires more effort to bridge the gap to the actual circuit. In return, all signals at the circuit nodes remain within a range always close to 1, and the time diagrams of the simulations are easier to read. Some of the figures that follow in this book have been generated using it.''&lt;br&gt;
:''Rev.2 automatically scales the time base so that the available computation steps (1500 steps) are used to analyse a time that is between 150 times &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; (longer, but with less accuracy in computations) and 15 times &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; (shorter, but with very accurate computations). To decide if the accuracy is adequate, it is possible to chose how many computational steps (between 10 and 100) are used in the simulation. (Rev.1 uses 500 steps, and relies on the choice of parameters so that &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is set between 0.2 and 0.01, which allows enough accuracy for the simulation).''
*'' The loop filter used in Rev.1 replicates the schematic diagram of an operational amplifier with RC feedback. The simulation of the filter (via recurrent relations, i.e. difference equations) is a little more complex than in Rev.2. The latter version simulates the filter with the simplest equations, without reference to a possible physical implementation. If an example of recurrent relations in a spreadsheet is of interest, then Rev.1 has more didactic value.'&lt;/small&gt;'&lt;br&gt;
The 2011 software covers both linear and bang-bang phase comparators in separated programs. A third piece of software pictures the Bode plots of the small signal linear models of the three main topologies (studied in detail in this book).&lt;br /&gt;

====radians and cycles, radian/sec and Hertz====
=====angles or phases=====
In the context of periodic phenomena, such as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave| wave], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_angle| phase angle] is synonymous with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)| phase].&lt;br&gt;

In the context of communication waveforms, the time-variant angle &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 2 \pi f t + \theta,\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; or its modulo &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; value, is referred to as '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instantaneous_phase| instantaneous phase]''', but often just '''phase'''. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;

Phases as well as angles are measured in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian| radians] or in cycles (or in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)| degrees]), and are  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity| dimensionless quantities].&lt;br&gt;
When checking the plausibility of an equation by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis| dimensional analysis], it may be useful to include, along with the dimensions of the other involved quantities, also the radian and the cycle (as appropriate) when an angle or a phase is involved.
The correctness check may become easier and the mistake of adding (or of not adding) a 2π may be avoided.&lt;br&gt;

=====time intervals and frequencies=====
When checking of an equation that deals with times and frequencies by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis| dimensional analysis],  it is useful to include also the radian and the cycle (as appropriate).&lt;br&gt;
It becomes easier to tell time constants from periods, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency| frequencies] from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency| angular frequencies], and to avoid uncertainties or mistakes.

{{Anchor|Just two architectures}}&lt;br/&gt;

===Just three architectures are of practical use===

This book will show some possible model architectures for the CDR, and suggest that the choice is made among just three!&lt;br&gt;
In all practical cases, one of those three models is the fundamental tool that gives a good understanding of the CDR operation.&lt;br&gt;
Linear, time-invariant idealizations of the CDR circuits will be be described in detail.&lt;br&gt;
The fundamental cases of:
#a first order loop for the burst-mode CDR (often, but not always, a phase aligner) (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1)
#a second order loop for the regenerator (slave) CDR  (2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1)
# a second order loop for non linear blocks with widely variable gain  (2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 2)
[[Image:Structures.png|center|800px]]
will be presented and emphasized as the only really important models to use (even when some blocks in the actual implementation are non linear).&lt;br&gt;
More details on why loops are identified by order and type are presented in [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs|a page a little further on in this book]].&lt;br&gt;
Although such idealizations  may not perfectly describe our circuit in some specific aspects (non-linearity of some circuit blocks, etc.) they serves to simplify the mathematics, keep us from getting lost in a welter of algebraic quantities, and –most of all- produce results that can be interpreted quite usefully. &lt;br&gt;
Further on in the book, a section called [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples|Structures and types of CDRs/Examples]] does show the characteristic functions of these three models, as well as the characteristic functions of some others.&lt;br&gt;
The other model architectures that are presented in [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples|Structures and types of CDRs/Examples]] are there only for didactic purposes, but are of no practical use for the electronic engineer.&lt;br&gt;
The three fundamental models instead, are further developed in three dedicated chapters :
#[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR based on a first order PLL|1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order (type 1) PLL]]
#[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 1|2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 PLL]]
#[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 2|2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 2 PLL]].

====First order systems====
These systems only have one degree of freedom.&lt;br&gt;
In the study of 1st order PLLs the time constant of the pulse response, called τ (tau), is considered.

This time constant τ is exctly the inverse of the loop gain:

&lt;center&gt;1 / τ = G&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; * G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; * G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt; = G&lt;/center&gt;
and the natural frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as 1/τ = G. ''&lt;small&gt;(The subscript n means natural, the subscript 1 - optional - means 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order)&lt;/small&gt;''

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:Schematic of  PLL 1st order.png|center|frame|670x274px]]|2=}}
1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order systems are primarily used where fast acquisition of lock is important.

Fast acquisition means in actuality that τ/T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; ranges between 25 and 100,  where  T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/ f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the period of each received pulse.

It should be noted that G&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt; are almost always a inevitable consequence of the technology chosen to implement the circuit. The circuit designer shall therefore play mostly with  G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; to obtain the desired value of τ.

====Second order systems====
These systems have two degrees of freedom.


In the models of 2nd order PLLs the quantities considered are the [[Wikipedia:Damping ratio|damping ratio]] ζ and the natural angular (undamped) frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;small&gt;''(the suffix &lt;sub&gt;2-&lt;/sub&gt; is added to ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; simply to remember that this parameter refers to a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order system,''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;''the suffixes &lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; or &lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; are added to ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and to &amp;zeta; simply to remember that the parameter refers to a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order system, either of type 1 or 2. Type 0 is not used for CDR pplications)''&lt;/small&gt;

The [[Wikipedia:Damping ratio|damping ratio]] ζ, for the PLL to be of practical use inside a CDR, must be close to 1 (0.7 to 1.3), to ensure that the behavior of the loop is neither under-damped nor over-damped. 


Saying that the second order loop has one more degree of freedom than the first order loop is therefore an overstatement.


It is more fair to say that in both cases the time (and frequency) response of the loop are primarily set by the gain G. In the case of the second order loop it is possible to have a slightly higher variability associated with the (limited) range of variation allowed for &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;.

The natural angular frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; in a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order loop depends:
*on the loop gain (in analogy with the first order loop)
*on the damping ratio ζ
*but also on the type of the loop:
If the frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; is defined again as 1/G (like in the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order loop), the natural frequencies for the 2-1 and 2-2 loops are:
&lt;center&gt; &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n21&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; ;  &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n22&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; / 2 &amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;n22&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''e.g. if ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; ,  then,  ζ = ½''.&lt;/center&gt; 
[[File:Schematic_of_PLL_2nd_order.png‎ |center|frame|498×368 px|&lt;center&gt;The 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order architecture models that are used for PLL clock recovery in data transmission&lt;/center&gt;]]
2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order loops of type 1 and of type 2 differ substantially from each other and their architectures are used in different applications of CDRs, as the following pages of this book will emphasize.

==== Third order systems ====


:A second order loop with &amp;zeta; &gt;&gt; 1, is nothing but a first order loop with a further, ineffectual pole at higher frequency.

:The second pole does not modify appreciably the behavior of the circuit, that in practice behaves as a '''first order loop'''.


In a similar way, a third pole added to a second order loop, at a frequency higher than the natural frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_{n2} &lt;/math&gt;, does not change the behavior of the loop.

It is important to consider that, in PLLs with a second order architecture (of both types, 1 and 2):
* a high frequency pole '''does always exist''' ''(typically at the output of the phase comparator or of the charge pump)'', but is there only for suppression of high frequency noise ( = reduction of high frequency generated noise ),
* the high frequency pole '''shall not be considered in the model''' of the PLL, because it does not alter the loop performances at the signal frequencies of interest and because it would -on the other hand-  complicate significantly the model.

From another point of view it can be seen that a single third pole added to a second order PLL:
* added at frequencies &gt;&gt; &lt;math&gt;\omega_{n2} &lt;/math&gt; does not compromise the loop stability
* added at frequencies not much higher than &lt;math&gt;\omega_{n2} &lt;/math&gt; will influence &amp;zeta; and reduce it to a value so low to be unacceptable. If very close it will even compromises the loop stability.



*''The three fundamental models shown in the figures above are inaccurate in the sense that there is always an additional pole at high frequency.&lt;br /&gt;''
:''The 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order model could be seen a as 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order model  and the two 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order models as 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; order models.''&lt;br /&gt;
:''This additional pole does not modify the fundamental behavior of the CDR because it is far enough along the frequency axis.''&lt;br /&gt;
:''As its consideration complicates the study, and does not lead to better engineering of the CDRs, it shall be neglected in the modeling.''
*''If an additional pole was close enough to the others to modify the CDR behavior in the frequency band of interest, its effect would be detrimental!'' 


:'''''Third order models are not used'''.''

The '''Inburgeringscursus''' for English speaking people living outside of the Netherlands is a course necessary for certain classes of non-EU citizens wishing to immigrate to Dutch society, while still living abroad. It is one of the conditions for immigration and is part of a larger [[w:Integration law for new immigrants to the Netherlands|Integration law for new immigrants to the Netherlands]]. The foreigner should do the exam at the nearest Dutch embassy in his or her country. Cost is as of 2008 Euro 350,- which should be paid to the Ministry of Foreign affairs (Dutch: [[w:Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken|Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken]]).

The examination consists of three parts.
*[[/Dutch Society|Knowledge of Dutch society]] (Dutch: Kennis van de Nederlandse samenleving)
*Very basic knowledge of Dutch language. See [[Dutch|Dutch language course]]. This includes
**[[/Antonyms|List of antonyms]] (Dutch: lijst van tegenstellingen)
**[[/Story|Repeating a story in the Dutch language]]

Apart from factual information about Dutch society and Dutch language, the Dutch government tries to educate the prospective immigrant into opinions and behavior that they consider appropriate, desirable and correct.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am Lifetiki; my real name is Benjamin Smith. I am a high school student who loves math and science. I have been a reader of Wikipedia for quite some time, but now I have decided that I should contribute to its sister projects as a way of saying thanks for the wealth of knowledge it has taught me. I encourage you to do the same.


== About Me ==
I live in a small town in West Virginia, USA. Although I have scored well on IQ tests and I make good grades, my goal is not to brag about my intelligence, but rather to improve society with my intelligence. I do not try to say I'm better than anyone else because I know that one head injury in a car accident or some other bad thing could make me lose it all. I thus want to help my fellow man by using my knowledge for the advancement of human civilisation.

I am a Christian who goes to a Baptist church. Because I believe in God, I will give him credit for the intellectual capacity he has granted me. Although I am a Christian, I will not try and force my beliefs on my fellow Wikibookians because it is not appropriate to do so in any place other than my user_talk page which I need to create sometime. Because I am told to tell you about my Lord and saviour Jesus Christ, (see Matthew 28:18-20) I will do it in the most appropriate manner I can. Thus I will eventually write a book on Wikibooks about the Bible and how to read it if an administrator says it is appropriate for Wikibooks. If he/she says it is not, I will not write it on Wikibooks.
== Books I Intend to Write ==
As I written no books as of now, these are the topics of the books I intend to start and work on significantly:
#Math and Science related
##A book on math that I will write the content and formulæ and someone else can put in pictures.
##* Will rant about the evils of calculator abuse.
##A kids' book on physics
##A kids' book on chemistry
#Miscellanea 
##A book on how to study the Bible
##A book on making an educated opinion
##*Will distinguish fact from opinion
##*Will teach that logic is good
##*Will have a section on faith and its definition
##*Will teach respecting others' opinion is a good way to win an argument.
##*Will try to be neutral</text>

==Working Rocrail with Hornby Elite DCC controller== 

===Purpose of this document===

This document is for beginners to Rocrail who want to use a Hornby Elite DCC controller R8214 and Hornby Accessory Decoders R8216 and/or R8247. 

It explains how Rocrail adjusts for quirks of the Hornby Elite controller, which is now fully supported by Rocrail using a specific elite sub-library. 

Drawing up a trackplan, identifying locomotives and motorised points to the system is covered by the Rocrail [http://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=quickstart-en step by step quick start quide] and the main [http://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=english on-line manual].

Rocrail nomenclature for points is switches and turnouts.

To progress to more complex train operations please read the Rocrail  [http://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=english on-line manual] in depth and filter out specific applicable information. 

A layout will likely have to be reworked into isolated power districts and/or operational blocks with necessary sensors to provide feedback for say aspect lights or signals, train positioning, or allow trains to run automatically, or to schedules. Such activity is presently outwith the scope of this initial help document.

The Rocrail [http://forum.rocrail.net/portal.php forum] is a valuable user group facility worth checking periodically for applicable posts.

===Introduction to Rocrail===

Rocrail is an open-source freeware project that enables computer control of a compatible digital command control (DCC) model railway layout under a Windows or Linux environment.

Control a basic layout, run locos and switch turnout-points from a computer by simple mouse clicks, operate advanced manual working with or without block control, and/or run fully automatic scheduled train operations. 

This is achieved by a server and client arrangement installed on the same or different computers depending upon user requirements. Control can be from a single computer linked directly to Elite, or other computer(s) on a local area network (LAN) connected to Elite, or using a remote computer over the Internet, if this has client installed. Control is also possible using mobile devices such as mobile phones or tablets.

Click for picture: [http://wiki.rocrail.net/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=&amp;h=&amp;cache=cache&amp;media=architecture.png]

Server is the engine room working in the background and client is a graphic user interface (GUI) connecting the human controller, footplate, signal box to a layout via Elite. The GUI is known in Rocrail as RocView but is referred to throughout this document as GUI.

Read the [http://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=english on-line manual] for information on setting up these wider control methods.

===Download and installation of Rocrail Files===

Go to Rocrail [http://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php] and from the left hand column select the download link for your platform - e.g. Windows or Linux. At the linked location choose the correct file type for your operating system - e.g. unicode for Windows. Save this file to say a desktop folder. Svn snapshots are available from here [http://rocrail.saturnus.it/] as nightly builds to fix recent problems in various areas and may be used at risk. Check also the asociated build notes.

Important - Note that there are some performance issues running Rocrail under Windows and you must choose the file most suited to your version of Windows (Ansi or Unicode) - read the Rocrail manual section 'Running Under Windows' for more details.

If a layout computer does not have Internet access or files are being downloaded to a computer other than the one that will control the layout, save all files to a portable memory stick and transfer them onto the layout computer.

Once downloaded (and if necessary copied to layout computer) navigate to where the files are saved and double click the .exe file. After Rocrail has finished installation, access the applications from Start-All_Programs-Rocrail.

If you already have an earlier version of Rocrail installed a snapshot can be loaded over it without losing any trackplan or .ini file data. 

Click for picture: [http://wiki.rocrail.net/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=&amp;h=&amp;cache=cache&amp;media=rocrail-start-menu.png]

Or make shortcuts and place them on the desktop.

===Updating Elite===

The Elite must have at least firmware vers.1.2 installed (check for this at Elite start up). It is advised to download the latest update (currently v 1.4.1) and instructions from [http://www.hornby.com/customer-support/downloads Hornby web-site] and install on the Elite. Check the integrity of all locomotive addresses and that Elite still works the layout in Standard and Classic Modes after any update.

Full instructions are available on Hornby's website explaining how to upgrade the firmware, especially if you are using Win 7/8.

Use the same USB cable to connect Elite to Rocrail pc as for the firmware update. For basic Rocrail operations an XpressNet cable is not required.

===Amending Rocrail configuration (.ini) file===

So that Rocrail software will recognise Elite as the interface unit, parts of the .ini file are changed to tell Rocrail which equipment is being used and then say how to find it.

Connect Elite to the running layout computer with USB cable and switch Elite ON. Look in Start-Control_Panel-System-Hardware-Device_Manager-Ports(COM &amp; LPT) for the ‘com’ port number Elite is using (e.g COM4). If Elite is not connected and switched ON there will be no ‘com’ port allocated. In Win 7/8 the port may not state Elite until the port driver is updated using the Elite driver. 

The preferred way to amend the .ini file is from within Rocrail main screen - from File menu select in turn Rocrail Properties and then Rocview Properties. Fill in the required information fields and/or click radio buttons. In the Controller tab select and add Expressnet as the basic controller, amend this to read Elite and select the radio button for the Elite. Depending if you want to run in Elite Standard or Classic mode depends if you need to tick the V2 box - see later in turnout addressing. Save and close these files. Then save and close Rocrail and restart. 

Note: .ini files can be manually amended using notepad or similar basic text editor if you are comfortable using this method.

Important – if manually editing .ini files carefully change only those bits of the file to read as shown in this link [http://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=hornby-elite-en]

Leave everything else alone then save the file – File-Save, and Exit the editor.

===Getting started with Rocrail===

Before a layout can be operated with Rocrail, the user must know how to correctly start and stop both server and client, draw a trackplan of a layout and tell Rocrail about locomotives and switches-turnouts-points. See the step by step guide and main manual for details.

Rocrail has introduced a 'Workspace' facility simplifying the final startup and shutdown procedures. This is best read about in the Rocrail manual, which explains how to set it up.

===Some things to note about Rocrail===

A trackplan, including the associated locomotive-switch-other tables should be saved to a meaningfull name (e.g. Your-Railway.xml) using File-Save/Save_As '''before''' exiting server.

All changes thus saved are uploaded to server. Rocrail must be stopped and restarted for the file to become effective before it can be used. The chosen filename will also write into the configuration file so that Rocrail knows which trackplan to use as default.

Do not use Windows close ‘x’ symbol to close the server DOS window as it shuts down without carrying out the full save process. Using &lt;nowiki&gt;Ctrl+x, Ctrl+c and/or Ctrl+Alt+Del&lt;/nowiki&gt; task manager methods will also abort Rocrail too early.

Using Rocrail Workspace precludes this problem. A workspace is a collection of files that Rocrail uses at startup to automatically load your track plan. Set it up initially from the File menu.

Simply close down Rocrail from drop down File menu – File-Exit or Shut down Rocrail and Server.

8051 is the default server monitor port allocated by NMRA to Rocrail. This is set in Rocrail properties from the File menu.

Rocrail can reset early Hornby locomotive decoders (R8215) during power up and power down sequences. It is recommended that if users have this problem they replace these decoders with latest Hornby production (R8249_v1.3 NMRA compliant or R8245 Sapphire) or other make decoders, preferably installed by way of a plug and socket. This is not a Rocrail fault.

For Rocrail to operate points correctly the inherent Elite points addressing differences between Standard and Classic modes (due to legacy problems catering for the Hornby Select command station) must be adjusted. Rocrail can be set to allow and adjust for the Elite being in either mode. See later in turnout addressing.

===Rocrail on-line manual===

The Rocrail on-line manual [http://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=english] contains much information about equipment that Elite users may not need or do not have, and also tells how to operate beyond present Elite functional capability. 

Refer also to the Rocrail quick start step by step guide.

The Rocrail on-line manual is a live Wiki document subject to frequent change, so please check periodically for updates.

===Trackplan===

To draw a trackplan refer to on-line manual section  - Creating your first trackplan - for guidance.

Draw up a simple schematic of the layout. Do not bother with details like blocks or signals, etc yet. Just add basic track, straights, curves, turnouts, crossings, buffer, etc to mimic your layout. Do not make it too elaborate to start with as it will probably be amended later.

Place turnouts-points by picking Turnout left or right hand, clicking on grid, then re-orientating to suit. Other types of turnout are possible – crossing at right angles, double slip crossing (not diamond), or triple, 3-way. These won't work until they are listed - see later. You can also create your own track symbols - see on-line manual.

In automatic or manual operations modes point motors can be fired in sequence to set a route before a train moves.

The track plan background colour can be changed, select View-Track_Plan_Colour. Text can be placed single or multi-line, font resized and re-orientated to suit, but placing can obscure the track lines.

Save a new trackplan with a suitable name – e.g. Your-Railway2.xml using File-Save. If not Rocrail will save to the default name - plan.xml.

To get a trackplan to work with Elite it needs to be saved and Rocrail client closed down and restarted in sequence. 

Server and client will by default be on same computer, unless operating over LAN using more than one computer or allowing friends to run (and probably trash) your trains over the web. If so read further into the manual and forums for how to set it up.

===Listing locomotives===

Read the Rocrail on-line manual, locomotive section to see what goes in which box, what is essential to make it work and what is just information.

Pictures of your locomotives can be added to the locomotives table. See the manual.

===Listing Switches-Turnouts-Points===

Rocrail calls them Switches in the manual so look for and read that section, but Rocrail calls them Turnouts in GUI area. Let’s generally call them Points for now unless otherwise stated.

Pull down menu Tables-Turnouts and define points in a similar way to locomotives, but only if they are solenoid motors and they are DCC controlled.
 
Manual points or solenoid point motors operated by analogue methods - passing contact/momentary switches, probe and stud, CDU or not, etc are not able to controlled by computer. For other types of points motors, such as Tortoise, see the manual. Populate turnouts table as for locomotives. 

ID is users preferred words or numbers to call each turnout e.g. Point-1, P2, Pt 3A-B, T5, etc. The rest as required but they can be amended later if necessary.

Address and Port - These instructions apply only to Hornby 4-port point and accessory decoders R8216 or R8247. For other make decoders refer to manufacturer's data.
Hornby point and accesory decoders have 4 ports and normal practice is to connect 1 point motor to each port, although for a track crossover junction 2 motors can be wired to a port. 

For each turnout location on the trackplan an Address and Port value is required. Various addressing methods are available in Rocrail but the preferred way for use with the Elite is PADA. Hornby sends a different value to either address or port according to which Elite mode is in use - Standard or Classic. Rocrail can adjust for this as explained in this Rocrail Wiki section relevant to the Elite [http://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=hornby-elite-en . It explains how to set Rocrail to allow for operating the Elite in Standard or Classic modes.

To invoke PADA addressing set all &lt;u&gt;address&lt;/u&gt; blocks to 0, then number each &lt;u&gt;port&lt;/u&gt; sequentially to match the turnout number - e.g T1 = 1, T2 = 2 ... etc ... T99 = 99. There is no need to identify which accessory decoder you are using, just carry over the turnout number. Continue the addressing sequence for as many accessory decoders and turnouts you have.

Various other addressing methods are possible, e.g. NMRA, MADA and FADA. See the Rocrail manual for definition of these methods. Also see the basic Address-Port designation page. Scroll down to '''switch addressing''' for further details: [http://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=addressing-en-flat].

Whichever addressing method is used Rocrail will recalculate addressing back to NMRA.

Again click Apply/OK and save to trackplan using File-Save, stop and restart Rocrail to make changes effective.

===Programming track===

CVs can be programmed directly from this tab: [http://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=pt-en]

===Operating a trackplan===

Connect Elite to computer and power up layout. Start Rocrail preferably using the Workspace facility.

A nag screen will appear requesting a donation. Please contribute if you can as Rocrail is run  by volunteers with donor support.

The user's layout trackplan should appear on screen. If not pull down menu File and Upload user’s trackplan to a new tab on the trackplan. Pull down menu Trackplan. Select Operate. Select Power On - lightbulb button. Users will be able to pick from a list of their locos, run them to throttle and use trackplan to switch points. 

Unless users are at a more advanced stage of having power districts, blocks and feedback incorporated into their trackplan the layout screen is mainly for show for basic operations, but can be used to switch turnouts-points and control locos.

===Operating locomotives===

A list of locos and some details will be seen at the left hand side of screen. 
Pick a locomotive from list and click on throttle slider. Increase power by moving slider up, watch the numbers in the adjacent box increase (0-100%) and locomotive will move off. Or use a wheel mouse to control speed. Note speed step at which locomotive moves off and if required, set this as starting voltage V-min on Interface tab. Similarly limit top speed. Check and fine tune as necessary. Pick another locomotive and do same for that. Check each locomotive obeys throttle and runs correct way.

Click for locomotives page:[http://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=loc-tab-en]

Double clicking a loconame(s) will launch a floating throttle(s).

All trains can be started together (unwise) and all stopped together (handy – like the Elite Emergency Stop button) if required. Trains can all be run automatically, some automatically and some manually, or all manually.

GUI will echo all commands in the lower right hand window pane.

===Operating switches, turnouts, points===

Trackplan calls them turnouts so we will use that term here.

Click any turnout on trackplan and if address and port are correctly set the associated point motor will throw, using capacitor discharge unt (CDU) built into accessory decoder. Click again and it throws other way.

There is also a Switch Control button that will open a switchbox to allow turnouts to be operated.

When a turnout throws the physical layout, it switches on trackplan with coloured leg showing the track way setting. Check it throws on layout same way as it throws on trackplan. If it throws in wrong logic amend the switch table to invert logic. No need to rewire.

Any pairs of point motors can wired and addressed together to operate as one when switched on the user's layout, but how to echo/mimic this on trackplan is presently under investigation.

GUI will echo in the lower panes all turnout commands and logic sent and received by showing the associated address-port and if set straight or turn.

Switches can be made to fire in sequence either in Auto mode or by selecting a Route. Routes can be operated manually. See on-line manual for details.

===Advanced operations===

Read the [http://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=english on-line manual], visit Rocrail [http://forum.rocrail.net/portal.php user forums], etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the last chapter, you were introduced
to the idea of a ''variable''. A variable
is a spot in the computer's memory where you can store a
value:

    sway&gt; var x = 1000000;
    INTEGER: 1000000
    sway&gt; x;
    INTEGER: 1000000

Here, I've named that spot ''x'' and I've stored
the number 1000000 at that spot.
Once, I've reserved that spot, I can change the
value there by assigning a new value to the variable.
Here's an example:

    sway&gt; x = 42;
    INTEGER: 42
    sway&gt; x;
    INTEGER: 42

Notice that I did not use the word &lt;tt&gt;var&lt;/tt&gt; this time.
When I use &lt;tt&gt;var&lt;/tt&gt;, it means reserve me a new spot. When
I don't use &lt;tt&gt;var&lt;/tt&gt;, it means update a previously reserved 
spot.
----
To learn more about assignment, please see
[[The Sway Reference Manual/Assignment|Sway assignment]].
----
What happens if we try to update a spot without
reserving it first?

    sway&gt; y = 3;
    EVALUATION ERROR: :assignError
    stdin,line 3: assignment: variable y is undefined

We get a message that ''y'' is undefined. This is the 
interpreter's way of telling us that we forgot to reserve
a spot for ''y'' using &lt;tt&gt;var&lt;/tt&gt;. Sway knows we
didn't define the variable because it looked for it
in the current environment and, failing, in the ''context''
environment and, failing, in the context of the context,
and so, until it ran out of places to look.

The word ''variable'' implies that the value can vary, which
is exactly what we did with ''x''; we changed it's value.
In some programming languages, there are analogous beasties
named ''constant''s, only once created, you cannot vary
them. In Sway, there are no constants, per se.
Should we need a constant, we will use a variable instead,
but
we will make a pledge not to change a variable's value.
To remind us
that we should not change its value, we will use capital
letters (mostly) in naming the variable:

    sway&gt; var PI = 3.14159;
    REAL_NUMBER: 3.1415900000

Making this pledge is known as ''following a convention''.
Note that variable names can be (and generally should
be) more than a single letter.
Note also that SPT in Chapter 3 of CME
uses lower case letters early in the alphabet
to indicate constants and lower case letters late in the
alphabet to indicate variables. That is a different convention.

==Adding a little bit==

Here's a problem that is a little bit
simpler than the one from CME&lt;ref&gt;
This figure is drawn using
Cheesy ASCII (tm) Graphics  (for fast loading).
&lt;/ref&gt;:
 
                            
    + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
    +                             +
    +                             +
    +                             + h = w/2
    +                             +
    +                             +
    + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
                   w

Consider a rectangle whose width and height are related.
Suppose we increase the width a little bit.
What happens to the height, assuming the new height is
still one half of the new width?
Since the height is calculated from the width,
we say that width is the ''independent'' variable and that
height is the ''dependent'' variable.
First, let's define a function that gives us the
height, ''h'',  given the width, ''w'':

    function h(w)
        {
        w / 2.0;
        }

Note that when we write functions like this, it is
almost always the case that the dependent variable
is the name of the function and the independent
variable is the name of the formal parameter.
Use this rule to help you define the functions
you need.

We can test out our new function:

    sway&gt; h(100);
    REAL_NUMBER: 50.0000000

This confirms our suspicion that if the width is 100 units, the height
must be 50 units.

Calculus is often concerned with the ''change'' in the
dependent variable given a ''change'' in the independent variable,
particularly the ''ratio'' of the two changes.

Now, let's figure out that ratio for the above rectangle,
using a small change in width:

    sway&gt; var w = 100;                //width
    sway&gt; var dw = 0.01;              //change in width
    sway&gt; var dh = h(w + dw) - h(w);  //change in height

The change in the height is simply the new height minus
the old height. Now we can compute the ratio:

    sway&gt; dh / dw;
    REAL_NUMBER: 0.5000000000

Another thing Calculus is concerned with is does this ratio
change with
different amounts of change
or
different values for the independent variable?
The lazy person's way to
answer these questions is, you guessed it, to write a
function to do the work.

    function ratio(w,dw)
        {
        var dh = h(w + dw) - h(w);
        dh / dw;
        }

Note that we pass in the values of ''w'' and ''dw'' and then
compute the ratio. This allows us to try a wide variety of
values quite easily:

    sway&gt; ratio(40,0.01);
    REAL_NUMBER: 0.5000000000
    
    sway&gt; ratio(40,0.0001);
    REAL_NUMBER: 0.5000000000
    
    sway&gt; ratio(20,0.0001);
    REAL_NUMBER: 0.5000000000

This ratio function is quite useful! We see that the ratio
of &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; does not seem to ever change.
But suppose we now start
looking at rectangles with a different relationship between 
width and height. All of a sudden, our ratio function is 
looking a lot less useful. This is because
we ''hard-wired'' the height function.&lt;ref&gt;
We ''hard-wire'' something when we treat it as a constant, something
that doesn't change.
&lt;/ref&gt;
We can
fix this by passing in the height function as a third
argument. Now we can easily try out new height functions.
By doing so, we have made the ratio computing
function more general.

    function ratio(w,dw,h)
        {
        var dh = h(w + dw) - h(w);
        dh / dw;
        }

It should work just the same:

    sway&gt; ratio(40,0.01,h);
    REAL_NUMBER: 0.5000000000
    
    sway&gt; ratio(40,0.0001,h);
    REAL_NUMBER: 0.5000000000
    
    sway&gt; ratio(20,0.0001,h);
    REAL_NUMBER: 0.5000000000

Let's try a different height function:

    function g(w)
        {
        w * w;
        }

With this height function, the height ''g'', grows as the
square of the width.  What does ''ratio'' produce now?
Let's try one width and ever smaller changes:

    sway&gt; ratio(100,1,g);
    INTEGER: 201
    sway&gt; ratio(100,0.1,g);
    REAL_NUMBER: 200.10000000
    sway&gt; ratio(100,0.01,g);
    REAL_NUMBER: 200.01000000
    sway&gt; ratio(100,0.001,g);
    REAL_NUMBER: 200.00100000

It's pretty clear that if the change in width becomes
infinitely small, the ratio when the width is 100 will be 200.

Now let's try a different width and ever smaller changes:

    sway&gt; ratio(200,1,g);
    INTEGER: 401
    sway&gt; ratio(200,0.1,g);
    REAL_NUMBER: 400.10000000
    sway&gt; ratio(200,0.01,g);
    REAL_NUMBER: 400.01000000
    sway&gt; ratio(200,0.001,g);
    REAL_NUMBER: 400.00100000
    sway&gt; ratio(200,0.0001,g);
    REAL_NUMBER: 400.00009998

For this new width, 200, the ratio appears to converge on 400.
Also,
for the last test, we got a value that was a little unexpected.
This should be a warning to you when dealing with real numbers.&lt;ref&gt;
You can trust integers, because they are exact. But you should 
never trust real numbers completely, because they are approximations.
Sway real numbers are only precise to 15 significant digits.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For the height function ''g'', we see that different starting
widths yield different ratios.
A good deal of calculus is for explaining why such ratios
change.
Also, this process of computing ratios is known as the ''taking
the derivative''.

==Questions==

All formulas are written using Grammar School Precedence.

'''1'''. Does it matter what variable name we use as a formal parameter when
defining a function?

'''2'''. Draw a picture of a labelled rectangle so that the height is the independent
variable, keeping the relationship that the height is one half the width.

'''3'''. In the function ratio, ''dh'' is computed from
&lt;math&gt;h(w + dw) - h(w)&lt;/math&gt;.
If we assume that 
&lt;math&gt;(w + dh&lt;/math&gt;) is equivalent to 
&lt;math&gt;(w) + h(dw&lt;/math&gt;) then ''dh'' is 
&lt;math&gt;(w) + h(dw) - h(w)&lt;/math&gt; or simply 
&lt;math&gt;(dw)&lt;/math&gt;.
Define a new function named ''ratio2'' to test
whether this assumption is valid.

'''4'''. Which function is better for very small changes? Why?

'''5'''. Consider a rectangle whose area never varies. That is, if the width
is increased, the height decreases to compensate so that the area of the
rectangle remains the same. Define a function that computes the height
of this rectangle given the width and the area.

'''6'''. Do we observe the same behavior in the ratios as we did with function
''g''?

'''7'''. &quot;Change is constant,&quot; but does not have to be a constant. Most
of us are comfortable with the notion of a constant rate of change.
For instance the change in height versus distance as described by a
straight line, for instance &lt;math&gt; y = 5 x + 4 &lt;/math&gt;. 
Use the ratio function to explore how ''y'' changes as ''x'' changes.
Produce a table of ''y'', ''x'', and ''dy/dx''.

'''8'''. The previous problem had a constant rate of change. Often, however, the rate of change of the dependent variable changes with the
independent variable. Let's take as an example the function for area of a square, &lt;math&gt; y = x^2 &lt;/math&gt;. 
First of all, what is the change in the area 
as ''x'' changes from 2 to 4?
Draw a sketch of this situation, labeling ''dy'' and ''dx''.
Do the same thing as ''x'' changes from 2 to 3, 2 to 2.5,
2 to 2.1, and 2 to 2.01. What do you observe? Try the same thing, but now start with x = 4. The point is that the rate of 
change in the area, itself changes depending on the length.
The function of ''x'' that expresses this relationship between the change
in ''y'' and ''x'' is called the ''derivative'', ''dy/dx''.
Based on your experiments, what is the derivative of 
&lt;math&gt;y = x^2&lt;/math&gt;?

'''9'''. The rate of damage reduction from armor is
&lt;math&gt;\mathit{Reduction} = \mathit{Armor} / (\mathit{Armor} + X) &lt;/math&gt;
where
&lt;math&gt; X = 467 * \mathit{EnemyLevel} - 22167 &lt;/math&gt;.
What is the relative growing of damage reduction with Armor? With
EnemyLevel?

      <text xml:space="preserve">We all remember Cuba Gooding Jr.’s immortal line from the movie Jerry Maguire, “Show me the money!” Well, that’s what financial statements do. They show you the money. They show you where a company’s money came from, where it went, and where it is now. 

There are four main financial statements. They are: (1) balance sheets; (2) income statements; (3) cash flow statements; and (4) statements of shareholders’ equity. Balance sheets show what a company owns and what it owes at a fixed point in time. Income statements show how much money a company made and spent over a period of time. Cash flow statements show the exchange of money between a company and the outside world also over a period of time. The fourth financial statement, called a “statement of shareholders’ equity,” shows changes in the interests of the company’s shareholders over time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Now that you know what sociologists study, you might be wondering: What can you do with a degree in sociology?  In an ideal world, just studying social problems would make them go away.  But, alas, as you've learned from reading this book, we don't live in an ideal world and there is far more to do than just study social life with a degree in Sociology.  The American Sociological Association, among others, has looked into this question and have some pretty intriguing answers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spalter-Roth2005&quot;&gt;Spalter-Roth, Roberta, William Erskine, Sylvia Pociask, and Jamie Panzarella. 2005. &quot;What Can I Do with a Bachelor's Degree in Sociology?&quot;: A National Survey of Seniors Majoring in Sociology. Washington, DC: American Sociological Association http://www.asanet.org/galleries/default-file/B&amp;B_first_report_final.pdf (Accessed April 30, 2008, not available as of January 15, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  What follows is a brief explanation of what you can do with a degree in Sociology.

==Sociology Majors==
Despite the many tests that suggest otherwise, there is no correlation between personality and career choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garcia-Sedeno&quot;&gt;Manuel Garcia-SedeÑo, Jose I. Navarro, Inmaculada Menacho (2009) Relationship Between Personality Traits and Vocational Choice. Psychological Reports: Volume 105, Issue , pp. 633-642.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, there is no particular &quot;personality type&quot; among sociology majors.

The average graduating sociology major is a young female (early 20s) who is white and single.  Almost 80% of students graduating with sociology degrees are female, and nearly that many (75%) are white. Less than half of the parents of sociology majors have baccalaureate degrees of their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spalter-Roth2005&quot;/&gt;

Many sociology majors choose the major because they found their first exposure to the discipline engaging (usually through an introductory course).  Most sociology majors chose the discipline because they found the concepts discussed in their course interesting.  Only 7% of sociology majors choose the discipline because it appears easy, and relatively few (5%) choose it because the major they wanted was unavailable.  In other words, sociology majors find the discipline exciting and challenging and generally enjoy studying sociology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spalter-Roth2005&quot;/&gt; 

By the time they graduate, 90% of sociology majors report understanding the basic concepts of the discipline (e.g., social structure, social stratification, etc.).  Most also grasp the differences in the theoretical paradigms of sociology (e.g., structural functionalism, conflict theory, etc.).  Sociology majors feel confident in the following skills as a result of their degree: identifying ethical issues in research, developing evidence-based arguments, evaluating different research methods, writing reports that are understandable by non-sociologists, forming causal hypothesis, using computers to develop reference lists, interpreting the results of data analysis, and using statistical software (though slightly less than 50% feel confident in their ability to use statistical software).&lt;ref name=&quot;Spalter-Roth2005&quot;/&gt;

Sociology majors are generally satisfied overall with their experience earning a sociology degree.  Most are also satisfied with the quality of teaching, the accessibility to technology and faculty, their interaction with other majors, and getting the courses they need to graduate.  Unfortunately, most students (between 80% and 92%) are dissatisfied with the information provided on graduate school and career opportunities (hopefully this brief chapter will help fill this void).&lt;ref name=&quot;Spalter-Roth2005&quot;/&gt;

==Bachelor's Degree Occupations==
What can you do with a Baccalaureate degree in Sociology?  While it may not seem like it when you are deep into studying race relations or gender stratification, the training you receive as a sociology major is actually quite applicable outside academia as well.  College graduates trained in sociology bring unique and valuable insights into business decisions concerning issues surrounding race, ethnicity, gender, age, education, and social class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercurio2008&quot;/&gt;  To give a specific example, a sociology major could help a company like [[w:CVS|CVS]] realize the problem with tagging hair care items for African Americans with anti-theft measures while not doing the same for hair care items for whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVS2008&quot;&gt;“Urban Legends Reference Pages: CVS Hair Care Products.” http://snopes.com/racial/business/cvs.asp (Accessed April 30, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  Practices like these may seem pragmatic to the managers of these stores, but they also alienate consumers.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVS2008&quot;/&gt;

College graduates trained in sociology bring many skills to their jobs, including: the ability to recognize trends and patterns, the ability to create concise reports and essays, strong critical thinking skills, oral presentation skills, strong interpersonal communication skills, skills in data collection and analysis using statistical software, grant writing skills, management skills, and planning and organizational skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldWideLearn&quot;&gt; “Sociology Major | What Can You Do With a College Degree in Sociology?.” http://www.worldwidelearn.com/online-education-guide/social-science/sociology-major.htm (Accessed April 30, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  All of these skills are potentially invaluable contributions to workplaces.

Most graduating seniors (around 72%) plan on getting a job right out of college.  Around 40% plan on going on to graduate school (these paths aren't mutually exclusive of course, you can work while going to graduate school). There are a number of institutions where sociologists find employment, including: schools, churches, hospitals, corporations, government, and social service agencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercurio2008&quot;&gt;Mercurio, Joe. 2008. “A Perspective on Business Careers for Sociologists.” Footnotes, February 2008, 3. http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/feb08/fn1.html&lt;/ref&gt; For those planning on getting jobs, all of the following are career paths sociology majors are well-suited for: [[w:Organization development|organizational planning, development, and training]]; [[w:Human resource management|human resource management]]; [[w:Industrial relations|industrial relations]]; [[w:Marketing|marketing]]; [[w:Public relations|public relations]]; [[w:Organizational studies|organizational research]]; and [[w:International business|international business]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ASACareers&quot;&gt; “Sociology Major - Preparation for Careers | American Sociological Association.” http://www.asanet.org/cs/root/leftnav/careers_and_jobs/sociology_major_preparation_for_careers (Accessed April 30, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Corporate World===
Some sociologists find the adaptation of their sociological training and insights to the business world relatively easy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercurio2008&quot;/&gt;  Corporations want and need to understand their customers' habits and preferences in order to anticipate changes in their markets.  This drive to understand consumers is called ''[[w:consumer research|consumer research]]'' and is a growing interest of corporations.  Sociology majors are particularly well-suited for this type of research as the ultimate goal of empirical sociological research is to predict human behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASARoles&quot;&gt;http://www.asanet.org/cs/root/leftnav/careers_and_jobs/sociological_roles_relating_to_business_industry_and_work&lt;/ref&gt;  This particular niche may be the single largest opportunity for sociologists in the corporate world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercurio2008&quot;/&gt;  

Another budding area in modern retail firms is site selection, or the determination of the best locations for new stores.  Site selection requires understanding human ecology and consumer spending patterns, both of which are addressed using the sociological imagination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercurio2008&quot;/&gt;  Some additional direct applications of sociology include concept and product testing (which will put to good use training in research methods), the evaluating of global market opportunities (which will draw upon understandings of various cultures),  long-range planning and forecasting (which draws on both statistics and futurist perspectives), marketing and advertising (which applies consumer studies directly), and human resource management (which relies on studies of organizational behavior).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercurio2008&quot;/&gt;

One way to situate yourself well for the corporate world after earning your Bachelor's degree in Sociology would be to double major in Sociology and Business or minor in Business. This would give you the credentials that hiring departments in the business world are looking for while simultaneously allowing you to focus on Sociology.  Another key to succeeding in the corporate world with a degree in Sociology is to market your specific skill set.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spalter-Roth&amp;VanVooren2008&quot;&gt;Spalter-Roth, Roberta and Nicole Van Vooren. 2008. Pathways to Job Satisfaction: What Happened to the Class of 2005. American Sociological Association Department of Research and Development. http://www.asanet.org/galleries/default-file/ASA_Pathways.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted above, a degree in Sociology provides you with skills that many other college graduates lack.  Emphasizing those skills on your resumes and in job interviews increases the odds of you being hired and you using those skills in your job.  There is also evidence to suggest that sociology graduates who use their sociological training in their jobs post graduation are more satisfied with their jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spalter-Roth&amp;VanVooren2008&quot;/&gt;

===Non-Governmental Organizations===
Non-Governmental Organizations (or NGOs) are legally constituted organizations created by private persons or organizations with no participation or representation of any government.  Examples of NGOs include [[w:Oxfam|Oxfam]], [[w:Catholic Relief Services|Catholic Relief Services]], [[w:CARE International|CARE International]], and [[w:Lutheran World Relief|Lutheran World Relief]].  Many NGOs are concerned with the very social problems and social issues sociologists study, from poverty to gender stratification to world population growth.  NGOs are ideal opportunities for sociology majors to apply what they have learned in college.

===Continuing Your Education===
For those planning on continuing their education, the table to the right breaks down the most frequently chosen fields of study for sociology majors:

Many professional degree programs (e.g., [[w:Medical school|medical school]] and [[w:Law school|law school]]) do not, in fact, require someone to have a specific undergraduate degree.  Sociology majors can carry the sociological imagination into medical practice, offering sociological insights while practicing medicine.  In 2001, sociology majors had a 42% acceptance rate into medical school.&lt;ref name=&quot;MedicalSchool&quot;&gt;“Acceptance to Medical School by Undergraduate Major, 2000-2001 Entering Class.” http://www.colorado.edu/aac/table1.pdf (Accessed April 30, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociology majors should view their undergraduate education as opening doors for them into many possible fields of work and study. Two factors seems to limit the occupational prospects of sociologists: The first limiting factor is their own imagination.  The sociological imagination is applicable to almost every occupation and field of research, from studying how physicists do their work &lt;ref name=&quot;Garfinkel1981&quot;&gt;Garfinkel, H., M. Lynch, and E. Livingston (1981). The work of a discovering science construed with materials from the optically discovered pulsar. Philosophy of the Social Sciences 11(2): 131-158.&lt;/ref&gt; to union organizing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lerner2007&quot;&gt;Lerner, Stephen. 2007. Global Corporations, Global Unions. Contexts. 6:3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second limiting factors is that many people do not know what sociologists are trained to do.  This should only be a limiting factor up until they meet a sociology major!

==PhD Degree Occupations==
What can you do with a PhD in Sociology?  A PhD in Sociology prepares an individual for a variety of career options, including all of those mentioned above for someone with a Bachelor's Degree in Sociology (e.g., marketing, non-governmental organizations, etc.), but it also means you will be much better qualified for these types of jobs.  [[w:Graduate School|Graduate training]] in Sociology includes a greater emphasis on research methodology and statistics.  It also often includes training in [[w:qualitative research|qualitative research]] methods, like [[w:content analysis|content analysis]].  Additionally, graduate training includes much more in depth analysis and discussion of many of the topics discussed in your undergraduate training.  The format of graduate training may also differ as many of the classes are designed as a [[w:seminar|seminar]] rather than a lecture-oriented class - students will come to class meetings having read the assigned readings and then discuss them under the supervision of a professor.

All of this additional training will prepare a PhD in Sociology for advanced careers in fields as diverse as corporate marketing and statistical forecasting to community organizing and lobbying.  A PhD in quantitative research and demography could lead to a career at the [[w:United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] or the [[w:World Bank|World Bank]].

Another obvious occupation one can pursue is as an academic sociologist, working at a college or university.  Depending on the type of university or college where one works, the job description will vary substantially.  Some colleges - typically four-year [[w:liberal arts college|liberal arts colleges]] - focus on teaching.  In contrast, [[w:university|research universities]] - which include PhD programs - focus on research.  Thus, what your job description would be as an academic sociologist could range from a heavy emphasis on teaching undergraduates to a heavy emphasis on teaching graduate students.  In both types of institutions, there are both tenure and non-tenure track jobs.  [[w:Tenure|Tenure]] refers to a lifetime appointment and carries with it a contractual right not to have the position terminated without just cause.  Adjunct instructing is another option, which is usually teaching on a contract basis.

According to [http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/julyaugust08/job.html Forbes magazine], Sociology is one of the top-ten highest-paying rare jobs in the United States and is generally rated as one of the most satisfying occupations.  This may be due to the fact that Sociologists are often engaged in trying to remedy social ills, which can be a very satisfying life pursuit.

According to data compiled in ASA’s 2007 [http://www.asanet.org/images/research/docs/ppt/ASA%20Beyond%20Ivory%20Tower%20Slideshow.PPT “Beyond the Ivory Tower”] report, one-fourth of  PhD sociologists work outside academia. Of those in academia, as of April 2008, the average sociology faculty salary was $68,857, ranging from assistant professors making $53,844 to full professor earnings of $87,938.

Often there is a need to remove unwanted elements in a image, such as the background. There are multiple methods.

==Method 1: Magic Wand==
An easy method is to use the ''Magic Wand'' selection tool.
# Firstly, right click on the layer you are working on and add an alpha channel if there is not already one. (Select Layer, Transparency, Add Alpha Channel.)
# Now switch to the ''Magic Wand'' tool. Make sure the mode is set to ''Add to the current selection''. (Mode is on Toolbox palette, just below &quot;Fuzzy select&quot;)
# Select all the parts that you want to erase by simply clicking in the area. 
# Press Delete..

==Method 2: Colour to Alpha==
An alternative method is ''Colour to Alpha''. This method works better with logos with less than 5 colours.
# Firstly, right click on the layer you are working on and add an alpha channel if required.
# Select ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Colours &gt; Colour to Alpha''.
# Set the colour after the &quot;From:&quot; label to the colour that you would like to remove.
# Click OK.
# Repeat steps 1-4 for any other colours that you need to remove.

==Method 3: Foreground Select==
A new method is the ''Foreground Select'' tool. This is best when there is only one thing in the foreground which you want to keep.
# Firstly, select the ''Foreground Select'' tool.
# Mark out a rough area around the foreground.
# Scribble in the foreground only. Repeat scribbling until the coloured boundary is tightly around the foreground.
# Press ENTER.
# Go to ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Select &gt; Invert''.
# Press Delete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
If you have studied Chapter 4 of CME, you will have learned
the ''power rule'' for differentiating simple polynomial functions,
known as ''terms''.
A term has the form:

    &lt;math&gt; a x ^ n &lt;/math&gt;

with ''a'' being known as the coefficient of the term and ''n''
being known as the ''exponent'' of the term.

Here is the power rule for terms:

    &lt;math&gt;\frac{d(a x^n)}{dx} = a n x^{n - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

As example, consider the polynomial:

    &lt;math&gt;y = 2 x^3&lt;/math&gt;

If the power rule is correct, then the derivative should be:

    &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = 6 x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Let's test. We start out by defining a function to
represent the polynomial:

    function y(x)
        {
        2 * (x ^ 3);
        }

As before, the dependent variable becomes the name of
the function and the independent variable becomes the
formal parameter.

----
Before we continue, now would be a good time to learn 
about [[The Sway Reference Manual/Storing Code in Files|using Sway with files]],
since typing into the interpreter
can be rather painful for function definitions.

Thus for the rest of this book, even though interactions
with the interpreter are shown, you should be storing
Sway programs in files and running Sway programs from files.
----

The derivative, or &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; can be
written as this function:

    function dy/dx(x)
        {
        6 * (x ^ 2);
        }

Is there any way to test whether or not the power rule
is correct?
Recall our revised ratio function from the previous chapter:

    function ratio(x,dx,y)
        {
        var dy = y(x + dx) - y(x);
        dy / dx;
        }

As you should remember, the ratio it computes is an approximation
for the derivative at a given ''x''.
Note that we've changed the names of the formal parameters,
''w'' to ''x'', ''dw'' to ''dx'', and ''h'' to ''y'',
to reflect the fact that we are working with
polynomials now.&lt;ref&gt;
In general, it does not matter what names are used
for the formal parameters, so we could have left
the ''ratio'' function untouched and it would still 
work exactly the same.
&lt;/ref&gt;

We believe that ''ratio'' (for small ''dx'')
produces a number that should be close to what the function ''dy/dx''
produces.

Let's define a testing function:

    function test(x)
        {
        var dx = 0.000001;
        
        println(&quot;for x = &quot;,x);
        inspect(ratio(x,dx,y));
        inspect(dy/dx(x));
        println();
        }

Given a value for ''x'', the test function will print
out the two results.
Time for some nomenclature. When we use our ''ratio''
function, we are finding the derivative ''numerically''.
That is to say, we use a small number for ''dx'', find
the resulting ''dy'', and then compute
the ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand,
using the power rule (as embodied in the function ''dy/dx''),
we find the derivative ''symbolically'' since
we never actually compute an actual ratio.

     sway&gt; test(10);
     for x = 10
     ratio(x,dx,y) is 600.00005965
     dy/dx(x) is 600
       
     sway&gt; test(20);
     for x = 20
     ratio(x,dx,y) is 2400.0001231
     dy/dx(x) is 2400
       
     sway&gt; test(30);
     for x = 30
     ratio(x,dx,y) is 5400.0001837
     dy/dx(x) is 5400

For this test at least, we see that there is good agreement
between our numeric and symbolic solutions.

Clearly, though, the symbolic solution is preferred because:

* it is exact
* it is easier to compute

You may be asking yourself, can we write a program
to find a derivative symbolically?

==A Shortcoming to Our Approach==

It certainly
would be nice if we could use the symbolic approach to finding
derivatives instead of our numeric approach
using ratios. The problem is that our function
representing a term:

    function y(x)
        {
        2 * (x ^ 3);
        }

has the coefficient 2 and the exponent 3 hard-wired.
If we are given such a function
but aren't privy to the internal details (such as the value of
the hard-wired exponent), we cannot create the derivative function
since we need to know the value of the exponent to do so and
have no way to get at it.
We need to contrive a way to retrieve the exponent
from the function so we can use it to construct the
derivative function.

The next section is to give you an exposure to one approach
for extracting the components of a function.
The approach uses ''objects''.
----
If you don't know what an object is or how to create one in
Sway, please read about [[The Sway Reference Manual/Objects|using objects]] in the 
[[The Sway Reference Manual]] now.
----

OK, now that you are familiar with objects, we
can begin to use objects to write a program that
finds a derivative symbolically.

==Polynomial Objects and the Power Rule==

Instead of using a function
to represent the polynomial ''y'', we are going to use
an object instead.
From studying the reference manual, you know that an
object is simply an environment and an environment
is simply a table of variables and their values.
You also know that you use a function to create
an object and that a function that creates an
object is conventionally known as a ''constructor''.
Finally, you know that to define a constructor function,
you have that function return the predefined variable
''this''.

Here's a constructor for a simple polynomial object.
We name the constructor ''term'':

    function term(a,n)
       {
       function value(x)
           {
           a * (x ^ n);
           }
        this;
        }

Note that the constructor includes an internal function
for computing the value
of ''y'' given an ''x'', just as before. We call that function by
using the ''dot'' operator.

    sway&gt; var y = term(2,3);
    OBJECT: &lt;OBJECT 1671&gt;
    sway&gt; y . value(4);
    INTEGER: 128
    sway&gt; y . value(5);
    INTEGER: 250

Indeed,
&lt;math&gt;2 * 4 ^ 3&lt;/math&gt;
is truly 128 and
&lt;math&gt;2 * 5 ^ 3&lt;/math&gt;
is truly 250.

Now comes the good part!
Storing a polynomial term
as an object rather than a function allows us to extract
the coefficient ''a'' and the exponent ''n'':

    sway&gt; y . a;
    INTEGER: 2;
    sway&gt; y . n;
    INTEGER: 3;

We can even ''pretty print'' the object ''y'' to see all its
fields:

    sway&gt; pp(y);
    &lt;OBJECT 2561&gt;:
        context: &lt;OBJECT 749&gt;
        dynamicContext: &lt;OBJECT 749&gt;
        callDepth: 1
        constructor: &lt;function term(a,n)&gt;
        this: &lt;OBJECT 2561&gt;
        value: &lt;function value(x)&gt;
        a: 2
        n: 3
    OBJECT: &lt;OBJECT 2561&gt;

We see, among other fields, the correct values for ''a'' and
''n''. Later on, you will understand the meaning and purpose
of the predefined fields:
''context'',
''dynamicContext'', and
''constructor''.
The ''this'' field you already know.

We want access to ''a'' and ''n'' because the power rule
needs them
to compute the derivative polynomial. Now we can write an
expression that allows us to compute the derivative:

    sway&gt; var coeff = y . a;
    sway&gt; var exp = y . n;

    sway&gt; var z = term(coeff * exp,exp - 1);
    OBJECT: &lt;OBJECT 2783&gt;

    sway&gt; z . a;
    INTEGER: 6

    sway&gt; z . n;
    INTEGER: 2

    sway&gt; z . value(4)
    INTEGER: 96

Of course, we could write a function to do this task for us:

    function powerRule(t)
        {
        var coeff = t . a;
        var exp = t . n;
        term(coeff * exp,exp - 1);
        }

Note that the ''powerRule'' function takes a ''term'' object as
an argument and returns a new ''term'' object that represents
the derivative. This is because the new term has a coefficient
of &lt;tt&gt;a * n&lt;/tt&gt; and an exponent of &lt;tt&gt;n - 1&lt;/tt&gt;, just like
the power rule dictates. Let's check and make sure our power
rule works as intended:

    sway&gt; var y = term(2,3);
    sway&gt; var z = powerRule(y);
    
    sway&gt; y . value(4);
    INTEGER: 128
    sway&gt; z . value(4);
    INTEGER: 96

Indeed it does!

Moreover, pretty printing ''z'' shows us the correct
values for ''a'' and ''n'':

    sway&gt; pp(dy/dx);
    &lt;OBJECT 2922&gt;:
        context: &lt;OBJECT 749&gt;
        dynamicContext: &lt;OBJECT 2808&gt;
        callDepth: 2
        constructor: &lt;function term(a,n)&gt;
        this: &lt;OBJECT 2922&gt;
        value: &lt;function value(x)&gt;
        a: 6
        n: 2
    OBJECT: &lt;OBJECT 2922&gt;

You may not have noticed it, but we have a little lack of symmetry.
While the term object has an internal function for computing its
value, we use an external function, ''powerRule'' to compute its
derivative. When we program using objects, we use internal functions
when possible. So let's rewrite the ''term'' function so that
it can compute its own derivative:

    function term(a,n)
        {
        function value(x)
            {
            a * (x ^ n);
            }
        function diff()
            {
            term(a * n,n - 1);
            }
        this;
        }

We name this new internal function, ''diff'', to indicate
taking the differential of our object. Note how we have
dispensed with the variables ''coeff'' and ''exp'' inside the
''diff'' function and just used ''a'' and ''n'' directly.

Finally, we add a third internal function to ''term''. This
one is used to ''visualize'' our object in a more concise
way than using the ''pp'' function. By convention, we
will call this function ''toString'':

    function term(a,n)
        {
        function value(x)
            {
            a * (x ^ n);
            }
        function diff()
            {
            term(a * n,n - 1);
            }
        function toString()
            {
            string(a) + &quot;x^&quot; + string(n);
            }
        this;
        }

The ''toString'' function converts both the coefficient and the exponent
to strings and then concatenates those strings together to 
form a string representation of the term:

    sway&gt; y = term(2,3);
    sway&gt; z = y . diff();

    sway&gt; y . toString()
    STRING: &quot;2x^3&quot;

    sway&gt; x . toString()
    STRING: &quot;6x^2&quot;

Notice how much easier it is to pick out the coefficient and the
exponent of a term by using the ''toString'' function.
Another way to formulate the ''toString'' function takes advantage
of the fact that if you add a string and a number (with the
string on the left hand side of the plus sign, the number is
automatically converted to a string. That, with the fact that
Sway combines mathematical operators from left-to-right, lets
us remove the string conversion of ''n'':

    function toString()
        {
        string(a) + &quot;x^&quot; + n;
        }

If we use an empty string to start the expression, we can remove
the first string conversion as well:

    function toString()
        {
        &quot;&quot; + a + &quot;x^&quot; + n;
        }

==A Whole System of Objects==

From here on out, we are going to develop a system for finding
the derivative (and eventually, the integral) of many kinds of mathematical
objects (limited only by our imagination and attention span).
Each object in our system will do (at least) three things. The
first is to compute its value at a given spot.
The second is to compute its
derivative (and eventually, its integral). The third is to
compute its visualization.  So all our mathematical objects
will have ''value'', ''diff'', and ''toString'' internal functions or
''methods''.
&lt;ref&gt;
In the world of object-oriented programming
(which is another way of saying programming with objects),
these internal functions are called ''methods''. We will
use the term ''method'' from now one. Just remember, a method
is simply an internal function.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the simplest real-world mathematical objects such as
numbers and variables will need to be re-created as Sway objects.
That way, we can always take the derivative of an object
without having to ask first if taking the derivative makes
sense. 

==Questions==

All formulas are written using Grammar School Precedence.

'''1'''.
Why does the Sway implementation of &lt;math&gt;2 x^3&lt;/math&gt; have parentheses: &lt;tt&gt;2 * (x ^ 3)&lt;/tt&gt;?

'''2'''.
Using the ''powerRule'' function, can you take the derivative of a derivative?
Explain.

'''3'''.
Write a function that uses the power rule function to answer the following questions on p. 58 of Thompson: 
1, 2, 4, 6, 7. Name your function ''p58''. Your function should calculate,
then print the answers to the questions.

'''4'''.
Using pencil and paper, work exercises 3, 8, 9, and 10 on p. 58 of Thompson.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
In the Sway world, an object is a simple a collection of related variables.
You've already been exposed to objects, although you may not
have realized it. When you created a variable, you modified
the environment, which is an object. When you defined a
function, you created 
an object. To view an object, we use the predefined function
''pp'' or ''ppObject''&lt;ref&gt;
The ''pp'' in the function names stands for ''pretty print'' which
means to print out something so it is 'pretty looking'.
&lt;/ref&gt;. Evaluating the code:

    function square(x)
        {
        x * x;
        }
    
    ppObject(square);

yields the following output:

    &lt;FUNCTION 3059&gt;:
        context: &lt;OBJECT 677&gt;
        prior: :null
        filter: :null
        parameters: (x)
        code: { x * x; }
        name: square

We see that the ''square'' function is made up of six ''fields''&lt;ref&gt;
Some people use the term ''component'' or ''instance variable'' instead
of ''field''.
Also, if you try this, you may see different numbers than 3059 and 677.
&lt;/ref&gt;. These fields are: ''context'', ''prior'', ''filter'', ''parameters'',
''code'', and ''name''.

Usually, an object lets you look at its individual components.
For example:

    println(&quot;square's parameters are: &quot;,square . parameters);

yields:

    square's parameters are: (x)
    
We use the function '.' (usually called the ''dot operator'') to extract
the fields of an object.

It is easy to create your own objects. First you must make a
''constructor''. A constructor is just a function that returns 
''this''. Suppose you want a constructor to
create an object with fields ''name'' and ''age''. Here is 
one possibility:

    function person()
        {
        var name;
        var age;
        
        this;
        }

We can create an object simply by calling the constructor:

    var p = person();

The variable ''p'' now points to the ''person'' object and we
can use ''p'' and the dot operator to
set the fields of the person object:

    p . name = &quot;Boris&quot;;
    p . age = 33;
    inspect(p . name);

Evaluating this code yields the following output:

    p . name is Boris

It is often convenient to give initial values to the fields of
an object. Here is another version of ''person'' that allows us
to do just that when we create the object:

    function person(name,age)
        {
        this;
        }
        
    var p = person(&quot;Boris&quot;,33);
        
    inspect(p . name);

The output is the same:

    p . name is Boris

In general, if a field is to be initialized when the object
is constructed, make that field a formal parameter. If not,
make the field a locally declared variable.

==Adding Methods==

Objects can have methods&lt;ref&gt;
A method is just another name for a local function.
&lt;/ref&gt;
as well. Here's a version of the
person constructor that has a ''birthday'' method.

    function person(name,age)
        {
        function birthday()
            {
            println(&quot;Happy Birthday, &quot;,name,&quot;!&quot;);
            age = age + 1;
            }
        this;
        }
        
    var p = person(&quot;Boris&quot;,33);
    p . birthday();
    inspect(p . age);

The output of this code is:

    Happy Birthday, Boris!
    p . age is 34

In summary, one turns a function into a constructor by making

    this;

or

    return this;

the last line of a function. The local variables, including
formal parameters, become the fields of the function while
any local functions serve as methods.

==Objects and Types==

If you were to ask an object, &quot;What are you?&quot;, it
would respond, &quot;I am an object!&quot;. The ''type'' function is
used to ask such questions:

    var p = person(&quot;betty&quot;,19);
    inspect(type(p));

yields:

    type(p) is :OBJECT

While this is useful at times, often we would like to know what
kind of object the object is. For example, we might like to 
know whether or not ''p'' is a person object. One way to do this
is to ask the constructor of the object if it is the person function.
Luckily, all objects carry along a pointer to the function
that constructed them:

    var p = person(&quot;betty&quot;,19);
    inspect(p . constructor . name);

yields:

    p . constructor . name is person

So, to ask if ''p'' is a person, we would use the
expression

    if (p . constructor . name == :person) ...

Since this construct is rather wordy, there
is a simple function, named ''is'', that you can use instead:

    if (p is :person) ...

The ''is'' function works for non-objects too. All of the following
expressions are true:

    3 is :INTEGER
    3.4 is :REAL
    &quot;hello&quot; is :STRING
    :blue is :SYMBOL
    list(1,2,3) is :LIST
    array(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;) is :ARRAY
    person(&quot;betty&quot;,19) is :OBJECT
    this is :OBJECT

The ''is'' function also works for variables bound to values as well.

== A formal view of object-orientation ==

Sway is a fully-featured object-oriented language. What does
that mean exactly? Well, to begin with, a programming language
is considered object-oriented if it has these
three features:

# encapsulation
# inheritance
# polymorphism

Encapsulation in this sense means that a programmer
can bundle ''data'' and ''methods'' into a single entity.
We've seen that a Sway function can
have local variables and local functions.
So, if we consider local variables (including the formal
parameters) as data and local
functions as methods, we see that Sway can encapsulate
in the object-oriented sense.

Inheritance is the ability to use the data and methods
of one kind of object by another as if they were defined
in the other object to begin with.

Polymorphism means that an object that inherits appears
to be both kinds of object, the kind of object it is
itself and the kind of object from which it inherits.
We will learn more about inheritance and
polymorphism in a later chapter.

== Using the '''''objects''''' library ==

If you include the '''''objects''''' library,
you can add ''toString'' methods to your objects.
Then when you display the objects, the ''toString''
method is called to help generate the output.

== Request for Template Protection ==

I request that the WikiBooks [[Template:Dropimage]] be protected.
I made it recently, and it is important to the
[[Editing Wikitext/Pictures]] page, which makes use of it throughout.
It might be as well to protect [[Template:Droplist]] at the same time.
I hope that this is the right way to get this done, as I am a bit
new to all this.  Thanks in advance for your help, [[User:Hyundai|Hyundai]] ([[User talk:Hyundai|talk]]) 10:50, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

: Why should nobody be able to edit these templates? Wikibooks doesn't normally protect templates much, as anyone should be able to edit them and improve on them like any content. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:16, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

::darklama, Hi!,
:: It is all about reducing the ''exposure to vandalism'' for those who have already invested their time.   Also, if a template were to be modified adversely, then not only would others be denied its use, but any work which then depended on it for correct functioning, would fail to work.

::As you know, it takes hours of work for even quite simple pages, and it is best not to tempt providence.   In any case, when it is protected, the code is still available for all to copy and use in ''modified'' versions.  Regards, [[User:Hyundai|Hyundai]] ([[User talk:Hyundai|talk]]) 14:43, 19 March 2008 (UTC)

::: Please [[WB:FAITH|assume good faith]], that the majority of people here have good intentions, and any changes are for the better. Wikibooks doesn't usually protect pages and templates due to what could happen. If someone is willing to put the time in to fix any usage of a template because there modifications broke it, then they should be welcome to do so. If someone makes a change you don't like, discuss it with them and find a compromise both of you can agree with. Someone could of invested as much time trying to improve a template as you did originally to make it. Everyone's time is of equal worth and importance here. If someone vandalizes it, someone will block them and revert them. If the template breaks, someone will fix it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:55, 19 March 2008 (UTC)

::Hi again,
::'''After a period of ''assuming good faith'', I can can tell you that it is a waste of time!   I am even more determined for important work to be protected.

It is too easy to do!!!'''

== Vandalism:   Lots on the one page ==

The entire page of [[Editing Wikitext/Pictures/The Quick Course|Editing Wikitext/Pictures/The Quick Course]] was deleted.   Since there was ''a lot of it on the one page'' this would seem to qualify for a comment here.

The history page extract reads:

(cur) (last)  16:56, 2 April 2008 '''Madhumohan''' (Talk | contribs) (empty) (Removing all content from page) (undo)

I have restored the page from a backup, but frankly, it causes me to reiterate the need for restricting access to some pages; it is even more important for some templates. (See elsewhere in admin notes).

[[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 18:10, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

== Non-Free Images Deadline ==

I just wanted to alert people that the deadline for deletion of images under the board's licensing policy is coming up on March 23. The policy is here:
:http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Licensing_policy
We here at Wikibooks have been in very good compliance with this policy so far. However, We still don't have an &quot;official&quot; licensing policy (called an EDP in the resolution above). [[Wikibooks:Media]] seems to be the best proposed candidate, and we have been following that policy (or nearly following it) as a ''de facto'' standard for some time now. Maybe the time has come for us to give it a final look-over and accept it as an official policy. 

According to the resolution, all fair use images must be deleted by March 23rd 2008, unless there is a policy that specifically allows certain fair use images to be kept. I don't know how the foundation is going to enforce this, I haven't heard any mention of this resolution for some time now. However, in the worst case scenario (and I don't expect this at all), members of the board or the developers could have all fair use images automatically deleted without our input. Again, I stress that I don't think this possibility will happen. Maybe nothing will happen and the resolution will not be enforced at all. However, I still this this is a good opportunity for us to look at [[Wikibooks:Media]] and see about making that (or a derivation of it) an official policy here. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:04, 7 March 2008 (UTC)
:Absolutely, we need to approve an EDP (presumably [[WB:MEDIA]]). I've been slogging through the fair use categories &amp; the only real problem is missing rationales - unfortunately they're a lot of work to write. I've looked at maybe 30% of the categories, fixing as much as I can, but there's plenty of work left. Despite the fact that our grace period ends on the 23rd, I also assume we'll have an extended grace period after that. We should aim to be in compliance as soon as possible, so let's all pitch in (both on approving a policy and on the cleanup required). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:22, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

OK, [[User:MonoBot|Monobi's bot]] has finished it's work; we now have lots of images that have no rationale, but should. I've emailed users who have more than a few and who have an email set, so hopefully we won't lose too many of the images. Any user reading this can go through [[:Category:Images with no fair use rationale]] and start putting up rationales. They're not hard to do; the template leads you through it and [[WB:MEDIA]] spells out what's needed in detail. I would also like to suggest that we hurry up and approve a fair use policy before the March 23rd [[foundation:Resolution:Licensing policy|deadline]] so that we can keep the fair use images that ''do'' have a rationale. Let's turn our attention to [[Wikibooks talk:Media]] :) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:32, 16 March 2008 (UTC)

:So the deadline is '''March 23rd''' - that's Sunday. Monobi has written a [[User:MonoBot/deletion script|script]] for me which will delete problem images, and log images which might be ok. I'd like to run it on Sunday, but I'm hesitant to do so when there's been basically no effort to fix the images missing rationales. I don't know how much can be done between now and then, but if you have time, there's many images that need rationales written for them (nudge nudge). That said, the images ''aren't'' in compliance (and won't be even if we put lots of effort into writing rationales), so they should be deleted on Sunday as applicable. As well, we have no EDP/fair use policy, so we need to discuss that, presumably at [[Wikibooks talk:Media]], since that's our ''defacto'' policy. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:12, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

== Picture heavy book inclusion criteria... ==

I am interested in composing some Wikibooks that are picture heavy. They would have some factual learning and then also be meant to spark the imagination of readers. A question for those in the know, and to avoid having my work deleted, is this within Wikibooks' scope? Is it something for the user namespace? How should I proceed? Thanks. --[[User:Remi|Remi]] ([[User talk:Remi|talk]]) 06:35, 4 April 2008 (UTC)

:G'day Remi, we in fact already have some in [[Wikijunior]], for example [[Wikijunior:World at work]] and [[Wikijunior:Animal Alphabet]]. Some of the computer graphics textbooks can be quite picture heavy too, for example [[Blender 3D]]. If your images are correctly licensed and your book complies with [[WB:WIW]], then you should have no problem. Please consider uploading images to [[Commons:|Commons]] instead of Wikibooks, so that they may be more easily reused (e.g. in a translation of your book!) or, better still, utilise some of the images already there. What will your books be about? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:51, 4 April 2008 (UTC)

== WikiBooks Format ==

I am starting my own wiki and I would like to have the same kind of structure of Book--&gt; Module or even better Book--&gt; Chapter --&gt; Verse.  Any advice or extensions that might help me.  I have looked through the extensions on MediaWiki and others that have shown up in searches, but nothing really helps.

Thanks,
Greg

:You just need to enable subpages for the Main namespace. Add the following to your LocalSettings.php file:
::&lt;tt&gt;$wgNamespacesWithSubpages[NS_MAIN] = true;&lt;/tt&gt;

== Wording to create a new page ==

When you [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=New_book&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1 go]] to create a new book(or page), an info box comes at the top. Is this a template (something I can view the code for), or it something admin only type of hard coded thing?

:Okay, answered my own question. It's here [[MediaWiki:Newarticletext]]
::Both. That template at the top of the page is only a default, you can actually do a lot of modifications. When you go to create a new page, you can (if your wiki-foo is strong):
::#Edit the template at the top to display a specific message for a new page
::#Edit the template at the top to display a different message if the page already exists (&quot;I already exist, check before saving!&quot;)
::#Preload the edit box with custom text. 
::Check out some of the work that I've done on my [[User:Whiteknight/Book Creator Gadget|book creator page]]. It's as close to automation as we can get around here without having to use javascript.

== Import vs. rename bug ==

I ran into this last night, and not sure what to do about it. Turns out that if an account has edits here (through the magic of import), the username can't be registered! The account came up on listusers, but had no account creation log.

My seat of the pants solution was to move &quot;User:Username&quot; to &quot;User:Username (wikipedia edits)&quot;. I then blocked the wikipedia edits account. We might want a template for the userpage or something as well (&quot;this user is a transwiki ghost of...&quot;?), but at least we should try to do the same thing for each case. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:38, 20 April 2008 (UTC)
:Perhaps crats should be permitted to override the software with [[mw:Extension:User Merge and Delete|Extension:User Merge &lt;s&gt;and Delete&lt;/s&gt;]]. Even so, this is a problem, so I'll make a report at bugzilla for you. I think the desired behaviour here is that the user is uncreateable (to avoid users registering an account that already has edits, which could attribute those edits to someone who didn't make them) but that this is possible to override. Alternatively, all imported history might use the User@xxproject format for attribution (which is not a username that can be created), but I seriously doubt that'd be possible retroactively. Realistically, I think the ability to override the software is necessary here (similarly with renaming someone to an account which has been merged - though there is now a method to do this is a slightly more roundabout way). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:49, 20 April 2008 (UTC)
:Actually, it seems you ''can'' create the account, which is (IMO) a bug, as it allows the imported edits to be attributed to anyone who registers the account. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:41, 20 April 2008 (UTC)

I like the idea of using User@xxproject for the short run. With SUL just around the corner, whenever they fix the outstanding problems though, the entire issue of someone being able to hijack contributions will become moot. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:49, 20 April 2008 (UTC)
:For reference: [[bugzilla:13798]]
:I meant that when edits are imported, they should be attributed to User@xxproject - not that we rename the ghost accounts to that (as there may be more than one project which has edits of that user imported, and we can't split it into more than one user; also, there are many many users with only imported contribs, and we can't rename them all) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:52, 20 April 2008 (UTC)

  - Add a very small piece of yeast and &lt;u&gt;slice the citrons into the mix, carefully removing the white part&lt;/u&gt;. 

The white part (pith) of citrus fruit is bitter tasting. 

Do the instructions mean that the zest (outer colored peel) be separately removed from the pith and put into the fermentation container?

If so, should the white pith be removed from the pulp of the fruit before slicing and placing the pulp into the container?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This article is on the topic of creating Bode plots in MATLAB.  The quick answer is use the ''bode'' command.  However, the bode command has several options and the plots generated by the ''bode'' command are not easily reformatted.  The default formatting of most MATLAB plots is good for analysis but less than ideal for dropping into Word and PowerPoint documents or even this website.  As a result this article presents an alternative that requires more lines of code but offers the full formatting flexibility of the generic [[MATLAB Plot|''plot'']] command.

==MATLAB's Bode Command==
The basic bode command is as follows
  &gt;&gt; bode(LTI_SYS)
where
:*LTI_SYS is an LTI object - [[MATLAB Transfer Function|TF]], [[MATLAB State Space|SS]], [[MATLAB ZPK|ZPK]], or [[MATLAB FRD|FRD]]
The bode command will automatically call ''gcf'' which will put the bode plot on the current [[MATLAB figure|figure]].  If no figure exists then one is created by ''gcf''.

If you wish to specify the frequency points at which ''LTI_SYS'' is plotted then create a frequency vector using [[MATLAB logspace|''logspace'']] or [[MATLAB linspace|''linspace]] as follows
  &gt;&gt; freqVec = logspace(-1, 3, 5000);
  &gt;&gt; bode(LTI_SYS, freqVec * (2*pi))
where
:*freqVec is a vector of 5000 frequencies, in Hz, spaced evenly on a log scale from 10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:*pi is a MATLAB constant equal to the value of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and in this case it is used to convert freqVec to rad/sec as it is passed to the ''bode'' command

In order to get the magnitude and phase at each frequency point the ''bode'' command must be called with output arguments such as
  &gt;&gt; [mag, phase] = bode(LTI_SYS);
or
  &gt;&gt; [mag, phase] = bode(LTI_SYS, freqVec * (2*pi));
where
:*mag is the magnitude ('''not''' in dB) at each point in freqVec
:*phase is the phase (in degrees) at each point in freqVec

The mag and phase variables must come out as 3D arrays.  Assuming LTI_SYS is [[:Category:SISO|SISO]] then the commands below will convert mag and phase into the vectors you would expect
  &gt;&gt; mag = mag(:);
  &gt;&gt; phase = phase(:);
  &gt;&gt; mag = db(mag);                               % to get the magnitude in 20log dB
  
===Issues with the ''bode'' command===
The main issue with the ''bode'' command is reformatting of the plot.  The ''bode'' command appears to use a normal semilogx plot and then apply patches ro something similar to the figure.  This can lead to odd behavior when attempting to create multi-line titles, reformat line widths or font sizes, etc.  The normal relationship of axes to figure is just not quite present.

* [[w:Color_gradient|Color gradient at wikipedia]]

==Types of color gradient ==
Color gradients can be named by :
* dimension
* color model
* number of segments of gradient
* function used to create gradient
* Number of colors

===Dimension===
==== 1D ====
Here color of pixel is proportional to 1D  variable. For example in 2D space ( complex plane where point z = x+y*i) :
* position with respect to x-axis of Cartesian coordinate system : x
* distance to origin : r=abs(z)
* complex angle angle=arg(z)

An example of a function to return a color that is linearly between two given colors:
	
&lt;pre&gt; 
colorA = [0, 0, 255] # blue
colorB = [255, 0, 0] # red
function get_gradient_color(val):
# 'val' must be between 0 and 1
for i in [1,2,3]:
color[i] = colorA[i] + val * (colorB[i] - colorA[i])
return color
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;
image:P_hot.gif|1D gradient with color proportional to x 
Image:RGB_and_CMYK_comparison.png|1D gradient with color proportional to radius
Image:HLSColorSpace.png|1D gradient with color proportional to angle

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== 2D ====
[[Image:Color complex plot.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[w:Domain coloring|Domain coloring]] plot of the function
&lt;br&gt;&amp;fnof;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''i'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''i''). The hue represents the function argument, while the saturation represents the magnitude.]]


Because color can be treated as more than 1D value it is used to represent more than one ( real or 1D) variable.
For example :
* Robert Munafo uses 2 values from  HSV model of color &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrob.com/pub/muency/r212c12.html R2.1/2.C(1/2) by Robert Munafo] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrob.com/pub/muency/color.html Color by Robert Munafo]&lt;/ref&gt;
* John J. G. Savard uses own function &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quadibloc.com/math/mb01.htm The Mandelbrot Function by John J. G. Savard]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.quadibloc.com/math/mbint.htm The Mandelbrot Function 2 by John J. G. Savard]&lt;/ref&gt;

        return 0;

&lt;/source&gt;

===Function===
One can use any function in each segment of gradient. Output of function is scaled to range of color component.

===Number of colors===
Number of color is determined by [[w:color depth|color depth]] : from 2 colors to 16 mln of colors.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Repetition  and offset ===

'''Direct repetition''' : 

Color is proportional to position   &lt;0;1&gt;  of color in color gradient. if position &gt; 1 then we have repetition of colors. it maybe useful

'''Mirror repetition ''' :

&quot;colorCycleMirror - This will reflect the colour gradient so that it cycles smoothly &quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subblue.com/projects/fractal_explorer The Fractal Explorer Pixel Bender filters by Tom Beddard]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Offset''' :

=How to use color gradients in computer programs=
[[File:Palette graphics.svg|right|thumb|Palette graphics, palette replacement mechanism]]
First find  what format of color you need in your program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acasystems.com/en/color-picker/faq-delphi-tcolor.htm What's Delphi TColor format? at ACASystems]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efg2.com/Lab/Library/Delphi/Graphics/VCLRTL.htm#TColor Delhi TColor at efg2.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

After that there are 3 ways making gradient :
* gradient functions
* gradient files
* palette 

== Gradient functions ==

Examples :
* Javascript using jQuery &lt;ref&gt;[http://davidwees.com/javascript/gradients/ Gradient jQuery plugin Posted by David Wees]&lt;/ref&gt;
===HSV gradient ===
* explanation by Robert P. Munafo&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrob.com/pub/muency/color.html Color by Robert Munafo]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Basic code  and images by Jean Debord&lt;ref&gt;[http://back2basic.phatcode.net/?Issue_%236:Mandelbrot_and_Julia_sets_with_PANORAMIC_and_FreeBASIC Mandelbrot and Julia sets with PANORAMIC and FreeBASIC By Jean Debord]&lt;/ref&gt;
* c programs by  Curtis T McMullen &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/programs/index.html c programs by  Curtis T McMullen ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear RGB gradient with 6 segments ===
[[Image:HSV-RGB-comparison.svg|HSV-RGB-comparison||thumb|right|Result and diagram of GiveRainbowColor function ]]
Here gradient consists from 6 segments. In each segment only one RGB component of color is changed using linear function.
====Delphi version ====
&lt;source lang=Delphi&gt;
// Delphi version by Witold J.Janik with help Andrzeja Wąsika from [pl.comp.lang.delphi]
//  [i] changes from [iMin] to [iMax]

function GiveRainbowColor(iMin, iMax, i: Integer): TColor;
var 
  m: Double;
  r, g, b, mt: Byte;
begin
  m := (i - iMin)/(iMax - iMin + 1) * 6;
  mt := (round(frac(m)*$FF));
  case Trunc(m) of
  0: begin
      R := $FF;
      G := mt;
      B := 0;
    end;
  1: begin
      R := $FF - mt;
      G := $FF;
      B := 0;
    end;
  2: begin
      R := 0;
      G := $FF;
      B := mt;
    end;
  3: begin
      R := 0;
      G := $FF - mt;
      B := $FF;
    end;
  4: begin
      R := mt;
      G := 0;
      B := $FF;
    end;
  5: begin
      R := $FF;
      G := 0;
      B := $FF - mt;
    end;
end; // case

  Result := rgb(R,G,B);
end; 
/////

&lt;/source&gt;

====C version====

Input of function are 2 variables :
* position of color in gradient, (a normalized float between 0.0 and 1.0 )
* color as an array of RGB components ( integer without sign from 0 to 255 )

This function does not use direct outoput ( void) but changes input variables color. One can use it this way: 

 GiveRainbowColor(0.25,color);


&lt;source lang=c&gt;
/* based on Delphi function by Witold J.Janik */
void GiveRainbowColor(double position,unsigned char c[])
{
  /* if position &gt; 1 then we have repetition of colors it maybe useful    */
      
  if (position&gt;1.0){if (position-(int)position==0.0)position=1.0; else position=position-(int)position;}
  
  
 
  
  unsigned char nmax=6; /* number of color segments */
  double m=nmax* position;
  
  int n=(int)m; // integer of m
  
  double f=m-n;  // fraction of m
  unsigned char t=(int)(f*255);
  

  
switch( n){
   case 0: {
      c[0] = 255;
      c[1] = t;
      c[2] = 0;
       break;
    };
   case 1: {
      c[0] = 255 - t;
      c[1] = 255;
      c[2] = 0;
       break;
    };
   case 2: {
      c[0] = 0;
      c[1] = 255;
      c[2] = t;
       break;
    };
   case 3: {
      c[0] = 0;
      c[1] = 255 - t;
      c[2] = 255;
       break;
    };
   case 4: {
      c[0] = t;
      c[1] = 0;
      c[2] = 255;
       break;
    };
   case 5: {
      c[0] = 255;
      c[1] = 0;
      c[2] = 255 - t;
       break;
    };
    default: {
      c[0] = 255;
      c[1] = 0;
      c[2] = 0;
       break;
    };

}; // case
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Cpp version====

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;

// C++ version
// here are some my modification but the main code is the same 
// as in Witold J.Janik code
//

Uint32 GiveRainbowColor(double position)

// this function gives 1D linear RGB color gradient 
// color is proportional to position 
// position  &lt;0;1&gt; 
// position means position of color in color gradient

{
  if (position&gt;1)position=position-int(position);
  // if position &gt; 1 then we have repetition of colors
  // it maybe useful
  Uint8 R, G, B;// byte
  int nmax=6;// number of color bars
  double m=nmax* position;
  int n=int(m); // integer of m
  double f=m-n;  // fraction of m
  Uint8 t=int(f*255);
  
  
switch( n){
   case 0: {
      R = 255;
      G = t;
      B = 0;
       break;
    };
   case 1: {
      R = 255 - t;
      G = 255;
      B = 0;
       break;
    };
   case 2: {
      R = 0;
      G = 255;
      B = t;
       break;
    };
   case 3: {
      R = 0;
      G = 255 - t;
      B = 255;
       break;
    };
   case 4: {
      R = t;
      G = 0;
      B = 255;
       break;
    };
   case 5: {
      R = 255;
      G = 0;
      B = 255 - t;
       break;
    };

}; // case


  return (R &lt;&lt; 16) | (G &lt;&lt; 8) | B;
}

&lt;/source&gt;

==Gradient files ==

=== File types for color gradient===

There are special file types for color gradients&lt;ref&gt;[http://illusions.hu/effectwiki/doku.php?id=color_gradients Color gradient file formats explained]&lt;/ref&gt;:
* The GIMP uses the files with .ggr extension &lt;ref&gt;[http://libregraphicsworld.org/articles.php?article_id=30 GIMP add-ons: types, installation, management by Alexandre Prokoudine]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fractint uses .map files &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nahee.com/spanky/www/fractint/palette_maps.html Fractint Palette Maps and map files]&lt;/ref&gt;
* UltraFractal uses .ugr - These files can contain multiple gradients
* ual - old Ultra Fractal gradient file

Gnofract4D saves gradients only inside the graphic file, not as separate file. &lt;ref&gt;[http://gnofract4d.sourceforge.net/manual/using.html gnofract4d manual]&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Fractint map files====
The default filetype extension for color-map files is &quot;.MAP&quot;. 
These are ASCII text files. Consist of a series of RGB triplet values (one triplet per line, encoded as the red, green, and blue [RGB] components of the color).
Color map ( or palette) is used as a colour look-up table&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Colour look-up table]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Default color map is in the Default.map file :

First line says it is a gimp gradient file. 

Second line is a gradient's name. 

Third line tells the number of segments in the gradient.

Each line following defines the property of each segment in following order :&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rockraikar.googlepages.com/gimpGGRformat.txt  gpr format description by Vinay S Raikar ]&lt;/ref&gt;


[position of left stoppoint] [pos. of middle point] [pos. of right stoppoint] [R for left stoppoint] [G for left stoppoint] [B for left stoppoint] [A for left stoppoint][R for right stoppoint] [G for right stoppoint] [B for right stoppoint] [A for right stoppoint] [Blending function constant] [coloring type  constant]  



There are only two constants at the end of each line: the blending function constant of the segment (apparently 0=Linear, 1=Curved, 2=Sinusoidal, 3=Spherical (increasing), 4=Spherical (decreasing)) and the second constant is the coloring type of the segment (probably 0=RGB, 1=HSV (counter-clockwise hue), 2=HSV (clockwise hue), most of those shipped with Gimp are RGB).

==Why bother about computers and society?==
The title &quot;Computers &amp; Society&quot; is a very old one in the computing field.
The way in which the word &quot;Computers&quot; precedes &quot;Society&quot; in the title suggests that Society is seen from the point of view of those who use computers. Whereas in the past the computers were always visible, standalone, separate things, today they are also omnipresent but invisible. 
Good examples of such omnipresence are mobile phones, banking machines, and the &quot;network&quot;
([http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001828 The Canadian Encyclopedia]).

The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has a special interest group on &quot;Computers &amp; Society&quot;, abbreviated [http://www.sigcas.org/ SIGCAS] with the mission of addressing &quot;the social and ethical consequences of widespread computer usage&quot;.

We want to address the issues surrounding the Computers in our Society in the age in which we live.
That is to say, the subject will always be open and current and relevant. But we cannot ignore the past,
the things that have happened. We need to know something of the background history to understand
how we got to where we are today. With such a study we may be better positioned to have some idea
of where we might be heading in the future. And we will want to make personal choices now that shape our future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Limits of the first order PLL===
The PLL of the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples#1st order, type 1|first order, type 1]], in spite of its simplicity, has several good features to represent the best choice in certain applications.

For instance, it is preferred to implement a [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples#Addition of the complementary delay (&quot;phase aligner&quot;)|phase aligner]] (''[[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)#Phase Aligners|Definition of phase aligner]]'') because the increases of performance offered by loops of 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order cannot give any advantage in this particular application;

it may also be a good choice for a [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples#Oscillator controlled in frequency (&quot;first order slave CDR&quot;)|simple slave CDR]] when the incoming bit stream has a high transition density.
[[File:1st order type 1 loop.pdf|center|720px|]]&lt;center&gt;Architectures of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 PLL model&lt;/center&gt;
For other [[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains#Master and slaves (slaves: regenerators or end points)|''(slave)'']] CDR applications, the flat gain block ''(evident in the figure of the slave loop of 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order)'' can be modified and made evolve into a 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order filter ''(making the loop become 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order)''.

It should be noted that the two other blocks of the first order loop (the phase comparator and the local clock) are necessarily working at the line pulse speed (that is the highest speed in a CDR).

This makes them more complex technologically and more expensive to modify when an improvement of the loop performances is required.

The added filter block works instead at lower frequencies, and its design is correspondingly more flexible.

The filter block is used to implement the desired values of ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;zeta; in the second order loops.

''It is always a good design approach to implement a filter that be linear (at least in its practical behavior). The loop modeling and simulation remain possible in all conditions and are simpler than the modeling and simulation of a non-linear loop, whose models and simulations do not always exist.''

The added filtering action allows to better fit specific requirements of other applications and to add some performances that the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order loop lacks:
* the input jitter high-frequency cut-off can be made sharper (from 6 dB/octave to 12 dB/octave), a performance important in regenerators (using the 2 - 1 loop)
* the steady state error resulting from a frequency difference f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; can be compressed to zero, a performance important when G is widely variable and the VCO has poor centering (using the 2 - 2 loop)
* the jitter tolerance due to the end-of-range of the phase comparator (that in a 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 slave PLL increases towards the lower frequencies with a slope of 6 dB/octave ) can be increased and present a steeper slope of 12 dB/octave (using a 2 - 2 loop ) 
* the low frequency noise generated by the VCO can be better rejected with a sharper low-frequency cut-off (from 6 dB/octave to 12 dB/octave), a performance important to use low cost, noisy VCOs (using the 2 - 2 loop).


It should be remarked however that the four points of possible improvement listed above are not relevant in the case of a phase aligner! This is in fact where the 1 - 1 loop finds its best fit.

&lt;small&gt;Point by point in the list above, for a phase aligner:
* De-jittering the incoming clock is no use, because the recovered clock is not used after the data regeneration;
* f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits some jitter with respect to f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;, but cannot wander away from it. They both belong to the same clock domain;
* the jitter tolerance is limited horizontally by the half-depth of the phase adder, that cancels any improvement possible at low frequencies to the boundary of tolerance set by the phase comparator;
* the local clock is the reference, and is conceptually impossible to use f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; as a reference to identify its low frequency noise!
&lt;/small&gt;

=== From 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order to 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order ===
====Addition of a filter between comparator and VCO====
The [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples#1st order, type 1|first order, type 1]] PLL is the simplest and corresponds to the simplest (and least expensive!) implementations of  CDRs.

In many other applications ''(of [[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains#Master and slaves (slaves: regenerators or end points)|&lt;u&gt;slave&lt;/u&gt;]] CDRs)'' it is desirable to improve certain performances of the CDR itself, at the expenses of a little increase of complexity.

The &quot;flat gain block&quot; between phase comparator and VCO ''(clearly identified in the model of the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains#Master and slaves (slaves: regenerators or end points)|slave]] 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1)'' acquires a first order structure, becomes &quot;the loop filter&quot; and makes the PLL loop a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order loop.
[[File:Schematic of PLL 2nd order.png|center|400px|]]
One pole at frequency &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and one zero at frequency &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; are added to this central block, whose transfer function becomes:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;  \tfrac{G_f(\tfrac{s }{\omega_z }+1) }{(\tfrac{s }{\omega_f }+1)  }       &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But not all possible choices of locations for the zero and the pole yield a good PLL for CDR. Some shall be excluded so that just two are left:
* &lt;u&gt;The block can neither be a simple [[Wikipedia:Integrator|integrator]] 1/s nor a simple [[Wikipedia:Differentiator|differentiator]] s&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The PLL would oscillate! 
* &lt;u&gt;The pole shall always be at a lower frequency than the zero&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;If not, the rejection of the input jitter at high frequencies would be reduced to a finite flat attenuation. Worse, the filter block would amplify the frequencies higher than &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; with a 6 dB/octave slope: the PLL would become and behave like a type 0 loop. This is not acceptable for slave CDRs: the steady state error corresponding to a finite f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; difference would be infinite!
* Therefore &lt;u&gt;'''the pole at a lower frequency than the zero'''&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;and at least one of them at a finite (neither 0 nor &amp;infin;) frequency&lt;/u&gt;.
** &lt;u&gt;They cannot be close to each other&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The loop would be a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order in name and cost but it would behave in practice not different and not better than a 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order loop: a wasted effort! 
** &lt;u&gt;Either the pole at &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and the zero at frequency &amp;infin; (the loop in this case is a '''2 - 1''' loop), or the pole at frequency 0 and the zero at &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; (the loop in this case is a '''2- 2''' loop)&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Were they both at finite, though distant, frequencies, just one would be determinant for the loop behavior (the one closer to &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; = G ).

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: right; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;
The natural frequency &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; of a first order loop is the same quantity as the open loop gain G.&lt;br /&gt;
The natural frequency &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;nx&lt;/sub&gt; is a useful concept also in higher order PLLs.&lt;br /&gt;
It represents in fact the corner frequency that the closed loop transfer function (= the jitter transfer function) would have&lt;br /&gt;
if all frequency shaping was removed from the loop filter (that would be reduced, in such hypothesis, to just a flat gain G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;).
&lt;/div&gt;

::In a 2 - 1 loop, the natural frequency &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n21&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;u&gt;cannot&lt;/u&gt; be made much &lt;u&gt;lower&lt;/u&gt; than &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 1#ωn2 and ζ as functions of G and τf|because, as the next page shows,]] the loop would be underdamped:
&lt;center&gt; &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n21&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; / 2&amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
::In a 2 - 2 loop, the natural frequency &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n22&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;u&gt;cannot&lt;/u&gt; be made much &lt;u&gt;higher&lt;/u&gt; than &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 2#ωn2 and ζ as functions of G and τz|because, as the relevant page shows,]] the loop would be underdamped:
&lt;center&gt; &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n22&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; 2&amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;  &lt;/center&gt;
::If, for instance, the open loop gain G varies ''(because of manufacturing variability, or of sensitivity to temperature, supply voltage, .., or because of the non linearity of a circuit block)'', the &quot;non filtered&quot; frequency &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; ( = G) may come close to the cut-off frequency of the filter ''( = &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; or &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, depending on the loop type 1 or 2)'' that, in practical circuits, is much more stable than G.

:::&lt;small&gt;In a 2 - 1 loop this would happen if the gain G increased (or if &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is pushed too much down to tighten the closed loop bandwidth more than ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt;);&lt;/small&gt;
:::&lt;small&gt;In a 2 - 2 loop this would happen if the gain G decreased (or if &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; is pushed too much up to widen the closed loop bandwidth more than ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt;);&lt;/small&gt;

::In both cases (increase of G in 2 - 1, decrease of G in 2 - 2), looking at the same dependence from another point of view, the damping ratio decreases:
&lt;center&gt; ζ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; / ( 4 ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; )  ; ζ&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; / ( 4 ω&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; ) &lt;/center&gt;
::For both 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order loops, &amp;zeta; should  not go below 0.7 ''(although the type 2 is a little more robust, as the following pages will show)''.

====Targeted to different applications, 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; are very different in practice====
When 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; are contrasted (in conditions of same cut off frequency) their differences may not seem so large.

Those differences become more evident if the values of the ratio  ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;/ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, requested for different CDR applications, are considered.

1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; becomes clearly preferred when  a high ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;/ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (=a short acquisition) is specified, and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; when a small ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;/ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (a continuous mode application) is specified.&lt;br /&gt;
More precisely, in practice:
#1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order loops are used when ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; needs to be just one or two decades lower than ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (typical case of burst mode receivers), while 
#2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order loops are used when ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; must be three or more decades smaller than ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (typical case of the continuous mode receivers).


Another important consideration exists, that addresses the noise generated inside the CDR and its deterioration of the output clock of the CDR.

The noise generated inside the PLL is rejected and does not affect the CDR output in the range of frequencies at which the PLL accepts the input signal as useful, but it propagates to the output if generated in the frequency range at which the PLL rejects the input noise ( i.e. the input jitter ) !

How the PLL reshapes the spectrum of the noise generated inside its own blocks is shown in a dedicated page: [[Clock and Data Recovery/Noise is shaped by the PLL structure]]. 2 - 2 is shown to perform better than 2 - 1 in this respect.

The 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 is mostly used in cases where ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;&lt; ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and, at the same time, it is important that a &quot;jitter clean&quot; clock is regenerated.

====Relative strengths and weaknesses of 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; type 1 and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; type 2====

Succintly, the '''2 - 1''' is best where the input/output requirements are tight and the circuit blocks have good characteristics.

It filters better than the other two loops the noise present in the input signal.

It requires a VCO with reduced noise at low frequencies and a phase comparator with linear characteristics. It is in fact less able to reject the low frequency noise of the VCO, and its damping ratio decreases when the loop gain increases.

It best fits the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Burst and Continuous transmission modes#Continuous transmission mode|continuous-mode]], [[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains|regenerator]] applications in professional Telecom equipment.


The '''2 - 2''' instead is a best fit where some compromises can be accepted on jitter transfer and generation, but low cost and high integration correspond to circuit blocks with poor characteristics (= non-linear, noisy, ..).

It filters more sharply the low frequency noise of the (integrated ≈ noisy ) VCO ; its damping ratio decreases when the loop gain decreases.

Despite the lower appeal of its mathematical linear model, the 2-2 structure is a very frequent choice for monolythic ICs, especially when the line pulse frequency challenges the highest speed of the elementary components of the technology &lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C.

The phase detector is often a bang-bang followed by a charge pump, and the VCO is often a ring oscillator.

      <comment>Frankenstein 1st sentence summary of letter one</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">	In this first sentence of letter one the information is that is read about is that the journey or quest that the speaker was on was successful so far. He is writing to someone who did not have a good insight on how this would end up. He is telling them you will rejoice, be happy because he has accomplished what they thought would be evil.
	What I find out about the speaker is that he is writing to someone letting them know he’s ok, probably someone he cares about maybe a mother, a sister, or perhaps a lover. He’s confident in telling this person that he made it and they should be happy.
When the sentence is read out loud it sounds very relieving and somewhat calming to those who read it because there is someone who was worried about the speaker and he’s writing to tell that he’s alright.
This sentence makes me want to keep reading because I want to know what this journey/quest was and why the other person was so worried about him. What made the other person have such bad feelings about this? I want to know of the evil forebodings that were spoke about and why they were an issue. I would suspect the book to be about some young man on a journey/quest and has a loved one who does not want him to go and he writes frequently and lets her know how things are going. 
In this first sentence the speaker gets to tell of what was not expected. This is a very enlightened sentence because it has a positive outcome and makes people want to keep reading to see what was so evil and foreboding. It makes for a good opening sentence because it is right to the point and tells the person the one thing they had worried about in the first sentence so they do not need to keep reading to find out. The rest of the letter then goes into detail of what is wanted to know.
With what little I know about Frankenstein the first sentence doesn’t sound like it would be at all what I would have expected the book to be about. The writer needs a good opening sentence to draw the reader in and want to keep reading, with this in mind when you read a good opening sentence in a book you will want to read more of it and it will be a adventure because anything can happen even when you do expect and especially when you don’t expect it.</text>

==Reading Without Vowels==
Already?!&lt;br&gt;
Yes, we need to start sometime. All texts written in Hebrew, except for dictionaries, children's books, learner's books and other linguistic material are written without vowels. You will have to recognize and know how to pronounce a word just by looking at it. Don't be afraid, though, you'll be surprised to find out it is pretty easy.
Read aloud the following words:
{{Question-answer
| question = ''
# אבא
# בת
# אתה
# בננה
# אב
# את
# תא
# בן
| answer =
# Aba
# Bat
# Atah
# Banana
# Av
# At
# Ta
# Ben
}}

See? It wasn't that hard.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Bread|Bread]]

The '''baguette''' is a variety of bread distinguishable by its much greater length than width, and noted for its very crispy crust. The standard girth size of a baguette is about 5 or 6 cm, but can be up to a meter in length. It typically weighs 250g. It may also be referred to as a ''French loaf'' or ''French stick''.

==Ingredients==
* 1 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (2 ounces) very warm water (105-115°F)
* 4 cups (18 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
* 2 1/4 teaspoons salt
* 1 1/4 cups (10 1/2 ounces) cool water (75°F)

==Procedure==
#Forming the dough
#* Using a fork, stir together the yeast and warm water in a small bowl until the yeast dissolves. Let stand for 3 minutes.
#* Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl.
#* Mix the cool water, yeast mixture and flour gently with your fingers to form a mass.
#* On a lightly-floured work surface, knead for 5 minutes. The dough should now be supple and resilient.
#* Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a light towel.
#* Let the dough rest for 25 minutes - this period is called the autolyse.
#* Knead the dough for 6 - 8 minutes. Overkneading could make an overly tough dough; you're looking for a dough that is smooth and stretchy.
#The first rise
#* Lightly oil a bowl, and turn the dough in the bowl to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with a tea towel.
#* Let rise at room temperature (75-77°F) for 1 1/2 - 2 hours (until the volume doubles).
#* Gently deflate the dough. Fold it over itself , then reshape into a ball. Cover again with a tea towel.
#* Let rise for 1 1/4 hours or until it doubles again.
#* Once again, gently deflate the dough. Reshape into a round and cover, letting it rise for about 1 hour.
#Shaping the loaves
#* On a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into 3 equal pieces (about 10 ounces each).
#* Take one piece and gently stretch into a rectangle, leaving some large bubbles in the dough.
#* Fold the top third down and the bottom third up.
#* Form the loaf into a log by rolling the dough over from left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm.
#* Fold the dough over about a third of the way each time, seal the length of the loaf, then repeat.
#* You want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of the baguette while leaving some air bubbles in the dough. Seal the seam, being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or deflate its airy structure.
#* Set aside on the work surface to relax before elongating it, and repeat the shaping process with remaining pieces of dough.
#* Now elongate each baguette, starting with the first one you shaped, by rolling it back and forth on the work surface. Begin with both hands over the center of the loaf and work them out to the ends until the loaf reaches the desired length. Make sure that the loaves don't exceed the length allowed by the oven.
#The second rise
#* Place the finished loaves on a peel or upside down baking sheet lined with parchment paper and generously sprinkled with cornmeal or on a baguette pan.
#* Cover the loaves with well oiled plastic or a floured cloth and let rise for 30 to 40 minutes until the loaves are slightly plump but still not doubled in volume. The final rise is short, because you want the baguettes to be slightly under proofed; this will give them a better oven spring, resulting in loaves with a light, airy crumb and more flared cuts.
#Preparing for baking
#* Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 500°F.
#* Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat, and place an empty water pan directly under the stone.
#* Use a very sharp razor blade or lame to make 3 to 5 slashes, depending on the length of your loaves, on the top of each baguette. The cuts should run from one end of the loaf to the other, rather than across it, and the blade should be held at a 30° angle to the loaf so that the cuts pop open in the oven. Be careful not to press down too hard, or you may deflate the loaves.
#* Using a plant sprayer, mist the loaves.
#Baking
#* Gently slide the loaves onto the preheated stone, or place the baguette mold in the oven. Pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and quickly close the oven door. After 1 minute, mist the loaves and oven walls 6 to 8 times and close the door. After 2 more minutes, spray the loaves and the oven walls again.
#* Bake for 12 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 400°F and bake for 25 - 30 minutes longer until the loaves are golden brown and crisp. Move them to a rack to cool.
# Enjoy your baguettes still slightly warm with some soft, ripe French cheese and a glass of wine.

Makes 3 14-inch baguettes.

==Variations==
Replacing some of the all-purpose flour (1/4 of it is a good amount) with cake flour will give an even lighter texture to the loaf.

==Recommended Uses==
Shorter baguettes are very often used for sandwiches. These sandwich-sized loaves are sometimes known as ''demi-baguettes'' or ''tiers''. Baguettes are often sliced and served with cheeses. As part of the traditional continental breakfast in France, slices of baguette are spread with jam and dunked in bowls of coffee or hot chocolate.

A now not-so-recent migrator from Wikipedia. :) 
&lt;br&gt;I was shocked to see the appalling state in which the [[Hebrew]] textbook is, and therefore I am committing myself to push it to Wikibook standards. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Recentchangeslinked&amp;target=Category:Hebrew&amp;hideminor=0&amp;days=30&amp;limit=50]

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

==To Do List==
I've got tons to do, but here are the most crucial:
* Plan Unit Two (obviously).
* Provide a navigational template for the Basic lessons.
* Create sub-categories for Hebrew Alphabet and Hebrew Basic.
* Create Semitic languages template?
* Sound samples will not be added in the near future; the course isn't stable enough, and I can't record them myself from technical and physical (my voice isn't that pretty) reasons.

==News==
*'''14 January 2009''' I'm going to be inactive for a while.

*'''29 December 2008''' Started working on Unit Two. 

*'''26 December 2008''' Finished Unit One. I plan Unit Two to be based on grammatical structures with handfuls of relevant vocabulary, somewhat like the [[Miskito]] book. 

*'''18 December 2008''' After a long wikibreak, I have decided to take a different approach for the Level I lessons, lessening the learning material for each lesson.

*'''9 May 2008''' I am glad to announce that &lt;big&gt;the Reading Hebrew level is complete!&lt;/big&gt; Now organizing the lessons of [[Hebrew/Basic|Level I]] into one single, chronological level.

*'''1 May 2008''' Currently working on the Aleph-Bet series. I want to make it a level of its own, preceding Level 1.</text>

    <title>Erlang Programming/Making Parsers with yecc</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Making Parsers with yecc

Yecc is an erlang version of yacc/bison.

We have a BNF(Backus-Naur_form) grammar in a source file 
ending in .yrl, yrl means yecc rule list.
We can parse a simple xhtml file using yecc.
Actually, we will apply yecc to html.yrl to create a parser 
called html_parser.erl. Next we use the html_parser to parse some
xhtml, voila. 
 yecc:yecc(&quot;html.yrl&quot;,&quot;html_parser.erl&quot;).
 c(html_parser).
 f(B), {_,B,_} =  
 erl_scan:string(
 &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;hello_world&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;).
 html_parser:parse(B).
All tags in the xhtml code must have matching open and close.
(Of course a more powerful way to parse an xml file 
in erlang is to use xmerl).

html.yrl source:
 Nonterminals tag elements element start_tag end_tag .
 Terminals 'atom' '&lt;' '&gt;' '/'.
 Rootsymbol tag.
 tag -&gt; 
 	start_tag tag end_tag : 
 	['$1', '$2', '$3'].
 tag -&gt; 
 	start_tag tag tag end_tag : 
 	['$1', '$2', '$3', '$4'].
 tag -&gt; 
 	start_tag elements end_tag : 
 	['$1', {'contents','$2'}, '$3'].   
 tag -&gt; 
 	start_tag end_tag : 
 	['$1','$2'].
 
 start_tag -&gt; '&lt;' 'atom' '&gt;' : {'open','$2'}.   
 end_tag -&gt; '&lt;' '/' 'atom' '&gt;' : {'close','$3'}.   
 elements -&gt; element : ['$1'].
 elements -&gt; element elements : ['$1', '$2'].
 element -&gt; atom : '$1'.
 
 % yecc:yecc(&quot;html.yrl&quot;,&quot;html_parser.erl&quot;).
 % c(html_parser).
 % f(B), {_,B,_} =  
 % erl_scan:string(
 % &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;hello_world&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;).
 % html_parser:parse(B).
 
It can be a pain to build and run a parser each time we edit the source yrl file. To speed things up, we can use a program to 
build and run the parser for us. We compile and run the test 
program which builds the parser and tests it for 
us on some document.
 
 -module(html_test).
 -compile(export_all).
 
 start() -&gt;
 	yecc:yecc(&quot;html.yrl&quot;,&quot;html_parser.erl&quot;),
 	cover:compile(html_parser),                         
 	{_,List_of_symbols,_}=erl_scan:string(
 		&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;greeting&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
 			&lt;body&gt;
 			hello there world what is up
 			&lt;/body&gt;
 		&lt;/html&gt;&quot;),
 	{ok,L} = html_parser:parse(List_of_symbols),  
 	register(do_event, spawn(html_test,event_loop,[])),
 	Events = lists:flatten(L),
 	send_events(Events),
 	Events.
 
 send_events([]) -&gt; do_event ! {exit};
 send_events([H|T]) -&gt;
 	do_event ! H,
 	%io:format(&quot; ~w ~n&quot;,[H]),
 	send_events(T).
  
 event_loop() -&gt;
 	receive
 		{open,{atom,_Line_Number,html}} -&gt; 
 			io:format(&quot;~n start scan ~n&quot;, []),
 			event_loop();
 		{contents,List} -&gt; 
 			Contents = get_contents(List,[]),
 			io:format(&quot;~n contents: ~w ~n&quot;, [Contents]);
 		{exit} -&gt; exit(normal)
 	end,
 	event_loop().
  
 get_contents([],Items) -&gt; Items;
 get_contents([H|T],Items)-&gt;
 	if
 		length(T) &gt; 0 -&gt;
 			NT = hd(T);
 		true -&gt;
 			NT = T
 	end,
 	{atom,_N,Item} = H,
 	NItems = Items++[Item],
 	% io:format(&quot; ~w &quot;,[Item]),
 	get_contents(NT,NItems).
 	
 % 6&gt; c(html_test).
 % {ok,html_test}
 % 7&gt; html_test:start().

      <comment>/* Bucketball */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bucketball ==

The game of bucketball combines the sports of hockey, basketball, and football.
It is played on a field of 50 ft. V. &amp; 40 ft. H.
It can be played indoors or outdoors.
Here are the rules of Bucketball:

*The game starts off with a team throwing or tossing the ball (small tennis ball, raquetball, or etc.) to the other team.
*The team that starts off with the ball has 4 downs (counts) to store a goal.
*Any shot that goes in the bucket is worth an amount of points:
**hits of the wall\goalie and goes in the bucket is worth 1 point.
**bounces in from the front\back of the bucket and goes in is worth 2 points.
**goes over the head of an opponent and goes in is worth 3 points.
***Here are the Types of Penalties:
**(Tripping) tripping an opponent (the ref waves his hand down at his feet)
**(Bad Words Code) saying bad words or fail language to other players (the ref crosses his hands in an &quot;X&quot; over his mouth)
**(Goalie Wrapping) pushing the goalie or trapping the goalie so he\she can't block or make a save (the ref puts his left hand behind his right hand):(when an opponent shoots the ball)
**(Shot Clock) running out the shot clock or taking to much time to pass the ball (stalling)
'''Note''' : the ref will count down from 30 (saying 30,29,28, and so on.)
Here are the positions:
**Guard (spiker) this player's job is to stop as many shots as possible. (1)
**Attacker(scorer)  this player's job is to try to score goals.  (2)
**Bully   (defender)    this player's job is to stop the other team from passing the ball or scoring. (2)
***Total (players): (5)</text>

'''Thanks for uploading [[:Image:431715454 dbab6fe724 o.jpg]].''' The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[wikibooks:Copyrights|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:Aforadam.gif]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted because there is missing license or source information.

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Please take the time to read [[Wikibooks:Media]] to learn more about what copyright information is required to satisfy our requirements and remember to include this important information for every file that you upload in the future as well.

Now I have put back my image of the horse.
Unfortunately, one must now go outside WikiBooks to see it at Wikimedia Commons.
How can I embed it directly?
(Михал Орела 07:51, 6 July 2008 (UTC))

Figured that one out by myself! Eventually! :)
(Михал Орела 09:37, 6 July 2008 (UTC))

:In the future, be sure to put a license on any photo you upload. If it does not have a license after 7 days, it will be deleted. I would suggest using the commons instead of uploading on here, because it makes the pictures availible to all projects and frankly I find it much easier to do that.

:I wonder whether the modules in this book could be named better - normally we frown upon using &quot;Chapter 5&quot; etc in module names - perhaps something more like &quot;Digital re-Discovery of Culture/Educational and Ethical Aspects&quot; (as well, the R in '''r'''e-Discovery should probably be capitalized for all these pages.) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:33, 26 August 2008 (UTC)

There is no need for numbering of chapters — you are right. Oversight on my part (Михал Орела 20:09, 27 August 2008 (UTC))

all fixed now! Thanx for the pointer! (Михал Орела 20:28, 27 August 2008 (UTC))

Will [[Modeling from A to Z/Modeling principles/B is for B-method]] be expanded? If not, the link should be placed elsewhere in the book and that module deleted. If it is going to be expanded though, you may simply remove the template I placed there. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:10, 25 September 2008 (UTC)

== learning how to ask questions ==

Welcome to Wikibooks, MihalOrela.

I've heard more people use the term &quot;wikidom&quot; than the term &quot;WikiWorld&quot; [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiBlogComparison] [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CurrentWikidomProblems].

I personally don't create a category unless I know of more than one page that will go into that category.
And so I am mystified -- why do you create categories which contain only one page each, such as
[[:Category:Learning how to ask questions]],
[[:Category:Learning how to read stuff]],
[[:Category:WikiWorld]], and
[[:Category:Back cover]]
?

== Signature ==

Would you mind putting a link to your user and/or user talk page in your signature? You can just wiki markup to do that in the signature box of [[special:preferences]]. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:59, 25 November 2008 (UTC)

I think I have done right what you suggested!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== INCLUDE ==
=== Statement ===
		Appearance 			Standard 			Console 	
=== Syntax ===
INCLUDE {&quot;&lt;path&gt;&quot;|alisResID} 
=== Description ===
When the compiler encounters an INCLUDE statement, it looks for a text file indicated by &lt;path&gt; or alisResID, reads the FB statements contained in that file, and effectively inserts those statements into the source code stream. &lt;path&gt; can be either a full or partial pathname; if you use a partial pathname, it's assumed to be relative to the folder containing the &quot;parent&quot; source file (i.e., the source file that has the INCLUDE statement). &lt;path&gt; may refer either to a text file, or to an alias file whose target is a text file. alisResID must be the resource ID number of an &quot;alis&quot; resource whose target is a text file. This resource should exist in the resource fork of the &quot;parent&quot; source file. INCLUDE files may be &quot;nested&quot;; that is, an INCLUDE'd file may contain references to other INCLUDE files. Example:
Suppose we create a file &quot;Assign.INCL&quot; which contains the following lines of text: a = 3
b = 7 Now suppose we write a program like this: DIM x(100)
INCLUDE &quot;Assign.INCL&quot;
c = a + b When we compile this program, the result will be identical to this: DIM x(100)
a = 3
b = 7
c = a + b Note:
FutureBasic's Project Manager is generally a more convenient way to combine the source code from several different files. However, there are some advantages to using the INCLUDE statement, such as the ability to conditionally include files (see COMPILE LONG IF). FB does not allow a given file to be included more than once in the source stream. If a second INCLUDE reference is made to a given file, that INCLUDE statement will be ignored.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== INT ==
=== Function ===
		Appearance 			Standard 			Console 	
=== Syntax ===
nearestInteger&amp; = INT(expr#) 
=== Description ===
Returns the value of expr# rounded to the nearest integer. Note:
INT returns a &quot;long integer&quot; value, which means that expr# should be within the range -2147483648 through +2147483547. To obtain the integer part of numbers which are outside this range, use the FIX function. (Note however that FIX truncates the fraction part rather than rounding to the nearest integer. In general, FIX and INT don't return the same values.)

		Appearance 			Standard 			Console

targetString$|targetContainer$$,searchString$|searchContainer$$) 
=== Revised ===
May 30, 2000 (Release 3) 
=== Description ===
This function searches for the first occurrence of searchString$ or searchContainer$$ within targetString$ or targetContainer$$, starting at character position startPos . (If startPos is less than 1, it's treated as 1.) If a match is found, the function returns the character position (1..255) within targetString$ or targetContainer$$ where the match begins. If no match is found, the function returns zero. The string search is case-sensitive. Note:
INSTR always returns zero in these cases:

    * when startPos is greater than LEN(targetString$)
    * when LEN(searchString$) is zero.

Rule number 3 - shows a windward boat having right of way as leeward boat is tacking. That appears to be somewhat correct HOWEVER it should be pointed out that, had the boats been overlapped and the leeward boat wished to tack, it would have shouted for &quot;Room to tack&quot; and the windward boat would have to keep clear AND give room.</text>

The Golden Fight League is a mixed martial arts league that is simular to the World Combat League though, is has international teams that compete for the &quot;Forces Cup&quot;. The Golden Fight League started in 1990 by pro wrestler Derek Bryan. The rules are different than any other martial arts league out there to this day. Here are the rules:

Types of Moves:

*Kicks:
**side kick, hook, roundhouse, crescent, strike, swinging, and back kick (many others).

*Punches:
**hook,uppercut,lowercut, spinning back fist,side (many others).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== XREF@ == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;XREF@ arrayName maxSub1 maxSub2 AS dataType&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XREF@&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is identical to the &lt;code&gt;XREF&lt;/code&gt; statement, except that the link variable is interpreted as a handle, rather than as a pointer. You should use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XREF@&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; when you want the contents of a relocatable block to be treated as an array.

===Example ===
The following declares an array called &lt;code&gt;inclination!&lt;/code&gt;, allocates a new block with enough room for &lt;code&gt;numElts&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; elements, and associates the &lt;code&gt;inclination!&lt;/code&gt; array with the contents of the block.


&lt;pre&gt;XREF@ inclination!(1)
inclination&amp;amp; = FN NEWHANDLE(numElts&amp;amp; * SIZEOF(SINGLE)&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Notes ===
Note that, because the value of &lt;code&gt;maxSub1&lt;/code&gt; is ignored in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XREF@&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement, we can arbitrarily set it to 1. However, when we actually reference the elements of the &lt;code&gt;inclination!&lt;/code&gt; array, we can specify any subscript value in the range 0 through &lt;code&gt;numElts&amp;amp;-1&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== XREF == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;XREF arrayName maxSub1 maxSub2 AS dataType&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XREF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement declares an array, and associates the array with the memory pointed to by a particular long-integer variable, called the &amp;quot;link variable.&amp;quot; You can use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XREF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to cause any arbitrary block of memory to be treated as an array. This is especially useful when you need to dynamically create an array whose size can't be determined until runtime, or when you want to impose an array structure on data that was created outside of your FB program.

The link variable must be a simple (non-array, non-field) long-integer variable which has the same name as the array (ignoring any type-identifier suffix). For example, if you specify the following:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XREF&lt;/b&gt; diameter#(3,7)&lt;/code&gt;

The compiler creates a long-integer variable called &lt;code&gt;diameter&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;. When you run the program, you should set &lt;code&gt;diameter&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; equal to some appropriate memory address (you do this after the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XREF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement); FB then assumes that the &lt;code&gt;diameter#()&lt;/code&gt; array begins at that address. When you examine elements in the array, they are retrieved from the memory pointed to by &lt;code&gt;diameter&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;. When you alter elements in the array, the memory pointed to by &lt;code&gt;diameter&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is altered.

&lt;strong&gt;The first subscript is arbitrary&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;maxSub1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;maxSub2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; etc. values must be positive static integer expressions. However, since &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XREF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not actually allocate any memory, the declared subscripts are used somewhat differently than in a &lt;code&gt;DIM&lt;/code&gt; statement. The second and subsequent subscripts (if any) determine the internal structure of the array, and they should exactly match the internal layout of the elements pointed to by the link variable. But the value of the first subscript (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;maxSub1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) is basically ignored, and may be arbitrarily set to any value greater than zero. When you actually reference the array elements, you can use subscript values that are larger than &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;maxSub1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, as long as they reference valid elements within the block of memory pointed to by the link variable.

=== Notes ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XREF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a non-executable statement, so you can't change its effect by putting it inside a conditional-execution structure such as &lt;code&gt;LONG IF...END IF&lt;/code&gt;. However, you can conditionally include it or exclude it from the program by putting it inside a &lt;code&gt;COMPILE LONG IF...COMPILE END IF&lt;/code&gt; block. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XREF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement should appear somewhere above the first line where the array is referenced.


&lt;/strong&gt;XREFs will not behave properly when used with handles.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XREF&lt;/b&gt; myHandleList(100) &lt;b&gt;AS HANDLE&lt;/b&gt; : &lt;b&gt;REM&lt;/b&gt; will not work!&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== XOR == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;result&amp;amp; = exprA {XOR | ^^} exprB&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Expression &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;exprA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and expression &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;exprB&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are each interpreted as 32-bit integer quantities. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XOR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator performs a &amp;quot;bitwise comparison&amp;quot; of each bit in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;exprA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the bit in the corresponding position in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;exprB&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The result is another 32-bit quantity; each bit in the result is determined as follows:

&lt;image was here&gt;

A common use for &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XOR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is to toggle the state of individual bits in a bit pattern. For example:

&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;pattern&amp;amp; = pattern&amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;XOR&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;BIT&lt;/b&gt;(7)&lt;/code&gt;

This flips bit 7 in &lt;code&gt;pattern&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0, and leaves all of &lt;code&gt;pattern&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;'s other bits alone.

=== Example ===
The example below shows how bits are manipulated with &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;XOR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;DEFSTR LONG
PRINT BIN$(923)
PRINT BIN$123)
PRINT &amp;quot;--------------------------------&amp;quot;
PRINT BIN$(923 XOR 123)

program output:
&lt;code&gt;00000000000000000000001110011011
00000000000000000000000001111011
--------------------------------
00000000000000000000001111100000&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== WRITE FILE == 
 
=== statement === 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;Write File[#] deviceID, address&amp;amp;, numBytes&amp;amp;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement writes &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numBytes&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; of data to the open file or serial port specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, starting at the current Òfile markÓ position. The data is copied from the memory which starts at &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;address&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This is generally the fastest way to write a large amount of data to a file.

=== Example ===

This program fragment saves the binary image of an array into an open file. You can later use the &lt;code&gt;Read File&lt;/code&gt; statement to quickly load the array using the data in the file (see the example accompanying the &lt;code&gt;Read File&lt;/code&gt; statement).

&lt;pre&gt;_maxSubscript = 200
Dim myArray%(_maxSubscript)
arrayBytes&amp;amp; = (_maxSubscript+1) * SizeOf(Int)
:
Write File #1, @myArray%(0), arrayBytes&amp;amp;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== WRITE# == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;WRITE [#] deviceID,{ var | strngVar$ ; len } [,{ var | strngVar$ ; len }...]&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement writes the contents of the specified variables to the open file or serial port specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, starting at the current &amp;quot;file mark&amp;quot; position. The variables in the list can be of any type (including record types). If you specify a string variable, it must be followed by a &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;len&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter, which indicates the number of bytes to copy from the string. &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;len&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be any positive numeric expression whose value doesn't exceed the length of the string.

=== Notes ===
Unlike the &lt;code&gt;PRINT#&lt;/code&gt; statement, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WRITE#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement does not apply any formatting to the data before writing it. Instead, it simply writes an exact copy of the variables' internal bit patterns to the device. This makes the written data suitable for input by the &lt;code&gt;READ#&lt;/code&gt; statement. In general, the data written by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WRITE#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not suitable for files which are to be interpreted as text.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== WRITE FIELD == 
 
=== statement === 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;WRITE FIELD[#] deviceID, handle&amp;amp;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Use this statement to write the contents of the relocatable block specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;handle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the open file or serial port specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, in a format suitable for input by the &lt;code&gt;READ FIELD&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WRITE FIELD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; starts writing at the current &amp;quot;file mark&amp;quot; position. If first writes a 4-byte long-integer which indicates the size of the block; following this, it writes the contents of the block itself.

=== Notes ===
If you want to write only the block's contents to the file (without the 4-byte length indicator), use the &lt;code&gt;WRITE FILE&lt;/code&gt; statement instead:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WRITE FILE&lt;/b&gt;# deviceID,[handle&amp;amp;],&lt;b&gt;FN GETHANDLESIZE&lt;/b&gt;(handle&amp;amp;)&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== WRITE DYNAMIC == 
 
=== statement === 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;WRITE DYNAMIC deviceID,arrayName&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Revised ===
May, 2001 (Release 5)

=== Description ===
Use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WRITE DYNAMIC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to send the contents of a dynamic array to a disk file. Data written to a file in this manner can be read back into memory using &lt;code&gt;READ DYNAMIC&lt;/code&gt;. Before dynamic arrays are written to the disk, they are automatically compressed.

=== Example ===

&lt;pre&gt;DIM x
DYNAMIC myAry(_maxLong)

FOR x = 1 TO 100
myAry(x) = x
NEXT

OPEN &amp;quot;O&amp;quot;,#1,&amp;quot;Dynamic Array Test&amp;quot;
WRITE DYNAMIC #1,myAry
CLOSE #1

KILL DYNAMIC myary

OPEN &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;,#1,&amp;quot;Dynamic Array Test&amp;quot;
READ DYNAMIC #1,myAry
CLOSE #1

FOR x = 1 TO 10
PRINT myary(x)
NEXT

KILL &amp;quot;Dynamic Array Test&amp;quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

1 Learning how to ask questions

MihalOrela 06:03, 2 May 2008 (UTC)

someone (?) suggested the removal of

{{tlx|alphabetical|C}}

and it is now done (Михал Орела 07:56, 31 July 2008 (UTC))

= Table of Contents =
This has been reorganized for cosmetical purposes.
(Михал Орела 06:44, 11 August 2008 (UTC))

= Categorization =
Many thanks to whomever (re)marked „Categorization needed“.
I thought that I had done it already...
In fact, I had used category: instead of Category: :)
(Михал Орела 18:16, 5 September 2008 (UTC))

I have categorized everything now and I am absolutely delighted with the result.
Thanks again to the wonderful editor(s) who emblazoned {{tlx|uncategorized}} 
on the pages :)

I am here to write a new book called &quot;Modeling from A to Z&quot;

I would really appreciate help.

===Dyslexia===

I should also say that I am dyslexic. That means that I often make big lots of spelling mistakes.
Also my sentences may seem a bit formal.

I appreciate all help I can get.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About==
The AROS Operating system is currently built using Linux and FreeBSD 
hosts. There has long been a significant amount interest in AROS being 
able to compile itself, therefore freeing the native version from 
Linux/FreeBSD.

In order for AROS to be able to recompile AROS, 
most likely the easiest path to take would be to port the existing 
FreeBSD/Linux build environment to AROS. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The purpose of this page 
is to keep track of the current state of the tools that need to be ported 
to AROS in order to realize the goal.

==Required Tools==
Here's a list of what is required to build from within AROS, and it's 
current port status for AROS:

===GNU GCC Compiler===
[http://gcc.gnu.org/ GCC] 3.3.1 Ported. No reported problems, yet has not undergone rigorus testing.

===GNU Binutils===
[http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/ Binutils] 2.14 Ported. No known issues

===GNU Fileutils===
[http://www.gnu.org/software/fileutils/fileutils.html Fileutils] 4.1 Ported. No reported problems, yet has not undergone rigorus testing.

===GNU Textutils===
[http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html Textutils] 2.1 Ported. No reported problems, yet has not undergone rigorus testing.

===GNU Make Utility===
[http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ GNU Make] 3.80 08.21.2004 Success! With updated sources from the AOS4 port, and some hacking about, a *stable* make has been generated. The make in contrib/gnu/make is slated to be removed and this will be committed in its place :-D

===GNU Awk Utility===
[http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/gawk.html GNU Awk (GAWK)] 3.1.3 Ported. No reported problems, yet has not undergone rigorus testing.

===GNU Bison Utility===
[http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/gawk.html GNU Bison (GAWK)]1.875 Ported. No reported problems, yet has not undergone rigorus testing.

===Python Script Parser===
[http://www.python.org/ Python] 2.2.1 Ported. It is hoped PyAROS will work.

===The NetPBM Graphics Conversion Package===
[http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/ NetPBM] Ported. Initial tests indicate the portions of this that are needed by the AROS build system function properly.

===GNU pdksh===
[http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/pdksh/ GNU Ksh Shell] Ported. However, an issue relating a workaround of the fork() function call is creating a stability problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To form commands or give orders simply choose the root verb and add &quot;ez&quot;. For example, from the verb '''manjar''' (to eat) we get '''manjez''' (eat!)

*'''apertez''' - open!
*'''drinkez''' - drink!
*'''donez''' - give!
*'''irez''' - go!
*'''sideskez''' - be seated!
*'''staceskez''' - stand up!

=== Examples ===

* Apertez la fenestro! - Open the window!
* Donez la plumo a me! - Give the pen to me!
* Drinkez vua kafeo! - Drink your coffee!

      <text xml:space="preserve">To form questions that elicit yes/no reponses, place the particle &quot;ka&quot; or &quot;kad&quot; at the beginning of a sentence. 

*'''Ka Sean iris a la skolo?''' Did Sean go to school?
*'''Kad el perdis la pekunio?''' Did she lose the money?

Simple questions may be formed by placing &quot;Ka&quot; in front of a noun without a verb. '''Ka Michelle?''' can mean &quot;Is it Michelle?&quot; or &quot;Do you mean Michelle?&quot;, depending on the context.
&lt;p&gt;
If there is a word like ''who, what, where'', etc., '''ka/kad''' is not used:

*'''Ube vu habitas?''' Where do you live?
*'''Quo es filozofio?''' What is philosophy?
*'''Quon vu timas?''' What do you fear?
*'''Qua es la prezidanto?''' Who is the president?
*'''Quante vu evas?''' How old are you?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi everyone.

This is a book about modeling in computing. There is some math here. There is some logic here. And there is some
formal specification stuff. Finally there is executable code.

== Section layout ==

I have organized the book into some simple sections in accordance with the Wikibook policy.

There does not appear to be much activity...

Maybe I can add somethings...

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think this is the right category for this book.

It belongs to subject areas of computer such as &quot;formal modeling&quot; &quot;formal specification&quot; requirements modeling&quot;
and so on.

I need help here.

I am new to this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PRINT# == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT#&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;,[&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt; [{,|;}[&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;]...]]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement writes information formatted as text to the open file or serial port specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;deviceID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The list of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'s is interpreted and formatted the same way as in the &lt;code&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; statement. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; normally writes a carriage-return character (ASCII character 13) after writing the final &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;; to inhibit this behavior, put a comma or a semicolon at the end of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is typically used to write data which is to be viewed later in a text editor or word processing program; or to write data which is to be read later by the &lt;code&gt;INPUT# &lt;/code&gt;statement. It generally formats its output differently than the &lt;code&gt;WRITE#&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WRITE FILE&lt;/code&gt; statements, which are better suited for transferring the contents of memory directly to the device. For example, consider this sample program fragment:

&lt;code&gt;a% = -1623&lt;br&gt;
PRINT #1, a%&lt;br&gt;
WRITE #1, a%&lt;/code&gt;

In this example, the &lt;code&gt;PRINT#&lt;/code&gt; statement formats the number as text, and puts out 7 bytes, as follows:

&lt;code&gt;00101101&lt;/code&gt; (ASCII code for &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;)&lt;code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
00110001&lt;/code&gt; (ASCII code for &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;)&lt;code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
00110110&lt;/code&gt; (ASCII code for &amp;quot;6&amp;quot;)&lt;code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
00110010&lt;/code&gt; (ASCII code for &amp;quot;2&amp;quot;)&lt;code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
00110011&lt;/code&gt; (ASCII code for &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;)&lt;code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
00100000&lt;/code&gt; (ASCII code for a space character)&lt;code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
00001101&lt;/code&gt; (ASCII code for a carriage-return character)

On the other hand, the &lt;code&gt;WRITE#&lt;/code&gt; statement puts out the binary contents of &lt;code&gt;a%&lt;/code&gt;. In memory, the short integer &lt;code&gt;-1623&lt;/code&gt; is stored as 1111100110101001; therefore, the &lt;code&gt;WRITE# &lt;/code&gt;statement puts out these two bytes:

&lt;code&gt;11111001  10101001&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;PRINT;INPUT;WRITE;FILE;OPEN;DEF OPEN;ROUTE&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= MENU statement =

=== Syntax ===
To create or alter a menu:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;itemID&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt; [,&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;

To unhighlight the menu bar: &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
February, 2002 (Release 6)

&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;

Use this statement to do any of the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Add a new menu to the menu bar.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Enable or disable a menu.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Add a new item to an existing menu.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Enable or disable a menu item.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Add or remove a checkmark from a menu item.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Change the text of a menu item.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Specify a hierarchical submenu to be attached to a menu item

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Unhighlight the menu bar.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add a new menu to the menu bar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to a number which is not already in use by an existing&amp;nbsp;menu. Use a number in the range 1 through 31.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;itemID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to zero.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter either to &lt;code&gt;_enable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_disable&lt;/code&gt;, depending on whether you want the menu to be initially enabled or dimmed (you can change this state later).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the text that you want to appear as the new menu's title.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a new empty menu (see below to learn how to add items to the menu). The value you choose for &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will determine the new menu's position on the menu bar; menus are automatically positioned from left to right in increasing order of their &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;numbers. Almost always, you'll want to assign your menus consecutive numbers starting with 1.

To enable or disable (dim) an existing menu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the ID number of an existing menu.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;itemID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to zero.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the state parameter to &lt;code&gt;_enable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_disable&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Do not specify the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter (if you do, all the menu's items will go away!)

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add a new item to an existing menu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the ID number of an existing menu.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;itemID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to a positive number which is not being used by any other&amp;nbsp;item in the menu. This number determines the item's position in the menu; items are&amp;nbsp;numbered consecutively from top to bottom starting with 1. If you &amp;quot;skip&amp;quot; an item,&amp;nbsp;then either a blank space or a grey dividing line will appear in that position, depending&amp;nbsp;on what version of System software you're using. Note that a grey dividing line&amp;nbsp;between items has its own item ID number. You can create a grey dividing line by&amp;nbsp;using the meta character &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to &lt;code&gt;_enable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_disable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_checked&lt;/code&gt;, depending on what you want&amp;nbsp;the item's initial state to be (you can change this state later).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the text that you want to appear in the item. Note that&amp;nbsp;when you're adding a new item, certain special characters in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; won't appear in&amp;nbsp;the item text but have other special meanings. Consult the &amp;quot;Meta Characters&amp;quot; table&amp;nbsp;below.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable, disable (dim), or checkmark an existing item:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;itemID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameters to an existing item in an existing menu.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to &lt;code&gt;_enable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_disable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_checked&lt;/code&gt;. Note that setting state to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;_enable&lt;/code&gt; or to &lt;code&gt;_disable&lt;/code&gt; will remove any existing checkmark on the item.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change the text of an existing item:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;itemID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameters to an existing item in an existing menu.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the desired text. Note that when you change the text of&amp;nbsp;an existing item, all the characters in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will appear in the item text, and none&amp;nbsp;will be interpreted as &amp;quot;meta characters.&amp;quot;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To specify a hierarchical submenu to be attached to a menu item:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the ID number of an existing menu; this is the &amp;quot;parent&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;menu which will contain the submenu.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;itemID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to a positive number which is not being used by any other&amp;nbsp;item in the menu. This is the &amp;quot;parent&amp;quot; item to which the submenu will be attached.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the ID number of the submenu. This should be a number in&amp;nbsp;the range 32 through 235 which is not being used by any other menu.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to a string which ends with these two characters: &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;/&amp;quot; + CHR$(&amp;amp;1B)&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The above procedure will attach the submenu to the parent menu item, but it&amp;nbsp;doesn't install the submenu. To install the submenu, you also need to call the&amp;nbsp;Toolbox procedure &lt;code&gt;InsertMenu&lt;/code&gt;. See the examples below.

To unhighlight the menu bar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Execute the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement without any parameters. The menu bar is automatically&amp;nbsp;highlighted every time the user selects a menu item, and it remains highlighted until&amp;nbsp;your program unhighlights it. By unhighlighting the menu bar, your program lets the&amp;nbsp;user know that the action associated with that menu item has completed.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta Characters&lt;/strong&gt;
The characters in this table have special meanings when they appear in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;parameter when you're adding a new menu item. Note that when you change the text of an existing item, all the characters in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will appear in the item text, and none will be interpreted as meta characters. The exception to this rule is a string that starts with a minus sign. The minus sign is a flag used by most menu definitions do draw a divider line. If your item needs to contain a minus sign, you may still display the item properly if you put a space before the character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMAGE WAS HERE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating Hierarchical Menus&lt;/strong&gt;
You can use the following function to add a new menu item and attach a new hierarchical menu to it. You should set &lt;code&gt;childMenuID&lt;/code&gt; to some number in the range 32 through 235 which is not being used by any existing menu.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/b&gt; MakeHierMenu(parentMenuID,parentMenuItem,&amp;not;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;itemString$,childMenuID)&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;title$ = &amp;quot;!&amp;quot;+&lt;b&gt;chr$&lt;/b&gt;(childMenuID)+itemString$ + &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; + &lt;b&gt;CHR$&lt;/b&gt;(&amp;amp;1B)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; parentMenuID,parentMenuItem,,title$
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;CALL INSERTMENU&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;b&gt;FN&lt;/b&gt; NEWMENU(childMenuID,&amp;quot;&amp;quot;), -1) &lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;END FN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

After you have called &lt;code&gt;FN MakeHierMenu&lt;/code&gt;, you can use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement to add new items to the hierarchical menu (set the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the value of &lt;code&gt;childMenuID&lt;/code&gt;).

&lt;strong&gt;Items in the Apple Menu&lt;/strong&gt;
You should use the &lt;code&gt;APPLE MENU&lt;/code&gt; statement to add items to the top of the Apple Menu. After adding these items, you can use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement (with the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter set to &lt;code&gt;_appleMenu&lt;/code&gt;) to alter the items (for example to enable or dim them).

&lt;strong&gt;Items in the Help Menu&lt;/strong&gt;
You can add items to the bottom of the Help Menu by getting a handle for the Help Menu and then calling the &lt;code&gt;AppendMenu&lt;/code&gt; procedure. You also need to find out the item number of your first Help item for use by your menu event handler (any existing items are handled by the Help Manager):

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM AS INT&lt;/b&gt; OSErr, @ firstCustomHelpItem&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DIM AS HANDLE&lt;/b&gt; @ hmHandle&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;#IF&lt;/b&gt; carbonlib&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;OSErr = &lt;b&gt;FN HMGETHELPMENU&lt;/b&gt;(hmHandle, firstCustomHelpItem)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;#ELSE&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;OSErr = &lt;b&gt;FN HMGETHELPMENUHANDLE&lt;/b&gt;(hmHandle)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;firstCustomHelpItem = &lt;b&gt;FN COUNTMITEMS&lt;/b&gt;(hmHandle)+1&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;#ENDIF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CALL APPENDMENU&lt;/b&gt;(hmHandle, &amp;quot;My Help&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

After adding items to the Help Menu, you can use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement (with the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;menuID&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;parameter set to &lt;code&gt;_kHMHelpMenuID&lt;/code&gt; ) to alter the items.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
Do not use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement to add new items to the Help Menu; use &lt;code&gt;AppendMenu &lt;/code&gt;instead.

&lt;strong&gt;Removing Menus&lt;/strong&gt;
Call the &lt;code&gt;DeleteMenu&lt;/code&gt; procedure to remove a menu created by the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CALL DELETEMENU&lt;/b&gt;(menuID)&lt;/code&gt;

This may cause other menus in the menu bar to slide to the left to fill the gap; however, they still retain their original menu ID numbers.

&lt;strong&gt;Removing Menu Items&lt;/strong&gt;
To remove all the items from a menu you created, use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement, specifying zero in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;itemID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter, and specifying a menu title in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter.

To remove an individual item, use the &lt;code&gt;GetMHandle&lt;/code&gt; function and the &lt;code&gt;DelMenuItem&lt;/code&gt; procedure:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;CALL DELMENUITEM&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;b&gt;FN&lt;/b&gt; GETMHANDLE(menuID), itemID)&lt;/code&gt;

Note that this will renumber any items below the deleted item, as they move up to fill in the gap. Menu item numbers are always numbered consecutively starting with 1.

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
The following lines create a complete menu which also contains a hierarchical menu. This example makes use of the &lt;code&gt;MakeHierMenu&lt;/code&gt; function defined above.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; 3,0,_enable,&amp;quot;Game&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; 3,1,_enable,&amp;quot;See High Scores/H&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; 3,2,_enable,&amp;quot;Reset High Scores/R&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; 3,3,_disable,&amp;quot;-&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;FN MakeHierMenu&lt;/b&gt;(3,4,&amp;quot;Scenarios&amp;quot;,100)
'Items in hierarchical menu:
&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; 100,1,_checked,&amp;quot;Level 1&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; 100,2,_enable,&amp;quot;Level 2&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; 100,3,_enable,&amp;quot;Level 3&amp;quot;
'It takes two MENU statements to include a
'special character like &amp;quot;!&amp;quot; in the text:
&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; 3,5,_enable,&amp;quot;dummy&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'This adds the item
&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; 3,5,_enable,&amp;quot;Play Now!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'This alters the item&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;Strong&gt;IMAGE WAS HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contextual Menus&lt;/strong&gt;
At about the time that the Appearance Manager came on to the scene, programmers began to use contextual menus. A contextual menu appears when the user clicks at a specific area in a window while holding down the control key. When this type of action takes place, you will receive (Appearance Manager Runtime only) a &lt;code&gt;DIALOG(0)&lt;/code&gt; message of &lt;code&gt;_cntxtMenuClick&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;DIALOG(_cntxtMenuClick)&lt;/code&gt; will be the window number of the window. At this point you may need to react by showing a menu under the cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMAGE WAS HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The following function builds and displays a menu and might be called in reaction to a contextual menu click.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/b&gt; DoContextMenu( wNum as long )
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM &lt;/b&gt;@ selectionType &lt;b&gt;AS LONG&lt;/b&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM &lt;/b&gt;@ menuID &lt;b&gt;AS SHORT&lt;/b&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM &lt;/b&gt;@ menuItem &lt;b&gt;AS SHORT&lt;/b&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM &lt;/b&gt;mHndl &lt;b&gt;AS HANDLE&lt;/b&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM &lt;/b&gt;err &lt;b&gt;AS OSSTATUS&lt;/b&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM &lt;/b&gt;helpItemString &lt;b&gt;AS STR255&lt;/b&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;mHndl = &lt;b&gt;FN NEWMENU&lt;/b&gt;(255, &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;LONG IF&lt;/b&gt; mHndl
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;INSERTMENU&lt;/b&gt;( mHndl, -1 )
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;APPENDMENU&lt;/b&gt;( mHndl, &amp;not;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;ContextualMenu click in window&amp;quot; + &lt;b&gt;str$&lt;/b&gt;( wNum ) )
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;helpItemString = &amp;quot;My Custom Help&amp;quot;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;err = &lt;b&gt;FN CONTEXTUALMENUSELECT&lt;/b&gt;( mHndl, &amp;not;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;#gFBTheEvent.where, _nil, _kCMHelpItemNoHelp, &amp;not;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;@helpItemString, #_nil, @selectionType, &amp;not;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;@menuID, @menuItem )
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;/*
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In this function, we don't actually do anything with the
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;selectionType, menuID, or menuItem returned, but we
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;could react to it right here
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*/
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DISPOSEMENU&lt;/b&gt;( mHndl )
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;END IF&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;END FN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PRINT == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; [@(&lt;i&gt;col&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;row&lt;/i&gt;)|%(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;)][&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt; [{,|;}[&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;]...]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; [@(&lt;i&gt;col&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;row&lt;/i&gt;)|%(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;)][POINT [{,|;}[POINT]...]]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
&lt;b&gt;May 5, 2000 (Release 3)&lt;/b&gt;

=== Description ===
Use this statement to put text out to the current window or to the currently &lt;code&gt;ROUTE&lt;/code&gt;'d device. The text is printed using the window's or printer's current font ID, font size, text style, text mode and foreground color (see the &lt;code&gt;TEXT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;COLOR&lt;/code&gt;and &lt;code&gt;LONG COLOR&lt;/code&gt; statements). The parameters are interpreted as follows:

When the item to be printed is a point, FB makes special provisions during the print process.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; mousePos &lt;b&gt;AS&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;POINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CALL GETMOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(mousePos)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; mousePos&lt;/code&gt;

The output looks like this &lt;code&gt;(194x,167y)&lt;/code&gt;

¥ &lt;code&gt;@(&lt;i&gt;col,row&lt;/i&gt;)|%(&lt;i&gt;h,v&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This specifies where the first printed character should appear within the window or the printed page. If you use the&lt;code&gt; @(&lt;i&gt;col,row&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; variant, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;col&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;row&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; represent the text column and row where the first character should appear; the exact pixel location depends on the current font ID and font size. If you use the &lt;code&gt;%(&lt;i&gt;h,v&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; variant, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;represent horizontal and vertical pixel positions; the first printed character is positioned with its lower-left corner at point &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. If you don't specify either variant, printing begins at the window's or printer's current pen position.

¥ &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This can be any of the following:

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Image Was Here&lt;/b&gt;

¥ &lt;code&gt;{,|;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You must use a comma or a semicolon to separate each pair of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'s; you can also optionally put a comma or semicolon at the end of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement (following the last &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).

A comma causes space characters to be printed until the total number of characters on the line is a multiple of the current &amp;quot;tab field width.&amp;quot; The default tab field width is 16; you can set it to other values using the &lt;code&gt;DEF TAB&lt;/code&gt; statement. Commas are usually used to help line up several lines of text into neat columns, or just to put some space between consecutive &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'s.

A semicolon does not cause any spaces to be inserted between consecutive &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'s. Use this when you want &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'s to be printed as close together as possible.

Normally, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; moves the pen down to the beginning of the next line after the last &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is printed. However, if you put a comma or a semicolon at the end of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement, the pen remains to the right of the last &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and is not moved down to the next line. This allows you to continue printing on the same line using a subsequent &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement.

Note that you can use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; without any parameters, like this:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

This simply causes the pen to move down to the beginning of the next line; it effectively &amp;quot;prints&amp;quot; a carriage-return character. This is useful for putting blank line(s) between other lines of text.

&lt;b&gt;Line wrap, scrolling and page-eject&lt;/b&gt;
By default, if the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'s reach the right edge of the window or the printer page, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement automatically &amp;quot;wraps the line&amp;quot;; that is, it moves the pen down to the beginning of the next line to continue printing the remaining &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;printItem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'s. However, this behavior can be altered using the &lt;code&gt;WIDTH&lt;/code&gt; statement; see the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;width.html&quot;&gt;WIDTH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement for more information.

If you're printing to a window, and the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement causes the pen to move below the bottom of the window, the window's contents are scrolled up so that the newly printed text will be visible.

If you're printing to the printer, and the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement causes the pen to move below the bottom of the printer page, the page is ejected and printing continues at the top of the next page.

&lt;b&gt;FB Lite behavior:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; behaves as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The [&lt;code&gt;@(col,row)&lt;/code&gt;] parameters are ignored.


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; switches to the Text Window before printing (unless output has been routed to the printer or &lt;code&gt;PRINT%&lt;/code&gt; is used). You can use &lt;code&gt;PRINT%&lt;/code&gt; to display text in the Graphics Window at an exact pixel position. Text printing will continue in the graphics window until a carriage return is encountered. You may suppress carriage returns using the semicolon character.


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;WIDTH&lt;/code&gt; statement has no effect. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; always wraps the line at the right edge of the window (or the printer page).


&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Text which is displayed using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement is not automatically refreshed, unless you're using the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime. To display text which is automatically refreshed, consider using Edit Fields (see the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;edit%20field.html&quot;&gt;EDIT FIELD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PRHANDLE == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pRecH&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;PRHANDLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
&lt;b&gt;FEBRUARY, 2002 (Release 6)&lt;/b&gt;

=== Description ===
This function returns a handle to the print record. The print record (also called a &amp;quot;TPrint record&amp;quot;) contains useful information about the printer and about the current print job (if any). For a complete description of the contents of the print record, see the &amp;quot;Printing Manager&amp;quot; chapter of Inside Macintosh: Imaging with QuickDraw. A few of the more useful fields from this record are listed here:

¥ pRecH&amp;amp;..prInfo.rPage&lt;br&gt;
This gives the print page rectangle. You can get the width and height of the page as follows:

&lt;code&gt;pageWidth = pRecH&amp;amp;..prInfo.rPage.right% - &amp;not;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;198&quot;&gt;pRecH&amp;amp;..prInfo.rPage.left%&lt;br&gt;
pageHeight = pRecH&amp;amp;..prInfo.rPage.bottom% - &amp;not;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;198&quot;&gt;pRecH&amp;amp;..prInfo.rPage.top%&lt;/code&gt;

Use these numbers to determine how much room is available for text and graphics. The page rectangle is affected by the user's selections in the &amp;quot;Page Setup&amp;quot; dialog: for example, if the user selects &amp;quot;landscape&amp;quot; mode, the page width will be greater than the page height.

¥ &lt;code&gt;pRecH&amp;amp;..prJob.iFstPage%; pRecH&amp;amp;..prJob.iLstPage%&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;These numbers indicate the first and last pages which the user wants to print. Your program should not print any pages outside of this range.

¥ &lt;code&gt;pRecH&amp;amp;..prJob.iCopies%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The number of copies to print. This is the number of times your program should send the selected pages to the printer. Note that many newer printer drivers will always set this number to 1; such printer drivers will handle multiple copies internally.

&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRHANDLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is partially emulated for Carbon. FB creates a 120 byte handle and fills in a few standard rectangles and other values so that programs won't be so likely to break during the transition period to OS X. But these emulations are not something that you should depend on in all future versions of the IDE.

== Introduction to Leptin == 
[[Image:Leptin.png|thumb|right| Leptin http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/common ]]
'''Leptin''', which comes from the Greek word ''leptos'' meaning “thin” was discovered in 1994 as the first factor in regulating feeding behavior and energy consumption.  Composed of only 167 amino acids, it is a small protein that is produced in adipocytes (fat cells) and migrates through the blood to the brain and ultimately acts on neural receptors of the arcuate nucleus (of the hypothalamus) to inhibit appetite.  Leptin basically conveys to the brain that the body’s fat reserves are met so food intake and fat synthesis should decrease while beta oxidation of fatty acids is allowed to increase for energy expenditure and heat.  


Its identification was first found as a product of the obese (OB) gene in lab mice.  Mice that carried two defective copies (one from each parent, ob/ob) had a defect in leptin production.  Their behavior and physiology were seemingly in a constant state of starvation with increased serum cortisol levels, the inability to stay warm, abnormal growth, sterility, and an unrestrained appetite.  As a consequence, they became very obese, weighing almost three times as much as a normal mouse.  To control for the possibility of any other contributing factor, these mice were injected with leptin and the results confirmed that they lost weight and had increased locomotor activity as well as thermogenesis.  Here is a picture and a follow-up article on humans.  [http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/01_01/Diabesity.shtml]
Initially, leptin ignited human interest as a possibility to prevent obesity.  But it has been found that obese individuals rarely have a defective leptin gene, so the system probably evolved to adjust an animal’s activity and metabolism during periods of severe nutritional deprivation, not to restrict weight.  

== Brain Mechanisms: Role in Satiety ==
In the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus there are two types of neurons that regulate eating and metabolism, the orexigenic and anorexigenic neurons.  Orexigenic neurons stimulate the appetite by producing and releasing neuropeptide Y (NPY).  NPY also releases a second orexigen: agouti-related protein (AGRP).  These (NPY secreting) neurons project to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) which will ultimately stimulate the brain stem nuclei that controls the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to decrease: insulin secretion, breakdown of fatty acids, and body temperature.  NPY neurons also project to the lateral hypothalamus, which will inhibit its secretion of peptide neurotransmitters, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin.  These hormones generally stimulate appetite and reduce metabolic rate.  During starvation, NPY in the blood rises as in the ob/ob mice, this elevated concentration sends signals to the brain to keep eating.  NPY and AGRP are very potent; injections of these neuropeptides will cause animals to eat voraciously, even when they receive electrical shocks to the tongue.  In addition, AGRP is long lasting, one injection into the third ventricle of rats resulted in six days of feasting.  Release of leptin will inhibit NPY and AGRP.  Anorexigenic neurons produce alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-MSH) which acts as an agonist at the melanocortin-4-receptor (MC-4R) to inhibit eating.  Moreover, this receptor is antagonized by AGRP, which stimulates eating.  The amount of leptin produced and released by adipose tissue is proportional to the number and size of adipocytes.  Here is a picture of the hormones that control eating.  [http://www.nature.com/ki/journal/v64/n3/fig_tab/4494000f4.html]

The hormone is transduced by the JAK-STAT system which is also the mechanism used by interferon and growth factors.  When leptin reaches the arcuate nucleus, it binds two leptin receptor monomers in the extracellular domain and dimerizes them.  Both monomers are then phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue of the intracellular domain by a Janus kinase (JAK).  The phosphorylated tyrosine resides become docking sitse for three proteins that are signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATS 3, 5, and 6, a.k.a. fat-STATS).  These docked STATS are then phosphorylated on Tyr residues by the same JAK.  Afterwards, the STATS dimerize and move to the nucleus where they will bind to specific DNA sequences to stimulate transcription of genes such as pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), which is the precursor to a-MSH.  

Leptin also stimulates the sympathetic nervous system to increase blood pressure, heart rate, and thermogenesis by uncoupling electron transfer from ATP synthesis in the mitochondria of adipocytes.  The uncoupling protein (UCP or thermogenin) produces a pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane that enables protons to reenter the matrix- detouring them from the ATP synthase complex, so no ATP is generated but the continued oxidation of fatty acids from adipocytes releases energy as heat.  Leptin stimulates the synthesis of this protein by releasing norepinephrine onto B3-adrenergic receptors on adipocytes.  These are G-protein bound and will go on to activate adenylyl cyclase which will amplify a second messenger, cAMP to phosphorylate many downstream targets like Protein kinase A (which will migrate to the nucleus) to increase the expression of UCP gene.

'''Summary:'''

Obesity is an increasingly worldwide problem that leads to significant health risks.  The traditional causes of obesity were overeating and a lack of exercise, this explanation may be true, but incomplete.  The author of this page explores a biological factor found by researchers today that plays a role in weight regulation.  He introduces the lipostatic theory within early studies and then goes into detail to explain the hormone leptin; particularly, what studies have shown, its feedback loop, and its other roles.

'''Summary:'''

This page addresses the study of leptin's role in metabolism with exploration of its therapeutic possibilities.  Leptin has been found to treat successfully—possibly even cure—two rare diseases: a defect in the leptin gene and lipodystrophy, a disease caused by the absence of fat cells, which the body relies on to make leptin.  Furthermore, this one fat-derived molecule affects metabolism, reproduction and the immune system, suggesting it may represent some evolutionary efficiency.  An interesting hypothesis about leptin is that it is a protective mechanism against starvation.  The leptin gene probably conferred a selective advantage on our ancestors by enabling them to survive lean times.

'''New Terms:'''

'''Summary:'''

Studies on obese mice (ob/ob) and diabetic mice (db/db) were instrumental in the studies of leptin. Ob/ob mice have a loss of function mutation in leptin which is produced in adipose tissue. Db/db phenotype has the ability to produce leptin but lacks the receptor for it. Studies suggest that leptin is used in the body during transitions between fed and starved states.

The hypothalamus of the brain has two cell populations of neurons that are responsive to leptin. The NPY/AgPR neurons can be upregulated through leptin. Loss of these neurons leads to hypophagia. POMC/CART neurons are stimulated by leptin. POMC deficiency leads to hyperphagia and obesity, having a role in appetite. Leptin receptors found outside the arcuate nucleus are critical in maintaining a normal body weight and possibly working to resist diet-induced obesity.

Leptin has an effect on neuronal growth and development by changing synaptic inputs to the arcuate neurons. It may be a growth factor during hypothalamic development. The ability to respond to leptin seems to be retained; therefore, leptin administration later in life works.

Leptin resistance has a few different mechanisms. In this case leptin administration does not result in weight loss even though the receptor is intact and there is a high level of the circulating hormone. It may not reach the receptor within the brain or there may be decreased levels of the receptor. 

Leptin is regulated at several levels including transcription, translation, storage, turnover and secretion. It is upregulated through insulin and glucocorticoids and downregulated by anything that increases cAMP levels in the adipocytes.

*''Hyperphagic'': Increased appetite

*''Hypophagia'': Decreased appetite

*''Arcuate nucleus'': Collection of neurons in the hypothalamus of the brain

*''Hypothalamus'': Part of the brain that receives and integrates neural, metabolic and humoral signals from the periphery

*''Parabiosis experiments'': Surgical union of two animals allowing blood exchange

*''Lipodystrophy'': Metabolic disorder where there is a selective loss of body fat and low leptin levels

'''Connection to Metabolism:'''

* Many levels of regulation: transcription, translation, turnover and secretion; also regulated with other hormones

* Fed and starved states in the cell alter levels of leptin

'''Summary:'''

Gene expression patterns change throughout the day along with the light/dark cycle, feeding behavior, sleeping patterns and other environmental factors. The daily light/dark cycle is in the hypothalamus. Peripheral tissues are controlled through sympathetic outputs. The leptin pathway was analyzed to look at oscillation in a biological system. Leptin regulates energy balance and makes an organism feel full after eating. It is expressed in adipose tissue and released into the bloodstream. There is an increase in the leptin receptor production before the leptin acrophase. The leptin signaling pathway is synchronized with the leptin receptor expression which follows an oscillating pattern. Alternative transcripts of long or short lengths are seen in the oscillation pattern. Additionally, if the balance of short and long lived transcripts are not maintained it may result in leptin resistance. These short and long lived transcripts compensate for the oscillation of a system to keep transcript levels constant. The oscillation pattern in leptin is tissue specific in brown and white adipose tissue.

'''New Terms:'''

*''Circadian rhythms'': daily rhythms that occur throughout nature

*''Sympathetic'': part of the nervous system that is always active at a low level, part of the fight-or-flight response

*''Oscillation'': repetitive variation between 2 or more states

*''Acrophase'': peak of a rhythm

*''Brown adipose tissue'': primary purpose is to generate body heat; contains high levels of mitochondria; present in many newborn or hibernating animals

*''White adipose tissue'': single fat droplets; account for large amount of body weight; have receptors for various hormones

'''Connection to Metabolism:'''

* Regulation in a biological system via transcription

* Light and dark cycles

* Energy balance in a cell

===Hepatic Steatosis &amp; Hyperinsulinemia===

Infusion of leptin has been proven to devitalize hepatic steatosis and hyperinsulinemia. This had been discovered via decreasing the synthesis of hepatic triglycerides and improving insulin sensitivity, in diet-induced lipodystrophy model mice. 

Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)-containing lipodystrophy model diets were proven to cause substantial weight gain in the livers of mice. Despite this, there was no significant change between the initial and final body weights, or in food intake. Leptin infusion has been proven to insignificantly alleviate hepatomegaly, in diet-induced lipodystrophy model mice. There were significant decreases in waist subcutaneous and abdominal (perennial, epididymal, and omental) white adipose tissue (WAT), in lipodystrophy model mice, without a significant effect of leptin infusion on WAT weights.

The activities of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and malic enzyme (ME) were increased in the liver of mice that had been fed the lipodystrophy model diet. However, the infusion of leptin failed to change these lipogenic enzyme activities. The lipodystrophy model diet was discovered to raise activity of membrane-bound forms of Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP), the most significant enzyme for triglyceride (TG) de novo synthesis. The activity of this enzyme experienced substantial suppression when leptin treatment was administered.

Adiponectin and leptin are known to be secreted from adipose tissue, and have several physiological functions, which include insulin sensitivity regulation. As a result, adipocytokine secretion deficiency induced by scant levels of adipose tissue has been attributed to lipodystrophy. This lipodystrophy would be characterized by severe insulin resistance leading to hyperinsulinemia and hepatic steatosis. Hepatic steatosis and hyperinsulinemia are proven to be alleviated by leptin deficiency. Regardless, leptin infusion had no observable effect on adiponectin levels. 

Mice that were fed the lipodystrophy model diet experienced an impaired insulin-mediated glucose lowering effect. However, leptin infusion in the mice resulted in an alleviation of insulin resistance. This indicated a weakening of hepatic steatosis and hyperinsulinemia via insulin resistance alleviation, and as a result of leptin treatment.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;_anyDev&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; returns information about the number of characters sent by the &lt;code&gt;PRINT &lt;/code&gt;statement to screen windows or to the device specified by the most recent &lt;code&gt;ROUTE&lt;/code&gt; statement. The value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;_anyDev&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is incremented whenever you print a character (other than a carriage-return) to any open window or to the &lt;code&gt;ROUTE&lt;/code&gt;'d device. The value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;_anyDev&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is reset to zero whenever any of the following happens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;You send a carriage-return character to any window or &lt;code&gt;ROUTE&lt;/code&gt;'d device (this is usually the final character sent by a &lt;code&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; statement); or:


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The text in any window or &lt;code&gt;ROUTE&lt;/code&gt;'d device reaches the right margin and wraps around to the next line; or:


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;You open a new window with the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW&lt;/code&gt; statement; or:


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;You start a new print job with the &lt;code&gt;ROUTE _toPrinter&lt;/code&gt; statement.


&lt;/ul&gt;
===Note===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;_anyDev&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; often, but not always, represents the number of characters on the current line of text. However, because FB does not maintain separate &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; values for separate windows, the value returned by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;_anyDev&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; may represent the characters on a line in the current window, or on a line in a different window, or even the sum of the characters on lines in multiple windows.

¥ &lt;code&gt;_printerDev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;_printerDev&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; returns the number of characters printed so far on the current line of text sent to the printer. The value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;_printerDev&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is incremented whenever you send a chacter (other than carriage-return) to the printer; the value is reset to zero whenever you send a carriage-return character to the printer, or the text reaches the right margin and wraps around to the next line.

¥ &lt;code&gt;_diskDev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;_diskDev&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; returns information about characters sent to open files. The value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;_diskDev&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is incremented whenever you send a character (other than carriage- return) to any open file; the value is reset to zero whenever you send a carriage-return character to any open file. Note that if you have more than one file open, the value returned by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;_diskDev&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; reflects the sum of the characters sent to all the files you're writing to. If you write a total of more than 32767 characters (to all open files) without writing a carriage-return character, the number returned by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;_diskDev&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is invalid.

&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PLOT == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;b&gt;PLOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PLOT TO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;PLOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

=== Description ===
This function draws a &amp;quot;point,&amp;quot; a line, or a series of connected lines, in the current output window, using the current pen size, pen mode, pen pattern and foreground color.

If you use the first syntax, a single &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; is drawn. This will actually be a little rectangular block whose dimensions are the same as the pen's width and height, with its upper-left corner at point &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h,v&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;.

If you use the second syntax, a line is drawn, having one endpoint at &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h,v&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. The line's other endpoint will be one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The last point specified in the most recent &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement (in any window); 

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;h,v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) coordinates of the most recent &lt;code&gt;BOX&lt;/code&gt; statement (in any window) that actually specified the &lt;i&gt;&lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameters;


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(0,0)&lt;/code&gt;, if no &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement has yet been executed, and no prior &lt;code&gt;BOX&lt;/code&gt; statement that specified &lt;i&gt;&lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; has yet been executed.


&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use the third syntax, a line or a series of connected lines is drawn, with endpoints at the specified points.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;FB Lite behavior:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; switches to the Graphics Window before executing. You can't use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLOT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to draw a line in the Text Window, or on the printer; use the Toolbox procedures &lt;code&gt;MOVETO&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LINETO&lt;/code&gt; instead. Alternatively, you can activate the graphics window and select Print from the File menu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MENU &amp;lt;resource&amp;gt; == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;resID%&lt;/i&gt;,{_resMenu|&lt;i&gt;_resSubMenu&lt;/i&gt;},&lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt; [,&lt;i&gt;resType$&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
Use this form of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement to install a menu which is described in a &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;MENU&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource. The menu's items can either be defined in the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;MENU&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource, or they can consist of a list of available named resources of a particular type (such as font resources).

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;resID%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter should specify the resource ID number of a &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;MENU&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource in a currently open resource file (usually in your application's resource fork). In most cases, this will also equal the menu's ID number (although the menu's ID number is actually defined within the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;MENU&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource).

If you specify &lt;code&gt;_resMenu&lt;/code&gt;, the menu will be installed on the menu bar. In this case, you should use a menu with a menu ID number in the range 1 through 31, which is different from the ID number of any existing menu.

If you specify &lt;code&gt;_resSubMenu&lt;/code&gt;, the menu won't be installed on the menu bar, but will be added to an internal &amp;quot;menu list.&amp;quot; Use this option when you want to install the menu as a hierarchical menu or a pop-up menu. To install a hierarchical resource menu, you must also use the Toolbox procedure &lt;code&gt;InsertMenu&lt;/code&gt;. The following illustrates how this may be done:

&lt;code&gt;resID% = 130
menuID% = 130
'Put resource menu on internal &amp;quot;menu list&amp;quot;:
&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; resID%, _resSubMenu, _enable
'Set this menu's &amp;quot;parent item&amp;quot;:
&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt; parentMenuID,parentItemID,menuID%,title$+&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;+&lt;b&gt;CHR$&lt;/b&gt;(&amp;amp;1B)
'Attach the resource sub-menu to the parent menu:
&lt;b&gt;CALL INSERTMENU&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;b&gt;FN GETMENUHANDLE&lt;/b&gt;(menuID%), -1)&lt;/code&gt;

If you use the &lt;code&gt;_resSubMenu&lt;/code&gt; option, you should use a menu with a menu ID number in the range 32 through 235, which is different from the ID number of any existing menu.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter specifies whether the menu should initially be enabled or disabled (dimmed). Set this parameter either to &lt;code&gt;_enable&lt;/code&gt; (1) or to &lt;code&gt;_disable&lt;/code&gt; (0).

If you omit the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;resType$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter, the resource menu's title and menu items will be displayed as defined in the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;MENU&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource. If you specify the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;resType$ &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;parameter, it should be a 4-character string indicating a resource type. In this case, the menu's items will consist of a list of all available named resources of the indicated type. For example, if you specify a &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;resType$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; value of &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;FOND&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot;, the menu will list the names of all available fonts. The menu's title is still taken from the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;MENU&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resource.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
You can use a program like ResEdit to create &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;MENU&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PICTURE FIELD == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PICTURE FIELD&lt;/b&gt; [#]&lt;i&gt;pfID&lt;/i&gt; [,[&lt;i&gt;pict&lt;/i&gt;][,[&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;][,[&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;][,&lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt;]]]]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
&lt;b&gt;February, 2002 (Release 6)&lt;/b&gt;

=== Description ===
Use this statement to create a new picture field in the current output window, or to modify the characteristics of an existing picture field. A picture field displays a picture which is automatically refreshed when necessary, and which can optionally respond to mouse clicks.

There are important differences in how picture fields are handled in the older Standard BASIC versus the newer Appearance Runtime. In Standard BASIC, picture fields were actually edit fields that had a destination rectangle with no height. (The top of the destination rectangle was equal to the bottom.) The contents of those edit fields consisted of data that told FB what to display. For instance, if the contents were. &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;%1001&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; then FB knew to display a resource picture with an ID of 1001.

Appearance picture fields are buttons and as such inherit the full power of the Appearance Manager's ability to display and manage them properly. There is, however, a difference between a picture &lt;i&gt;field&lt;/i&gt; and a picture &lt;i&gt;button&lt;/i&gt;. A picture &lt;i&gt;field &lt;/i&gt;is fully managed as a user pane (a special type of button) by the Appearance Runtime.In other words, FB tells the toolbox that it should call back into the runtime for the details of managing the picture. A picture &lt;i&gt;button &lt;/i&gt;is a standard CDEF (control definition) that is managed by the Appearance Manager. Both are buttons. But PICTURE FIELDs are generally display items where APPEARANCE BUTTONs that employ pictures are generally action items.

Appearance Manager picture fields abandon the more obscure framing conventions that were available in the Standard BASIC runtime. For instance, frame types such as &lt;code&gt;_round&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_rounder&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;_roundest&lt;/code&gt; are no longer available.

The parameters are interpreted as follows.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pfID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;This is the ID number of the picture field. To create a new picture field, specify a &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pfID&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;value which is different from the ID of any existing picture field, and any existing edit field, in the current window. When you're creating a new picture field, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pict&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameters are also required. To modify an existing picture field, specify the ID number of the existing field, and any other parameters that you want to modify; any parameter that you omit won't have its corresponding characteristic changed.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pict&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;This parameter specifies the picture to display in the picture field. You can specify it in any of the following forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;resName$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; -- The name of a PICT resource in a currently open resource file. 

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;%resID%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; -- A &amp;quot;%&amp;quot; symbol followed by the resource ID number of a PICT resource in a currently open resource file. 

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;amp;pictHandle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; -- An &amp;quot;&amp;amp;&amp;quot; symbol followed by a picture handle.


&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use a &lt;code&gt;PICT&lt;/code&gt; resource, it's best to use one that's purgeable so that the memory it occupies will be properly released (this memory is not automatically released when the picture field is closed). Don't close the resource file containing the picture until after you close the picture field or you put a different picture into the field. If you use a picture handle, make sure you do not release its memory (don't call &lt;code&gt;KILL PICTURE&lt;/code&gt;) until after you close the picture field or you put a different picture into the field.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;This parameter specifies the rectangle in which the picture will appear; no part of the picture will be drawn outside of this rectangle. You can specify it in either of the following forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(x1%,y1%)-(x2%,y2%)&lt;/code&gt; --These coordinates specify two diagonally opposite corners&amp;nbsp;of the rectangle.


&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rectAddr&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; -- A pointer or long integer expression. This is interpreted as the address&amp;nbsp;of a standard 8-byte RECT structure.


&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;This is an integer which specifies several characteristics about the field.

&amp;quot;Clickable&amp;quot; types. Picture fields of these types will generate an &lt;code&gt;_efClick&lt;/code&gt; Dialog event (Standard BASIC) when the user clicks in them.

&lt;img src=&quot;p/PICTURE_FIELD_statement04.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IMAGE imgs/PICTURE_FIELD_statement04.gif&quot; width=444 height=257&gt;

&amp;quot;Non-clickable&amp;quot; types. Picture fields of these types will not generate any Dialog event when the user clicks in them.

&lt;img src=&quot;p/PICTURE_FIELD_statement05.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IMAGE imgs/PICTURE_FIELD_statement05.gif&quot; width=419 height=193&gt;

You can also add any combination of the following constants to the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to achieve different effects in appearance:

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Images Were Here.&lt;/b&gt;
===Note:===
To remove a picture field from the window, use the &lt;code&gt;EDIT FIELD CLOSE&lt;/code&gt; statement.

When you create, modify or click on a &amp;quot;clickable&amp;quot; picture field, all edit fields in the current window become inactive, and the picture field becomes &amp;quot;active.&amp;quot; When a picture field is &amp;quot;active,&amp;quot; you can retrieve various kinds of information about it using the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW &lt;/code&gt;function.

=== Description ===
This function draws a picture in the current output window, or to the printer if output is currently routed to the printer. If you specify &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pictureHandle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the picture referenced in that handle is drawn; this can be a handle returned by the &lt;code&gt;PICTURE&lt;/code&gt; function, or a &lt;code&gt;PICT&lt;/code&gt; resource handle, or any other valid picture handle. If you don't specify &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pictureHandle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the picture which was recorded by the most recent pair of &lt;code&gt;PICTURE ON/PICTURE OFF&lt;/code&gt; statements is drawn.

The &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h1,v1&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h2,v2&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; parameters specify the upper-left and lower-right corners of a rectangle. If you specify both &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h1,v1&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h2,v2&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, the picture is scaled to fit the indicated rectangle. If you specify only &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h2,v2&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, the picture is scaled to fit the rectangle &lt;code&gt;(0,0)-(&lt;i&gt;h2,v2&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. If you specify only &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h1,v1&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, the picture is drawn unscaled, with its upper-left corner at &lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;h1,v1&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. If you specify neither corner, the picture is drawn unscaled, using the same frame rectangle that was used to record the picture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PICTURE == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pictureHandle&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;PICTURE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This function returns a handle to the picture recorded with the most recent pair of &lt;code&gt;PICTURE ON/PICTURE OFF&lt;/code&gt; statements. This handle is the same handle returned by:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PICTURE OFF&lt;/b&gt;, pictureHandle&lt;/code&gt;

You can specify this handle in the &lt;code&gt;PICTURE&lt;/code&gt; statement when you want to draw the picture. You can also pass the picture handle to any of a number of Toolbox routines which require a picture handle as a parameter.

===Note===
Your program is responsible for releasing the memory occupied by pictures created with the &lt;code&gt;PICTURE ON/PICTURE OFF&lt;/code&gt; statements. You should normally use the &lt;code&gt;KILL PICTURE&lt;/code&gt; statement to do this, once you're finished using the picture handle. However, if you turn the picture into a resource (using the Toolbox routine &lt;code&gt;AddResource&lt;/code&gt; or PG's &lt;code&gt;FNpGreplaceRes&lt;/code&gt;) then you should not dispose of the picture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PEN == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PEN&lt;/b&gt; [&lt;i&gt;penWidth&lt;/i&gt;][,[&lt;i&gt;penHeight&lt;/i&gt;][,[&lt;i&gt;visible&lt;/i&gt;][,[&lt;i&gt;mode&lt;/i&gt;][,&lt;i&gt;pattern&lt;/i&gt;]]]]&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement alters the characteristics of the drawing &amp;quot;pen&amp;quot; in the current output window. The pen characteristics affect the appearance of QuickDraw shapes (lines, ovals, rectangles, etc.) that are subsequently drawn in the window. If you omit any parameter, the corresponding characteristic is not altered. The parameters are interpreted as follows:

¥ &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;penHeight&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;penWidth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These specify the height and width of the pen in pixels. They must be positive integers. Taller, wider pen sizes produce thicker lines and borders.

¥ &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;visible&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you set this to &lt;code&gt;_false&lt;/code&gt;, subsequent drawing won't be visible on the screen (but it will still be &amp;quot;recorded,&amp;quot; if you have turned on picture recording (see the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;picture%20on.html&quot;&gt;PICTURE ON&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/code&gt;statement)). If you set &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;visible&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;to &lt;code&gt;_true&lt;/code&gt;, subsequent drawing will be visible.

¥ &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;mode&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This determines how the pen behaves when you draw over existing images in the window. You can specify any of the pattern transfer modes described in &quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos8/mac8.html&quot;&gt;Inside Macintosh&quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/QuickDraw/QuickDraw-2.html&quot;&gt;Imaging With QuickDraw. Usually you will use one of the following constants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_patCopy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_transparent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_patOr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_addOver&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_patXor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_addPin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_subPin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¥ &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pattern&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This determines the pattern that will be used to draw lines, and to frame or fill shapes. Specify a number in the range 0 through 37 to get one of the following system patterns:

&lt;b&gt;Image Was Here&lt;/b&gt;
===FB Lite behavior===
When you use the &amp;quot;FB Lite&amp;quot; runtime, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;PEN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; switches to the Graphics Window before executing.

===Note===
To change the pen's color, use the &lt;code&gt;COLOR&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;LONG COLOR&lt;/code&gt; statement. To change the appearance of text, use the &lt;code&gt;TEXT&lt;/code&gt; statement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MOUSE &amp;lt;event&amp;gt; == 
 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;clickType&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(0)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;locationInfo&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;locationType&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
February, 2002 (Release 6)

=== Description ===
If you have designated a mouse-event handling routine using the &lt;code&gt;ON MOUSE&lt;/code&gt; statement, then the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt; &amp;lt;event&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; functions return information about a mouse click event. Your mouse-event handling routine should check the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(0)&lt;/code&gt; function, and possibly the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(locationType)&lt;/code&gt; functions, each time your routine is called.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt; &amp;lt;event&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; functions will not report a mouse click that occurs inside an active control (such as a button or scrollbar), or in an edit field or picture field, or anywhere outside the active window's content region. Such mouse clicks are handled by other routines, such as your dialog-event handling routine (see the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;dialog%20function.html&quot;&gt;DIALOG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function), or your menu-event handling routine (see the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;menu%20function.html&quot;&gt;MENU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function).

&lt;strong&gt;MOUSE(0) function&lt;/strong&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(0)&lt;/code&gt; function indicates whether a single, double or triple-click occurred. It will usually return one of the following values:

&lt;strong&gt;Image was here&lt;/strong&gt;

In rare cases, the user may have time to both click the mouse and release it before your program detects the click. This can happen, for example, if your program runs a long time between successive calls to &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt;. In that case, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(0)&lt;/code&gt; may return one of the following values:

&lt;strong&gt;Image was here&lt;/strong&gt;

If you just want to detect the click, and you don't care whether the user released the mouse button before your mouse-event handling routine was called, then your routine can just check &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(0))&lt;/code&gt;, which will always return 1, 2 or 3.

&lt;strong&gt;MOUSE(locationType) functions&lt;/strong&gt;
To detect where the mouse pointer was at the instant it was clicked, call the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_lastMHorz)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_lastMVert)&lt;/code&gt; functions within your mouse-event handling routine. The values returned by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_lastMHorz)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_lastMVert)&lt;/code&gt; are usually the same as those returned by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_horz)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_vert)&lt;/code&gt; (see the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mouse%20position.html&quot;&gt;MOUSE &amp;lt;position&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; functions), but they may be different, especially if the mouse is being moved quickly.

If &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(0)&lt;/code&gt; returns a positive value (indicating that the mouse was both clicked and released before your mouse-event handling routine was called), then you may also be interested in the values returned by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_releaseHorz)&lt;/code&gt;ÊÊand &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_releaseVert)&lt;/code&gt;. These values tell you where the mouse pointer was at the instant the mouse button was released. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(0)&lt;/code&gt; returned a negative value, then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_releaseHorz)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(releaseVert)&lt;/code&gt; are meaningless.

&lt;strong&gt;MOUSE Window (Appearance Manager)&lt;/strong&gt;
A new selector helps your program determine where the mouse is located:

&lt;code&gt;wndNum = &lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_mouseWindow)&lt;/code&gt;

...will return the FB window reference number of the window over which the mouse is positioned. The window does not need to be active when this is used.

&lt;strong&gt;Click Sequencing&lt;/strong&gt;
FB reports a mouseclick event as soon as it can after the mouse button has been pressed down. If the user executes a double-click, FB interprets it first as a single-click event and then (once the second click happens) as a double-click event. Both &amp;quot;events&amp;quot; will be reported to your mouse-event handling routine. Similarly, if the user executes a triple-click, FB will first report a single-click event, then a double-click event, and finally a triple-click event.

You should take this into account when writing your mouse-event handling routine. The example program &amp;quot;DoubleClick.BAS&amp;quot; handles single-clicks and double-clicks; like most well-designed programs, its interface is designed so that the effects of a single-click are included in the effects of a double-click.

&lt;strong&gt;Waiting for the Mouse Up&lt;/strong&gt;
In most cases, FB will call your mouse-event handling routine while the mouse button is still being held down. But in some situations, your routine may need to track the mouse's motion until the button is released. You can use the Toolbox function &lt;code&gt;FN STILLDOWN&lt;/code&gt; to determine when the user releases the mouse button. See the example program, &amp;quot;StillDown.BAS&amp;quot;.

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Image was here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;code&gt; CD Example: DoubleClick.BAS&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image was here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;code&gt; CD Example: StillDown.BAS&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= MENU function =
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;selectedMenu&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;(_menuID)
&lt;i&gt;selectedItem&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;(_itemID)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Revised ===
January 2, 2001 (Release 4)

=== Description ===
If you have designated a menu-event handling routine in your program (using the &lt;code&gt;ON MENU &lt;/code&gt;statement), then &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;(_menuID)&lt;/code&gt; returns the menu number, and &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;(_itemID) &lt;/code&gt;returns the item number, of the menu item most recently selected by the user. Your menu-event handling routine should check these values each time it's called.

To give the user continual access to the menu bar, your program should execute &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; periodically. &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; checks for recent clicks on the menu bar, and responds by opening the menu and tracking the mouse's movement. Finally, &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; calls your menu-event handling function if the user selects a menu item.

&lt;strong&gt;Menu Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;
With the exception of the Apple Menu, the Help Menu and the Application Menu, the menus on the menu bar are numbered in increasing order from left to right. In most cases, they will be numbered consecutively starting with 1. You use the &lt;code&gt;MENU&lt;/code&gt; statement to assign menu numbers to the menus your program creates.

The number of the Apple Menu equals the constant &lt;code&gt;_AppleMenu&lt;/code&gt;. If your program adds new items to the Apple Menu, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function can detect when the user selects those items. Other items in the Apple Menu are handled by the Finder, and your program can't detect when the user selects those. You use the &lt;code&gt;APPLE MENU&lt;/code&gt; statement to add items to the Apple Menu. (NOTE: If you created the Apple Menu as part of an &lt;code&gt;MBAR&lt;/code&gt; resource, then use the constant &lt;code&gt;_AppleResMenu&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;_AppleMenu&lt;/code&gt;.)

The number of the Help Menu equals the constant &lt;code&gt;_kHMHelpMenuID&lt;/code&gt;. If your program adds new items to the Help Menu, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function can detect when the user selects those items. Other items in the Help Menu are handled by the Help Manager, and your program can't detect when the user selects those. To add new items to the Help Menu, you use the Toolbox routines HMGetMenuHandle and AppendMenu (see the &lt;code&gt;MENU &lt;/code&gt;statement for an example of how to do this).

Your program can't directly detect an item selected in the Application Menu; that's handled by the Finder. However, your program can detect when another application has been brought to the front. See the &lt;code&gt;DIALOG&lt;/code&gt; function for more details.

Your program can also detect when the parent item that pops out a hierarchical menu is selected. This is turned on and off by a constant in the file named UserFloatPrefs which is located in the User Libraries folder. One (undesirable) side effect of enabling this feature is that a menu grayed by setting its title to a disabled state will produce menu events in inactive items. To use the old method (this is the default state) of ignoring hierarchical items, remark out the line in that reads...

&lt;code&gt;_FBEnableMenuChoice = _zTrue&lt;/code&gt;

To enable the new feature, remove the remarks and allow the constant to be defined. This declaration is in the file named UserFloatPrefs which is located in the User Libraries folder.

Hierarchical menus have their own menu numbers that are different from their &amp;quot;parent&amp;quot; menu's number. You can use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function to detect selection in hierarchical menus that your program creates.

Pop-up menus are considered to be window controls (like buttons), and are therefore not detected by the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function.

&lt;strong&gt;Item Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;
Menu items are numbered consecutively from top to bottom, starting with 1. Note that a grey dividing line between items has its own item number, even though it can't be selected. It's important to remember this when assigning and interpreting item numbers. Items within hierarchical menus are also numbered consecutively starting with 1.

&lt;b&gt;Image was here&lt;/b&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MOUSE(_down) == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;buttonStatus&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_down)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===
If your program does not do any kind of event-trapping using the &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS &lt;/code&gt;statement, then you can use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_down)&lt;/code&gt; function to determine whether the mouse button is currently down. In these circumstances, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_down)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;_zTrue &lt;/code&gt;is the button is down, or &lt;code&gt;_false&lt;/code&gt; otherwise.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_down)&lt;/code&gt; function will not work if your program traps events using &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt;. Since most well-designed programs trap events this way, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOUSE&lt;/b&gt;(_down)&lt;/code&gt; function is probably of limited usefulness. See the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mouse%20event.html&quot;&gt;MOUSE &amp;lt;event&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/code&gt;functions to learn how to respond to mouse clicks using event trapping.

&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
You can also use the Toolbox function &lt;code&gt;FN BUTTON&lt;/code&gt; to determine whether the mouse is currently down. &lt;code&gt;FN BUTTON&lt;/code&gt; works regardless of whether your program uses event trapping.

=== Description ===
This statement updates &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which must be a string variable) or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;(a container variable), deleting a subpart from &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and replacing it with an equal number of characters from the left side of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;replaceString$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The subpart to be replaced begins at position &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;startPos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/code&gt;or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;container$$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. In the following code fragments, containers and strings work the same. The number of characters replaced equals the smallest of these quantities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;LEN(&lt;i&gt;replaceString$&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;LEN(&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;) - &lt;i&gt;startPos&lt;/i&gt; + 1&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the following circumstances, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;MID$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does nothing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;When &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;replaceString$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is empty;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;When &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;startPos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is less than 1 or greater than &lt;code&gt;LEN(&lt;i&gt;stringVar$&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;When &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;numChars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is less than 1.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
You may not use complex expressions that include containers on the right side of the equal sign.

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;code&gt;x$ = &amp;quot;abcdefgh&amp;quot;
y$ = &amp;quot;abcdefgh&amp;quot;
z$ = &amp;quot;abcdefgh&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;MID$&lt;/b&gt;(x$,2,3) = &amp;quot;1234&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; x$
&lt;b&gt;MID$&lt;/b&gt;(y$,2,5) = &amp;quot;1234&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; y$
&lt;b&gt;MID$&lt;/b&gt;(z$,7,4) = &amp;quot;1234&amp;quot;
&lt;b&gt;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; z$&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;program output:&lt;br&gt;
a123efgh
a1234egh
abcdef12&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter lists methods for removing skunk odor.


==Hydrogen peroxide method==
==Odor==
You can forget about tomato juice. In an episode of the television program ''MythBusters'', chemist Paul Krebaum's peroxide-and-baking-soda formula&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Paul Krebaum's page: &lt;/cite&gt;[http://home.earthlink.net/~skunkremedy/home/ The Skunk Remedy Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; was found to be the most effective. It was first published by K.M. Reese in the &quot;Newscripts&quot; section of &quot;Chemical and Engineering News,&quot; Oct. 18, 1993&lt;ref&gt;Chemical and Engineerng News Archives:&lt;cite&gt;http://pubs.acs.org/toc/cenear/71/42&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Paul Krebaum &quot;About the Author&quot; &lt;/cite&gt;[http://home.earthlink.net/~skunkremedy/home/sk00004.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;. You can also find it in ''Popular Science'''s August 2007 issue.


Here is his recipe:
* One quart of 3% hydrogen peroxide
* One quarter cup of baking soda
* one teaspoon of liquid hand soap (not detergent)


Bathe your pet in this solution and rinse with warm tap water. This solution could irritate a pet's eyes and should be used carefully. Krebaum warned that there is no way to store this potion. &quot;If you put the ingredients in a bottle, the whole thing would explode.

The thiols that are responsible for the odor are not water soluble, even with soap, but the baking soda catalyzes the oxidative ability of the peroxide, which oxidizes the thiols into highly water-soluble, non-foul smelling sulfonates. 


Paul Krebaum recommends oxygen bleach for fabrics that are color-safe to it, on his website.  For use on clothing, furniture, and anything of fabric, use the solution Nature's Cure usually found at large animal stores. Nature's Miracle, however, should also be used with caution. One of the active ingredients, alcohol, can create dry skin a degradation of the dog's coat quality. In the worst cases, the alcohol can result in permanent injuries to the cornea.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== WNDBLK == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;ptr&amp;amp; = WNDBLK&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This function returns a pointer to FutureBasic's internal Window Descriptor Block. The Window Descriptor Block is an array of Window Descriptors. Each Window Descriptor is a record which contains information about one of your program's windows; FutureBasic maintains a Window Descriptor for each window that you create using the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW &lt;/code&gt;statement. The structure of a Window Descriptor is as follows:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEGIN RECORD&lt;/b&gt; wDescriptor&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM&lt;/b&gt; wptr&amp;amp; 'Pointer to window record&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM&lt;/b&gt; efdHeadH&amp;amp; 'Handle to the first Edit Field Descriptor&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM&lt;/b&gt; activeEfH&amp;amp; 'Handle to active edit field&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM&lt;/b&gt; clipH&amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'Handle to window's clip region&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;END RECORD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;wptr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element points to the window's window record, which is a structure that the MacOS Window Manager maintains for each open window. This is the same pointer that is returned by the &lt;code&gt;GET WINDOW&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;efdHeadH&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is a handle to the first Edit Field Descriptor for the window. There is an Edit Field Descriptor for each edit field or picture field in the window; see below for more information. If there are no edit fields nor picture fields in the window, &lt;code&gt;efdHeadH&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;_nil&lt;/code&gt; (zero).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;activeEfH&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; element is a handle to the currently active edit field or picture field (if any) in the window. This is the same as the handle returned by the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW(_efHandle)&lt;/code&gt; function when the window is active. If there is no active field in the window, &lt;code&gt;activeEfH&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;_nil&lt;/code&gt; (zero).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;clipH&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; element is a handle to the window's clip region. However, if the window's &lt;code&gt;_noAutoClip&lt;/code&gt; attribute is set, &lt;code&gt;clipH&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;_nil&lt;/code&gt; (zero).

&lt;/ul&gt;
You can use the window's assigned ID number to determine the location of its Window Descriptor within the array. The first Window Descriptor in the array corresponds to &amp;quot;window #0,&amp;quot; which is a special graphics port that is reserved for FutureBasic's internal use. The next element in the array corresponds to window #1; the next to window #2; and so on. Array elements that don't correspond to the ID of any existing window have undefined contents.

If you define a &lt;code&gt;wDescriptor&lt;/code&gt; record type as shown above, you can get a pointer to the Window Descriptor corresponding to window #&lt;code&gt;windowID&lt;/code&gt; as follows:

&lt;code&gt;wdPtr&amp;amp; = WNDBLK + (windowID * &lt;b&gt;SIZEOF&lt;/b&gt;(wDescriptor))&lt;/code&gt;

Alternatively, you can use &lt;code&gt;XREF&lt;/code&gt; to access the contents of the array using normal
FutureBasic&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; array syntax:

&lt;code&gt;wdArray&amp;amp; = WNDBLK
XREF wdArray AS wDescriptor&lt;/code&gt;

You can then use the syntax &lt;code&gt;wdArray(windowID)&lt;/code&gt; to access an individual Window
Descriptor.

Edit Field DescriptorsFutureBasic maintains an Edit Field Descriptor for each field that you create using the &lt;code&gt;EDIT FIELD&lt;/code&gt; statement or the &lt;code&gt;PICTURE FIELD&lt;/code&gt; statement. For each window, there is a linked list of Edit Field Descriptors for the fields in that window; a handle to the first descriptor in the list can be found in the &lt;code&gt;efdHeadH&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; element of the Window Descriptor record. The structure of an Edit Field Desciptor is as follows:

&lt;code&gt;BEGIN RECORD efDescriptor&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM nextDescH&amp;amp;&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;134&quot;&gt;'Handle to next descriptor in list&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM indexRef%&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;141&quot;&gt;'Field's ID number&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM fieldType``&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;126&quot;&gt;'Field's type&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM jClass``'Text justification &amp;amp; class number&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM teH&amp;amp;&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;15&quot;&gt;'Handle to TextEdit record&lt;br&gt;
END RECORD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;nextDescH&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is a handle to the next Edit Field Descriptor in the list. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;nextDescH&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is _nil, there are no more edit fields nor picture fields in this window. 

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt; indexRef%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is the field's ID number, as assigned by the &lt;code&gt;EDIT FIELD&lt;/code&gt; statement or the &lt;code&gt;PICTURE FIELD&lt;/code&gt; statement.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;fieldType``&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is the same as the type parameter specified in the &lt;code&gt;EDIT FIELD&lt;/code&gt; statement or the &lt;code&gt;PICTURE FIELD&lt;/code&gt; statement (it defaults to &lt;code&gt;_framedNoCR (1)&lt;/code&gt; if no type was explicitly specified).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The&lt;code&gt; &lt;i&gt;jClass``&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is the same as the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;efClass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter specified in the &lt;code&gt;EDIT FIELD&lt;/code&gt; statement, or the justparameter specified in the &lt;code&gt;PICTURE FIELD&lt;/code&gt; statement. It defaults to zero if the parameter wasn't specified.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt; teH&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is a handle to the field's TextEdit Record, which is a structure that the MacOS maintains for each open edit field. This is the same handle that is returned by the &lt;code&gt;TEHANDLE(efID)&lt;/code&gt; function. Note that FutureBasic associates a TextEdit Record with picture fields as well as edit fields; you can use a picture field's TextEdit Record, for example, to determine the field's rectangle. See the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-40.html&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;TextEdit&amp;quot; chapter&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos8/mac8.html&quot;&gt;Inside Macintosh&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Text/Text-2.html&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/a&gt; for more information.

&lt;/ul&gt;
=== Example ===
The following function returns a count of the number of edit fields and picture fields in a specified window. It assumes that the &lt;code&gt;wDescriptor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;efDescriptor&lt;/code&gt; record types have been defined as shown above.

&lt;pre&gt;LOCAL FN EfCount(wndID)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM wdPtr AS POINTER TO wDescriptor
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIM efdH AS HANDLE TO efDescriptor
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;count = 0
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;IF WINDOW(-wndID) = 0 &lt;b&gt;THEN EXIT FN '(no such window)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;wdPtr = WNDBLK + (wndID * SIZEOF(wDescriptor))
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;efdH = wdPtr.efdHeadH&amp;amp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;WHILE efdH &amp;lt;&amp;gt; _nil
&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;48&quot;&gt;INC(count)
&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;48&quot;&gt;efdH = efdH..nextDescH&amp;amp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;WEND
END FN = count&lt;/pre&gt;


=== Note ===
Window Descriptors are maintained only for windows that are created using the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW &lt;/code&gt;statement, and Edit Field Descriptors are maintained only for edit fields/picture fields that are created using the &lt;code&gt;EDIT FIELD&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;PICTURE FIELD&lt;/code&gt; statement. If you create a window or an edit field using a MacOS Toolbox routine (such as NewWindow or TENew), there will be no Descriptor associated with it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== WINDOW PICTURE == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;WINDOW PICTURE [#]windowID,pictHandle&amp;amp;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement &amp;quot;attaches&amp;quot; the picture whose handle is &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pictHandle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the window specified by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;windowID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The picture is refreshed automatically as necessary, and all &lt;code&gt;_wndRefreshDIALOG&lt;/code&gt; events for the window are inhibited. This is sometimes useful when you want to display a window which shows nothing but a single unchanging picture. However, because &lt;code&gt;_wndRefresh&lt;/code&gt; events are inhibited, it makes it difficult to maintain other kinds of contents in the window. It's generally more useful to use the &lt;code&gt;PICTURE FIELD&lt;/code&gt; statement instead.

=== Note ===
You must not dispose or release the picture in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;pictHandle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; until you first either close the window (using &lt;code&gt;WINDOW CLOSE&lt;/code&gt;), or detach the picture from the window. You can detach the picture either by explicitly attaching a different picture, or by executing the following:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW PICTURE&lt;/b&gt; [#]windowID, _nil&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== WINDOW OUTPUT == 

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;WINDOW OUTPUT [#]idExpr&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement makes an existing window the current output window. The current output window is the destination for any subsequent text and drawing commands, and is the target window for such statements and functions as &lt;code&gt;BUTTON&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;EDIT FIELD&lt;/code&gt;, etc.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be either a positive or negative number; &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW OUTPUT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; affects the window whose ID number is &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. If you specify a negative &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the window becomes invisible. If you specify a positive &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the window becomes visible.

=== Note ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW OUTPUT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not activate the specified window (i.e., it does not highlight its contents nor bring it to the front), if there are other visible windows open. Use the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW&lt;/code&gt; statement when you want to explicitly activate a window. (Note: the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW &lt;/code&gt;statement also makes the specified window the current output window.)

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW OUTPUT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is useful in cases where you need to update the contents of a window which may be in the background, without bringing the window to the front.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== WINDOW FILL == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;WINDOW FILL [[#]expr&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement immediately redraws, in the current output window, any controls, edit fields and picture fields which intersect with the window's &amp;quot;invalid region.&amp;quot; The window's invalid region consists of those visible parts of the window which were recently uncovered but haven't yet been refreshed; you can also add an arbitrary rectangle to the invalid region using the new (in Release 6) &lt;code&gt;FN NVALRECT&lt;/code&gt;.

After redrawing the controls etc., &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW FILL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; resets the window's invalid region to a nil (empty) region. This will inhibit FB from generating a &lt;code&gt;_wndRefresh DIALOG &lt;/code&gt;event for the window the next time &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; is executed.If no window number is used for &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, FB assumes that you wish to use the current output window.

=== Note ===
You will rarely need to use this statement. FB automatically redraws controls, edit fields and picture fields as necessary every time your program executes &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt;.

== Introduction ==

Corticosteroids, or Corticoids are hormones that are produced in the adrenal cortex. This family can be broken down into two main groups; mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. Included in these groups are hormones such as Cortisol and Prednisone. The male and female sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen are also produced in small amounts in the adrenal gland. A reduced ability to produce theses steroids can lead to disorders such as Addison’s disease.

The adrenal gland can be broken down into three layers. The outermost layer is the zona glomerulosa, which produces mineralocorticoids. The middle layer is the zona fasciculate which produces the glucocorticoids and the innermost layer is the zona reticularis which produces weak androgens (precursors to testosterone and estrogen).

Corticosteroid drugs are usually administered through inhalers for asthma related problems, and topologically for skin related irritations.


== Table of corticosteroid medications ==

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:corticosteroid table.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;



== Formation of Corticosteroids ==

All steroids originate from the same starting molecule, cholesterol. In the case of the formation of the corticosteroid Aldosterone, cholesterol is first converted into Pregnenolone by way of a side chain cleavage. Pregnenolone is then converted into Progesterone which in turn in converted into 11-deoxycorticosterone. The remaining reactions take place in the outer layer of the adrenal gland.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Corticosteroidpic1.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
11-deoxycorticosterone is converted into Corticosterone which is converted into 18-hydroxy-corticosterone which is oxidized, turning it into the final product, Aldosterone. The human body will synthesize this steroid to conserve sodium and secrete potassium in the kidneys, which causes retention of water and increase blood pressure. This is a key molecule in the regulation of ion re-absorption and blood pressure.


== Disorders related to Corticosteroids ==

There are a few disorders related to the adrenal gland and the production of corticosteroids. One of these diseases is called Addison’s disease, also known as chronic adrenal disorder. People who suffer from this cannot produce sufficient steroid hormones form their adrenal gland and must take supplement hormones orally. Some symptoms of Addison’s disease are; sweating, change in mood and personality, joint and muscle pain. Signs that someone may have the disorder are puffiness and darkening of the skin, most noticeable on scars, lips and pressure points. This occurs because the hormone that causes increased melanin production, melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) shares the same precursor molecule as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). When ACTH levels are increased due to medication MSH levels increase as well.  A prominent figure in American history that had Addison’s disease was John F. Kennedy, it is thought to have caused some of his appearance and mood issues late in his presidency.


== Inhaled Corticosteroids in Asthma Management ==

This article stated that all available inhalable corticosteroids have the ability to work as advertised at an equipotent dose. Inhalers are currently the most effective treatment to asthma on the market, most of them only requiring low (80μl-1200μL) doses a day. Inhalers can range from once daily doses to multiple doses daily. This article when into detail about the obstacles that drug developers have to overcome to produce an effective treatment, such as taking advantage of corticosteroids that are only activated once they reach the lower respiratory tract (Ciclesonide). This ensures that the maximum amount of the drug is deposited in the lungs where it is needed, and not lost in the mouth and throat. The article also included adverse effects that may occur while taking the steroids, such as Adrenocortical suppression, bone degradation and glaucoma. As with most drugs being overweight and smoking increase adverse effects. Long acting beta agonists have been found to make the medications more effective and have been suggested for patients to use in tandem.

== Addison’s Disease ==

This article, entitled Addison’s Disease focuses on the corticosteroid treatment of the adrenal gland insufficiency.  The article reviews the clinical presentation and common manifestations of the disease, followed by the diagnostic criteria and management.  The management portion of the paper was the most revealing in terms of corticosteroids.  This portion of the paper focused on biochemical testing used to diagnose the illness, including plasma cortisol, morning serum cortisol, and cortisol response to ACTH; to rule out the illness, potassium and plasma renin activity are taken.  Normal treatment of this disease includes replacing hormones, specifically corticosteroids that the adrenal insufficiency has not provided.  These corticosteroids include intravenous or oral hydrocortisone, or prednisone for a longer half-life.  The hydrocortisone is a much safer option, not adversely affecting the immune system like prednisone, although the prednisone is a more effective treatment it can only be used for emergency situations, not for long term treatment.  The only other option for replacement of these corticosteroids is oral fludrocortisone which is quite potent requiring a dose of only 0.05 to 0.3 mg/day this hormone replaces the mineralocorticoids whereas the other two medicines replace glucocorticoids.

== What are topical Corticosteroids? ==

As the name suggests, this website pertained to information about topical corticosteroids. The site gave a general overview of the science behind corticosteroids and the uses that they can be applied to. Topical corticosteroids are used to suppress inflammation of the skin and come in ointments and creams like the widely known Hydrocortisone. In many cases commercial topical corticosteroids include antiseptics and antibiotics, to combat potential microbial threats as well as heal inflammation. This site divides topical corticosteroids into four strengths; mild, moderate, potent and very potent. When seeing a doctor about issues with skin irritation the lowest strength is usually prescribed first, and is increased until the problem is solved. This is to avoid any potential side effects that may occur with the stronger varieties.

==Glucocorticoids==

Carbenoxolone (CBX) has been discovered to inhibit cortisol and prednisolone production via 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11ß-HSD)1 inhibition. Decreasing glucocorticoid (GC) levels has been determined to be a requirement for GC-induced lipolysis.

Previous studies have concluded that CBX increases levels of urinary free cortisol (UFF) and decreases levels of urinary free cortisone (UFE). This is reflects upon the inhibition of renal 11ß-HSD2. A decrease in tetrahydrometabolites of cortisol (THF + 5 THF) and an increase in tetrahydrocortisone (THE) levels were also discovered to occur. 

11ß-HSD1 and -2 are capable of interconverting cortisol and cortisone, as well as prednisone and prednisolone. The activities of these enzymes were also able to be inhibited by glycyrrhetinic acid (GE), because of their similar enzyme kinetics. Dexamethasone has been established as an 11ß-HSD1 substrate, and could act as a competitive inhibitor with cortisone. 

Experimental GC induction might be counteracted by decreased mRNA expression from CBX action. There have been observed decreases in cortisol production after CBX treatment, which supports the assumption that 11ß-HSD2 inhibition increases the half-lives of cortisol and prednisolone. Increasing these half-lives would result in an increase in overall production of cortisol and prednisolone. 

During interstitial fluid experiments, single doses of CBX were proven to have the same impact as a 72hr treatment as the limited availability of cortisol. Activity inhibition had been marked in microdialysate samples. Single doses of CBX were discovered to inhibit the production of cortisol in the microdialysate. This is in agreement with the local inhibition in adipose, and is further supported by the capability of measuring CBX within adipose tissue and interstitial fluid. CBX concentrations were much higher in serum than in adipose and were in excess of interstitial fluid GC concentrations. As a result, competitive inhibition seems entirely possible. 

11ß-HSD1 has been proven to regulate GC promoted lipolysis. Adipose tissue microdialysis data revealed that peak glycerol release was reduced by CBX, which indicated an inhibition of GC-mediated lipolysis. Overall, useful biomarkers of 11ß-HSD1 inhibition include urinary GC/MS, prednisolone, and interstitial adipose cortisol production. In addition, limited GC availability to human adipose tissue via 11ß-HSD1 inhibition also results in lipolysis attenuation.

== Corticosteroids ==

This website is dedicated to corticosteroids, their application, background, various types, and side effects.  The site is based around about.com so it is based on a certain topic, in this case arthritis.  Corticosteroids are a well known very effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and this site is based on information focused around that fact.  This page starts with describing what they are, some examples of corticosteroids, information about cortisol, how corticosteroids work, what conditions do they treat, and how they are given.  For just some basic background and applications of corticosteroids this is an excellent resource, for a more in-depth look at the hormones, where they are formed and what they do in the human body a more scholarly article should be sought.  Most websites readily available online are geared more to the layman but journal articles are where the real information is.

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;WINDOW CLOSE [#]windowID&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement closes the window whose ID number is &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;windowID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, removing it from the screen. It also closes all edit fields, picture fields, buttons and other controls that were in the window. If you re-use the same &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;windowID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; value in a subsequent &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement, a new window is created.

If you're closing the active window, and your program has other visible windows open, one of the other windows becomes the active window, and becomes the current output window. If you're closing the current output window (but it's not the active window), you should explicitly designate a new destination for output (using the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW&lt;/code&gt; statement or the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt; statement) before executing any subsequent text or drawing commands.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter describes how to keep skunks out of homes or other areas.

==Basic precautions==

As a skunk's odor is generally considered to be offensive, people living in areas known to be inhabited by skunks are advised to take certain precautions to prevent skunks from taking up residence where they are not wanted. As skunks commonly make their dens in wood or junk piles, it is recommended that these be kept to a minimum. Skunks are scavengers and frequently go after garbage. Garbage should be stored in tightly sealed cans. 

Skunks are reported to feed on insects found in the ground, and are less found if there is no such food to be found. Use a general purpose pesticide on the grounds to reduce the occurrence of the insects will act on skunks feed. This method has its weak points though. By aiming at skunks indirectly the impact on the above mentioned grounds and their insect population is huge. It only works before the damage has started. It has long term effect on the insect population and ground specs, like pollution of water, polenisation, etc. Also, insecticids should be use with care, as most insecticids are heavily toxic.

==Skunk infestations==

A fence extending one or two feet into the ground is sufficient to prevent skunks from making a den underneath a house or other structure. If a skunk should take up residence under the building, bags filled with mothballs or washcloths drenched with ammonia can be used to encourage skunks to leave. Securing a rope to the bag or cloth will make removal easy later on. Flour or other non-toxic white powder can be sprinkled around the den entrance to track foot prints. One should check for fresh foot prints from the skunk leading out, but not going back in. It is better to check in the morning as the skunks will be more likely to be active at night.

After all the skunks have left, one should then block up any entrances that the skunk may have used along with the entrance to the skunk's den. If it is suspected that there are more skunks living in the den, a door should be constructed at the den's entrance that is hinged at the top, and extends approximately six inches (15 cm) beyond the entrance. It should be placed at a right angle to the direction of travel and should not be air tight. This can be an effective technique as it allows the skunks to exit their den, but makes it difficult for them to get back in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About this page ==

:The intention of this page is to enable people to export their Blender creations to Trainz using the Blender Exporter for Trainz. Here is no place to answer all your qestions related to Blender or Content Creation, only things directly touching the exporter behavior will be described here. If you are stuck in Blender or have a question about Content Creation itself, then you will find a lot of explanations and experienced people under the following links:

:[http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Main_Page Blender Documentation]

:[http://www.blender.org/community/user-community/ Blender Community]    

:[http://www.auran.com/TRS2006/global/files/CCG2006.zip TRS2006 Content Creation Guide]

:[http://www.auran.com/TRS2006/uploads/Image/files/CCGTC.pdf Trainz Classics Content Creation Guide]

:[http://forums.auran.com/trainz/index.php Trainz Discussion Forums]

== Getting started ==

:What you need to create content for Trainz with Blender is obviously [http://www.blender.org/ Blender] itself and the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/blenderextrainz/ Blender Exporter for Trainz]. The script was developed for Blender 2.45, but any later version should work also. To use the Blender Exporter for Trainz, you must unzip the archive and copy the included file ''trainz_exporter.py'' into the script directory of Blender. This is normally the folder ''scripts'' located in the subdirectory ''.blender'', so if you install Blender on a Windows system using the default path, you have to copy the file ''trainz_exporter.py'' from the archive into the folder ''C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts''. 

Your Blender installation has a script directory.  There are normally two locations to look one is as described above the other is under &quot;application data&quot; which is a hidden folder under &quot;Documents and Settings&quot; so go to documents and settings, tools, folder options, view, &quot;show hidden fires and folders.&quot;

As an example on my machine this would be C:\Documents and Settings\Trainz\Application Data\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts where trainz is the account name.  You should see something like 100 .py files in there.

Every time Blender starts it scans this directory and include any found script into its menu structure. So if you start or restart Blender after copying the exporter script then you call it over the Blender menu '''File &gt; Export &gt; Trainz Export'''. After selecting what you want to create and if no problems occure you find yourself in Blenders file save dialog. Choose the desired location and filename and press '''Save''' to finally create the resource file. You should always check the Blender console for infos or warnings, as the exporter only stops by fatal faults.

== Blender settings ==

:We still have to figure out what are the best Blender settings to not be surprised if finally take a look at your creation in Trainz. Instead just only some basic hints:

:*In Blender you can't scale units like in GMAX(where you have to set in preferences that a system unit should be one meter), simply assume that one BU(Blender Unit) is one meter, that's it. If you want to use imperial units, then you might take a look at the  at [http://www.geneome.net/index.php/blender-files/ Blender Mesh Attribute Editor] 

:*If you want to move an object to an absolute position, then change to Object Mode(Hotkey '''TAB''') and press '''N'''. In the now visible Transform Properties window you can enter the values you need. But beware, LocX, LocY and LocZ are local values, only if an object doesn't have a parent these are world coordinates. If you have already assigned a parent, then you will see and must enter the location relative to that parent.

:*Not all material properties visualized in Blender will have effect in Trainz, and some effects in Trainz are unable to visualize in Blender. So don't trust what you see in Blender and take a look at your creation in Trainz.

:*As textures only diffuse, opacity, reflection and normal maps have effect in Trainz. You can also export meshes without any texture.

:*The RIGHT side view shows you the LEFT side of your mesh unlike Gmax.

== Objects ==

=== Meshes ===

:Meshes are the Blender objects you will see in Trainz. You can build your objects by manipulate Blender primitives or even place vertices and create faces. Just keep in mind the following things:

:*center your creation around the point of origin, as Trainz place this point at cursor position when you insert the asset

:*Faces can be double or single sided, in Blender this is a mesh and not a material option. You will recognize the difference only in Trainz, as Blender render faces always double sided.

:*every mesh need a material; you can use one material for different meshes

:*keep an eye on vertex and face count

:The Exporter only recognize meshes which are visible during export. Make sure all objects you want to export are visible and you have selected all needed layers too! There are two reasons for this behaviour: First, nothing will be exported what you not see(maybe a long forgotten test mesh). The second cause is that you can hold big or animated objects in one Blender file and export only the needed parts by changing visibility(here the layers comes into play).

=== Bones ===

:As soon as you want to animate your asset, there is no way around using bones. You can create bones by placing a Lattice('''Add &gt; Lattice''') and rename it to something like ''b.r.something'' as it is described for the bone naming conventions in CCG. If you use bones you need to build up a complete hierarchy, that mean starting from a root bone all other bones or meshes need to be child of this root bone or any subordinated bone. The Exporter denies work if you have loose meshes or bones, because unbound meshes will not shown in Trainz.

:The root bone should be located at the point of origin and should not be rotated. Best practice might be to place it in top view(Hotkey '''NumPad 7''') and leave it untouched. The root bone also must not be animated; it serves as parent for any not animated mesh within this asset and for any bone which is not driven by/depending on an animated parent.

:To export bones they must be visible; so watch your Outliner and your Layers.

=== Attachment Points ===

:Attachment points are used in Trainz to attach effects, tracks or even other meshes. To create an AP you have to add an Empty first('''Add &gt; Empty'''). Afterwards place and rotate it like you need and give it a name following the CCG-Rules for APs(''a.whatsoever'', do you remember? ;)). APs don't need a parent, as this information will get lost during export. To although made animation possible, Trainz use an extended naming schema. Assume you have a bone ''b.r.john'' and an AP ''a.doe''. To tell Trainz that ''a.doe'' should be animated like ''b.r.john'', you must rename the AP to ''a.r.john/a.doe''. In your config.txt this AP is still to refer as ''a.doe''.

:What is valid for meshes and bones, is also valid for attachment points: If they are not visible, they will not be exported.

== Materials ==

=== Colors ===
:You can manipulate diffuse and specular color in Blender to give the material in Trainz the appearance you want. Both you find at the material panel, '''Col''' for diffuse and '''Spe''' for specular color:
[[Image:Materialpanel.png|frame|center|1 - Blender material panel]]
:There are two other colors supported by Trainz: ambient and emissive.

:The ambient color in Blender work different from Trainz and as in most cases ambient and diffuse color will be equal,  ambient color is copied from diffuse color during export. The emissive color is used for self illumination in Trainz and not provided in Blender. As things normally have the same color even if lighted or light, the Exporter here also copies the value of diffuse color.

:If you plan to use textures you should set the diffuse color to pure white, else your textures will appear darker in Trainz than expected.

=== Opacity ===

:Also on the material panel you find the slider for Opacity, in Blender called Alpha(slider '''A''' down at the right side). A value of 1 means the material is completely visible, a value of 0 render your material completely invisible. If you use texture maps which also affect the opacity, then better leave the Alpha-slider at its right position as the over all opacity will not be higher then the material opacity.

=== Specularity ===

:Specularity can be adjusted using the shader panel. The interesting sliders are specularity '''Spec''' and hardness '''Hard''' in the middle of the panel.
[[Image:Shaderpanel.png|frame|center|2 - Blender shader panel]]
:Slider specularity maintain the intensity of specular color from 0(no specular highlight) up to 2(full specular highlight), while slider hardness define how concentrate the reflected light should be. A high hardness gives a hard specularity(imagine glass or an polished surface), while a low hardness gives a dull shine(like asphalt or rough/dirty metal). The hardness range(1..511) will be scaled down from the Exporter to 0..100, so if you want to copy GMax/Max Glossiness-values you have to multiply them roughly by 5.

=== Self Illumination ===

:The brightness without to be lighted. You find the slider '''Emit''' in the lower right corner of shader panel. The more emissive you order, the more your material glow in diffuse color.

== Textures ==

=== General ===

At first some common things to textures:

:*NEVER use packed picture formats, as they often distort colors, wasting resources while loading(to extract they need additional memory and CPU-time) and at last they have the same footprint in memory as an uncompressed picture format. A good format is Targa(*.tga), as it is uncompressed(don't use the RLE-option!) and has the ability to store also an alpha channel if needed.

:*Made your textures as small as possible. What ever should work is the creation of your texture twice as big as finally used and afterwards scale them down with enabled antialiasing. You get nearly the same detail grade as in the original map and need only 1/4 of its memory.

:*Ever us &quot;power of 2&quot; - values as map dimensions(i.e. 64x64, 128x128, 128x512). Such textures could processed very fast,because &quot;power of 2&quot; - numbers are the native language of your hardware. You don't have to stay by square maps, but also avoid an aspect ratio behind 1:8.

:In Blender you assing textures using the texture panel you find in the Material buttons window(Hotkey '''F5''').
{|border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;83%&quot;
|[[Image:Texturpanel1.png|frame|3 - Blender Texture panel - empty]]
|[[Image:Texturpanel2.png|frame|4 - Blender Texture panel - texture object created]]
|}
:After creating a TE-object you have to tell Blender where the mapping information should came from(Map Input) and which material property should be influenced(Map To).
{|border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;83%&quot;
|[[Image:Mapinputpanel.png|frame|5 - Blender Map Input panel]]
|[[Image:Maptopanel.png|frame|6 - Blender Map To panel]]
|}
:The default map input choosen by Blender is '''Orco'''. That's a mapping not used by Trainz. For reflection maps you can choose '''Refl''', for all the other used maps the Exporter only accept '''UV''' mapping. As mapping target you can choose one or more of the following options:

::* '''Col''', used for diffuse maps
::* '''Alpha''', used for opacity maps
::* '''Ref''', used for reflection maps
::* '''Nor''', used for normal(bump) maps

:You can assign other mapping targets and these textures will be exported, but you will not notice the slightest effect in Trainz.

:What's now left to do is of course loading the texture itself. In Blender you define the content of a texture using the Texture buttons window(Hotkey '''F6'''). The only texture type you can export to Trainz is '''Image''', so you can ignore all other possibilities you have in Blender.
[[Image:Texturebuttons.png|frame|center|7 - Blender Texture buttons]]
:Now select the appropriate image by pressing '''Load''' on the Image panel.

:There is only one option left, the option &quot;no texture&quot;. The Blender Exporter for Trainz allows you to export models without any texture. This can speed up asset creation due to &quot;quick checks&quot; of the pure mesh directly in Trainz. To export without any texture you simply have to delete eventually assigned texture objects.

=== Diffuse Textures ===

:Diffuse textures are the most used textures, they basicly define the surface of objects. To use them you have to select button '''UV''' as input and button '''Col''' as output. The texture amount you can adjust with slider '''Col''', located at the right middle of the Map To panel.

=== Opacity Textures ===

:Alpha textures are used to simulate transparent materials or to make parts of your object invisible. You can create dirty windows or let a simple plane look like a bogey part. An alpha map normaly comes together with a diffuse map, so the needed '''UV''' mapping should already be done. As target select '''Alpha'''. The texture amount is controled by slider '''Var''' at the right side of Map To panel.

:You can combine diffuse and opacity texture if you use an image with alpha layer. You need to select the option '''UseAlpha''' at the Map Image panel and must select '''Col''' and '''Alpha''' as targets at the Map To panel.

:One little problem can occure if you work with opacity: Due to a bug in Trainz not completely opaque or transparent areas may overlap each other. You can take a look at the problem and one possible work around by downloading the two related examples from [https://sourceforge.net/projects/blenderextrainz/ SourceForge].

=== Reflection Textures ===

:These textures are a bit different in usage as the others, because Trainz map them automatically using spherical mapping. How this works you can imagine best if you create a smooth sphere and assign a reflection map. Which map part is shown depend on the direction in which the imaginary ray from the camera to the objects surface would be reflected. That's why you see the whole map on the surface of a smooth sphere.

:To use reflection maps you only need to press button '''Refl''' in Map Input panel and button '''Ref''' in the Map To panel of the designated texture. You will notice that no colors appear neither in material preview nor in render window. That's because Blender use reflective textures to modify the strenght and not the color of reflection. But no fear, in Trainz you get your colors back ;).

=== Hardness Textures ===

:You can assign hardness textures but you will be disappointed. They don't affect hardness, instead they will be typed as reflective texture during export. This behavior is copied from the original exporter, as any attempt to influence the &quot;shinestrength&quot; so far ends in a complete white unlighted object.

=== Normal Textures ===

:A normal texture is used to fake highs and lows on an plain surface. To use it you need an '''UV''' Map Input and a '''Nor''' Map To. Please take care to use an normal map and not a bump map. Both are used for the same purpose, but they contain different data.

=== Texture Combinations ===

:How a texture influence the object appearance in Trainz is controlled by so called &quot;material name decorations&quot;. With one exception the Blender Exporter for Trainz select the appropriate decoration depending your assigned textures. This exception is ''m.billboard'', as this material decoration is used for objects always face the camera. Because the Exporter has no chance to detect if you want this behavior, you have to decorate the material name for yourself with the ending ''m.billboard''. General the Exporter don't overwrite a known material decoration, so if you want to ensure your material will be exported as ''m.gloss'', then simply append ''m.gloss'' for yourself to the material name.

:a list of all currently supported texture combinations
:'''single textures:'''
::* diffuse texture
::* reflection texture
::* hardness texture(will appear as reflection texture)
:'''double textures:'''
::* diffuse &amp; alpha texture
::* diffuse &amp; reflection texture
::* diffuse &amp; hardness texture(the same as diffuse &amp; reflection)
::* diffuse &amp; normal texture
:'''triple textures:'''
::* diffuse, reflection &amp; alpha texture(in this case the alpha texture affects the reflection texture and not the diffuse texture)
::* diffuse, alpha &amp; normal texture(no reflection or hardness texture allowed)
::* diffuse, reflection &amp; normal texture(no alpha texture allowed)

== Events ==

:In case of animation export the original exporters ask you for an event file to bind events to specific frames. To use events with the Blender Exporter for Trainz is similar. Switching a Blender window to Text Editor window and create a new TX object via '''File &gt; New''' (Hotkey '''Alt N'''). Enter for every event a line with frame number, event type and event name. If you finally rename this TX object to ''events'', then the Exporter will parse this text and create the desired entries in your animation file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== WINDOW == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;WindowInformation = WINDOW(expr)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Revision:
&lt;/strong&gt;February, 2002 (Release 6)

=== Description ===
This function returns information related to a window (usually the current output window). The value you specify in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; determines what kind of information is returned, as described in the following paragraphs.

&lt;strong&gt;ID's of Active Window , Active Document Window, Active Palette Window and Output Window&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_activeWnd)&lt;/code&gt; returns the window ID number of the currently active window, or zero if no window is active.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_activeDoc)&lt;/code&gt; returns the window ID number of the currently active document&amp;nbsp;window or zero if no document window is active. In searching for the active document,&amp;nbsp;this function bypasses all palettes in search of a window with the type attribute set to&amp;nbsp;include &lt;code&gt;_keepInBack&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_activePlt)&lt;/code&gt; returns the window ID number of the frontmost palette. In&amp;nbsp;order for there to be a palette, one or more document windows must be open with the&amp;nbsp;type attribute set to include &lt;code&gt;_keepInBack&lt;/code&gt;. At that point, all non-&lt;code&gt;_keepInBack&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;windows become palettes and float over the document windows.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_outputWnd)&lt;/code&gt; returns the window ID number of the current output window,&amp;nbsp;or zero if output is currently directed to somewhere besides a FutureBasic-created&amp;nbsp;screen window (e.g., to the printer).

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Window Size&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_width)&lt;/code&gt; returns the width (in pixels) of the content region of the current&amp;nbsp;output window.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_height)&lt;/code&gt; returns the height (in pixels) of the content region of the current&amp;nbsp;output window. (Note: The content region does not include the window's frame.)

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Window Position (Appearance manager)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_kFBstructureTop)&lt;/code&gt; returns the distance from the top of the screen to the&amp;nbsp;top of the structure region of the window.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_kFBstructureLeft)&lt;/code&gt; returns the distance from the left of the screen to the&amp;nbsp;left of the structure region of the window.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_kFBstructureWidth)&lt;/code&gt; returns the width of the window's structure region.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_kFBstructureHeight)&lt;/code&gt; returns the height of the window's structure region.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_kFBcontentTop)&lt;/code&gt; returns the distance from the top of the screen to the top&amp;nbsp;of the content region of the window.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_kFBcontentLeft)&lt;/code&gt; returns the distance from the left of the screen to the&amp;nbsp;left of the content region of the window.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_kFBcontentWidth)&lt;/code&gt; returns the width of the window's content region.&amp;nbsp;This is normally the same as &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_width)&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_kFBcontentHeight)&lt;/code&gt; returns the height of the window's content region.&amp;nbsp;This is normally the same as &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_height)&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pen Position&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_penH)&lt;/code&gt; returns the horizontal position (in pixels) of the pen in the current output window.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_penV)&lt;/code&gt; returns the vertical position (in pixels) of the pen in the current output window.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Window Record Pointer&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_wndPointer&lt;/code&gt; OR &lt;code&gt;_wndRef)&lt;/code&gt; returns a pointer to the Window Record of the current output window. For information about the contents of the Window Record,&amp;nbsp;see the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;get%20window.html&quot;&gt;GET WINDOW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-188.html#HEADING188-0&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Window Manager&amp;quot; chapter&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos8/mac8.html&quot;&gt;Inside&amp;nbsp;Macintosh&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-2.html&quot;&gt;Macintosh Toolbox Essentials&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the descriptions of grafPort and&amp;nbsp;CGrafPort data structures in &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos8/mac8.html&quot;&gt;Inside Macintosh&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/QuickDraw/QuickDraw-2.html&quot;&gt;Imaging with QuickDraw&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_wndPort)&lt;/code&gt; return the current grafport being used for output.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Clipboard Contents&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_textClip)&lt;/code&gt; returns a nonzero value if there is information of type &amp;quot;TEXT&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;on the clipboard; returns zero otherwise.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_pictClip)&lt;/code&gt; returns a nonzero value if there is information of type &amp;quot;PICT&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;on the clipboard; returns zero otherwise.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Window Class (Standard BASIC only)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_outputWClass)&lt;/code&gt; returns the &amp;quot;class number&amp;quot; assigned to the current output&amp;nbsp;window.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_activeWClass)&lt;/code&gt; returns the &amp;quot;class number&amp;quot; assigned to the currently active&amp;nbsp;window.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_outputWCategory)&lt;/code&gt; returns the &amp;quot;class number&amp;quot; assigned to the current output window for the Appearance Manager runtime.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_activeWCategory)&lt;/code&gt; returns the &amp;quot;class number&amp;quot; assigned to the currently active window for the Appearance Manager runtime. (See the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;window%20statement.html&quot;&gt;WINDOW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement for more information about class numbers).

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Other Window Info (Appearance Manager)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_kFBMacWClass)&lt;/code&gt; returns the toolbox window class. Return values might&amp;nbsp;include things like &lt;code&gt;_kDocumentWindowClass&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_kMovableModalWindowClass&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_kFBMacWAttributes)&lt;/code&gt; returns toolbox attributes about a window. Values&amp;nbsp;might include &lt;code&gt;_kWindowResizableAttribute&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_kWindowCloseBoxAttribute&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_kFBwDescHandle)&lt;/code&gt; returns the handle to a FBwindowDescription record&amp;nbsp;which is stored in the window's refcon. While this information is subject to change, it&amp;nbsp;currently contains the following data:

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEGIN RECORD&lt;/b&gt; FBwindowDescription
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; FBwRef&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;227&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;AS LONG&lt;/b&gt;&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;22&quot;&gt;// standard FB Ref number&lt;br&gt;

&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;255&quot;&gt;// text buttons&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;END RECORD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_kFBwClickThru)&lt;/code&gt; returns a non-zero value if this attribute bit is set. 

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_kFBFloatingWndPtr)&lt;/code&gt; returns the window pointer of the frontmost floating window.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Screen Borders in Local Coordinates&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_toLeft)&lt;/code&gt; returns the horizontal pixel position of the screen's left edge,&amp;nbsp;expressed in the local coordinate system of the current output window (note this will&amp;nbsp;be negative if the window lies entirely on the screen).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_toTop)&lt;/code&gt; returns the vertical pixel position of the top of the screen, expressed&amp;nbsp;in the local coordinate system of the current output window (note this will be negative&amp;nbsp;if the window lies entirely on the screen).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_toRight)&lt;/code&gt; returns the horizontal pixel position of the screen's right edge,&amp;nbsp;expressed in the local coordinate system of the current output window.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_toBottom)&lt;/code&gt; returns the vertical pixel position of the bottom of the screen,&amp;nbsp;expressed in the local coordinate system of the current output window.

&lt;/ul&gt;
(Note that these numbers are meaningless if output is currently directed to some place other than a screen window.)

&lt;strong&gt;Checking Whether a Window Exists
&lt;/strong&gt;If you specify a negative value in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; returns a nonzero value if there exists a window whose ID number is &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;; it returns zero otherwise. The returned value does not depend on whether the window is currently visible or not; it only depends on whether the window has been created (using the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW&lt;/code&gt; statement) and not yet closed (using the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW CLOSE&lt;/code&gt; statement).

&lt;strong&gt;Edit Field and Picture Field Information&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_efNum)&lt;/code&gt; returns the ID number of the currently active edit field or picture&amp;nbsp;field; or zero if there is no currently active edit field or picture field.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_selStart)&lt;/code&gt; returns the character position of the beginning of the selected&amp;nbsp;text or insertion point in the currently active edit field (if any).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_selEnd)&lt;/code&gt; returns the character position of the end of the selected text or&amp;nbsp;insertion point in the currently active edit field (if any).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_efHandle)&lt;/code&gt; returns a handle to the TextEdit record of the currently&amp;nbsp;active edit field (if any); this is the same as the value returned by &lt;code&gt;TEHANDLE(&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_efNum))&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_lastEfNum)&lt;/code&gt; returns the ID number of the previously active edit field&amp;nbsp;(or zero, if no other edit field was previously active).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_efTextLen)&lt;/code&gt; returns the number of characters in the currently active&amp;nbsp;edit field (if any).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_teBlock)&lt;/code&gt; returns a handle to the Edit Field Descriptor for the currently&amp;nbsp;active edit field or picture field (if any).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;(_efClass)&lt;/code&gt; returns the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;efClass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter assigned to the currently&amp;nbsp;active edit field (if any); or the &lt;i&gt;negative&lt;/i&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter assigned to the&amp;nbsp;currently active picture field (if any).

&lt;/ul&gt;
=== Note ===
If output is currently directed to a graphics port other than a screen window (e.g. to the printer, or to an offscreen GWorld), then references to the &amp;quot;current output window&amp;quot; apply to the current port, unless otherwise specified.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Noodle|Noodles]]

'''Chow mein''' is a generic Chinese term for a dish of stir-fried noodles, of which there are many varieties. Authentic chow mein is generally made of soft noodles, whereas chow mein in Westernized Chinese Cuisine may also be made from thin crispy noodles.

This version of chow mein is made with [[Cookbook:Seitan|seitan]] instead of the more traditional use of chicken, pork or shrimp, making this dish fit for vegans. Also, instead of using oyster sauce in the marinade, shiitake mushrooms are used to achieve a similar depth of flavour.

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] mung bean sprouts
* 15 ounces [[Cookbook:Seitan|seitan]]
* 1/2 pound dry wonton noodles
* 2 medium ribs celery
* 1 pound bok choy or broccoli
* 1/2 pound fresh mushrooms 
* 1 red bell pepper
* 1/2 red onion
* 1 green onion (scallion, spring onion)
* vegetable oil for frying and stir-frying, as needed
* 1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds
Marinade:
* 1/4 cup finely chopped shiitake mushrooms
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 1 teaspoon soy sauce
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
Sauce:
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] water or low-sodium vegetable broth
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 4 tablespoons water

==Procedure==

# One or 2 hours before cooking, rinse the mung bean sprouts so that they have time to drain thoroughly.
# Cut the seitan into thin strips. Add the marinade ingredients, adding the cornstarch last.
# Marinate the seitan for 20 to 25 minutes.
# The following 3 steps can be completed while the seitan is marinating:
#* To prepare the sauce, in a small bowl dissolve the 1 tablespoon cornstarch with the 4 tablespoons water. Whisk the water or vegetable broth with the oyster sauce, soy sauce, salt, pepper and cornstarch and water mixture and set aside.
#* Soften the noodles by placing them in boiling salted water. Plunge into cold water to stop the cooking process and drain thoroughly.
#* Wash all the vegetables as needed. Cut the celery and the bok choy into 1/2-inch pieces on the diagonal. If substituting broccoli for bok choy, peel the stalks until no more strings come out, and slice thinly on the diagonal.  Wipe the mushrooms clean with a damp cloth and slice. Cut the red bell pepper in half, remove the seeds and chut into chunks. Peel and chop the onion. Dice the green onion.
# Heat a wok or frying pan over medium-high to high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil. When the oil is hot, add the noodles. Fry in batches until golden. Remove the noodles from the pan.
# Heat 2 tablespoons oil. Add the onion and the seitan, keeping remaining marinade aside for later use. Let the seitan brown briefly, then stir-fry until the redness is gone and the seitan is nearly cooked through. Remove the cooked seitan and onion from the pan.
# Cook the rest of the vegetables separately, except for the green onion, seasoning each with a bit of salt while stir-frying if desired. When cooking the bok choy or broccoli, add 1/4 cup of water and cover while cooking. Remove each of the vegetables from the pan when finished stir-frying. Add more oil as needed.
# Give the sauce a quick restir. Add all the ingredients back into the wok, making a &quot;well&quot; in the middle if the wok for the sauce. Add the sauce and any remaining marinade, stirring quickly to thicken. Mix everything together. Stir in the green onions. Pour the cooked vegetable and sauce mixture on top of the noodles. Garnish the chow mein with the toasted sesame seeds. Serve hot.

==Variations==
For crispy chow mein noodles, add more oil than the recipe calls for and cook the noodles longer to dry them out.

=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;WINDOW [#]idExpr[,[title$][,[rect][,[type][,class]]]]&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
Use this statement to do any of the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Create a new screen window;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Activate (highlight and bring to the front) an existing window;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Make an existing window visible or invisible;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Alter the title or rectangle of an existing window.

&lt;/ul&gt;
The parameters should be specified as follows. They are interpreted slightly differently depending on whether you are creating a new window or altering an existing one.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - a positive or negative integer whose absolute value is in the range 1 through 255.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;title$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - a string expression.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - a rectangle in global screen coordinates. You can express it in either of two forms:

&lt;code&gt;(&lt;i&gt;x1&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;y1&lt;/i&gt;)-(&lt;i&gt;x2&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;y2&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;/code&gt;Two diagonally opposite corner points.&lt;code&gt;
&lt;i&gt;rectAddr&amp;amp; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;Long integer expression or &lt;code&gt;POINTER&lt;/code&gt; variable which points to an 8-byte struct such as a &lt;code&gt;RECT&lt;/code&gt; type.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - a positive or negative integer which specifies the general appearance of the window, and specifies whether it should be &amp;quot;modal&amp;quot; or not (a modal window is always active while it's open; it inhibits the user from selecting another window or a menubar item until the window is closed).

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;class&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - an integer in the range 0 through 255.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To Create a New Screen Window&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Specify an &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; value such that &lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is different from the ID number of&amp;nbsp;any existing window. A new window is created and is assigned an ID number of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ABS(&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. You can use the window's ID number later to identify the window in&amp;nbsp;other FB statements and functions. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is negative, the window is created&amp;nbsp;invisibly; it's sometimes useful to create a window invisibly if it will contain controls,&amp;nbsp;edit fields and graphics that may take a long time to build. You can use the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement again to make an invisible window visible (see below). When you create a&amp;nbsp;new window, it becomes the current output window. If you create it visibly (and you&amp;nbsp;don't specify the &lt;code&gt;_keepInBack&lt;/code&gt; attribute), it also becomes the current active window.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;title$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; assigns a string to the window's title bar (if the window has a title bar). If you&amp;nbsp;omit this parameter, the window will be created without a title.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies the initial size and location of the window's content rectangle. Note&amp;nbsp;that rect does not include the window's frame. This parameter is interpreted in a&amp;nbsp;special way if you specify an upper-left coordinate of (0,0) in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;; in this case, the&amp;nbsp;window is centered in the screen, and its width and height are determined by the right&amp;nbsp;and bottom coordinates of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Note that this special interpretation applies only&amp;nbsp;when you're creating a new window. If you omit this parameter, a window of a&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;default&amp;quot; size and location is created.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies the appearance, modality and special attributes of the window (see more&amp;nbsp;below). If you omit this parameter, a non-modal window of type &lt;code&gt;_doc&lt;/code&gt; is created,&amp;nbsp;with no special attributes.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;class&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies an optional &amp;quot;class number&amp;quot; for the window. If your application creates several windows, it's useful to assign the same class number to each window that performs a given kind of function. Later, you can use the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW&lt;/code&gt; function to determine the class number of the currently active window and the current output window; this can help your application determine what the window is used for and how to process it. If you omit this parameter, the new window is assigned a class number of zero.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Activate an Existing Window&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Specify the (positive) ID number of an existing window in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. You do not need&amp;nbsp;to specify any of the other parameters, unless you also wish to change some of the&amp;nbsp;window's characteristics. The window also becomes the current output window. If&amp;nbsp;the window was invisible, it becomes visible.
&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: You can't activate the window if you specified the &lt;code&gt;_keepInBack&lt;/code&gt; attribute when the window was created, and there are other visible windows open.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Make an Existing Window Visible or Invisible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;To make a window visible, specify the (positive) ID number of an existing window in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The window also becomes the current active window (unless its &lt;code&gt;_keepInBack&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;attribute is set), and it becomes the current output window.

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;To make a window invisible, specify the negative of an existing window's ID number&amp;nbsp;in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The window becomes the current output window. If it was the active&amp;nbsp;window, it becomes inactive (possibly forcing another window to become active).
You do not need to specify any of the other parameters, unless you also want to change some of the window's characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Alter the Characteristics of an Existing Window&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Specify the ID number of an existing window (or its negative) in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;specify a new &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;title$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter (you can't change the window's&lt;code&gt; &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;class&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; after it's been created). If you omit any parameter, the corresponding&amp;nbsp;characteristic won't change. Note that the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;parameter is interpreted slightly&amp;nbsp;differently when you're altering an existing window, as opposed to creating a new&amp;nbsp;window; in particular, specifying an upper-left coordinate of (0,0) will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; cause an&amp;nbsp;existing window to be centered on the screen. If you want to change an exising&amp;nbsp;window's rectangle so that it's centered on the screen, use a &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;rect &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;parameter that's&amp;nbsp;calculated as follows:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; rect.8&lt;br&gt;
x1 = (&lt;b&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/b&gt;(_scrnWidth) - myWindowWidth) / 2 &lt;br&gt;
y1 = (&lt;b&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/b&gt;(_scrnHeight) - myWindowHeight) / 2 &lt;br&gt;
x2 = x1 + myWindowWidth&lt;br&gt;
y2 = y1 + myWindowHeight&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CALL SETRECT&lt;/b&gt;(rect, x1, y1, x2, y2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: If you specify the window's (positive) ID number when you alter a window's characteristics, the window also becomes the current active window (unless its &lt;code&gt;_keepInBack&lt;/code&gt; attribute is set). If you specify the negative of the window's ID number, the window becomes invisible.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side Effects of Activating the Window&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement always makes the window active, unless you specify a negative &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or you specified the &lt;code&gt;_keepInBack&lt;/code&gt; attribute when you created the window. When you activate a window using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement, the following things also happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;The window also becomes the current output window. (See the &lt;code&gt;WINDOW OUPTUT&lt;/code&gt; statement to learn how to specify an output window that's different from the active window.)

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;A DIALOG event of type &lt;code&gt;_wndActivate&lt;/code&gt; is generated. (There are also other kinds of actions which generate &lt;code&gt;_wndActivate&lt;/code&gt; events; see the &lt;code&gt;DIALOG&lt;/code&gt; function for more information.)

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;Any previously-active window becomes inactive (this also generates a separate &lt;code&gt;_wndActivate&lt;/code&gt; DIALOG event).

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side Effects of Making a Window Visible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the (positive) ID of a window that currently exists but is invisible, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement makes the window visible, and also generates a &lt;code&gt;DIALOG&lt;/code&gt; event of type &lt;code&gt;_wndRefresh&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;code&gt;_wndRefresh&lt;/code&gt; event is also generated when you create a new window visibly. (Note: There are also other kinds of actions which generate &lt;code&gt;_wndRefresh &lt;/code&gt;events; see the &lt;code&gt;DIALOG&lt;/code&gt; function for more information.)

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side Effects of Making a Window Invisible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;idExpr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is negative, the window becomes invisible, and it becomes the current output window. If the window was previously active, it becomes inactive; if your program has other visible windows, one of them becomes the active window.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More about the type Parameter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;parameter is a positive or negative integer. The absolute value of &lt;code&gt;type&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;determines the general appearance of the window and determines some special attributes&lt;br&gt;
of it. The sign of &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; determines whether the window will be modal or non-modal. If&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is negative, the window will be modal, which means the user won't be able to&lt;br&gt;
switch to a different window until the modal window is closed; if the user clicks in an&lt;br&gt;
inactive window while a modal window is active, a beep is generated, but a &lt;code&gt;_wndClick&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;event is notgenerated. &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;can be expressed as follows:

&lt;code&gt;[-](windowVariant [+attribute [+attribute ...]])&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;windowVariant&lt;/code&gt; can be any of the following:
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;image was here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_doc&lt;/code&gt; (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Document window with room for scrollbars.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;image was here &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Framed dialog window.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;image was here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td nowrap&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_dialogPlain&lt;/code&gt; (3)



&lt;code&gt;_dialogShadow&lt;/code&gt; (4)



&lt;code&gt;_docNoGrow&lt;/code&gt; (5)



&lt;code&gt;_dialogMovable&lt;/code&gt; (6)



&lt;code&gt;_docZoom&lt;/code&gt; (9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td nowrap&gt;Plain dialog window.
&lt;p&gt;

Shadowed dialog window.



Document window with no grow box.



Movable dialog window.



Document window with zoom box and room for scrollbars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;image was here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_docRound&lt;/code&gt; (17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rounded-corner window. Add 1 through 7 to this variant to increase the roundness of the corners.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;image was here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_WDEFbaseID&lt;/code&gt; (129)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Palette window with close box. You can add the constant &lt;code&gt;_WDEFhasZoom&lt;/code&gt; (8) to this variant to give the window a zoom&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;image was here&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;_WDEFbaseID + _WDEFsideDrag&lt;/code&gt; (131)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sideways palette. You can add the constant &lt;code&gt;_WDEFhasZoom&lt;/code&gt; (8) to this variant to give the window a zoom box.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;176 through 191&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;These values are mapped to Appearance Manager window types 1984 through 1999.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;192 through 255&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;These values are mapped to Appearance Manager window types 1024 through 1087.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;attribute&lt;/code&gt; can be any of the following (you can specify as many of these as apply):

&lt;image was here&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== WIDTH == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;WIDTH [LPRINT][=]{_noTextWrap|_textWrap|numChars}&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This statement affects how (and whether) text printed by subsequent &lt;code&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;LPRINT &lt;/code&gt;statements will &quot;wrap.&quot;If you specify the &lt;code&gt;LPRINT&lt;/code&gt; keyword, the &lt;code&gt;'''WIDTH'''&lt;/code&gt; statement applies only to statements sent to the printer. If you omit the &lt;code&gt;LPRINT&lt;/code&gt; keyword, the &lt;code&gt;'''WIDTH'''&lt;/code&gt; statement applies only to subsequent &lt;code&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; statementsdestined for the screen. &lt;code&gt;'''WIDTH'''&lt;/code&gt; (without &lt;code&gt;LPRINT&lt;/code&gt;) applies to all existing and subsequently-created windows.

=== Notes ===
While &quot;wrapping&quot; is enabled, any subsequently printed text whose location exceeds a certain limit on the current line will automatically &quot;wrap around&quot; and continue at the beginning of the next line. Wrapping does not necessarily occur on word boundaries.

If you specify &lt;code&gt;_noTextWrap&lt;/code&gt;, wrapping is disabled. Text continues on the current line until the pen is explicitly moved to the next line (this usually happens automatically after the last item in the &lt;code&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;LPRINT&lt;/code&gt; statement has been printed). Note that if the window or the printer page is not wide enough to display all of the items in the print list, some of the items will be lost. The advantage of using &lt;code&gt;_noTextWrap&lt;/code&gt; is that it greatly increases printing speed.

If you specify &lt;code&gt;_textWrap&lt;/code&gt;, wrapping occurs at the right edge of the window or the printer page. This is the default condition in effect before the first execution of &lt;code&gt;'''WIDTH'''&lt;/code&gt;.

If you specify &lt;code&gt;''numChars''&lt;/code&gt; (which must be a number in the range 1 through 255), wrapping occurs either at the right edge of the window (or the printer page), or after &lt;code&gt;''numChars'' &lt;/code&gt;characters have been printed on the current line, whichever occurs first. Note that if you're using a proportional font, the horizontal pixel location where wrapping occurs may be different on different lines.

'''FB Lite behavior:'''
When you use the &quot;FB Lite&quot; runtime, the &lt;code&gt;'''WIDTH'''&lt;/code&gt; statement is ignored; essentially, &lt;code&gt;'''WIDTH''' [LPRINT] _textWrap&lt;/code&gt; is always in effect. Also, previously-printed text in the Text Window will dynamically &quot;re-wrap&quot; as the user resizes the window. If you're not using the &quot;FB Lite&quot; runtime, you won't get the dynamic re-wrap effect; previously-printed text stays where it is, and may be obliterated if the user resizes the window.

==Introduction==

'''Ghrelin''' was recently discovered in 1999 by Masayasu Kojima and his colleagues as a hormone that stimulates appetite. It is known as the counterpart of the hormone leptin, which is made in fat tissue.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Both these hormones, when at low levels, provide the sensation of being full, scientifically known as satiation. Conversely, when these hormones are at high levels, hunger ensues. Therefore, ghrelin production is increased before a meal and then slowed afterwards. 


Due to the effects of ghrelin on metabolism and hunger, it is a prominent target for development of anti-obesity treatments. It has been reported that immunization of rats against ghrelin resulted in decreased weight gain and adiposity relative to control rats; even though both groups consumed an equivalent amount of food. This and other experiments could someday lead to the possibility of a vaccine against obesity.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;


*The link to the right shows a graph of ghrelin levels in the blood before and after a meal. The graph is based on assays of plasma ghrelin in 10 humans during the course of one day.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;


Ghrelin is primarily produced by PD/1 cells in the fundus of the stomach and epsilon cells of the pancreas.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Smaller amounts are also produced in the kidney, placenta, hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. This hormone exists in two forms; an endocrinological inactive (pure peptide) form, as well as an active (octanoylated) form. Without proper control of ghrelin production, disease states such as anorexia nervosa and Prader-Willi syndrome result. To prevent these disease states, regulatory mechanisms are required to maintain equilibrium. These mechanisms control ghrelin production and use the hormone for a number of vital needs.


The main function of ghrelin is to let the brain know the current energy-state of the body. In doing this, ghrelin helps balance the energy in our system. It is able to do this by promoting the secretion of growth hormone by activation of the growth hormone secretagoue receptor, and antonymously suppressing fat utilization in adipose tissue. Ghrelin is also known to stimulate gastric emptying. The hormone furthermore contributes to neurotrophy, particularly in the hippocampus; and it is essential for cognitive adaptation to changing environments and the process of learning. Most recently, ghrelin has been shown to activate the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase in a pathway that depends on various kinases including Akt.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Ghrelin can also have positive effects on the cardiovascular system, although scientists are not sure if, for example, cardiac output is increased due to ghrelin or the indirect effect of its stimulation of growth hormone secretion.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 




 Ghrelin functions as a growth hormone-releasing peptide; and was therefore aptly named ghrelin based on the Proto-Indo-European root ghre, which means to grow.

='''&lt;big&gt;Discovery&lt;/big&gt;'''=

Ghrelin was recently discovered in 1999 by Masayasu Kojima and his colleagues as a hormone that stimulates appetite.

More recently, Scripps research scientists developed an anti-obesity vaccine. The vaccine uses the immune system's antibodies to bind to selected targets, directing the body's own immune response against them. This method prevents ghrelin from reaching the central nervous system, thus resulting in reduction of weight gain.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;



='''&lt;big&gt;Physiology&lt;/big&gt;'''=

Ghrelin is primarily produced by PD/1 cells as a preprohormone, then proteolytically processed to yield a 28-amino acid peptide in the fundus of the stomach and epsilon cells of the pancreas.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Smaller amounts are also produced in the kidney, placenta, hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. Ghrelin is also produced by a small number of neurons in the arcuate nucleus.


Receptors for ghrelin were discovered before the actual hormone. They are found on neurons in the arcuate nucleus and the ventromedial hypothalamus as well as the pituitary gland, heart and adipose tissue. These receptors are G protein-coupled receptors, also known as GHS receptors (growth hormone secretagogue receptors); and when activated by ghrelin, secrete growth hormone and have also been found to suppress fat utilization in adipose tissue. 


This hormone increases food intake and fat mass by action in the hypothalamus. Here in the hypothalmus, ghrelin activates the arcuate nucleus cells. The ghrelin-response of these cells is affected by both leptin and insulin (other hormones related to metabolism).&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 

Ghrelin also activates the mesolimbic cholinergic-dopaminergic reward link, a circuit that communicates the pleasurable and reinforcing aspects of natural rewards; for example, food, as well as addictive drugs, such as ethanol.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

     
    Ghrelin exists in two forms; an endocrinological inactive (pure peptide) form, as well as an active (octanoylated) form. 


=='''&lt;big&gt;Function/Purpose&lt;/big&gt;'''==


The main function of ghrelin is to let the brain know the current energy-state of the body. In doing this, ghrelin helps balance the energy in our system. 

It does this in a number of ways:

*Promotion of secretion of growth hormone by activation of the growth hormone secretagoue receptor. 

*Suppression of fat utilization in adipose tissue. 

*Stimulation of gastric emptying. 

*Contribution to neurotrophy (within hippocampus)

*Essential for cognitive adaptation to changing environments. 

*Essential to the process of learning. 

*Activation of the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase in a pathway that depends on various kinases including Akt.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 

*Ghrelin may also have positive effects on the cardiovascular system, although scientists are not positive this is directly related to ghrelin.


===Energy Homeostasis===

Afferent signals that arise from peripheral tissues are known to play a significant role in the CNS/periphery interactions that are involved in energy homeostasis regulation. Ghrelin is among the list of exemplifiers for this signaling and regulation. Ghrelin has been discovered to be primarily synthesized in the stomach and has become a focus of obesity research. This is because it is the only known systemic signal that specifically promotes food intake, positive energy balance, and the facilitation of adiposity development via attenuation of fatty oxidation. Researchers have proven that the action of ghrelin increases food intake, and independently regulates adipocyte metabolism. Ghrelin channels nutrient partitioning toward fat storage via favoring the uptake of glucose and triglycerides. This is made possible by increasing lipogenesis via lipid oxidation inhibition within white adipocytes. Central ghrelin administration also results in lower body core temperatures.

It has been determined that maximum ghrelin potency as a fat storage-promoting factor requires that it affects nutrient intake and metabolic nutrient partitioning. This is because the most significant ghrelin-induced body fat gain occurs with ample substrate availability, strong orexigenic drive and high efficiency lipid storage.

Ghrelin action elicits within the brain, which suggests that stomach-derived ghrelin may act at the level of brain structures to affect peripheral adipocytes metabolism, if secreted in substantial amounts. As a result, researchers have suggested that ghrelin may “prime” adipose tissue to store energy as fat after altering the expression of adipocyte enzymes.

Ghrelin gene deficiency has, in the past, been proven to decrease the respiratory quotient (RQ), which results in decreased fat deposition. A possible explanation for this may be decreased expression of lipogenic enzymes in white adipose tissue (WAT). Researchers propose that during a normal diet, limited lipogenic pathway activity of ghrelin knockout (KO) mice is sufficient for physiological phenotype maintenance. By contrast, it is also proposed that conditions of abundant dietary fat result in impaired adipocyte metabolism, which decreases the susceptibility for diet-induced obesity.

It is presumed that ghrelin may inhibit a food-induced insulin response, since ghrelin has an inhibitory effect on insulin secretion.

Researchers have concluded that a neuroendocrine network in the CNS that involves ghrelin, its hypothalamic target neurons, and the sympathetic nervous system are direct regulators of adipocyte energy metabolism. Researchers have hypothesized that the enzymatic deficiency of ghrelin deficient mice provides enough lipid storage capacity to manage low amounts of nutritional lipids that have been ingested while on a normal diet. It is determined that ghrelin-deficiency exhibits defective regulation of lipid-metabolizing enzymes, which impairs nutrient partitioning and efficient lipid deposition. However, it is assumed that protection against diet-induced obesity may partly result from the enzymatic capacity of ghrelin acting as a limiting factor for fat storage from circulating lipids.

=='''&lt;big&gt;Mechanisms&lt;/big&gt;'''==


Ghrelin is a peptide that promotes appetite by affecting the hypothalamic arcuate and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei which work in regulating the appetite.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;  The orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related protein neurons are stimulated while the anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin/cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript neurons are inhibited by ghrelin.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;


Inhibited by leptin and α-melanocyte stimulating hormone and activated by ghrelin and cannabinoids, hypothalamic AMPK mediates many appetite-regulating hormones.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; The CB1 receptor in the hypothalamus is a route found to increase food intake when accessed by cannabinoids.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;


A signaling cacade has been suggested such that ghrelin→endocannabinoid→CB1→AMPK→appetite.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;


An increased release of endocannabinoids, acting through CB1, is needed for ghrelin to stimulate AMPK and appetite.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; The presence of CB1 is also needed for the hypothalamic neurophysiological effects of ghrelin.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; The orexigenic and central AMPK-stimulatory effects of ghrelin are mediated through the necessary endogenous cannabinoid system.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

=='''&lt;big&gt;Disorders Related to Ghrelin&lt;/big&gt;'''==


Levels of circulating ghrelin are inversely correlated with positive energy balance, body mass index, body fat mass, adipocyte size, and leptin levels.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;


Anorexia nervosa patients exhibit high levels of ghrelin opposed to obese patients who have low levels of plasma ghrelin.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  It is thought that the fluctuations of circulating ghrelin levels may mirror physiological adaptation to changes in energy balance.  Treating obesity with a ghrelin antagonist seems like the right move because of the orexigenic and adipogenic attributes of ghrelin.  Even though  this seems logical it is not clear whether quenching ghrelin would have any positive effect on the already depressed ghrelin levels in obese patients.  Also, like in many body systems there would be counter mechanisms that would be activated in order to satisfy nutritional needs. Ghrelin also has a strong stimulatory effect on Growth Horomone (GH) secretion and an antagonist could drop off GH levels below functioning levels.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;


Obesity has been linked to the ghrelin gene having genetic variations.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  Baseline levels of ghrelin were more alike in pairs of monozygotic twins than in heterozygous pairs.  Also, the decrease in ghrelin concentration after periods of overfeeding showed the same trend.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Clinical uses for ghrelin can be fabricated once a better understanding of its stimuli and regulatory pathways for synthesis and release are known.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Ghrelin Overview'''

This article discusses the mechanism of the ghrelin-cannabinoid interaction. Both ghrelin and cannabinoids enhance the appetite by activating the hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase.  The study in this paper involved adult male WT mice and CB1-KO mice.  The study showed that the CB1 receptor is needed for ghrelin's appetite stimulating response. The cannabinoid content of the hypothalamus is increased by gherelin and this effect also involves CB1.  Input into the PVN is inhibited by ghrelin.  Although, a CB1 antagonist as well as inhibiting cannabinoid synthesis can be used to prevent this effect. Ghrelin's appetite-inducing effects are dependent on the interactions between ghrelin and the cannabinoid systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== VARPTR == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;address&amp;amp; = VARPTR({var|FN userFunction})
address&amp;amp; = @var&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VARPTR&lt;/b&gt;(var)&lt;/code&gt; returns the memory address where the first byte of the variable &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is located. You can use this value as a &amp;quot;pointer&amp;quot; to &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a local variable inside a local function, the value returned by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VARPTR&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; may be different each time you execute the function, and is not valid after the function exits. The syntax &lt;code&gt;@var&lt;/code&gt; is just a shorthand version of &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VARPTR&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VARPTR&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;b&gt;FN&lt;/b&gt; userFunction)&lt;/code&gt; is identical to the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;@FN&lt;/b&gt; userFunction&lt;/code&gt; function.

=== Example ===
You cannot use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VARPTR&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; with variables that use register storage, because such variables do not have addresses. See the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement and the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;REGISTER ON/OFF&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/code&gt;statements to learn how to prevent a variable from using register storage.

Because the &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; symbol has a special meaning when it appears after the &lt;code&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;LPRINT&lt;/code&gt; keyword, you cannot use the &lt;code&gt;@var &lt;/code&gt;syntax as the first item in a list of print items.

&lt;pre&gt;PRINT @myVar#&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;15&quot;&gt;'This does not work&lt;br&gt; (&amp;quot;@&amp;quot; is misinterpreted)
PRINT (@myVar#)&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;144&quot;&gt;'This works.
PRINT VARPTR(myVar#)&lt;spacer type=&quot;horizontal&quot; size=&quot;108&quot;&gt;'This works too.&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== VAL&amp;amp; == 
 
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;integerValue&amp;amp; = VAL&amp;amp;(string$)&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
This function is similar to the &lt;code&gt;VAL&lt;/code&gt; function, but it can only evaluate a string which represents an integer. The advantage of using &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VAL&amp;amp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is that it executes more quickly than &lt;code&gt;VAL&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can represent an integer in decimal, hex, octal or binary format. The absolute value of the represented integer must not exceed 4,294,967,295.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VAL&amp;amp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ignores leading spaces in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and it stops evaluating the string when it encounters a character that is not part of standard integer notation. Note that this means &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VAL&amp;amp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will stop evaluating the string when it encounters a decimal point or an &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; exponent indicator. That means that certain strings which represent integers will be evaluated differently by &lt;code&gt;VAL&lt;/code&gt; than by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VAL&amp;amp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the string &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;24.61E2&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; will be evaluated as 2461 by &lt;code&gt;VAL&lt;/code&gt;, but as 24 by &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VAL&amp;amp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== VAL == 
  
=== Syntax ===
&lt;pre&gt;numericValue = VAL(string$)&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Description ===
If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; contains the characters of a number in any of the standard FB formats (decimal, hex, octal or binary), &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns the number's value.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ignores leading spaces in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. When it finds a non-space character, it evaluates the remaining characters in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; until it encounters a character which is not part of the number. Thus, for example, the string &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;3245.6&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; would be evaluated as 3245.6, but the string &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;32W45.6&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; would be evaluated as 32. If the first non-space character in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can't be recognized as part of a number, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns zero. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;VAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; performs the opposite of functions such as &lt;code&gt;STR$&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;HEX$&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OCT$&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;BIN$&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UNS$&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Example ===
&lt;pre&gt;DATA &amp;quot;-3.2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1.4E2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;amp;4C1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;9+7&amp;quot;
FOR i = 1 TO 4
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;READ s$
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PRINT s$, VAL(s$)
NEXT

program output:
&lt;code&gt;-3.2 -3.2
1.4E2140
&amp;amp;4C1 1271
9+7 9&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Notes ===
If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;string$&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; represents an integer, consider using the &lt;code&gt;VAL&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; function, which is faster.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Comparison of adjectives==

*'''granda, plu granda, maxim granda''' big, bigger, biggest
*'''bela, plu bela, maxim bela''' beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful

As you can see from the above examples, in English there are two different systems for comparing adjectives. Ido has only one method of comparison which is equivalent to the English in the second example above. This means that instead of 'bigger' Ido says 'more big' ('''plu granda'''), instead of 'prettiest', 'most pretty' ('''maxim beleta''') and so on.

*'''Chinia es la maxim populoza naciono de la mondo.''' - China is the most populated nation of the world.

===Comparatives===
In Ido adjectives are compared by:
*'''plu . . . kam''' - more . . . than 
*'''min . . . kam''' - less . . . than 
*'''tam . . . kam''' - as . . . as 
*'''ne tam . . . kam''' - not so . . . as 
*'''maxim . . . de''' - most . . . of 
*'''minim . . . de''' - least . . . of 
*'''tre'''  - very

===Examples===
*'''El es PLU gracila KAM Elena.''' - She is more graceful than Elena.
*'''Me esas TAM richa KAM il.''' - I am as rich as he.
*'''Ol esas la MAXIM bela de omni.''' - It is the finest of all.
*'''Il esas TRE brava.''' - He is very brave.
*'''Me preferas ico KAM ito.''' - I prefer this to that.

= Sicilian Defence, Poisoned Pawn Variation =
The famous Poisoned Pawn Variation. Black accepts the pawn. This line after good results from Black, initially Fischer but later Kasparov has seen a decline in popularity of 6.Bg5.

The line was popularized by [[wikipedia:Bobby Fischer|Bobby Fischer]], who in playing this line said that he could grab a pawn, give his opponent three or four moves in development, and still win! Today the line is just as messy as it was in its heyday in the 1970s, but is now considered to be equal with best play. Today there have been lines analyzed up to twenty or thirty moves in depth, such as this one, the main one.

= Caro-Kann Defence:Classical Variation =
4. Nxe4 is an obvious recapture. Black has 3 main alternatives. The Classical Variation, 4...Bf5, usually sees the bishop controlling the light diagonal from g6. The Smyslov/Karpov variation delays the development of the light bishop, with Nd7, while Nf6 risks doubled pawns for an open file. None of the other alternatives have seen significant usage.

White can, and almost always does, stick to the main line, with Ng3, forcing the bishop back, but the ambitious Nc5, and the aggressive Burris Gambit have given white surprising success.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Software Tools==
To write and test Java, you will need to the appropriate tools. The two main tools you will need are the Java Software Development Kit (Java SDK or JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The JDK includes all the tools your computer will need to build and run Java programs. While a simple text editor could be good enough for writing Java code, the text editor cannot ''compile'' the code, or put the code together so that it can ''execute'', or run on a computer. An IDE uses the SDK to compile Java code and turn it into an executable program. A popular and widely-used IDE with many features is [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse].

==First Java Program==
When you first learn any computer programming language, one of the first things you may learn to do is write a ''Hello World'' program, a program that simply prints the phrase &quot;Hello, world!&quot; on your computer screen. Create a new file titled &quot;HelloWorld.java&quot; using an IDE and type the following code in the file:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
public class HelloWorld {
     public void main(String args[]) {
          System.out.println(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
     }
}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Now save this file and compile it using your IDE, then execute the program.  This program should print the following message on your screen:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
Hello, world!
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Congratulations! You've just written your first Java program. Later sections of this book will explain what these words mean, how to write longer and more complex programs, and how to understand code that is already written.

__NOTOC__

==Uses, Limitations, and Options==

===Uses===
----
'''FancyH2''' is Intended to replace the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;H2&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' heading with a more colourful alternative.

This can be used instead of the standard '''&lt;nowiki&gt;==Heading==&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''.

Because it still uses that tag, it will be correctly displayed in the automatically generated Table of Contents, (TOC).

Note:   To remove the &lt;nowiki&gt;TOC&lt;/nowiki&gt; for the page just make the entry &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt;.


This template is called for use with:

{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{fancyh2|This is the First Bit | ; this is the second bit...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}


It does this:


{{fancyh2|This is the First Bit | ; this is the second bit...}}



===Limitations===
----
There are limited formats in this version.

Do not attempt to use this template for an H3 tag by simply reducing the font size since it will still display in the TOC as an H2.

Use template '''FancyH3''' for that instead.


===Options===
----
;ff:   font family, (default, Lucida Handwriting)
;fw:   font weight, (default, bold)
;fc:   font color, (default, maroon)
;hfs:  heading font size, the first part of the heading, (default, 22pt)
;tfs:  tails font size, the second part of the heading, (default, 50% of that above)

;bgc:  text background color, (default, transparent)
;ta:   text alignment, (default, left)
;bb:   bottom border, the underline, (default, 10px solid lightsalmon)
;p:    padding, (default, 5px 5px 0 5px, for top, right, bottom, and left respectively)

===Limitations===
----

Consider making a new one for h4 instead. See also fancyh2.

==Percentages==
Percentages are another way of representing rational numbers. Rational numbers can be represented as decimals, fractions or percentages.

Percent, when you actually break the word apart, consists of two words: per and cent. Per is a small but extremly powerful word. It means &quot;to divide&quot;. Cent is a Latin word for 100. Percent, then, means &quot;divide by 100&quot;.

To convert from a fraction to a percentage, we simply multiply the fraction by 100. For example, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4} = (\frac{1}{4} \times 100)% = 25%\,&lt;/math&gt;.

To convert from a decimal to a percentage, we first convert the decimal into a fraction, and then proceed with the approach outlined above. For example, &lt;math&gt;0.15 = \frac{15}{100} = (\frac{15}{100} \times 100)% = 15%\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The following three numbers represent 3 different ways to think about the average value of your set.  

'''Mean''' - This is what we usually think of as the &quot;average&quot; of a data set.  The mean can be found by summing all the values in the data set and dividing by the size of the data set (that is number of elements in the set). In mathematical notation,

&lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i) \div n = (1/n) * (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_n) &lt;/math&gt;, 
where &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the arithmetic mean,  and n is the number of elements in the data set. All values of x together constitute the ''sample space'' for the data set.

''For example'': Suppose {{nowrap|1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}} is our data set then the sum is {{nowrap|1= 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 30}} and there are 6 elements in the data set, so the mean is {{nowrap|1= 30/6 = 5}}.

The mean, while a very useful statistic, has its flaws. Notably, its value may be heavily influenced by ''outliers'' - numbers in a data set which are significantly higher or lower than the majority of the data. It is often preferable to use the median instead to describe such data sets.

'''Median''' - This is the middle of our data set.  To find the median you must first put your data values in numerical order (say, from smallest to largest). If you have an odd number of elements in your data set there will be exactly one number in the middle, this number is the median.  If you have an even number of elements in your data set then the median is the average of the ''middle two'' numbers.
et
''For example.'' If our data set was {{nowrap|2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 22}} is our data s data set.  Since it has an even number of elements, we have to take the mean of the middle two, in this case 6 and 7, so the median is 6.5.

'''Mode''' - Mode refers to how many times a number or numbers occur in a data set. Since mean, median, and mode often are confused with each other, an easy way to remember mode is 'most often'. The first two letters in mode are 'm' and 'o', imagine this stands for 'most often' to help  you remember.  In the case that two or more different values are tied for the most number of repeats then that data set is said to have multiple modes. If your asked to find the mode of a data set with multiple modes, then all of the modes should be listed. If no element of the data repeats, then there is no mode. 

''For example''. Suppose {{nowrap|1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 7}} is our data set, then the mode would be both 2 and 5.  They both occur three times and three is the maximum number of repeats in our data set. 

The following quantity tell us how spread out our data set is.

'''Range''' - The difference between the largest and smallest numbers in our data set.  Notice this means the range is ''never'' negative.


===Examples===

'''Mean''' 

Let's look at the following data set:

Data Values: 10, 13, 4, 7, 9               so n = 5

Now add the values together: 

10 + 13 + 4 + 7 + 9 = 43

    43 / 5 = 8.6

''Mean = 8.6''

----

'''Median'''

&lt;u&gt;Case 1:&lt;/u&gt;

Data Values: 10, 13, 4, 7, 8               so n = 5

Numerical Order: 4, 7, '''8''', 13, 10      

Since 8 is the middle number, 

''Median = 8''

&lt;u&gt;Case 2:&lt;/u&gt;

Data Values: 10, 13, 4, 7, 8, 10           so n = 6

Numerical Order: 4, 7, '''8''', '''10''', 10, 13 

Middle Numbers: 8 and 10

Find Mean: 8 + 10 = 18

           18 / 2 = 9
''Median = 9''

----

'''Mode'''

Data Values: 10, 13, 4, 7, 8, 10

10 is in the data set twice.

''Mode = 10''

Data Values: 4, 9, 13, 18, 4, 2, 9, 4, 13, 8, 9

4 and 9 both have three data values.

''Mode = 4, 9''

----

'''Range'''

Data Values: 10, 13, 4, 7, 8

Numerical Order: 4, 7, 8, 10, 13

Difference of last and first: 13 - 4 = 9

''Range = 9''


===Practice Problems===
Find the mean, median, mode, and range of the following data sets:

1.) 5, 8, 12, 4, 8, 9, 11, 2

2.) 24, 26, 37, 24, 16, 44, 26, 34, 24  

3.) 15, 48, 89, 74, 25, 36, 57, 51, 17, 22

4.) 2, 6, 8, 7, 8, 2, 2, 9, 10

===Answers===
1.) Mean = 7.375   Median = 8   Mode = 8      Range = 10

2.) Mean = 28.33   Median = 26  Mode = 24     Range = 28

3.) Mean = 43.4    Median = 42  Mode = None   Range = 74

4.) Mean = 6       Median = 7   Mode = 2      Range = 8</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Setting the scene is necessary before a film shoot. It is also what one does in the theater for a play, a drama. Even in the writing of the film script or of the play one has to set the scene.

Here, in this place, we are setting the scene for the Wikibook you are reading. We imagine that you, the reader, exist. We imagine (and hope) that there will be many of you. We will never meet, except through this Wikibook.

==Reader==
The book is intended for all who are interested in the ways in which the society develops in a world of computers.
To see where we are today, we need to know where we come from.

The book is in English. It would be nice if other language versions of it were to appear.

There are 3 levels of intended reader: 

*the 12 to 16 age group (junior and senior high school)
*the 17 to 21 age group (college)
*the 22+ age group (all the rest of us)

What does this mean? Well! There are exercises/questions in the book which might prove very challenging for the college group, for example. 
And the exercises/questions are not targeted at any specific group. Nor is level of difficulty given. Real life is like that. Here is a simple example
of an exercise which some questions:

* Why did [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay eBay] buy [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paypal PayPal]?
* Why did eBay then buy [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype Skype]?
* What do you think eBay ought to buy next?

Where are the answers? Good question. Perhaps they ought to go into a separate Wikibook?
To find answers one must search. One must ask one's own questions.

==iStuff==
Let us be hip in late 2008?
We have [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook iBook], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone iPhone], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod iPod]... There is no reason for us to limit ourselves to particular commercial branding terms.

In the Internet society we expect to see all sorts of iStuff&lt;ref&gt;[http://myluckey.blogspot.com/2008/05/idump.html iStuff]&lt;/ref&gt;! We can think of the „i-“ in iStuff to stand for „Individual“, „Internet“, „Interactive“, „Interesting“,...

The topic seems to be of significant widespread use to deserve a [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computers_%26_Society/Identity_%26_Privacy/iStuff module of its own] in this (wik)iBook.

'''Cookies &amp; Milk''' is a common snack in Canada, especially Ontario.  Many versions are made, varying from the most basic, simply dipping a cookie in milk, to our recipe for one of the more complicated and messy versions. 

==Ingredients==
* Cookies - preferably chocolate chip, but others can be used
* Milk - any will do
* A glass - diameter must be equal to or larger than that of the cookie

==Procedure==
# Drop the cookies into the glass, filling it up to roughly 3/4 of the glass. You can fill it more if you desire, but usually about 4 - 6 cookies is good.
# Fill the cookie-filled glass with milk until the milk covers the top cookie.
# Wait a couple of minutes for the cookies to absorb the milk and become soft. You can decide how soft you want them
# Drink milk and cookies from glass.

==Variations==
* Use chocolate milk for a more chocolatey taste
* Use oatmeal cookies if you want a healthier snack
* For those who suffer from a lactose intolerance or other milk allergy, soy milk can be used as an alternative, less strong option.

We take many things for granted. It is natural and normal. But sometimes we need to examine some of the things we take for granted. In this book on ''Computers &amp; Society'' we will work together to try to make sense of the Internet world in which we live. 
We do it together precisely because in this Internet world everything is obviously connected. Physically, you the reader may be located on the other side of the planet (and maybe even you are on some orbital space platform above). But if you are connected you will probably have friends also connected and maybe also physically very far away. This awareness of the other, physically distant but present, brings her or him to mind and (s)he becomes again an intimate part of your society.

When you are reading a novel do you not forget yourself for a moment and become part of the story? Does it not seem that the characters you meet appear to take on real personality, a sort of life of their own? And do you not become involved? Do you not lose yourself, begin to care about the other, the one who is speaking, acting, living in the book? Let us imagine that you are a fan of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter Harry Potter]? Do you remember how you felt as the story progressed?

We may transfer this experience of the novel to the other modes of contemporary life, the society in which we move, even if at a distance. Do you not become involved in the movie you watch? In the music your hear? In the theater where the play, the ballet, the performance entrances you? Are not all these doorways or gateways into another world, another society, even if only for a short period of time? Afterwards, maybe much later, do you not remember the experience of going through that doorway? Do you not remember, being there? Is it not a part of you now?

Everything has a beginning. And sometimes we remember that the same everything has an ending. Perhaps we cannot yet imagine what the ending of the Internet world will look like? Will we see the end of the Oil world first? We are going to look at our world, our society through the eyes of the Internet world. We are going to put ourselves at the center of the ''Digital Society'' with its own ''Digital Culture'' and we are going to ask ourselves how did we get here and where are we going?

In our Internet galaxy we are always finding new ideas, new phrases, new words, turning all the time. That is the nature of our world. If we say that we are in the Digital Society then we can always check to see if the phrase captures the idea world-wide. It is certainly the case that there is the widespread idea of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide Digital Divide], highlighted by Manuel Castells in his 9th Chapter &quot;The Digital Divide in a Global Perspective&quot;, p.247-274 of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet_Galaxy The Internet Galaxy], published in 2001.

But, let us take time to imagine, to be creative, to explore, to invent. Let us play? Let us grab the word &quot;Divide&quot;. How can we use it, play with it? What ideas come to mind? Surely you will remember jokes where &quot;dividing up&quot; is the key idea? There are sports, such as football in the UK, where football teams are placed into divisions. And isn't the same idea used in war? If we have &quot;Divide&quot; then we might ask ourselves what is its opposite? Is it &quot;Join&quot; or &quot;Unite&quot; or &quot;Get together&quot;? Doesn't this give us another idea of the &quot;Digital Join&quot;? Could we use it to describe the interconnecting of networks that had never been connected before? How can we check to see if this little l''anguage game'' is interesting? Well, that is where the Internet Society fits in. We are online, connected. Go search!

In the rest of this chapter &quot;Learning how to ask questions&quot; we are going to look at some very famous questions that are always asked.  We are going to ask ourselves if the question could be re-phrased. Maybe we will be challenged to ask ourselves when was the first time we heard the question. Or even, we will try to remember where we were or how old we were when we heard the question for the first time? If we go down that route we may find that we were taught the question in elementary school or in Sunday school, or at home. Then we might suppose that the question is framed in the way it is, precisely in order to get the &quot;right answer&quot;. The first major question we look at here may seem to be trivial. It is a &quot;Who&quot; question like „Who is your father?“ or „Who is your mother?“ or „Who is the President of the United States?“ Let's take a look at this little question and answer game?

==='''Q.''' ''Who made the world?''===

Did you think of an answer? Write it down somewhere. On a piece of paper maybe. Now let us ask a question about this sort of question?  The first word in the question is the &quot;Who&quot; word. [http://bit.ly/So-The_Spear-Danes_in_days_gone_by So]! We say that this sort of question is a Who-question. And we say that the answer expected is a Who-answer. The usual answer is the name of a person. Many people, when asked this question, will automatically respond with the answer &quot;God&quot;.

[[Image:2189209918_869e585e77_o.jpg|thumb|400px|right|So. The Spear-Danes in days gone by]]

==='''Q.''' ''How did the world come into being?''===

There are exactly 6 sorts of questions that we might want to begin with. Each has a different question word. We have already met the Who-word. The other question words are &quot;What&quot;, &quot;Where&quot;, &quot;When&quot;, &quot;How&quot;, and &quot;Why&quot;. Instead of asking the Who-question: Who made the world?, we can try the How-question: How did the world come into being? Have you got an answer? Write it down. Many people, when asked the question in this form, will answer immediately [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang &quot;The Big Bang&quot;]. To learn more about this answer, one can click on the link to view the article in Wikipedia.

Let us take &quot;the world&quot; as the focus for all our questions. And let us ask questions about its beginning, where we use each of the question words in turn:

*'''Who?''' Who made the world?
*'''What?''' What is the world made of?
*'''Where?''' Where exactly is the world?
*'''When?''' When did the world come into existence?
*'''How?''' How did the world come into existence?
*'''Why?''' Why did the world come into existence?

==='''Q.''' ''How did the World Wide Web come into being?''===

Instead of asking questions about the world, let us focus on questions about &quot;Computers &amp; Society&quot;?
One of the most important aspects of our world today is the existence of the Internet.
So! Questions about the Internet are important. We need to be able to ask the right sorts of question.
We might try a Who-question:

*Who made the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet Internet]?

The answer to this seems to be very difficult. Why? Because there were many people and organizations involved.
It might take a long long time to get the answer. A similar sort of question is:

*How did the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web World Wide Web] come into being?

What might a simple answer to this question look like? We know what an encyclopedic answer looks like. Click on the links to see.

==='''Q.''' ''Where do the names of the days of the week come from?''===
{{subject|Days of the week}}
To gain experience in learning how to ask questions, it is usually a good idea to start with those everyday things that one already knows well.  Why not start with the days of the week? There are 7 of them. Let us put them in their natural order:

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday Sunday]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday Monday]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuesday Tuesday]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wednesday Wednesday]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday Thursday]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday Friday]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday Saturday]

You may ask why is this order called natural? That is a very good question. And the obvious answer is that Sunday is named after the Sun. It is really Sun-day. You probably can guess that Monday is named after the Moon. It is really Moon-day.
Let us skip over Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. These ''seem'' to have very particular sources, quite different from Sun and Moon. Saturday is Saturn-day. But if you have clicked on the links above you will already know the answers.

*Let us try something a little bit more challenging? There are 7 days of the week. Not 6! Not 8! So, it is worth asking why there are 7 days? Try this now for yourself. Do not search the Internet. Do you not look up the answer in a book. Do not ask a friend. See if you can imagine can it came into being from the very beginning. Write you best guess down. Then go and check to see if you are right?

====Challenge—Months of the Year====
{{subject|Months of the year}}
{{subject|Language game}}
{{subject|Digital re-discovery of culture game}}
From &quot;Days of the week&quot; to &quot;Months of the year&quot; is an obvious next step. Here are the months of the year, listed in the usual order. Again, like the days of the week we work backwards. We start with the largest common suffix and split it off to see what we get.

In this simple game we use pattern matching. What is the same and what is different? In matching, we either begin at the front and try to find the largest pattern in common. Such a pattern is called a &lt;u&gt;prefix&lt;/u&gt;. Alternatively, we can start at the end and proceed in the same way. The largest common pattern found in this way is called a &lt;u&gt;suffix&lt;/u&gt;. For convenience the suffix is marked in the table shown. Such matching lies at the very center of Computing.
{{subject|pattern matching}} {{subject|Computing}}

What other sort of question and answer game would you like to play? In other words what interesting questions can you ask? To play this game, you might choose a friend, someone with whom you are connected. This is a lesson in self-discovery. When you have finished playing you may want to take a look at some possible questions and answers in the back of this book?

====Challenge—Seasons of the Year====
{{subject|Seasons of the year}}
In this language game we will take two lists for the seasons:
*Spring
*Summer
*Fall
*Winter
and
*Spring
*Summer
*Autumn
*Winter
Perhaps you can make up three types of questions about the seasons. The first type will be &quot;easy&quot;. The second type will be &quot;difficult&quot;. And the third type will be &quot;surprising&quot;?  Have a go!

====Challenge—Question Words====
{{subject|question words}}
Did you ever stop to think that of the 6 usual question words in English, 
who, what, where, when, how, why, there is an &quot;odd man out&quot; question word.
Which one is it?

And now that we have used „Which“ to ask a question why don't we include in our list to make 7?
And if we do, where in the list will we put it?

Maybe there is yet another question word we have missed?

==='''Q. ''What has Copernicus and Galileo contributed to Computers and Society?'''''===
In our world of computers, the technology is constantly changing and surprising us. 
And with the changing technology there is an ever-expanding, surprising, flourishing of applications.
The combination of 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus Copernicus] 
and 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei Galileo] 
with Computers and Society is an obvious anachronism.
The juxtaposition is deliberate.
Therefore we may infer that there is an important message to be decoded.

Briefly, Copernicus had an idea (which was not original really) that the Earth moved.
Specifically, the Earth moved around the Sun.
The idea is crazy, of course, or so it would appear.
Anyone today can tell you that the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
Our language (and not only English) embodies and (en)codifies this reality. 
We speak of sunrise and sunset.

Copernicus idea was just a theory. How could it be verified in practice?
Practice means application and application requires machinery or technology.
Galileo provided the technology. What exactly did he do, this Galileo person?
What sort of technology did he use? And to what purpose? And why was he absolutely right?

====The Structure of Scientific Revolutions====
Once upon a time, there was a man, whose name was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Samuel_Kuhn Thomas S. Kuhn].
Perhaps he is most renowned for the book  entitled [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions „The Structure of Scientific Revolutions“]?

Of course, the title owes much to the Copernican Revolution (about which he wrote in 1957).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Consider the compound sentence, 
“In the Ptolemaic system planets revolve about the earth; 
in the Copernican they revolve about the sun.”
Strictly construed, that sentence is incoherent.
The first occurrence of ‘planet’ is Ptolemaic,
the second Copernican, and the two attach to nature differently.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
What are Scientific Revolutions? The Road since Structure. Thomas S. Kuhn, p.15. The University of Chicago Press, 2000.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What is the point? Well, if people can (still) be fooled by what they see and take for granted. And if the language itself encodes the deception
then how can we know and understand and speak about the revolution we are undergoing right now?

What revolution you ask? Why... the revolution that goes by the name of... That thing which is happening to us all and which we want to talk about under the title of „Computers &amp; Society“.

So! The real question we need to ask is this? How can we use technology (just like Galileo did) to show that there is indeed a real earth-shattering revolution happening now?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stuff is a great word. Maybe you thought we were going to look at learning how to read ''books''? After all, you need to be able to read, before you can read books, and before you can read this stuff here in the Wikibook?

Well, we are going to look at the problem of reading. It turns out that reading is very difficult in many cases, just as asking questions can be very difficult. You don't believe it?

I remember the shock of picking up a book called [http://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Painting-Lessons-Masters/dp/0810955768 &quot;How to read a painting&quot;]. It is a very famous book. You can look at its cover now if you want to. I used to think that one ''looked at'' paintings. I never imagined that one could also ''read'' paintings. It was a really big surprise for me.

Learning to read paintings helps one a lot when trying to read books. For example, when you read &quot;I remember the shock of picking up a book called...&quot; you are thinking &quot;Aha! The author of this Wikibook remembers the shock of picking up a book called...&quot;. Aren't you? Well, it is true that I am an author writing this. But a Wikibook may have many authors. And you may not be able to say which author, if any, was the one who picked up a book called...

So! Reading a Wikibook requires careful thought. That is exactly why we began this book with learning how to ask questions. And the &quot;we&quot; here is ambiguously fruitful in the sense that &quot;we&quot; might be &quot;I the author&quot; and &quot;you the reader&quot;, or it might be &quot;we the authors&quot;, or it might be ...

===How to read a proverb?===
Let us begin with a well-known proverb. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;You can take a horse to water,&lt;br&gt;
but you can't make him drink.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is called a proverb because it is an &quot;old saying&quot;. It must be an old saying because there is a horse in it!
If there is a horse in it, then it probably occurs in many different cultures where horses were/are important.
It is also important because of the water. Water is essential to life. Do you think the horse knows this?

Notice the horse and the &quot;him&quot;. If it were a mare then the &quot;him&quot; would be a &quot;her&quot;. Do you think that mares were brought to water?
Notice the horse is brought to water, not the water is brought to the horse. That is important.
It shows just how old the saying is! 
You are probably wondering why the him-horse of the proverb is not called a stallion?
There is a very good reason. It has to do with the usual way we use (any) natural language.
Stallion and mare are too specific. Animal is too general. Horse is just right.
Just in case one does not know what a horse looks like, here is a foto.
[[Image:Horse_grazing_beside_river_in_Koprivshitsa%2C_Bulgaria.jpg |thumb|240px|right|horse grazing beside river]]

In the foto we can see that there is water beside the horse. It is a river. It is often the case that the horse is brought to a river to drink water.
So! Is that all there is to this proverb? Has everything been read or said?

===How to read a painting?===
{{subject|How to read}} {{subject|How to read a painting}} {{subject|How to read a book}}
Let us look at the painting [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchus_and_Ariadne Bacchus and Ariadne] which is used as the cover for that book &quot;How to read a painting&quot;. We have chosen the Wikipedia article as our resource.

The first thing we want to focus on is the asking of questions. We will ignore obvious questions like &quot;Who is Bacchus?&quot; and &quot;Who is Adriadne?&quot; We will also ignore questions like &quot;Why are most of them half naked? It must be very hot there?&quot;

We look carefully, just like reading. Then we spot something really strange. 8 stars in the blue sky! What's this you ask?

====Reading is just like decoding====
{{subject|reading}} {{subject|decoding}} {{subject|writing}} {{subject|encoding}}
There is a subtitle to the book &quot;How to read a painting&quot;. It is &quot;Decoding, Understanding and Enjoying the Old Masters&quot;.
Reading and decoding are basically the same process. You are probably asking yourself the question: &quot;Then is writing basically the same as encoding?&quot;

===How to read a digiFoto?===
{{subject|How to read}} {{subject|How to read a photograph}} {{subject|How to read a digital photograph}} {{subject|How to read a digiFoto}}
The first thing to notice is that the image [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchus_and_Ariadne Bacchus and Ariadne] is not the painting. The image is a digital photograph, which we abbreviate to digiFoto. The painting exists uniquely in the National Gallery, London, UK. Someone has photographed it. The original photograph was probably on film. It was not a digital photograph. Perhaps it has been photographed recently, this time using a digital camera? 

But, by definition, if we find an image on the Internet we shall always think of it as a digital image. The word we will use for such a digital image is &quot;'''digiFoto'''&quot;. Why? Because it looks nice and modern and strange and memorable. Isn't it fun to be creative in this way?

[[Image:„Blue_bottle_with_yellow_cup_on_red_table“.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Still Life]]

Now let us look at the digiFoto &quot;Still Life&quot; shown above. How are we to read this?


===Skimming===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
«A new study overturns the common assumption that the ‘Google Generation' – youngsters born or brought up in the Internet age – is the most web-literate. The first ever virtual longitudinal study carried out by the CIBER research team at University College London claims that, although young people demonstrate an apparent ease and familiarity with computers, they rely heavily on search engines, view rather than read and do not possess the critical and analytical skills to assess the information that they find on the web.»&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/news/2008/pressrelease20080116.html British Library press release] 16 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report referred to above is entitled “Information behaviour of the researcher of the future”&lt;ref&gt;The report [http://bit.ly/BritishLibraryJISC Information behaviour of the researcher of the future], Peter Williams and Ian Rowlands, is available in pdf format.&lt;/ref&gt; and in our opinion it may be read in a more positive light, one that supports Marshall McLuhan's argument that there is a new generation coming which will not be bound by the old Renaissance culture of the printed book.

John Naughton's article in The Observer, “Thanks, Gutenberg - but we're too pressed for time to read”, gives a very precise summary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
«The findings describe 'a new form of information-seeking behaviour' characterised as being 'horizontal, bouncing, checking and viewing in nature. Users are promiscuous, diverse and volatile.' 'Horizontal' information-seeking means 'a form of skimming activity, where people view just one or two pages from an academic site then &quot;bounce&quot; out, perhaps never to return.' The average times users spend on e-book and e-journal sites are very short: typically four and eight minutes respectively.»&lt;ref&gt;John Naughton, &quot;[http://bit.ly/NaughtonSkimmingWikipedia “Thanks, Gutenberg - but we're too pressed for time to read”], January 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is in this passage that the word “skimming” occurs.

=== Browsing ===
Browsing is a word just like skimming in the sense that...
Well! Browsing is a kind of reading. One might browse through a book.
One might might browse in a library. Today, in the Age of Internet, one browses the Web.
In order to browse one needs a browser. The story of the Browser is another way of talking
about the story of the Internet or the story of the World Wide Web.
Later we will look at each browser in turn. For now, here is a short list&lt;ref&gt;Not only is it a short list but also we try to use just one word. So! The Internet Explorer (IE) becomes simply Explorer and Mozilla Firefox become just Firefox.&lt;/ref&gt; (in alphabetical order):
* Chrome
* Explorer
* Firefox
* Opera
* Safari

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since the publication of [[w:Manuel_Castells|Manuel Castells']] book [[w:The_Internet_Galaxy|The Internet Galaxy]] in 2001, there have been enormous changes to the Society.

In this chapter we will look specifically that those changes which go by the name [[w:Social_web|Social Web]].

In 2001, Castells opposed &quot;Virtual Communities&quot; to the &quot;Network Society&quot; (p.116). After a chapter of detailed analysis he concludes that perhaps that &quot;individuals are in fact reconstructing the pattern of social interaction [...] to create a new form of society: the network society.&quot; (p.133).

We need to look for evidence to see if in fact there is a reconstruction of social interaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">According to a fundamental principle that &quot;Everything is mediated through language&quot; we can infer 
the derived and more precise principle that &quot;Everything computable is mediated through programming language&quot;. Let us canonize these two principles as axioms:
*Axiom 1: Everything is mediated through language.
*Axiom 2: Everything computable is mediated through programming language.
We may regard them as self-evident truths. But if you are worried about such canonization then you ought to delve further and seek evidence and proof. In other words, do '''not''' believe in them unless you feel very sure that they are worth taking as foundation for further work. How might we find such evidence?

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_%28computer_science%29 Ontology] is considered to be about &quot;that which exists&quot;. Do not be surprised to find that many people have very different views on what that means exactly. For example, one often reads about the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn Unicorn] (a kind of one-horned animal). Some people say that it is non-existent. It is just a figment of the imagination. Other people say that it exists, precisely because we have the language to talk about it. In this book we will take the latter view that if we can talk about it in a precise way then for all practical purposes the Unicorn is with us. One might imagine a future where we might be able to bring the Unicorn into actual physical existence. But that is futuristic.

One thing we can be more or less certain about is that in the Western Tradition of Philosophy, the Father of Ontology was Aristotle.

===OWL—the Semantic Web Ontology Language===

There are three variants of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language OWL]:
* OWL-Lite
* OWL-DL, where the DL stands for description logic
* OWL-Full
We recommend OWL-DL in this course.

====OWL-DL====

The most important thing to do is to get started as soon as possible in describing our world in terms of OWL-DL.
What world is that you might say? Well, it is the world of Computers &amp; Society.

How will we describe the Unicorn? Is it not (like) a horse with one horn? We introduce two concepts: '''horse''' and '''horn'''. Using these we might describe the unicorn as
* Unicorn isa Horse
* Unicorn hasThing Horn

*For practical work on Semantic Web Ontology (OWL) we recommend the [http://protege.stanford.edu/overview/protege-owl.html Protégé Editor] from Stanford.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some of the things we will want to look at are:

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_passport biometric passport]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoubleClick DoubleClick]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phorm Phorm]
* ...

And precisely on this date of looking (July 31, 2008) we have discovered the existence of [http://bit.ly/bit-lyLaunch bit.ly]
which is a smart URL shortener launched July 8. The discovery is made through the [http://bit.ly/linkCompacter TechnologyGuardian article] „Pointing the internet in a new direction“ by Wendy M Grossman.

Given the nature of this Wikibook it seemed reasonable to incorporate the bit.ly URL shortener immediately to see just how it works. And so it is used here for the first time. A comment to that effect has been posted to [http://bit.ly/MyComment Betaworks].

However, there is one exception to this use of bit.ly. URLs internal to the Wikiworld will be used in full in order that they adhere to the community guidelines.

=Technologies of Control=
There are 3 types of technologies postulated by Manuel Castells (2001), in his seminal work  „The Internet Galaxy“ p.171:
* technologies of identification
* technologies of surveillance
* technologies of investigation

==Technologies of Identification==
Castells (2001) cites 3 things which are used in the technologies of identification:
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password passwords]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie cookies]
* authentication procedures

The last item seems to be a catch-all. How about we try and expand on it now for 2008?

===MyFlickr Authentication Procedure===
Let us pick an „authentication procedure“ currently available and well-documented online?
Here is one from the blog of [http://bit.ly/36hCGd „MyFlickr.org“]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;big&gt;«&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
1. The user visits user.myflickr.org, which presents a start button&lt;/br&gt;

2. When the user clicks the start button, user.myflickr.org replies with a redirect to service.myflickr.org/?next=user.myflickr.org&lt;/br&gt;

3. The user gets the page at service.myflickr.org which saves user.myflickr.org in a cookie in the browser and redirect to Flickr.com to authenticate with the MyFlickr application&lt;/br&gt;

4. The user's browser saves the cookie and goes to Flickr.com where he can decide to authenticate with MyFlickr.&lt;/br&gt;

5. If the user accepts MyFlickr to get permission to the user's photos, Flickr redirects the user to a URL which is configured in MyFlickr's API preferences together with a &quot;frob&quot;. The Frob is a string that MyFlickr must use to get the user's security token.&lt;/br&gt;

6. The User's browser goes to service.myflickr.org. Now with the frob from Flickr in the request URL, and hopefully with a cookie with the address of the album he is trying to authenticate with. (As created in step 3)&lt;/br&gt;

7. If the server at service.myflickr.org gets the cookie, it can redirect the user together with the frob to the authenticating server, otherwise the server has to ask the user to fill in a form and provide this information again. This is where Flickr.com has severe limitations in the API. (see below)&lt;/br&gt;

8. The user's browser gets redirected back to the domain he tried to claim or authenticate with, together with a frob in the address.&lt;/br&gt;

9. When MyFlickr at the proper address gets the user back with the frob, it sends the frob back to flickr and should get the user's security token back. The security token can finally together with MyFlickr's secret keys be used to access the user's photos.

10. The user configures his site which goes live immediately!&lt;/br&gt;

It's a complex procedure with four redirects, but it looks simple to the user. So nothing can possibly go wrong! ;)
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;big&gt;»&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

[http://bit.ly/MyFlickrBlog from MyFlickr blog]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Full details of all related issues (updates, ...) are at [http://bit.ly/MyFlickr MyFlickr].

Of particular importance is the (unfinished) [http://bit.ly/MyFlickr Privacy Policy]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;big&gt;«&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
The MyFlickr server you use to host your photos will get access to your private photos, but you can revoke this access at any time from your Flickr account. The MyFlickr service never access your photos, and will not display photos that you don't explicitly publish. MyFlickr only access information about your photos, and gives
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;big&gt;»&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And, yes! The last sentence is unfinished in the original text. Such unfinished business is potentially alarming, especially when it occurs in the Privacy Policy.

===MyFlickr Authentication Procedure Experiment===
It is not often one has the opportunity to experiment with both an „authentication procedure“ 
and a „privacy policy“ in the one application domain. How shall we go about setting up such an experiment?

We will follow the instructions precisely as given on the [http://bit.ly/MyFlickr MyFlickr home page]:

* “All you need is a Flickr account with some photos”

So! Let us do it!

* Step 1: Create a Yahoo! ID such as mihal.orela@yahoo.com

* Step 2: Create a (free) Flickr account for [http://www.flickr.com/photos/29196775@N05/ Mihal Orela]

* Step 3: Claim the URL http://mihalorela.myflickr.org/

* Step 4: Done! So! The first result shows [http://mihalorela.myflickr.org/ Nebeto]

It is strongly recommended that one carry out this experiment for oneself.
At each stage of the process, a (dated) screen shot ought to be captured and saved
for further analysis.

==Technologies of Surveillance==
According to Manuel Castells surveillance technologies, although different in kind from identification technologies, rely on the latter
“to be able to locate the individual user” („The Internet Galaxy“ p.171-2). 

* intercept messages
* place markers that allow tracking of communication flows from a specific computer location,
* monitor machine activity around the clock

In the article on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_surveillance Computer surveillance] the concept of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_sniffer packet sniffer] is introduced. Outside of the immediate computer technology world the concept of a sniffer would apply to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_dog dog] or a certain kind of &quot;wine&quot; glass called a brandy sniffer. One sniffs, that is uses the nose (and hence relys on the sense of smell) to investigate, to find out what is there.

==Technologies of Investigation==
Such technologies “refer to the building of databases from the results of both surveillance and storage
of routinely recorded information” (Manuel Castells,  „The Internet Galaxy“ p.172). Here, Castells cites [http://bit.ly/SimsonGarfinkel Simson Garfinkel], [http://bit.ly/DatabaseNation „Database Nation“], Sebastopol, CA:O'Reilly, 2000.

Given that “data are collected in digital form” then “all the information items contained in the database can be aggregated,
disaggregated, combined, and identified according to purpose and legal capacity” (ibid. p.172). Today, we sum up all these processes with
one succinct phrase:

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining data mining]

===Data Mining===
In a business context “[http://bit.ly/DataMining1 data mining] (sometimes called data or knowledge discovery) is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information - information that can be used to increase revenue, cuts costs, or both.” Evidently, there is nothing that restricts data mining to the business world.

One of the key concepts that one might associate with data mining is that of profiling. A simple search on the latter will throw up some interesting insights. For example, the word profiling may be used to describe the action of  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_analysis performance analysis] in software engineering and, moreover, a profiler “is a performance analysis tool that measures the behavior of a program as it runs, particularly the frequency and duration of function calls”.  Let us substitute “behavior of a user” in the latter and see how it reads?

A classical case of profiling is used by Castell's in connection with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoubleClick DoubleClick] in November 1999 (p.174-5).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
«
...Double Click bought Abacus, a database of names, addresses, and information
concerning the shopping patterns of 90 million households in the US. 
Using this database, Double Click created profiles linking individual's real names
and addresses with their on-line and off-line shopping.
»
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He cites the article [http://bit.ly/TheErodedSelf „The Eroded Self“] by Jeffrey Rosen in the New York Times Sunday Magazine, published April 30, 2000.

Here is the [http://bit.ly/AbacusDirectPrivacyPolicy Privacy Policy] of [http://bit.ly/AbacusDirect Abacus Direct] which gives insight into just how customer data may be used.

===Privacy Protection===
Can one really protect one's privacy on the net? In 2001, before [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks '''9/11'''], Castell's gave a list of 4 websites providing technological resources to protect privacy (p.187):

* cnetdownload.com
* junkbusters.com
* silentsurf.com
* anonymizer.com

It is seven years since the list was published. We need to know if these web addresses are still in use and if so that they refer to the same (original) entities. Let us take a look at each in turn.

====Website address checking====

1. cnetdownload.com —  still exists  (Михал Орела 06:30, 5 August 2008 (UTC)) –– note the signature and date stamp! This is normally used for the ''date of last access'' to a web page and is to be highly recommended in serious scholarly work in journalism, academia, government, and so on. In this book, it is used especially for website existence checking. The name cnetdownload.com resolves into [http://bit.ly/CnetDownload_com http://www.download.com/Mac/]

Some interesting observations can be made. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_(web_browser) Opera] browser was chosen for this test. Other browsers used for checking were [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox Firefox] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser) Safari]. The reason for choosing Opera in this case was to see if /Mac/ turned up. Clearly, download.com can tell that the computer being used in a Mac?

2. junkbusters.com — still exists (Михал Орела 07:03, 5 August 2008 (UTC)). In the [http://bit.ly/JunkBusters „About us“] page we read
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Junkbusters Corp. was founded in April 1996 in Green Brook, New Jersey, with the mission of helping people get rid of junk messages of all kinds: spam, telemarketing calls, unwanted junk mail, junk faxes, and more. The web site junkbusters.com is a leading consumer resource on the control of junk communications and the protection of privacy. At the end of 2004 the site and other assets were tranferred to its sister company Guidescope Inc.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of particular note is JunkBusters list of [http://bit.ly/JunkBustersPrivacyPolicies privacy policies].

3. silentsurf.com — still exists (Михал Орела 07:14, 5 August 2008 (UTC)). The address resolves into [http://bit.ly/SilentSurf http://silentsurf.com/site/index.html]. However, the page looks strange. At the very bottom there is a copyright notice:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
© Copyright 1999-2003 Distinctly Inc.  All rights reserved.  Page updated 30 Mar 2003.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Further experimentation suggests that the actual site is dead. For example, one might like to try to buy... and read the disclaimer...
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* I fully agree with all of the policies and procedures outlined in the Distinctly.com Inc., Conditions and Acceptable Use Policy. I authorize Distinctly.com Inc. to deduct from the credit card used to purchase the service my normal monthly, quarterly, or semi-annual payments for my service as outlined in the order form for the above service. I agree fully with all of the terms in the cancellation policy outlined to me when I signed up for hosting services. In the event that this charge is contested by myself or charged back to Distinctly.com Inc., I agree that I am responsible for any charges incurred by Distinctly.com Inc. in defending authorization. In the event I wish to cancel my account, I need to call into the billing department to get full instructions for canceling. In the event that a refund is due, all monies owed will be credited back to this credit card, minus any startups, which are non-refundable after the account logins are sent out. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before using the credit card it is worth checking Distinctly.com Inc. Continuing the research/experiment 
we find that the site „distinctly.com“ is [http://bit.ly/AvailableToPurchase available for purchase]!

4. anonymizer.com — still exists (Михал Орела 07:33, 5 August 2008 (UTC)). Of note is the link to the [http://bit.ly/PrivacyBlog Privacy blog].

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Meat_Recipes|Meat recipes]]

This is a hearty and flavoursome beef stew inspired by the Mediterranean. It is based on a dish cooked by [[w:Keith Floyd|Keith Floyd]] in his ''Floyd around the Med'' TV series.

==Ingredients==
* 500[[Cookbook:g|g]] (1.1[[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) of lean [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] stewing/braising steak (in steaks, not diced)
* 600[[Cookbook:g|g]] (1.3[[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) of green [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]], stones removed
* Six large [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]]
* One [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], finely [[Cookbook:Chopping|chopped]]
* One large clove of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], finely [[Cookbook:Chopping|chopped]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]]

==Procedure==
#In a large [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] or casserole dish, gently [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] the onion and garlic in plenty of good olive oil for a few minutes, taking care not to brown them.
#Season the beef well with [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] and immediately add to the pan. Fry until evenly sealed and lightly browned.
#Add the olives and tomatoes to the pan and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] gently for two hours with the lid on.
#Serve. The olives make this a filling meal in itself, but it could be served with [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] or simply with [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] to mop-up the gravy.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*If you buy olives in brine, it's a good idea to soak them in fresh water before use so that the resulting dish is not overly salty.
*Adding red [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]] or a dark [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]] such as a dunkel or stout could result in a richer gravy but may overpower the fresh flavour of the vegetables.

How can one illustrate the subject &quot;Computers &amp; Society&quot;?
One might think of possible alternative names. One might look for other disciplines which seem to cover the same ground.
For example, what about looking at [[w:Digital_humanities|Digital Humanities]] (also known as Humanities Computing or [[w:Humanistic_informatics|Humanities Informatics]]

== Still Life ==
The digital photograph entitled ''[[w:Still_life|Still life]]'' conjures up Art.
And Art is said to belong to the Humanities, to the Society. &quot;Still Life&quot; is the technical art term used in the English language 
for the French ''[[w:fr:Nature_morte|Nature morte]]''.

Where then is the Computer in the picture?

Did you guess it right?

The picture was taken by a [[w:Digital_camera|digital camera]] and the digital image was processed on a computer and then
sent up to another computer somewhere. Later that image was grabbed by a computer and then placed in such a way that
you can see it on your computer... now!

It captures exactly how we need to see computers in society. Mostly they are invisible, hidden. They are in the background all the time. Indeed they are so common that we rarely think of them just being there.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF DISPOSEH&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;handle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===

If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;handle&amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; represents a valid handle to a relocatable memory block, this statement disposes of the block, and sets the value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;handle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to zero (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;handle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must be a long-integer variable or a &lt;code&gt;HANDLE&lt;/code&gt; variable).

If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;handle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not represent a valid handle, the statement sets the value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;handle&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to zero, but otherwise does nothing.

=== Description ===

You may use this statement to display a picture directly from disk. The picture can actually be too large to load into memory. You may determine the size of the picture in advance using &lt;code&gt;DEF GETIMAGEFILERECT&lt;/code&gt;. The following example shows how to open a file and display it in a window.

==== Note ====

In order to use this routine, you must include the file named &amp;quot;&lt;code&gt;Subs Image Files.Incl&lt;/code&gt;&amp;quot; as shown in the example below.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/b&gt; &amp;quot;Subs Image Files.Incl&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a recent contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has its own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator (See below), a chess diagram upgrade (looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

==== Revised ====

November 2006 (FB 4, Release 4)

=== Description ===

This function shifts item &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and all subsequent items in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;gMyDynamicArray&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;HowMany&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; positions higher, to leave &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;HowMany&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; new items beginning at position &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The total number of items in the array increases by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;HowMany&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (or moreÑsee below), and the inserted items (beginning at &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) are filled with data located at &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;FillPtr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or with zeros if &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;FillPtr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is 0.

==== Note ====

Whether currently populated or not, a dynamic array must have held data at some point before being passed to this function.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;gMyDynamicArray&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is any FutureBASIC Dynamic Array previously dimensioned using &lt;code&gt;DYNAMIC&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DIMÊDYNAMIC&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the array position at which the first item will be inserted. It must be &amp;gt;= 0. &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will normally be less than the current number of items in the array, but can be greater. If it is greater, enough new empty items will be inserted to provide &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;HowMany&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; items beginning at item &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. For example, if you have 10 items (0-9) in the array, and insert 2 items beginning at item #13, your array will hold the original 10 items, followed by 3 empty items (10-12), and the 2 inserted items (13-14) for a total of 15 items.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;HowMany&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies the number of items to be inserted. It also represents the number by which the index of any specific item higher in the array will increase.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;FillPtr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is an address where new data are waiting to be inserted into &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;gMyDynamicArray&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. These must be in the same format, with the same size elements as &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;gMyDynamicArray&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. In OS 9, if you pass a dereferenced handle as &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;FillPtr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, you should first lock the handle. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF DYNAMICINSERTITEMS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not check to ensure there is adequate data to copy.

==== Revised ====

November 2006 (FB 4, Release 4)

=== Description ===

This function deletes &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;HowMany&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; items from &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;gMyDynamicArray&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, beginning with item &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;First&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Any subsequent items will shift down to replace the removed items, resulting in an array of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;HowMany&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; fewer items. Each subsequent item will have its index reduced by &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;HowMany&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;SavePtr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is 0, the data will be expunged without warning or recourse. If a pointer is passed in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;SavePtr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the data to be removed will first be copied to that address.

==== Note ====

Whether currently populated or not, a dynamic array must have held data at some point before being passed to this function.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;gMyDynamicArray&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is any FutureBASIC Dynamic Array previously dimensioned using &lt;code&gt;DYNAMIC&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DIMÊDYNAMIC&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;First&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the array position of the first item to be removed. It must be &amp;gt;= 0. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEFÊDYNAMICREMOVEITEMS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will not remove more items than exist in the array. For example, if your array holds 10 items (0-9) and you attempt to remove 5 items beginning with item 8, 2 items (8-9) will be removed instead and the array will be left with 8 items (0-7).

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;HowMany&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies the number of contiguous items to be removed. If there are too few items following &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;First&amp;amp;,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; only the number available will be removed. &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;SavePtr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is an address to which the items being removed from &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;gMyDynamicArray&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will be copied.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;SavePtr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; must point to an allocated memory block (or variable) of adequate size to hold all data being removed. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt; DEFÊDYNAMICREMOVEITEMS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not check to ensure there is adequate space. If there are fewer than &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;HowMany&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; items available to remove, only the number removed will be copied to &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;SavePtr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. To remove data without saving it, pass 0 in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;SavePtr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Revised ====

February 2002 (Release 6)

=== Description ===

The appearance manager can embed several buttons (sub controls) within a single parent button (or super control). In fact, buttons may be embedded in buttons which are in turn embedded in other buttons. The advantages are enormous. Take this example: each window has a single root control. All buttons within the window are embedded into this root control or into one of its children. When the window becomes inactive, the root control is disabled. With that single command (implemented by the FB runtime) all other controls in the window are automatically disabled.

The versatility extends to things like showing or hiding a pane in a tab control or buttons within a group.

==== Example ====

The following example creates a radio button group and embeds individual buttons into the super control. As a result, you can poll the group button to find out which of the radio sub controls is currently selected.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIM&lt;/b&gt; r &lt;b&gt;as rect&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== DEF FN &amp;lt;expr&amp;gt; == 
 
=== Statement === 
 
✔ Appearance ✔ Standard ✔ Console

=== Syntax ===

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF FN&lt;/b&gt; functionName [(&lt;i&gt;var1&lt;/i&gt; [,&lt;i&gt;var2&lt;/i&gt; ...])] = &lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Description ===

This statement defines a &amp;quot;one-line&amp;quot; function. You can refer to the function in later parts of your program by using an expression in this form:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;FN&lt;/b&gt; functionName [(parm1 [, parm2 ...])]&lt;/code&gt;

This expression returns the value of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; from the function definition.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF FN&lt;/b&gt; &amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement should not appear inside any &lt;code&gt;LOCAL&lt;/code&gt; function.

&lt;code&gt;functionName&lt;/code&gt; can be any valid FB identifier which is different from any other function name defined in your program. &lt;code&gt;functionName&lt;/code&gt; can optionally end with a type-identifier suffix (such as &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, etc.)

If &lt;code&gt;functionName&lt;/code&gt; ends with a type-identifier suffix, the suffix indicates the data type that the function returns (and hence &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be of the same type). If no type-identifier suffix is specified, the function returns a long-integer value.

You can optionally include a formal parameter list in the function definition: this is a list of variable names (&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses, which immediately follows &lt;code&gt;functionName&lt;/code&gt;. Usually, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will contain references to these parameter variables. When you call a function that has a formal parameter list, you pass values to it in an actual parameter list (&lt;code&gt;parm1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;parm2&lt;/code&gt;, etc.). These values are then assigned to &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc., and are used in evaluating &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;var2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc. must be &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; variables: they cannot be array elements, records, nor record fields. &lt;code&gt;parm1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;parm2&lt;/code&gt;, etc. can (with some exceptions) be any kinds of expressions, as long as the data type of each &lt;code&gt;parm&lt;/code&gt; expression is compatible with its corresponding &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; variable in the formal parameter list. The number and order of the items in the actual parameter list must exactly match the number and order of the items in the formal parameter list (if any).

The variables in the formal parameter list are either global (if they were previously declared within a &lt;code&gt;BEGIN GLOBALS&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;END GLOBALS&lt;/code&gt; section), or they are &amp;quot;local to main.&amp;quot; In either case, this means that the values which get assigned to those variables (when you call the function) persist even after the function returns its value. You need to keep this in mind if you later execute some statement in &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; (outside of all &lt;code&gt;LOCAL&lt;/code&gt; functions) which contains one of those variables.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; may contain other variables besides those which appear in the formal parameter list. All variables in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are either global (as declared within a &lt;code&gt;BEGIN GLOBALS&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;END GLOBALS&lt;/code&gt; block) or are local to main.

==== Example ====

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF FN&lt;/b&gt; Area!(r!) = pi# * r! * r!

&lt;b&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/b&gt; Circle6&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a! = &lt;b&gt;FN&lt;/b&gt; Area!(6.0)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PRINT&lt;/b&gt; a!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;END FN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;FN Area!&lt;/code&gt; calculates the area of a circle, when the radius of the circle is passed as a parameter. We are assuming that the variable &lt;code&gt;pi#&lt;/code&gt; is a global variable or a &amp;quot;local to main&amp;quot; variable whose value has previously been set to 3.14159...

When we call the &lt;code&gt;Circle6&lt;/code&gt; function, the value 113.079 gets assigned to the local variable &lt;code&gt;a!&lt;/code&gt;. As a side effect of calling &lt;code&gt;FN Area!(6.0)&lt;/code&gt;, the value of the &amp;quot;local to main&amp;quot; variable &lt;code&gt;r!&lt;/code&gt; is changed to 6.0.

==== Note ====

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF FN&lt;/b&gt; &amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a &amp;quot;non-executable&amp;quot; statement, which means you cannot affect the definition of the function by placing &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF FN&lt;/b&gt; &amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;THEN&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ELSE&lt;/code&gt; (in an &lt;code&gt;IF &lt;/code&gt;statement), nor by placing it inside any kind of &amp;quot;conditional execution&amp;quot; block such as &lt;code&gt;LONG IF&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;END IF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WHILE&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;WEND&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FOR&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt;, etc. However, you can affect the function definition (at compile time) by placing &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF&amp;nbsp;FN&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;expr&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; inside a &lt;code&gt;COMPILE LONG IF&lt;/code&gt; block.

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEF FN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not work for threaded functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Summary==
The Redcrosse Knight has been commissioned by the Faerie Queene Gloriana to rescue the Lady Una's parents from a dragon. Una, riding on a donkey and accompanied by a dwarf and a lamb, guides the knight. A storm erupts, and the group takes shelter in a tree-filled grove, where they soon become lost. They find a cave and learn that it is the home of the half-woman, half serpent beast known as Errour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== div ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
div_t div( int numerator, int denominator );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function div() returns the quotient and remainder of the operation ''numerator'' / ''denominator''. The '''div_t''' structure is defined in cstdlib, and has at least:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int quot;   // The quotient
int rem;    // The remainder  
&lt;/source&gt;

For example, the following code displays the quotient and remainder of x/y:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
div_t temp;
temp = div( x, y );
printf( &quot;%d divided by %d yields %d with a remainder of %d\n&quot;,
  x, y, temp.quot, temp.rem );   
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Randomized Evidence for Kaposi's Sarcoma'''&lt;/big&gt;


*'''Johannesburg Hospital''' (South Africa)(2003-2004) -- RT 24/12 vs. 20/5
**Randomized. 65 sites of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma (histolocially proven, HIV+, mucosal or cutaneous). Arm 1) RT 24/12 vs. Arm 2) RT 20/5. Tumor + 2cm margin, if oral location then entire oral cavity
**'''2008''' PMID 18439694 -- &quot;Hypofractionated radiation therapy in the treatment of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma - A prospective randomized trial.&quot; (Singh NB, Radiother Oncol. 2008 Apr 23 [Epub ahead of print])

&lt;big&gt;'''Second Primary Tumors in Head &amp; Neck'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Second primary tumors are a major source of morbidity and mortality, particularly for patients who have been effectively treated for early stage HNSCC
*The risk of developing a second primary is ~5%/year. Majority occur in H&amp;N, esophagus, or lung; lung is the most common site (31%), followed by oral cavity (17%)
*Continued smoking increases both risk of second primary tumor (HR 1.6) and death (HR 2.5) over that of former smokers (HR 1.3 and 1.6) compared with non-smokers. This is a rationale to promote smoking cessation
*Concurrent treatment with chemotherapy doesn't appear to change risk of second cancers
*A high-dose isotretinoin given for 1 year decreased the risk of second primary in Stage I-IV patients in a randomized trial; however, tolerance was poor with 70% patients requiring dose reduction
*A French trial, using a second generation retinoic acid etretinate did not show any benefit. An Italian and Australian trial using isotretinoin also did not show any benefit
*Finally, a tolerable low-dose isotretinoin given for 3 years to early stage patients in a large Intergroup trial did not decrease risk of second primary tumors or death


*'''Colorado-SEER; 2008''' PMID 18078720 -- &quot;Use of external beam radiotherapy is associated with reduced incidence of second primary head and neck cancer: a SEER database analysis.&quot; (Rusthoven KE, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 May 1;71(1):192-8.)
**Analysis of 27,985 patients with early stage HNCA entered into SEER database between 1973 and 1997
**Patients treated with RT had significantly reduced incidence of second HNCa (15yr incidence 7.7% vs 10.5%)
**On multivariate analysis, pts with primary tumors of the pharynx (p&lt;0.001) and larynx (p=0.04) had significant reduction in second primary HNCA with RT

*'''Memorial Sloan Kettering; 2005''' (1986-1995) PMID 16265657, 2005 (1984-98) &amp;mdash; &quot;Second primary malignancy of the aerodigestive tract in patients treated for cancer of the oral cavity and larynx.&quot; (Lin K et al. Head Neck. 2005 Dec;27(12):1042-8. )
**Retospective. 1257 patients with oral cavity (n=595) and larynx (n=662). Endpoint development of second primary (H&amp;N, esophagus, or lung)
**Outcome: 5-year rate larynx 8%, oral cavity 10%. Larynx most common 2nd primary was lung, oral cavity was another H&amp;N.
**Predictors: Smokers 5x increased risk, EtOH 2x increased risk
**Conclusion: Rates comparable, patterns different. Smoking and EtOH independent risk factors

*'''SAKK 10/94; 2005''' PMID 15936546 -- &quot;Risk factors for developing a second upper aerodigestive cancer after radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in patients with head-and-neck cancers: An exploratory outcomes analysis.&quot; (Taussky D, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005)
**Analysis of Swiss SAKK 10/94 trial (RT +/- cisplatin). 521 patients. Median F/U 4.7 years
**Second primary tumors: No difference as a function of getting chemotherapy, age, PS, gender, T-stage, or N-stage. Concomitant boost fewer SPTs
**Conclusion: Addition of chemotherapy doesn't influence incidence of second cancers

*'''RTOG Registry (76-19)''' (1977-1980)
**'''1989''' PMID 2674073 -- &quot;Second malignancies in patients who have head and neck cancer: incidence, effect on survival and implications based on the RTOG experience.&quot; (Cooper JS, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1989 Sep;17(3):449-56.)
***Prospective registry of H&amp;N patients seen by RTOG. 928 HNSCC treated with RT only
***Second tumor risk: 3-years 10%, 5-years 15%, 8-years 23%; most occurred in patients with small primaries due to their longer survival

*'''MD Anderson; 1989''' PMID 2674081 -- &quot;Second malignant tumors in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: the overshadowing threat for patients with early-stage disease.&quot; (Lippman SM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1989 Sep;17(3):691-4.)

==Prevention Trials==
*'''Quebec''' (1994-2000) -- alpha tocopherol/beta-carotene vs placebo
**Randomized. 540 patients, Stage I-II HNC, treated with RT. Arm 1) alpha-tocopherol 400 IU/day and beta-carotene 30 mg/day (''beta-carotene discontinued after 156 patients due to ethical concerns'') x3 years vs Arm 2) placebo.
**'''2005''' PMID 15812073 -- &quot;A randomized trial of antioxidant vitamins to prevent second primary cancers in head and neck cancer patients.&quot; (Bairati I, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2005 Apr 6;97(7):481-8.) Median F/U 4.3 years
***Outcome: 2nd primary supplement 23% vs. placebo 19%. During supplementation, higher rate of 2nd primary than placebo (HR 2.9, SS), which lowered after supplementation was discontinued
***Conclusion: Alpha-tocopherol produced unexpected higher occurence of second primary cancer
**'''Weight loss; 2010''' PMID 20187097 -- &quot;Predictors of weight loss during radiotherapy in patients with stage I or II head and neck cancer.&quot; (Nourissat A, Cancer. 2010 Feb 24. [Epub ahead of print])
***Patients weighed before and after RT. Mean weight loss 2.2 kg (SD 3.4 kg). Baseline characteristics assessed
***Outcome: Predictors for weight loss: non-glottic site, higher baseline weight, Stage II disease (vs Stage I), baseline dysphagia/odynophagia, lower KPS. No association with diet
***Conclusion: Predictors for weight loss identified

*'''Italian Head and Neck Chemoprevention Study Group''' 2004 (1992-1996) -- low-dose isotretinoin
**Randomized. 267 patients. Radically treated Stage III-IV HNSCC. Arm 1) placebo vs. Arm 2) isotretinoin 0.5 mg/kg vs. Arm 3) isotretinoin + Interferon alpha-2a (''only 15 patients assigned due to financial problems'') x1 year
**'''2004''' PMID 15138569 &amp;mdash; &quot;13-cis retinoic acid in head and neck cancer chemoprevention: results of a randomized trial from the Italian Head and Neck Chemoprevention Study Group.&quot; (Toma S, Oncol Rep. 2004 Jun;11(6):1297-305.) Mean F/U 3.2 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS isotretinoin 59% vs. placebo 57% (NS); RFS 49% vs. 56% (NS)
***Toxicity: Grade III-IV in 4%, Grade I-II 69%
***Conclusion: Low-dose isotretinoin ineffective at chemoprevention

*'''Retinoid Head and Neck Second Primary Trial (INT/RTOG 91-15)''' (1991-1999) -- low dose isotretinoin
**Randomized. 1190 patients, treated, with Stage I-II HNSCC (oral cavity, larynx, pharynx), disease-free at least 4 months. Arm 1) low-dose isotretinoin (30 mg/day) vs. Arm 2) placebo x3 years
**'''Smoking; 2001''' PMID 11489748 -- &quot;The impact of smoking status, disease stage, and index tumor site on second primary tumor incidence and tumor recurrence in the head and neck retinoid chemoprevention trial.&quot; (Khuri FR, Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2001 Aug;10(8):823-9.)
***Outcome: second primary tumor rate 5.1%/year; active smoker 5.7% vs. never smoker 3.5% (p=0.05); Stage I 4.3% vs. Stage II 6.4% (SS)
***Conclusion: Significantly higher second primary tumor rate in active smokers, intermediate rate for former smokers compared with never smokers
**'''6-years; 2006''' PMID 16595780 -- &quot;Randomized phase III trial of low-dose isotretinoin for prevention of second primary tumors in stage I and II head and neck cancer patients.&quot; (Khuri FR, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2006 Apr 5;98(7):441-50.) Median F/U 6 years
***Outcome: Second primary tumors rate 4.6%/year in both arms (NS); no difference in primary tumor–free survival, RFS, smoking-associated DFS, and OS 
***Predictors: second cancers 261 (22%); current smokers (HR 1.64, SS) more risk than former smokers (HR 1.32, SS) compared with non-smokers. Risk of death current smokers 2.51 vs. former smokers 1.60
***Sites of 2nd tumors: lung (31%), oral cavity (17%), larynx (8%), pharynx (5%)
***Conclusion: Low-dose isotretinoin not effective at reducing second primary tumors 

*'''France''' -- etretinate
**Randomized. 316 patients, SCHNN T1-2N0-1 &lt;=3 cm. Arm 1) etretinate 25 mg/day vs. Arm 2) placebo x2 years
**'''5-years; 1994''' PMID 7917535 -- &quot;Prevention of second primary tumours with etretinate in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx. Results of a multicentric double-blind randomised study.&quot; (Bolla M, Eur J Cancer. 1994;30A(6):767-72.) Median F/U 3.4 years
***Outcome: second primary tumor 18% (NS). No difference on LR or DM rate. 5-year OS and DFS no difference
***Toxicity: discontinued in etretinate 33% vs. placebo 23% (SS)
***Conclusion: Etretinate does not prevent second primary tumors

*'''Queensland''' (Australia) -- high-dose or low-dose isotretinoin
**Randomized. ''Trial stopped early by sponsor after early analysis showed no benefit.'' 151 patients. T1-4N0-2 HNSCC. Arm 1) high-dose isotretinoin 1 mg/kg x1 year, then low-dose isotretinoin 0.5 mg/kg x2 years vs. Arm 2) low-dose isotretinoin x3 years vs. Arm 3) placebo x3 years. 67% did not complete therapy (~1/3 in high-dose due to side effects)
**'''2005''' PMID 15781758 -- &quot;Chemoprevention of head and neck cancer with retinoids: a negative result.&quot; (Perry CF, Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2005 Mar;131(3):198-203.)
***Outcome: Second primary cancer high-dose 9% vs. low-dose 17% vs. placebo 14% (NS); no difference in DFS, RFS, or OS
***Toxicity: No difference between groups
***Conclusion: Use of isotretinoin not indicated for prophylaxis

*'''MD Anderson''' -- high-dose isotretinoin
**Randomized. 103 patients, treated Stage I-IV HNSCC. Arm 1) high dose isotretinoin 50-100 mg/m2 vs Arm 2) placebo x1 year.

***Outcome: second primary tumors isotretinoin 4% vs. placebo 24% (SS). 93% tumors in H&amp;N, esophagus, or lung. No difference in local, distant, or regional recurrence of primary tumor.
***Conclusion: High dose isotretinoin effective in prevention of second primary
**'''5-years; 1994''' PMID 8271298 -- &quot;Prevention of second primary tumors with isotretinoin in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: long-term follow-up.&quot; (Benner SE,  J Natl Cancer Inst. 1994 Jan 19;86(2):140-1.) Median F/U 4.5 years
***Outcome: second primary tumors isotretinoin 14% vs. placebo 31% (SS); but impact diminishes with time. By 8 years, estimated rates of 19% vs. 44%. No patients developed second primary tumor while on drug
***Toxicity: 70% required dose reduction, 25% stopped
***No difference in OS.  No impact on behavior of primary tumor.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two types of security in .NET
* Code Access Security - security access that a program may have, independent of the user
* Role-based Security - security access that a particular user account has

===Permission===
A '''Permission''' is the ability to do something, for example delete a file.

There are three sorts of permission:
* Code access permission - access to a resource or ability to perform an operation. E.g. Access to a file, ability to delete a file
* Identity permission - 
* Role-based security permission - whether a user is a particular user, or belongs to a particular user group. e.g. a successful login.

===Type safety===
Type safety in the .NET security context refers to the permissions that computer programs (rather than users) have, in particular it indicates how much of the computer's memory it can access. A program that is '''verifiably type safe''' can only access memory related to itself, and only in the correct manner. It is an advantage to write '''verifiably type safe''' programs because they won't trigger those annoying confirmation messages in Windows Vista, and users are more likely to download them because they are much less likely to be malware.

===Evidence===
Evidence is a piece of information, e.g. a password, electronic signature or certificate, that the framework uses to establish what permissions are available to the user or program.

===Identities, Roles and Principals===
An '''Identity''' is analagous to a user account. A '''Role''' is similar to a user group (e.g. &quot;Administrator&quot;). A '''Principal''' is something like the concept of &quot;the currently logged in user&quot;. It represents the totality of the access currently available to the program from the combination of code access security and the Identity and Role being used. The Principal is the computer program, acting on the user's behalf. Different identities can also used by the Principal, through impersonation. e.g. a website might perform file operations that the user of the website might not be allowed to perform directly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Backstory=

Everybody gets named. Usually, they get their first name sometime around their birth. Most get named before they are born. It all depends on the culture and the circumstances. For example, once upon a time someone called MacDonald would be the presumed son (mac is the prefix which means son) of Donald. Today, Jane MacDonald is... well... Jane.

There are many cultures where the naming was really a father to son affair. One of the most famous naming laws in the twentieth century was passed on June 21, 1934. Where was it passed? Why was it necessary?

Sometimes,  the one born would be given the name of the occupation of the father. So, we have John Smith and Mary Taylor. Were we to follow this tradition, we can imagine names like Timothy Kingmaker and Cynthia Filmproducer.

And so, it came to pass, that when the Internet came into being, there was again the need to name. An even bigger and more important naming need occurred with the birth of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web World Wide Web (WWW)].

==Weaving the Web==
In his book &quot;Weaving the Web&quot; with Mark Fischetti, Tim Berners-Lee writes (p.66)
&quot;I presented the idea of a ''universal document identifier''&quot; (UDI). Subsequently, universal became uniform, document became resource, and locator was preferred over identifier. &quot;We argued, but at the IETF [1992] the universal resource identifier became URL, the ''uniform resource locator''&quot; (p.67).

That was then. Now the URI has come into its own.

== Question on the Naming Law of 1934 ==
There are many cultures where the naming was really a father to son affair. One of the most famous naming laws in the twentieth century was passed on June 21, 1934. 
 
* &lt;tt&gt;Q. Where was it passed?&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;Q. Why was it necessary?&lt;/tt&gt;

== Answer strategy ==
*1. Why not try searching Wikipedia first?&lt;/br&gt;

Let us begin with the search text «Wikipedia &quot;naming law&quot;» &lt;/br&gt;
The first result is about  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_name Dutch names]&lt;ref&gt;The is a very interesting article on the question of naming.
It is not the answer anticipated. To find the answer to the naming law question we will need to include the year 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;.

We now search with «Wikipedia &quot;naming law&quot; 1934» &lt;/br&gt;
There are no results. 

Let us search outside Wikipedia.&lt;/br&gt;
There are still no results. Perhaps we must be very specific about the date. Let us begin again.&lt;/br&gt;
«Wikipedia &quot;naming law&quot; 21 June 1934»&lt;/br&gt;
Hmmm! This is a harder question than expected.

*2. The answer is on Wikipedia!&lt;/br&gt;

How do I know? Well, that is where I started when I formulated the question. Here is a source: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atatürk's_Reforms Atatürk's Reforms]&lt;ref&gt;In order to enrich our experience and knowledge, and to help others, let us answer the question by checking facts inside and outside Wikipedia. Then let us add a new page on Turkish_name just like that of the page on Dutch_name which we found?&lt;/ref&gt;.

While there are many ways to take notes, the best ways are the ones you feel most comfortable with. There are however a few formatting ideas that are used by all sort of notes.

* Separate major ideas by a blank line, and more general ideas by a few more lines.
* If you're almost done with a page, and are starting a new unit or section, start on a new page.
* Writing on only one side of a page is a very good idea, but is not required.
* Use abbreviations and symbols to avoid long sentences.
* Write down information in your own words.

=== Cornell Method ===

[[Image:NotesCornell.png|right|Cornell Note-taking Method]]

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes Cornell Method] has a  very good proven track record. The method consists of the '''5 R''''s:
*Record
*Reduce
*Recite
*Reflect
*Review
One way to remember these 5 might be to &lt;u&gt;imagine&lt;/u&gt; them written on the digits of the right (or left) hand:
*Thumb — Record
*Pointing finger — Reduce
*Middle finger — Recite
*Ring finger — Reflect
*Little finger — Review
Or, get an old plastic glove used for washing-up or gardening and write the R's on the glove. This should be fun.
Imagine wearing and showing the glove to friends. They will say: &quot;What's this? Why 5 R's? I thought there were only 3 R's: Reading, Riting, Rithmetic!&quot;

Here is a simple picture of a notebook page that shows the notes on one column of a page, and keywords on the other column. It allows quick retrieval of different subjects, and a fast and easy way to review the notes.

To setup a page using the Cornell Method, follow these steps:

* Write your name, the subject, the date, and the page number on the top.
* Draw a line (or leave space) from top to bottom about 2&quot; from the left side.
* Draw a line (or leave space) for a summary of the page's content.

When listening to a lecture, record the main ideas on the right side of the paper as a list or in paragraph form. Use abbreviations when possible. On the left side, write down a keyword that describes this section of notes. When you finish the page, summarize in a few sentences the main ideas of the whole page. When you finish class, review and clarify any keywords.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;MODELING FROM A TO Z&lt;/big&gt;

This book is for &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; who want to learn
about the use of mathematics and logic
in the design of computing systems.

A model is like the architectural drawings.
It gives a feeling for the actual thing yet to be built.

&lt;!-- Need a large diagram to go here --&gt;

We will look at some apparently very simple models of
* an address book
* a waste management system
* and so on

We will show how to build the model, how to exercise the model, how to verity the rightness of the model
using very well-known but techniques such as
* Alloy
* B-tool
* not C or C++ or an other C-like programming language
* ...
* VDM
*...
* Z

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Modeling? What is that?=
Let us begin with a simple question? What exactly is meant by modeling? What do we mean by a model? 

One way in which to answer these questions is to start with a simple example. The example we will begin with is the management of waste in the environment. It might be Nuclear waste. It might be office or home waste, such as the disposal of paper, glass, batteries, and so on. 

In general, waste arrives at a processing plant. And the waste is all mixed up. The first important process is to separate this waste into its different constituent parts. We may call this the ''separation phase'' or the ''separation process''. Such a phase has an input and an output. It will be convenient to imagine that the input is a container full of mixed waste and that the output is a collection of containers specific to each type of waste. So, for example, if the input container holds glass, paper and batteries, then it is reasonable to suppose that there are three&lt;ref&gt;This simple example shows how easy it is to get it wrong. One must always take into account the unexpected. For example, a rat might have decided to take up residence in the input container. It is then big surprise for the computer system to know whether the rat is glass or paper or battery! The solution is to have four output containers. The fourth one is the catch-all container. Perhaps you have now become suspicious and wary? Perhaps, we need a fifth output container? Can you think of a reason reason why?&lt;/ref&gt; output containers.

In the modern Networked and Distributed Environment, one mode of improvement in the development and maintenance of both &quot;industrial software with strong focus&quot; such as in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management Waste Management], and  &quot;widespread-use software with collaborative focus&quot; such as in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modeling_and_analysis_of_financial_markets Financial Market Analysis], is characterized by the rigor of both formal engineering techniques in the modeling of
critical kernels, and in the ontological grounding of all key concepts and their properties.

==Same-shape models==
Let us imagine that you build a model of an airplane. It has a body, wings, cockpit, wheels. And some other bits. The key parts are the body, wings, and so on. You are pleased with your model. It can not fly of course. But there are days when you sit still and stare at it and wonder and dream.

You are staring out the window. It is a nice day, blue sky, some white clouds floating. Suddenly a bird flies by, black in color. It is not quite the apple falling on the head kind of experience, but close enough. You say to yourself. „Why not build a model of a bird?“ Both have wings. You sketch out the wings. Both have places for eyes and so on. For the bird it will be called the head. The airplane has a cockpit instead. After a while you draw a table:

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
|+ Design for flight thing 
!Name
!Airplane
!Bird
|-
|body || Airbus body&lt;ref&gt;You want to show the shape of the body to your friends. Which one do you have in mind? Maybe it is the new [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380 Airbus A380]?&lt;/ref&gt; || [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon Pigeon] body&lt;ref&gt;You choose the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon Pigeon body] you like.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|observation platform&lt;ref&gt;This is a very complicated and long phrase. It is invented to fit the general idea of &quot;a place to see from&quot;.
Maybe you can think of a better phrase?&lt;/ref&gt; || cockpit || [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle Eagle] head
|-
|wings || Boeing wings&lt;ref&gt;Do you dream of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787 Boeing 787 Dreamliner?]&lt;/ref&gt; || [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross Albatross] wings
|-
|stuff for being on ground&lt;ref&gt;Maybe a better generalization of wheels and feet is &quot;landing apparatus&quot; or &quot;standing apparatus&quot;? You can see just how difficult it is to find phrases to cover the meaning of wheels (for aircraft) and feet (for bird). Have you a better suggestion?&lt;/ref&gt; || wheels || [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow Crow] feet
|}

It is easy to see the correspondences between the airplane and the bird. It is not so easy to see why these particular birds have been chosen. Can you think of a good reason? Would you make a different choice. If yes, what reasons would you give for your choice?

==Development of models==
One of those quiet days when you have time to yourself and perhaps you are daydreaming, staring out the window, an idea lands. „What do I need to add to the model to make it fly?“, you say to yourself.

To ask such a question is to take oneself right back to the beginnings of the search for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight flight]. That birds should give directions is only natural. However, for the flight of man, many solutions have been found. What are they? Where did the ideas comes from? Who had the ideas? Where can we find information of this?

But the birds did not give the inspiration for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon balloon] nor the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter helicopter]. Where do you think these ideas came from?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=What is the Alloy analyzer?=
[http://alloy.mit.edu/ Alloy] is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language formal language] deeply rooted in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_notation Z]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Like Z, it describes all structures (in space and time) with a minimal toolkit of mathematical notions,&quot; Jackson 2006, p.xii&lt;/ref&gt;. It was developed by Daniel Jackson, currently at MIT.
Daniel is the son of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Jackson Michael Jackson] who is well-known
for his contributions to computing.

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy_language Alloy analyzer] is a constraint analyzer developed by Felix Chang&lt;ref&gt;Some brief information on Felix Chang is given in the e-Links.&lt;/ref&gt;, currently at MIT.

==Simple model of the address book==

Let us take the classic example of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Book address book]&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson-2006&quot;&gt;We use addressBook2 as the key example taken from Daniel Jackson's book Software Abstractions, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; and
convert it into a formal equivalent model of a digital art gallery catalog. Here we are thinking of the names of paintings&lt;ref&gt;In practical work we will use digital photographs as digital images in our exhibition. Such digital photographs will be freely available under the usual Creative Commons license.&lt;/ref&gt;. A physical painting is located in exactly one place. But the digital form of that painting, which we will call digital image, may be located in many different places. Such digital images are to be subject to control, for quality purposes, for copyright purpose, and so on. To motivate the work we will concentrate on a real-world example: the digital art exhibition.

But first let us start with the address book. In today's world we might be thinking of names and web addresses, or names and e-mail adresses, or ...
There is so much potential. Let us be conservative and have some fun? Here is a simple old-fashioned address book:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
|+ '''simple address book'''
! Name || Address 
|-
| Harry Knooall  || Black Rock,  Big Peak county
|-
| Martha  Underwude || Black Rock,  Big Peak county
|-
| Charlie Bigfoot || on the road
|-
| Mary Wethervain || White Rock, Big Peak county 
|}

To build a model requires investment of time and energy. To develop a meaningful model of one's own helps to understand the process of model building. This gives one a sense of ownership in the model. One might experiment with the simple model above. For example, if interested in the prison system, one might change „Black Rock“ to „Black Rock penitentiary“ or „Black Rock jail“ and maybe change „on the road“ to „on the run“.

Let us take the first first example used by Jackson in his book&lt;ref&gt;We have simplified Jackson's model a little bit. 
His module, page 6, has the longer title „tour/addressBook1“&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''module''' addressbook
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''sig''' Name, Addr {}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''sig''' Book {&lt;/br&gt;
	addr: Name -&gt; '''lone''' Addr&lt;/br&gt;
	}&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The special keyword '''lone''' needs explanation. It indicates that each name is mapped to at most one address. It is possible for someone to have no address. In our little model „Charlie Bigfoot“ has no address in the usual sense. So, just for fun, we have given him&lt;ref&gt;It is important to be open about possible meanings of names. I say ''him''. I could say ''her''. If we want to be specific about gender, then we have to model it: ''female'', ''male'', ''other'', for example.&lt;/ref&gt; a special sort of address &quot;on the road&quot;.

We can get a picture of our simple model.

 |&lt;!--column2--&gt;The structure of the simple model of the addressBook&lt;/br&gt; using Magic Layout
 |}&lt;!--end wikitable--&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The image on the left is the default layout in the Alloy analyzer; that on the right uses the „Magic Layout“.

Our next step is to produce some typical address books. In particular we are interested to see if we can produce an example that corresponds to the old-fashioned address book with which we began.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''pred''' show () {}&lt;br&gt;
'''run''' show '''for''' 4 '''but''' 1 Book
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the pattern of Jackson's development closely, one adds the predicate show to get at most 4 objects  in each signature: ''Name'' and ''Addr'' but only 1 object ''Book''.

[[Image:AddressBook1 ShowFor4But1.jpg|thumb|500px|center|The structure of the simple model of the addressBook]]

So! We can think of „Harry Knooall“ having Name1, „Martha  Underwude“ having Name0, „Black Rock,  Big Peak county“ being represented by Addr2, and so on. In other words, we do have a good working model for the kind of address book we have in mind. Now what shall we do?

=Digital Art Exhibition=
Let us begin with a simple correspondence.
An address book associates names with addresses. The exhibition catalog associates names of digital images (of paintings or whatever) with web addresses.

We jump in straight away with the name of the module:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''module''' exhibitionCatalog
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The next step is the introduction of an abstract signature which we will call Xpoint&lt;ref&gt;Jackson uses the name Target, p.17. It is very hard to imagine how one might come up with this particular way of doing things. In other words, to start with such an abstract signature seems to require prior knowledge. Such prior knowledge seems to require a great deal of sophistication or intuition.&lt;/ref&gt;.
The idea behind Xpoint is to indicate some end point in an XML namespace.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''abstract sig''' Xpoint {} &lt;!-- Target ==&gt; Xpoint --&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now we can define exactly what we mean by the web address of the digital image (of the painting or whatever).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''sig''' WebAddr '''extends''' Xpoint {} &lt;!-- Addr ==&gt; WebAddr --&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We also consider the possibility of groups of names. The purpose of the group is to cover the concept of artistic theme, such as Impressionism, Cubism, and so on. Let us try out the use of ArtTheme for such a group? 

Similarly, an alias is a name for another name. It is frequently the case, that an artwork will have some name, such as Mother with Child. It is also possible that a caloguer will use an alias such as the Chicago Madonna for exactly the same artwork. It might seem convenient to use Alias for this purpose. However, in order to avoid confusion between this new (isomorphic) model and the original Jackson model
we will use OtherName. Both ArtTheme and OtherName are sorts of Names, words which identify. But Name is used in the original Jackson model. Let us use instead the word Identity. And just as the Xpoint is in an XML space, then why not consider the Identity to be a kind of Xpoint?
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''abstract sig''' Identity '''extends''' Xpoint {} &lt;!-- Name ==&gt; Identity --&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now we can define ArtTheme and OtherName as extensions of Identity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''sig''' ArtTheme '''extends''' Identity {}&lt;/br&gt;&lt;!-- Group ==&gt; ArtTheme --&gt;
'''sig''' OtherName '''extends''' Identity {}&lt;!-- Alias ==&gt; OtherName --&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For convenience, one might like to wrap up the previous two defintion in one line:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''sig''' ArtTheme, OtherName '''extends''' Identity {}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally the ArtExhibitionCatalog is determined by setting up a relationship between
the Identity (of the ArtWork) and the Xpoint (where it is located).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''sig''' ArtExhibitionCatalog {webAddr: Identity —&gt; Xpoint}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Encoding the model===
Now we put everything together 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''module''' exhibitionCatalog&lt;/br&gt;

'''abstract''' '''sig''' Xpoint {}&lt;/br&gt; 

'''sig''' WebAddr '''extends''' Xpoint {}&lt;/br&gt; 

'''abstract''' '''sig''' Identity '''extends''' Xpoint {}&lt;/br&gt;

'''sig''' ArtTheme, OtherName '''extends''' Identity {}&lt;/br&gt;

'''sig''' ArtExhibitionCatalog {webAddr: Identity -&gt; Xpoint}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first thing to do is show a picture of the structure of the metamodel:

[[Image:ArtExhibitionCalalog20080815 1.jpg|thumb|320px|center|The metamodel]]

It might be a good idea to make a printout or a sketch of this picture while studying the rest of the model.
  
===Exercising the model===
Now we are ready to play with our little model.
Before we do, it is really worthwhile to listen to what Daniel Jackson has to say on the subject:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
«Building a model incrementally with an analyzer, simulating and checking as you go along,
is a very different experience from using pencil and paper alone. The first reaction tends to be amazement:
modeling is much more fun when you get instant, visual feedback, When you simulate a partial model,
you see examples immediately that suggest new constraints to be added.»&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2006, p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most basic way to show what is going on is to use the predicate show.
Here we want to show '''some''' of the possible ''webAddress''es associated with our ''ArtExhibitionCatalog'': 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''pred''' show (aec: ArtExhibitionCatalog) {'''some''' aec.webAddr}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and we want to limit our exploration of the model to at most 3 objects in each signature, 
except for the ''ArtExhibitionCatalog'' which is limited to 1 object:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''run''' show '''for''' 3 '''but''' 1 ArtExhibitionCatalog
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Finally, to get a picture of what is happening with respect to the ''ArtExhibitionCatalog'', we project over it. That is to say, we know there is just one.
Let us put it in the background and see what the rest of the picture looks like. Here is one such result.

[[Image:ArtExhibitionCatalog20080811aSQR.jpg|thumb|320px|center|An illustration of a problem in the design of our model.]]

===Elimination of identity cycling ===
We must go back and fix the model. Specifically, one might add the fact that for any ''ArtExhibitionCatalog''
there is no Identity that is in a set of Xpoints which can be reached from that Identity. In other words, cycling (i.e. going round in circles) is out!

We state this as 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''fact''' {&lt;/br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''all''' aec: ArtExhibitionCatalog | '''no''' id: Identity | id '''in''' id.^(aec.webAddr)&lt;/br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:ArtExhibitionCatalog20080811bSQR.jpg|thumb|355px| center|Problem of cycling identities solved.]]

===From OtherNames to Xpoints===
Now let us consider the following result:

[[Image:ArtExhibitionCatalog20080812a 250x500.jpg|thumb|320px|center|An ArtTheme which has two webAddresses.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''pred''' show (ace: ArtExhibitionCatalog) '''some''' OtherName.(ace.webaddress)}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=From addressBook to vCard=
Starting again from the simple address book we can move in the direction of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard vCard].
The task is to find a simple way of building up the model of the vCard, step by step. Why not begin with the example given in the Wikipedia article?

Our first task is to identify the meaning of the &quot;key&quot; words which are apparently given in uppercase. We recognize TITLE, WORK, VOICE, HOME and so on. But what exactly is N, FN, REV? These &quot;key&quot; words are called properties. The basic list of properties is FN, N, NICKNAME, PHOTO, BDAY, ADR, LABEL, TEL, EMAIL, MAILER, TZ, GEO, TITLE, ROLE, LOGO, AGENT, ORG, CATEGORIES, NOTE, PRODID, REV, SORT-STRING, SOUND, URL, UID, VERSION, CLASS, KEY.

      <text xml:space="preserve">VDM abbreviates the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Development_Method '''V'''ienna '''D'''evelopment '''M'''ethod].
The specification language was known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-IV_(specification_language) Meta-IV].

From the very beginning (around 1978) the intention was to use a language for modelling:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;We stress here... that the meta-language is to be used, not for solving algorithmic problems (on a computer), but for specifying, in an implementation-independent way, the architecture (or models) of software. Instead of using informal English mixed with technical jargon, we offer you a very-high-level 'programming' language. We do not offer an interpreter or compiler for this meta-language. And we have absolutely no intention of ever wasting our time trying to mechanize this meta-language. We wish, as we have done in the past, and as we intend to continue doing in the future, to further develop the notation and to express notions in ways for which no mechanical interpreter system can ever be provided.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=Different schools — different philosophies=
There are three basic schools of the VDM (listed in order of historical emergence):
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Danish school&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;English school&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;Irish school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

We will take a brief look at each in turn.

      <comment>/* Isomorphic models */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">need to add some very simple examples --Михал Орела 15:59, 5 May 2008 (UTC)

=templates=

I have added some basic templates that I have personally used in writing som Wikipedia articles.

* Notes — is for footnotes
* References — is the list of books etc. for the supporting the inline citations and footnotes
* Reading links — is a sort of standard bibliography
* e-Links — is a sort of electronic standard bibliography

(Михал Орела 10:45, 11 August 2008 (UTC))

=Isomorphic models=

I am going to use the examples of an „address book“ and an „art exhibition catalog“ to show that the same model can fit two very different 
applications. 

The „same model“ concept is very abstract. We can call it mathematical. But when there are two models which have the same mathematical shape but differ in their application, they are said to be same-shape (iso-morphic) models.
This text is good enought to go into the main body. (Михал Орела 04:55, 12 August 2008 (UTC))

From the mathematical perspective isomorphic is the precise term we need. It is of Greek origin, well respected and understand by mathematicians. Let us be brave and be different. I have replaced iso-morphic with same-shape. I am not yet brave enough to write sameshape. (Михал Орела 05:00, 12 August 2008 (UTC))

==Design for flight thing==

To motivate the design of the new a„art exhibition catalog“ model I have introduced a simple analogy between airplane and bird.
To be brief I have chose to use a wikitable and to fill in some of the slots.
To add to the fun, I have chosen Airbus and Boeing airplane models as examples
and used Wikipedia to show images of what is meant.
This is a good use of the table for illustration purposes.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian Cuisine]]

'''Mango Chutney''', is a speciality of the South Indian coastal state of Andhra Pradesh.  Mango chutney can be made in many different ways. I will add all the variations I know as I get time. Chutney is a tasty sauce, you can have it with your poppadoms or with your main course.

Below is the recipe for the easiest one.


==Ingredients for Type 1==
* 1 large raw (unripe) mango, peeled and cut into 1&quot; cubes 
* 2 tsp mustard seeds
* 3 tbsp vegetable oil (e.v. olive oil works)
* 1/2 tsp [[Wikipedia:Asafoetida|asafoetida]] (&quot;Heengh&quot; in Hindi, &quot;Perungayum&quot; in Tamil)
* 3-4 dry red chillies
* 2-3 green chillies (you can add more if you want it spicier)
* 1 tsp lime juice (if mango is not sour enough)
* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* 3/4 tbsp salt (adjust to taste)

==Procedure for Type 1==
# Heat the oil in a pan.
# Add mustard seeds, asafoetida, green chillies and red-chillies. Wait till the mustard seeds splutter and remove pan from stove.
# Grind the above mix with mango, lime juice (if needed) turmeric and salt

==Notes, tips, and variations==
# Serve with hot rice or bread
# Works as an excellent spread on a sandwich
# If it is not too spicy then you can serve it as a dip for tortilla chips
# You could also serve with yoghurt/curd
# Typically presented in restaurants in a steel dish with a spoon for serving oneself
# Vary amount of salt and spices as needed
# Delicious with white meat (not raw)

==About Me==
I am a 213 year old male, from the [[US History|United States of America]]. I moved from the [[Dutch Empire|Netherlands]] a few years ago. I have improved my english to such a level that I no longer have an accent. I am interested in history as you might see by looking through my contributions. I have made major contributions to to the [[Dutch Empire]], [[World History]], [[American Revolution]] and [[World War II]]. I am currently thinking about starting a book on [[w:William the Silent|William the Silent]], although it might be hard to write an entire book on him.

==My Blocking Policy==
If I am the one who finds your vandalizim, or any other unconstructive edits, you are very lucky. I will nearly always give someone a warning before blocking them, and even if you do continue to vanadlize, my blocks will start off short. But if you yet still continue, my blocks will slowly grow larger, and if it comes to the point where there is no point in trying to reason with you, I will just block you indefinitely. Vandalizing pages is useless. It will get reverted within a few minutes and I don't really understand why people even bother.

If you see anyone who has been previously warned by me or someone else for unconstructive edits, and still continues with them, please report it to me or [[Wikibooks:Administrators|another admin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and welcome to the History of the Dutch Empire. Here we will cover the history of the Dutch colonies, as well as the Netherlands itself. I encourage anyone to contribute, as many sections currently do not cover enough material. So any help would be appreciated, particularly with my spelling which is not that good.

The coastal provinces of Holland and Zeeland had for a long time prior to Spanish rule been important hubs of the European maritime trade network. Their geographical location provided convenient access to the markets of France, Germany, England and the Baltic. The war with Spain led many financiers and traders to emigrate from Antwerp, capital of Flanders and then one of Europe's most important commercial centres, to Dutch cities, particularly Amsterdam, which became Europe's foremost centre for shipping, banking, and insurance. Efficient access to capital enabled the Dutch in the 1580s to extend their trade networks beyond northern Europe to new markets in the Mediterranean and the Levant. In the 1590s, Dutch ships began to trade with Brazil and the Gold Coast of Africa, and towards the Indian Ocean and the source of the lucrative spice trade. This brought the Dutch into direct competition with Portugal, which had dominated these trade networks for several decades, and had established colonial outposts on the coasts of Brazil, Africa and the Indian Ocean to facilitate them. The rivalry with Portugal, however, was not entirely economic: from 1580 the Portuguese crown had been joined to that of Spain in an &quot;Iberian Union&quot; under Phillip II. By attacking Portuguese overseas possessions, the Dutch forced Spain to divert financial and military resources away from its attempt to quell Dutch independence. Thus this began the Dutch-Portuguese War, which would last until the 1650's.
[[Image:Dutch-Port War Result.PNG|250px|thumb|Results of the Dutch Portuguese War, Green is Dutch]]
In 1594, a &quot;Company of Far Lands&quot; was founded in Amsterdam, with the aim of sending two fleets to the spice islands of Maluku. The first fleet sailed in 1596 and returned in 1597 with a cargo of pepper, which more than covered the costs of the voyage. The second fleet, departing in 1598 and returning in 1599, returned its investors a 400% profit. The success of these voyages led to the founding of a number of companies competing for the trade. The competition was counterproductive to the companies' interests as it threatened to drive up the price of spices at their source in Indonesia while driving them down in Europe.

As a result of the problems caused by intercompany rivalry, the Dutch East India Company (or VOC, from the Dutch Verenigde Oost-Indische) was founded in 1602. The charter awarded to the Company by the States-General granted it sole rights, for an initial period of twenty-one years, to Dutch trade and navigation east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan. The directors of the company, the &quot;Heeren XVII&quot; were given the legal authority to establish &quot;fortresses and strongholds&quot;, to sign treaties, to enlist its own army and navy, and to wage defensive war. The company itself was founded as a joint stock company, similarly to the English East India Company, that had been founded two years earlier. In 1621 the Dutch West India Company was set up and given a twenty-five year monopoly to those parts of the world that were not controlled by its East India counterpart: the Atlantic, the Americas and the west coast of Africa.

The VOC began immediately to take away the string of coastal fortresses that at the time comprised the Portuguese Empire. The settlements were isolated, difficult to reinforce if attacked, and prone to being picked off one by one, and the Dutch enjoyed great success attacking these forts. Amboina was captured from the Portuguese in 1605, but an attack on Malacca the following year narrowly failed in its objective to provide a more strategically located base in the East Indies with favorable monsoon winds. The Dutch found what they were looking for in Jakarta, conquered by Jan Coen in 1619, later renamed Batavia after the Latin name for Holland, and which would become the capital of the Dutch East Indies. Meanwhile, the Dutch continued to drive out the Portuguese from their bases in Asia. Malacca succumbed in 1641 (the first attempt had failed), Colombo in 1656, Ceylon in 1658, Nagappattinam in 1662 and Cranganore and Cochin in 1662. Goa, the capital of the Portuguese Empire in the East, was attacked by the Dutch twice in 1603 and 1610, on both occasions unsuccessfully. While the Dutch were unable in four attempts to capture Macau from where Portugal monopolised the lucrative China-Japan trade, the Japanese shogunate's increasing suspicion of the intentions of the Catholic Portuguese led to their expulsion in 1639. Under the subsequent sakoku policy, for two hundred years the Dutch were the only European power allowed to operate in Japan, confined in 1639 to Hirado and then from 1641 at Deshima.

In 1624 the VOC established Fort Zeelandia in Taiwan. The Dutch originally sought to use their castle Fort Zeelandia at Tayowan (Anping) as a trading base between Japan and China, but soon realized the potential of the huge deer populations that roamed in herds of thousands along the alluvial plains of Taiwan's western regions. The Dutch built a second administrative castle on the main island of Taiwan in 1633 and set out to turn Taiwan into a Dutch colony. They surprssed the villages who resisted them. In 1661, a naval fleet of 1000 warships, led by the Ming loyalist Koxinga, landed at Lu'ermen to attack Taiwan in order to destroy and oust the Dutch from Zeelandia. Following a nine month siege, Koxinga captured the Dutch Fort Zeelandia and defeated the Dutch. Koxinga then forced the Dutch Government to sign a peace treaty at Zeelandia on February 1, 1662, and leave Taiwan.

By the middle of the seventeenth century, the Dutch had overtaken Portugal as the dominant player in the spice and silk trade, and in 1652 founded a colony at Cape Town on the coast of South Africa, as a way-station for its ships on the route between Europe and Asia.

In the Atlantic, the West India Company concentrated on wresting from Portugal its grip on the sugar and slave trade, and on opportunistic attacks on the Spanish treasure fleets on their homeward bound voyage. Bahia on the north east coast of Brazil was captured in 1624 but only held for a year before it was recaptured by a joint Spanish-Portuguese expedition. In 1628, Piet Heyn captured the entire Spanish treasure fleet, and made off with a vast fortune in precious metals and goods that enabled the Company two years later to pay its shareholders a cash dividend of 70%, though the Company was to have relatively few other successes against the Spanish. In 1630, the Dutch occupied the Portuguese sugar-settlement of Pernambuco and over the next few years pushed inland, annexing the sugar plantations that surrounded it. In order to supply the plantations with the manpower they required, an expedition was launched in 1637 from Brazil to capture the Portuguese slaving post of Elmina., and in 1641 successfully captured the Portuguese settlements in Angola. By 1650, the West India Company was firmly in control of both the sugar and slave trades, and had occupied the Caribbean islands of Sint Maarten, Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire in order to guarantee access to the islands' salt-pans.

Unlike in Asia, Dutch successes against the Portuguese in Brazil and Africa were short-lived. Years of settlement had left large Portuguese communities under the rule of the Dutch, who were by nature traders rather than colonisers. In 1645, the Portuguese community at Pernambuco rebelled against their Dutch masters, and by 1654, the Dutch had been ousted from Brazil. In the intervening years, a Portuguese expedition had been sent from Brazil to recapture Luanda in Angola, by 1648 the Dutch were expelled from there also.

On the north-east coast of North America, the West India Company took over a settlement that had been established by the Company of New Netherland (1614-18) at Fort Orange at Albany on the Hudson River, relocated from Fort Nassau which had been founded in 1614. The Dutch had been sending ships annually to the Hudson River to trade fur since Henry Hudson's voyage of 1609. In order to protect its precarious position at Albany from the nearby English and French, the Company founded the fortified town of New Amsterdam in 1625 at the mouth of the Hudson, encouraging settlement of the surrounding areas of Long Island and New Jersey. The fur trade ultimately proved impossible for the Company to monopolise due to the massive illegal private trade in furs, and the settlement of New Netherland was unprofitable. In 1655, the nearby colony of New Sweden on the Delaware River was forcibly absorbed into New Netherland after ships and soldiers were sent to capture it by the Dutch governor, Peter Stuyvesant.

Ever since its inception, the Dutch East India Company had been in competition with its counterpart, the English East India Company, founded two years earlier but with a capital base eight times smaller, for the same goods and markets in the East. In 1619, the rivalry resulted in the Amboyna massacre, when several English Company men were executed by agents of the Dutch. The event remained a source of English resentment for several decades, and in the late 1620s the English Company shifted its focus to from Indonesia to India.

== World History ==
Red4tribe,
I'd like to become a proofreader for the World History Wikibook as well as a contributor to the Renaissance and Ancient History. My qualifications: I'm managing editor for my school newspaper.


== Re:Help ==

Welcome to Wikibooks, I would be happy to help you! I saw your book, and I put a couple cleanup tags on the page to point out that very problem. Here is what we can do to fix this easily, without having to rewrite everything:
1) Use the '''move''' tab at the top of the page to rename it correctly. So you would change a page &quot;PAGENAME&quot; to &quot;Dutch Empire/PAGENAME&quot;
2) on your table of contents, Change the links to say &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Dutch Empire/PAGENAME|PAGENAME]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. They will look the same, but they will point to the correct places.

Also, you should be able to upload images within a few days. It's a restriction that we have because vandals create temporary accounts to upload pornography. It's a lousy restriction for new users, but it saves the whole project a lot of hassle.

If you need anything else, please don't hesitate to ask. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:32, 5 May 2008 (UTC)

:I didn't think there was a restriction on it, but I could be mistaken. I'll fix the pages that are in the wrong places right now. Just make extra certain to name the pages correctly until you have the extra tools you need to make mistakes without having to worry! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:52, 5 May 2008 (UTC)

Okay, I have some information for you. You can create an account at [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]], and you can upload your pictures there immediately. Any pictures on Commons can be used here on Wikibooks directly without having to do anything special. It's just like uploading them here on Wikibooks, except your images can also be used on Wikipedia and other projects as well. Plus, Commons has over 1.5 million pictures, and you might be able to find more pictures for your book that you wouldn't have had otherwise. Check that out and you should be able to add all the pictures you want. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:57, 5 May 2008 (UTC)

== re:[[Dutch Empire]] ==

one of the easiest ways to make navigation for your book is by making a template. The easiest templates to make are just a large banner with a link to the front page of the book. Look at [[Parrot Virtual Machine]] for an example of a recent book that I've created with a simple banner header. Another way is to provide a mini-TOC at the top of your page with links to all the pages in the book. [[E-government]] is one example of this, and [[Zine Making]] is another example of the same concept but with a different style. [[Chess]] is a good example of a book that uses forward/back links. On each page, there are links to the previous page and the next page in both the upper-right corner of the screen and at the bottom of the page (a &quot;page footer&quot; template). [[Control Systems]] is the most &quot;creative&quot; navigation I have ever created myself, it has a combination of links to important pages (TOC, print version, etc), and forward/back links too. 

I can definitely help set you up with a good template, just let me know what features you want for it. 

Also with the print version, a lot of the templates only look good once they are actually printed. Click &quot;Print preview&quot; to see how things will render. I think you will like what you see! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:25, 15 May 2008 (UTC)

:That's a very nice template! Tell me what colors you want it to use, and maybe link me to a dutch flag image, and I'll try to set it up to fit the dutch book. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:43, 15 May 2008 (UTC)

::Okay, check out [[Template:Dutch Empire]]. It still has the links for the spanish book, but check the colors to see if they are right. Should the red be brighter? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:56, 15 May 2008 (UTC)

I've been watching you write this, and have been very impressed! I love history, and this book definitely has potential. I don't think it's featured quality quite yet, but it is getting there. And I saw your comment on Whiteknight's page... glad you liked my Spain TOC box! Anything you'd like help with, I'd be glad to work with you on.

== re:Similar Vandals ==

Thanks for the heads-up, and thank you for cleaning up after these vandals. If you see any more instances of this, please let me know. I haven't blocked these particular IPs yet, I'm hoping that they come back and give us more information that we can use to block them all. 

I've also contacted the &quot;authorities&quot;, and have alerted the other projects to look for similar vandalism patterns. Hopefully we can get this whole issue resolved soon. Thanks again! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:27, 20 May 2008 (UTC)

== welcoming ==

Hey Red4tribe, I'm glad to see you've been welcoming people to Wikibooks. Just a small suggestion: when you're welcoming somebody, it reduces the load on the servers if you substitute the template rather than using it directly. So instead of using &lt;nowiki&gt; {{welcome}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;, use &lt;nowiki&gt; {{subst:welcome}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;. What that does is puts the code for the welcome template into the person's talk page so the server doesn't have to grab it every time someone enters his or her talk page.

Have a great day! [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 01:37, 24 May 2008 (UTC)

== Nomination ==

Not sure what you did here, but the template message is strange. When you use {{tlxs|nld}} on an image like [[:Image:599px-The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg]] it gives you text to paste into the user's talk page. In that case it should be &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Image copyright|Image:599px-The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|~~~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; - that will produce the right text every time. Most of the other template messages you use when patrolling do the same thing. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:25, 31 May 2008 (UTC)

I do have a question that I feel you'd answer. How do I suggest a change to Wikibooks? The change is that the navigation for next/previous chapter should also appear at the bottom of pages. The reason being that scrolling all the way to the top to goto the next chapter is retarded. And, if possible, I'd like this fix named after me. If not that's ok too ;).

== +rollbacker and +patroller ==

In case you haven't noticed, [[User:Mike.lifeguard]] just gave you these rights. (Sorry mike, if you wanted to post a nice &quot;welcome!&quot; message here!). When you view an edit diff, you will see a link that says [rollback], and you are also able to do new page patrolling (something that doesn't get done enough around here). If you have any questions about things, let us know. As a few points:
# A strong vandal will make bad edits rapidly. It is more important to contact an admin to have the vandal blocked then it is to clean up the mess. Post a quick &quot;help!&quot; message on [[WB:AN]] first, then start rolling back vandal edits. 
# If you notice patterns to vandalism from different accounts, they might be coming from the same source. A checkuser can determine this, and block the source for good. Again, post a message with your findings to [[WB:AN]] to get the proper help. 
# One day, you're going to be the admin answering questions and responding to &quot;help me!&quot; pleas. Set a good example now that other users can follow, and in the future things will be that much easier for you to deal with.
If you have any questions or anything, you can ask me or any of the other current admins. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:44, 4 June 2008 (UTC)

I was wondering if I could become member of the project [[World History]]. I have been editing at WP the last few months, you can check my account here: [[w:User:A.Cython|A.Cython]] and one of my main interests is history (mainly ancient and medieval). If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask. I can be regular contributor and proofreader. [[User:A.Cython|A.Cython]] ([[User talk:A.Cython|talk]]) 01:19, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

:::* The image should contain the most significant cultures, and if possible different eras

== Re:[[w:WP:SNOW]] ==

In general, we don't like to have a lot of policy around here. Even if you set it up as a &quot;guideline&quot; instead of a policy, I doubt many people would vote for it. A few things that you could do:
# Write a draft of the guideline here, use {{tlx|Proposed}} to mark it as a proposal. Post a couple notes on places like [[WB:CHAT]] and [[WB:BB]] to get some feedback from the community about it.
# An easier thing to do (and probably a better thing) would be to copy it into a page in your user namespace, such as [[User:Red4tribe/SNOW]], and use the {{tlx|Essay}} template instead. This way people can find it if they want to, the community doesnt need to approve it (which they probably wouldn't anyway), and we have it as a handy reference.

It is an interesting idea, but the bot would need a list of uncategorized pages to work from in the first place. When it found a page, it would have to determine whether the page was a top-level page &quot;BookName&quot;, or a sub-page &quot;Bookname/Pagename&quot;. The subpages can be tagged with {{tlx|BookCat}} or something similar, the top-level pages should be tagged with {{tlx|Alphabetical}} (if they aren't already).

I have apparently not been using the image upload feature properly.

How do I access the image properties inspector to make adjustments to the licensing?

== [[World History]] and [[Ancient History]] ==

I know Ancient civilizations aren't exactly your area of interest, but I was wondering if I could have your input on something, as someone interested in history who has done a fine job expanding our [[history bookshelf]].

The [[Ancient History]] book has issues with scope. I believe the original intent was to stop the book at the fall of Rome, but &quot;ancient&quot; civilizations continued to exist elsewhere in the world for centuries after, such as the American civilizations that did not collapse until the sixteenth centuries. I therefore think it would be better for there to be no &quot;Ancient&quot; History book at all, but rather to merge it into the [[World History]] book. This would certainly solve the scope issues, as the World History book's scope would not need to be defined by time. Thoughts?

:If you look at the first 10-12 chapters of World History, they correspond rather well with those of Ancient History. We could merge histories and just pick and choose what is best from each one. The chapters of Ancient History are on the left, and the corresponding chapters of World History are on the right:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
'''Ancient History'''&lt;br&gt;
Introduction&lt;br&gt;

Hello.

Hi,  I would like to contribute to the World History book by proofreading?  I understand that I should contact you?

Thanks for the comment. I like the concept of the book so I will probably be working on it a lot when I have the time but right now because of school, I'm not sure how much I will be able contribute. I didn't want to add my name to the author list if I wasn't going to be adding a lot over a long period of time. I also want to ask you how much information you want on the pages. 

I looked at your work on George Washington before I started. Is that about the amount of info your looking for, or do you want more than that, I want to make sure I get it right when I start building onto the profiles so that they look uniform throughout. --[[User:Xxagile|Xxagile]] ([[User talk:Xxagile|talk]]) 15:57, 31 August 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

I've noticed your edits to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter|the Muggles' Guide]], and it looks like you have some good ideas there. Thanks for your contributions, and good luck! [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:11, 6 May 2008 (UTC)</text>

== Exercises ==

Obtain the names of all physicians that have performed a medical procedure they have ''never'' been certified to perform.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
 SELECT Name 
   FROM Physician 
  WHERE EmployeeID IN 
        (
          SELECT Physician FROM Undergoes U WHERE NOT EXISTS 
             (
                SELECT * FROM Trained_In 
                 WHERE Treatment = Procedure 
                   AND Physician = U.Physician
             )
        );

 SELECT P.Name FROM 
  Physician AS P,    
  (SELECT Physician, Procedure FROM Undergoes 
     EXCEPT 
     SELECT Physician, Treatment FROM Trained_in) AS Pe
  WHERE P.EmployeeID=Pe.Physician
}}


Same as the previous query, but include the following information in the results: Physician name, name of procedure, date when the procedure was carried out, name of the patient the procedure was carried out on.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=
 SELECT P.Name AS Physician, Pr.Name AS Procedure, U.Date, Pt.Name AS Patient 
   FROM Physician P, Undergoes U, Patient Pt, Procedure Pr
   WHERE U.Patient = Pt.SSN
     AND U.Procedure = Pr.Code
     AND U.Physician = P.EmployeeID
     AND NOT EXISTS 
               (
                 SELECT * FROM Trained_In T
                 WHERE T.Treatment = U.Procedure 
                 AND T.Physician = U.Physician
               );

 SELECT P.Name,Pr.Name,U.Date,Pt.Name FROM 
  Physician AS P,    
  Procedure AS Pr,
  Undergoes AS U,
  Patient AS Pt,
  (SELECT Physician, Procedure FROM Undergoes 
     EXCEPT 
     SELECT Physician, Treatment FROM Trained_in) AS Pe  
  WHERE P.EmployeeID=Pe.Physician AND Pe.Procedure=Pr.Code AND Pe.Physician=U.Physician AND Pe.Procedure=U.Procedure AND U.Patient=Pt.SSN
}}


Obtain the names of all physicians that have performed a medical procedure that they are certified to perform, but such that the procedure was done at a date (Undergoes.Date) after the physician's certification expired (Trained_In.CertificationExpires).

Obtain the information for appointments where a patient met with a physician other than his/her primary care physician. Show the following information: Patient name, physician name, nurse name (if any), start and end time of appointment, examination room, and the name of the patient's primary care physician.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=

The Patient field in Undergoes is redundant, since we can obtain it from the Stay table. There are no constraints in force to prevent inconsistencies between these two tables. More specifically, the Undergoes table may include a row where the patient ID does not match the one we would obtain from the Stay table through the Undergoes.Stay foreign key. Select all rows from Undergoes that exhibit this inconsistency.

{{ExerciseSolution|text=

Obtain the names of all patients (also include, for each patient, the name of the patient's primary care physician), such that \emph{all} the following are true:
* The patient has been prescribed some medication by his/her primary care physician.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mitosis and meiosis are both forms of reproduction. Mitosis is asexual reproduction and requires only one parent cell; meiosis is sexual and so requires two parent cells. Mitosis produces two identical cells (clones), while meiosis produces four genetically variable cells. Meiosis occurs only in the gonads, while mitosis occurs all over the body in somatic cells. Mitosis produces 2 diploid (2n) cells- that is, they have the normal number of chromosomes- and meiosis produces 4 hapliod (n) cells. Haploid cells have only half the normal number of chromosomes. Meiosis 1, meiosis 2, and mitosis all have the four phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, in that order. Meiosis one is followed by interkinesis, the resting stage. Interkinesis is the same as interphase, which takes place in mitosis, except no replication occurs. Crossing over and independent assortment of chromosomes takes place in meiosis, but does not happen in mitosis. The functions of mitosis are growth, repair, regeneration, and asexual reproduction. The functions of meiosis include genetic variation and sexual reproduction.

The Batavian Republic was proclaimed on January 19, 1795, a day after the fled to England. The invading French revolutionary army, however, found quite a few allies in the Netherlands. Eight years before, the Orange faction had won the upper hand in a small, but nasty civil war. Many of the revolutionaries, who where full of the ideals from the American and French Revolutions, had fled to France and now returned eager to realize their ideals.

The new Republic took its name from the Batavi, a Germanic tribe who had lived in the area of the Netherlands in Roman times and who were then romantically regarded as the ancestors of the Dutch nation.

The new Republic did not experience a reign of terror or become a dictatorship. Changes were imposed from outside after Napoleon Bonaparte's rise to power. In 1805 Napoleon installed the shrewd politician Schimmelpenninck as raadspensionaris (&quot;Grand Pensionary&quot;, President of the republic) to strengthen the executive branch. 

In 1801, Napoleon imposed a new constitution on the republic, which was financially drained by French requisitions. 

As a French vassal state, the Batavian Republic was an ally of France in its wars against Great Britain. This led to the loss of most of the Dutch Empire and a defeat of the Dutch fleet in the Battle of Camperdown in 1797. South Africa (cape colony), Sri Lanka, India and Berbice wer occupied by the British between 1795 and 1802. After peace was made between Britain and France in 1802, Berbice and South Africa were returned to the Dutch. However, after the outbreak of war again in 1803, Berbice was occupied and South Africa followed a few years later, in 1806. The collapse of Dutch trade caused a series of economic crises. Only in the second half of the 19th century would Dutch wealth be restored to its previous level.

In 1806 Napoleon forced Schimmelpenninck to resign and declared his brother, Louis Bonaparte, King, of the new Kingdom of Holland.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cquote|To play Holland, you have to play the Dutch.|||Ruud Gullit}} Kingdom of Holland was set up by Napoleon Bonaparte as a puppet kingdom for his third brother, Louis Bonaparte, in order to better control the Netherlands in 1806. The name of the leading province, Holland, was now taken for the whole country. In 1807 Prussian East Frisia and Jever were added to the kingdom but in 1809, after an English invasion, Holland had to give over all territories south of the river Rhine to France.
[[Image:LouisBonaparte Holland.jpg|thumb|200px|Louis Bonaparte, King of Holland]]
King Louis did not perform to Napoleon's expectations, he tried to serve Dutch interests instead of his brother's . Louis had learned the Dutch language, and proclaimed himself to be a &quot;Hollander&quot; as soon as he stepped into the country. In 1810, under heavy pressure from his brother, Louis abdicated and the Kingdom was annexed into the French Empire.  

The kingdom of Holland covered the area of present day Netherlands, with the exception of Limburg, and parts of Zeeland, which were French territory. East Frisia (in present day Germany) was also part of the kingdom. 

In 1810 the British invaded the Dutch island of Java, and their other possessions in the East Indies. This started the Anglo-Dutch Java War. By the end of 1811 the entire island was under British control.

In 1810 the Kingdom of Holland was dissolved by Napoleon. The 1812 campaign in Russia proved to be calamitous for Napoleon, but it was a complete disaster for the Dutch army. Of the 20,000+ Dutch soldiers serving in Russia, only a few hundred returned home (most had served with the rearguard at the Beresina). As Russian troops crossed the Dutch borders in 1813, a full-scale rebellion against the French broke out and the son of William V (who had since died), Willam Frederik, returned and became Willam I of a new Kingdom of the Netherlands. He went to The Hague to be granted the title Sovereign of The Netherlands on 2 December, 1813. 

When Napoleon returned for the 100 Days, Dutch troops were sent to the front under control of William Frederick George Louis, future King of the Netherlands. During the Congress of Vienna, King William I succesfully won the peace and completed his dream of a United Netherlands by uniting the Southern Netherlands in the Kingdom. Java and Dutch Guiana(Suriname) were both returned to the Dutch, but Berbice, today Guyana, was ceded to Britain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Evolution of the Dutch East Indies.png|thumb|300px|Dutch Expansion in the East Indies]]
==VOC Conquests==
By 1669, the VOC was the richest private company the world had ever seen, with over 150 merchant ships, 40 warships, 50,000 employees, a private army of 10,000 soldiers, and a dividend payment of 40% on the original investment. 

The VOC was temporarily forced to halt trade in Europe during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, and this resulted in the spike in the price of pepper, and the shares of the VOC dropped. During the later 1600's the VOC gained monopolies over the sugar, rice, opium trade in the East Indies. The VOC was able to control trade on the island of Celebes (present day Sulawesi).  Around 1720, the VOC began to decline, and would never again be as powerful as they were in the 1600's.
[[File:Flag of the Dutch East Indies Company.svg|thumb|250px|The VOC flag]]
During the early 1700's the VOC fought three wars of Javanese Succession. The first one resulted in the Dutch being allowed by the Sultan of Mataram to build forts anywhere on the Island of Java. The Second War of Javanese Succession resulted in further concessions on Java to the Dutch. The Third, and most decisive war, resulted in the Northern Coast of Java being put under control by the VOC, and Mataram was divided into different kingdoms. Banten, meanwhile, had become a territory of the VOC in 1753. During the end of the 1700's the VOC was able to establish control over a few small parts of Celebes.

==Agreement With Britain==
The bankrupt Dutch East India Company was liquidated on 1 January 1800, and its territorial possessions were nationalised as the Dutch East Indies. Anglo-Dutch rivalry in Southeast Asia continued to fester over the port of Singapore, which had been ceded to the British East India Company in 1819 by the sultan of Johore. The Dutch claimed that a treaty signed with the sultan's predecessor the year earlier had granted them control of the region. However, the impossibility of removing the British from Singapore, which was becoming an increasingly important centre of trade, became apparent to the Dutch, and the disagreement was resolved with the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. Under its terms, the Netherlands ceded Malacca and their bases in India to the British, and recognised the British claim to Singapore. In return, the British handed over Bencoolen, all of its property on Sumatra and agreed not to sign treaties with rulers in the &quot;islands south of the Straits of Singapore&quot;. Thus the archipelago was divided into two spheres of influence: a British one, on the Malay Peninsula, and a Dutch one in the East Indies.

==Java==
By 1800 all of Java was under Dutch rule excluding two Dutch vassal states. During the VOC period, the Dutch depended on the cooperation of the Javanese aristocratic class, which allowed them to rule indirectly. After the brief British rule, the Dutch came back and many Javanese found that they were in debt. 

In 1825 tensions broke out, Pangeran Diponegoro had started the revolt in 1825 after the Dutch decision to build a road across a sacred tomb. The troops of Diponegoro were very successful in the beginning, controlling the middle of Java and besieging Yogyakarta. Furthermore the Javanese population was supportive of Diponegoro's cause, whereas the Dutch colonial authorities were initially very indecisive. However, as the Java war prolonged, Diponegoro had difficulties in maintaining the numbers of his troops, and Dutch colonial army was able to fill its ranks with troops from Celebes and later on with troops from the Netherlands. The Dutch commander, General De Kock, was able to end the siege of Yogyakarta on September 25, 1825. In 1827 a guerrilla war began after the Dutch had gained the upperhand.

In 1830 the Dutch invited Diponegoro to come and negotiate, but he was arrested during the meeting, and later exiled. After his exile, the rebellion fell apart. It is estimated 8,000 Dutch were killed, and possibly as many as 200,000 Javanese killed.

==Sumatra==
Dutch expansion began first in Sumatra. By 1823, the eastern part of the island, including the important city of Palembang, was under Dutch control. In 1821 the Padri War broke out, and by the 1830's, western Sumatra had also fallen under Dutch control.  Between the 1870s and the end of the century, colonial troops also defeated the fierce Batak ethnic group, living north of the Minangkabau. 
[[File:Batavia harbour canal.jpg|thumb|250px|Batavia, 1870]]
The Dutch colonial government declared war on Aceh on 26 March 1873. Aceh is located on the Northern part of Sumatra. An expedition under Major General Köhler was sent out in 1874, which was able to occupy most of the coastal areas of the country. The Sultan requested received military aid from Italy and the United Kingdom in Singapore, and the army was therefore rapidly modernized. Aceh soldiers managed to kill Köhler. A second expedition led by General Van Swieten managed to capture the kraton (sultan's palace): the Sultan had however been warned, and had escaped capture. Intermittent guerrilla warfare continued in the region for ten years, with many victims on both sides. Around 1880 the Dutch strategy changed, and rather than continuing the war, they now concentrated on defending areas they already controlled, which were mostly limited to the capital city (modern Banda Aceh), and the harbor town of Ulee Lheue.

In 1880 the Dutch declared the war as over, however, it broke out again in 1883. A British ship had crashed in Aceh, and the Sultan had used the sailors as hostages. Infuriated, the Dutch and British launched a joint invasion and forced the Sultan to had over the hostages. Open war was declared soon after. 

The Dutch achevied little success over the next few years, and an attempt to ally with a local failed. During the early 1890's the Dutch managed to gather valuable information from the Aceh government after Dr Snouck Hurgronje of the University of Leiden, then the leading Dutch expert on Islam, gained the trust of many Aceh leaders. He turned his information over to the Dutch. 

In 1898 Major J.B. van Heutsz, was proclaimed governor of Aceh, and with his lieutenant, later Dutch Prime Minister Hendrikus Colijn, would finally conquer most of Aceh. In an attempt to crush remaining resistance, a few villages were burned and about 3,000 Acehnese were killed. By 1904 Aceh was under Dutch control(although a limited guerrilla resistance remained), and had an indigenous government that cooperated with the colonial state. Estimated total casualties on the Aceh side range from 50,000 to 100,000 dead, and over a million wounded.

==Celebes==
At the time of the end of the VOC, only a small part of Celebes, mostly the coasts, were under Dutch rule. The Dutch gradually expanded into the island, by means of treaties and wars, and by the late 1800s only the two states of Bone, and Gowa were still independent. Both states were largely dominated by the Dutch. In 1905 Bone lost its independence, and in 1911 the same happened with Gowa. 

==Borneo==
Although the VOC had controlled the trade of Borneo for some time, they did not have any control over the island itself. Dutch influence was established on the west coast in the early 1800s. During the early to mid 1800's the Dutch conquered the Malay city-states on the south coast of Borneo. The Dutch called their new colony Kalimantan, from a native word that means &quot;River of Diamonds.&quot; In 1850, the Dutch launched an offensive into western Borneo. Over the next few decades the Dutch gradually pushed deeper into the huge island of Borneo. In 1905 the final borders were established with the British to separate North and South Borneo.

==New Guinea==
In 1828 the Dutch formally claimed the west part of the island. The first establishment was in Merkusoord/Fort Du Bus, in 1828 and abandoned in 1836. The Netherlands established trading posts in the area after Britain and Germany recognised the Dutch claims in treaties of 1885 and 1895. The first permanent administrative posts, at Fakfak and Manokwari, were not set up until 1898.

In 1923, the Nieuw Guinea Beweging (New Guinea Movement) was created in the Netherlands by ultra right-wing supporters calling for Dutchmen to create a tropical Netherlands in Papua. This prewar movement without full government support was largely unsuccessful in its drive, but did coincide with the development of a plan for Eurasian settlement of the Dutch Indies to establish Dutch farms in northern West New Guinea.

==Smaller Islands==
During this time, the lesser islands came under Dutch control. Islands, such as the Moluccas had been under Dutch control for centerius. Other islands such as Nias had resisted attempts by the Dutch to force them under their control. Nias would finally fall in 1863. It was not until 1908 that Bali, just off the east coast of Java, would fall. The island of Sumba would not fall until even a year later. 

It was by this time that the Dutch East Indies would reach their greatest extent, stretching over 3,000 miles from Sumatra, to New Guinea.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Dutch West India company was abolished in 1791, and its colonies in Suriname and the Caribbean brought under the direct rule of the state. The economies of the Dutch colonies in the Caribbean had been based on the smuggling of goods and slaves into Spanish America, but with the end of the slave trade in 1814 and the independence of the new nations of South and Central America from Spain, profitability rapidly declined. Dutch traders moved en masse from the islands to the United States or Latin America, leaving behind a small populations with little income and which required subsidies from the Dutch government. The Antilles were combined under one administration with Suriname from 1828 to 1845. Slavery was not abolished in the Dutch Caribbean colonies until 1863, long after those of Britain and France, though by this time only 6,500 slaves remained. In Suriname, slave holders demanded compensation from the Dutch government for freeing slaves, whilst in Sint Maarten, abolition of slavery in the French half in 1848 led slaves in the Dutch half to take their own freedom. In Suriname, after the abolition of slavery, Chinese workers were encouraged to immigrate as indentured labourers, as were Javanese, between 1890 and 1939.

USR HANDLE2BTN

=== Description === 

If ctrlRecHandle&amp; is the handle to the Control Record of a FutureBasic-created button or scrollbar, USR HANDLE2BTN returns the ID number of the button or scrollbar (this is the number that your program assigned to the button or scrollbar in the BUTTON statement or SCROLL BUTTON statement). USR HANDLE2BTN returns the ID number regardless of whether the control is in the current output window or in a different window; if the control is in the current output window, then USR HANDLE2BTN is the inverse of the BUTTON&amp; function. If ctrlRecHandle&amp; is not a valid handle to a Control Record, or it's the handle to a control that was created by other means than a BUTTON statement or a SCROLL BUTTON statement, then the value returned by USR HANDLE2BTN is undefined.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==
The revolution had many causes; principally the treatment of the French-speaking Catholic Walloons in the Dutch-dominated United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the difference of religion between the Belgians and their Dutch king. The King William I was a Calvinist. The Belgians had little influence over the economy and resented Dutch control. The Belgians also felt that they were under-represented Lower Assembly.

==The Riot==
Catholic partisans watched with excitement the unfolding of the July Revolution in France, details of which were swiftly reported in the newspapers.On the night of August 25, 1830, following a performance of Daniel Auber's sentimental and patriotic opera La Muette de Portici. The crowd poured into the streets after the performance, shouting patriotic slogans, and swiftly took possession of government buildings.
[[Image:Wappers belgian revolution.jpg|thumb|275px|The 10 Days Campaign]]
King William I attempted to restore the established order by force, but the royal army under Prince Frederick was unable to retake Brussels in bloody street fighting, September 23 to 26. The following day a provisional government was declared in Brussels September 26, 1830; a declaration of independence followed on October 4. In November a National Congress assembled in Brussels, and on February 7, 1831, the Belgian constitution was proclaimed. After Louis, Duke de Nemours had refused an offer of the Belgian crown, Erasme Louis Surlet de Chokier was appointed regent of Belgium on February 25, 1831. He served as regent until Leopold I took the oath as King of the Belgians on July 21, 1831.

==The Ten Days Campaign==
In the morning of August 2, 1831, the Dutch crossed the &quot;border&quot; near Poppel. The Belgian scouts had noticed the troops and a number of roads were blocked by cutting the trees around them. Within the first two days the Dutch Army has retaken Nieuwenkerk, Zondereigen, Ravels and Turnhout. On August 4 Dutch troops took Antwerp, and the Brabantic flag was taken down and the Dutch flag was hoisted. The Prince of Orange however demanded that the flag be taken down again, because it would symbolise occupation rather than a restoration of the Dutch power.

During this time the Dutch army continued its advance, capturing the cities of  Geel, Diest, Boutersem, Hasselt, and Leuven. It appeared for the Belgians that the revolt was over and they would fall back under Dutch control, however they asked for help from the French on August 9th, and on the next day French troops crossed the border. With Russia being unable to give help,(they were busy surprssing the Polish Revolution) the Dutch were forced to agree to a ceasfire on August 12th. The last Dutch troops returned to the Netherlands around August 20th although Antwerp would remain occupied until 1832.

==European Reaction==
The European Powers were divided over the Belgian cry for independence. France supported Belgian Independence, while  Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Great Britain all supported the Dutch. However, in the end, none of the European powers sent troops to aid the Dutch government, partly because of rebellions within some of their own borders. 

==Independence==
On December 20, 1830, the European powers recognized Belgium's de facto independence from the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It was not until April 19, 1839 however, that the Treaty of London signed by the European powers (including the Netherlands) recognized Belgium as an independent and neutral country comprising West Flanders, East Flanders, Brabant, Antwerp, Hainaut, Namur, and Liège, as well as half of Luxembourg and Limburg. The Dutch held onto Maastricht, and Limburg with its large coalfields.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Invasion==
On the morning of May 10, 1940 the Dutch awoke to the sound of aircraft engines roaring in the sky. Nazi Germany had commenced operation Fall Gelb and attacked the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Luxembourg: in the case of the Low Countries without a declaration of war given before hostilities.

The Luftwaffe was guaranteed air superiority over the Netherlands. The Dutch Air Force, the Militaire Luchtvaartafdeling (ML), had a strength of 144 combat aircraft, half of which were destroyed within the first day of operations. The remainder was dispersed and accounted for only a handful of Luftwaffe aircraft shot down. In total the ML flew a mere 332 sorties losing 110 of its aircraft.

The German 18th Army secured all the strategically vital bridges in and toward Rotterdam, which penetrated Fortress Holland(The main area of Dutch defence) and bypassed the New Water Line from the south. However, an operation organised separately by the Luftwaffe to seize the Dutch seat of government, Battle for The Hague, ended in complete failure. The airfields surrounding the city (Ypenburg, Ockenburg, and Valkenburg) were taken with heavy casualties and transport aircraft losses, only to be lost that same day to counterattacks by the two Dutch reserve infantry divisions. The Dutch captured or killed 1,745 Fallschirmjäger, shipping 1,200 prisoners to England. The Luftwaffe's Transportgruppen also suffered heavily. Transporting the German paratroops had cost it 125 Ju 52 destroyed and 47 damaged, representing 50 percent of the fleet's strength. Most of these transports were destroyed on the ground, and some whilst trying to land under fire, as German forces had not properly secured the airfields and landing zones.
[[Image:Netherlands-map1-en.gif|thumb|350px|The German Advance Day by Day]]
The French 7th Army failed to block German armoured reinforcements of the 9th Panzer Division; they reached Rotterdam on 13 May. That same day in the east the Dutch retreated from the Grebbe Line to the New Water Line, when a counter-offensive to contain a German breach had failed.

An attempt by the Germans to cross the Afsluitdijk in the North, a thin dike that stretches from Friesland to North-Holland, failed. The German troops were unable to pass the Dutch fortifications and had to withdraw to their original positions.

The Dutch Army, still largely intact, surrendered in the evening of 15 May after the Bombing of Rotterdam by Heinkel He 111s of Kampfgeschwader 54 on the 14th killing about 900 civilians, and threats to do the same to other major Dutch Cities. They considered their strategic situation to have become hopeless and feared a further destruction of the major Dutch cities. However, the Dutch troops in Zealand and the colonies continued the fight while Queen Wilhelmina established a government-in-exile in Britain.

Dutch, Australian, British and United States forces fought the Japanese during the Dutch East Indies campaign. From January 1, 1942, Allied forces in South East Asia formed the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM), under the British General Archibald Wavell. ABDACOM's control of the &quot;Malay Barrier&quot; (also known as the &quot;East Indies Barrier&quot;) was considered vital to the Allies' global strategy. However, Japanese advances over the next several weeks split the Allied forces, and ABDACOM was dissolved on February 25. Allied operations in Indonesia (except Sumatra) were later controlled by the South West Pacific Area command, under General Douglas MacArthur. 

==Borneo==
In 1941, Borneo was divided between the Dutch East Indies and British crown colonies. The northern part was udner British control and the southern, and larger part, war under Dutch control. 
[[Image:Pacific War - Dutch East Indies 1941-42 - Map.jpg|thumb|300px|Japanese Invasion]]
On December 13, 1941 the invasion began, soon after the Japanese bombing of Peral Harbor. The lightly defended North Borneo was overrun by the Japanese in early January. 

On December 22, the Japanese bombed the Dutch defences, and occupied their oil fields. The Dutch, and remaining British troops retreated into the Jungle covered mountains where they began a 10 week long Gurellia War campaign before surrendering in April of 1942. During January, on an island off of Boerno, 1,300 Dutch troops who had burned oil fields to prevent them from falling into Japanese hands, were all exuecuted, many of them were killed by samurais.

==Manado==
On the island of Celebes (now known as Sulawesi),1,500 Dutch troops were attacked by a much larger force of Japanese on the Minahasa peninsula. The Japanese launched a combined air and ground attack, in an attempt to capture a strategic airfield. After two days of fighting, seeing that the battle was lost, the Dutch troops retreated inland and started a Gurillea War. By the end of February, most had been captured and many of them were executed. 

==Ambon==
On January 30 the Japanese launched an attack on the island of Ambon. The island was first bombed, and the invaded by sea. Within a day of the Japanese landings, the Dutch detachments in their vicinity were overrun and/or had withdrawn. On January 31, after the fall of Batugong, the Japanese surrounded the Dutch troops, and they were forced to surrender. 

After dawn on February 2, the main Australian force on Nona plateau, commanded by Lieutenant Bill Jinkins, was in danger of encirclement. Jinkins ordered a withdrawal to Amahusu, where he became aware that the Dutch had surrendered. By the morning of February 3, the Australians around Eri were struggling to cope with increasing air and naval attacks, wounded Australians, the influx of Dutch personnel, diminishing supplies and widespread fatigue. Soon after it was agreed that they would surrender. 

Allied casualties in the battle were relatively light. However, at intervals for a fortnight after the surrender, Imperial Japanese Navy personnel chose more than 300 Australian and Dutch prisoners of war at random and executed them. This was in revenge for the sinking of a Japanese Minesweeper.

==Palembang== 
On February 13 the Japanese launched an attack on Palembang, Sumatra. They dropped paratroopers over strategic airfields around the area. Although they failed to take the Airfield, they did manage to take the entire complex of an oil refinery, undamaged. The Allies launched a counter attack an retook the refinery, but with heavy casualties. 

On the morning of February 13, a river boat commandeered by the British Royal Navy, HMS Li Wo — under Lieutenant Thomas Wilkinson — ferrying personnel and equipment between Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, ran into the Japanese fleet carrying the main invasion force. On February 15, an ABDA naval force of five cruisers, HNLMS De Ruyter, HNLMS Java and HNLMS Tromp, HMS Exeter, HMAS Hobart and 10 destroyers, under Admiral Karel Doorman, made an abortive attempt to intercept the Japanese force. Planes from Ryujo and land-based aircraft made a series of attacks on the Allied ships, forcing them to withdraw to the south of Sumatra.

As the Japanese landing force approached Sumatra. The remaining Allied aircraft attacked it, and the Japanese transport ship Otawa Maru was sunk. Hurricanes flew up the rivers, machine-gunning Japanese landing craft.

However, on the afternoon of February 15, it was ordered that all Allied aircraft were ordered to Java, where a major Japanese attack was anticipated, and the Allied air units had withdrawn from southern Sumatra by the evening of February 16, 1942. Other personnel were evacuated by ships to Java or India.

==Timor==
During the night of February 19–February 20, the Imperial Japanese Army's 228th Regimental Group, under the command of Col. Sadashichi Doi, began landing in Timor. Portuguese Timor had been occupied by the Dutch in the previous year. During the night, Dutch and Australian troops managed to inflict heavy casualties onto the Japanese invaders, but failed to stop them. The Australian commandos withdrew south and east into the mountainous interior, and about 200 Dutch East Indies troops, headed southwest toward the border with Dutch Timor. It is believed that all but one of the POW's was exucuted.

On the same night, Allied forces in Netherlands Timor were under extremely intense air attacks. This caused the Australian Airforce to withdraw to Australia. The bombing was followed up by the landing of the main body of the Japanese invasion force, on the undefended southwest side of the island. Light tanks were landed to support the Japanese infantry, and the force advanced north, cutting off the Dutch positions in the west. 

As the Dutch retreated, the destruction of an airfield was ordered, however, Japanese Paratroops were dropped onto the field. Despite killing most of the Japanese paratroopers, the Dutch surrendered due to the fact they were low on ammunition. 

By the end of February, the Japanese controlled most of Netherlands Timor. However, many Australian and Dutch troops had withdrawn to the South part of the island and began a Guerrilla War. During August, Japanese forces began to burn and/or bomb villages believed to have assisted the Allies, with huge civilian casualties. During the summer of 1942 the Japanese launched an assault deeper into the island, and difficult campaign, forced the remaining allied troops to withdraw in February of 1943. By the end of the campaign, between 40,000-70,000 civilians of Timor had been killed.

==1st Java Sea==
[[Image:Hr. Ms. De Ruyter (1936).jpg|thumb|250px|The Dutch Ship ''De Ruyter'']]
In an attempt to stop the Japanese fleet, which was going to land at Java, the Dutch-American-British-Australian fleets set off to find the Japanese fleet. The fleets sighted each other on February 27. During the engagement, the allied ships ''Kortenaer'' and ''Electra'' were both sunk.  Within two hours after engagement, the Allied Fleet broke off from battle covered by a smoke screen laid by 4 American destroyers. As they withdrew, the allied ships ran into mines, which sunk '' Jupiter ''. During the night the two fleets encountered each other again, and the Dutch ships ''De Ruyter''(named after Michiel de Ruyter) and ''Java'' were sunk. During this time, the Dutch commander Karel Doorman was killed.

==Java== 
The Japanese troops landed at three points on Java shore on March 1, 1942. The West Java invasion convoy landed on Bantam Bay near Merak and Eretan Wetan. The West Java convoy had previously fought in the Battle of Sunda Strait, a few hours prior to the landings.

===West Java Campaign===

On March 1, the invaders set up new headquarters at Serang. On March 2nd, a Japanese detachment was sent to cut off an allied escape route. The detachment arrived at Rangkasbitung and continued to Leuwiliang, 24 kilometres (15 mi) west of Buitenzorg. The Australian and American troops put up stiff resistance, destroying many Japanese trucks and tanks and holding up the Japanese for two days before being forced to withdraw. 

Around the same time, two other detachments headed westwards to Madja (Maja) and Balaradja(Balaraja). They found many of the bridges already destroyed by the retreating Dutch and were forced to find other routes; some units took the opportunity to make for Buitenzorg. 

On March 4, the Dutch commander decided to withdraw his forces from Batavia and Buitenzorg to reinforce the defence of Bandoeng. The following evening Dutch troops in Batavia surrendered. By dawn of March 6, the Japanese troops had attacked Buitenzorg, which was guarded by the KNIL(Royal Dutch East Indies Army). In the morning Buitenzorg was occupied, while a large number of Allied soldiers had retreated to Bandoeng. The Japanese continued to pursue the Dutch troops for the next 3 days, capturing  Tjiandjoer and Tjimahi. On the same day Bandoeng  was also occupied by the Japanese. 

===East Java Campaign===

The Japanese first landed on March 1,on Kragan, a small village in East Java. The Dutch forces who resisted the landing were quickly subdued. 

The Japanese occupied Tjepoe on March 2 and occupied Bodjonegoro on March 3. The Japanese proceeded further and overwhelmed the Dutch defences at the Ngawi Regency, Tjaroeban, Ngandjoek, Kertosono, Kediri and Djombang. 

At Porong, near Surabaya, Dutch and American troops gave fierce resistance to the incoming Japanese. Eventually the Allied troops under Major-General Gustav A. Ilgen had to retreat to the island of Madura upon the completion of demolition of the city's infrastructure. On the evening of March 9, Major-General Ilgen, commander of the KNIL in East Java, signed the instrument of surrender.

The Japanese moved southward with main objective to occupy Tjilatjap in order to capture the harbour and block the retreat to Australia. In one week, they advanced rapidly and overcame all Dutch army defence found in Blora, Soerakarta, Bojolali, Jogjakarta, Magelang, Salatiga, Ambarawa and Poerworedjo. Also during this time the invades captured Keboemen and Purwokerto.

==Dutch Surrender==
By March 7, defeat was inevitable, with Tjilatjap already in Japanese hands. Soerabaja was being evacuated while Japanese troops were rapidly converging on Bandoeng from both the north and the west. At 09:00 on March 8 the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces, Ter Poorten, announced the surrender of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army in Java.

The Dutch Governor, Jonkheer Dr. A.W.L. Tjarda Van Starkenborgh Stachouwer and Lieutenant-General Ter Poorten, together with Major-General Jacob J. Pesman, the commander of the Bandoeng District, met the Japanese Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant-General Hitoshi Imamura at Kalidjati that afternoon and agreed to the capitulation of all the troops.

On March 12, 1942, the senior British, Australian and American commanders were summoned to Bandoeng where the formal instrument of surrender was signed in the presence of the Japanese commander in the Bandoeng area, Lieutenant-General Masao Maruyama, who promised them the rights of the Geneva Convention for the protection of prisoners of war.

==Aftermath==
Initially Japanese occupation was welcomed by the Indonesians as liberators. During the occupation, the Indonesian nationalist movement increased in popularity. In July 1942, leading nationalists like Sukarno accepted Japan's offer to rally the public in support of the Japanese war effort. Both Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta were decorated by the Emperor of Japan in 1943.

During the occupation, the Japanese encouraged and backed Indonesian nationalistic feeling, created new Indonesian institutions and promoted nationalist leaders such as Sukarno. In the decades before the war, the Dutch had been overwhelmingly successful in suppressing the small nationalist movement in Indonesia such that the Japanese proved fundamental for the coming Indonesian independence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Initial Declaration ==

Two days after the Japanese surrender in August 1945, Sukarno and fellow nationalist leader, Mohammad Hatta, declared Indonesian independence. The Netherlands, only very recently freed from German occupation itself, initially lacked the means to respond, allowing Republican forces to establish de facto control over parts of the huge archipelago, particularly in Java and Sumatra. On the other hand, in the less densely populated outer islands, no effective control was established by either party, leading at times to chaotic conditions.

== British Military Action ==
[[Image:Soekarno.jpg|thumb|150px|Sukarno, the leader of Indonesian Independence]]
Initially the United Kingdom sent in troops to take over from the Japanese and soon found itself in conflict with the fledgling government. British forces brought in a small Dutch military contingent which it termed the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA). When a member of the NICA raised a Dutch flag on a hotel in the country's second-largest city, Surabaya, Indonesian nationalists overran the Japanese proxies guarding the hotel and tore the blue stripe off the flag, forming the red-and-white Indonesian flag.

On November 10, 1945, Surabaya was attacked by British forces, leading to a bloody street-to-street battle. The battle for Surabaya was the bloodiest single engagement in the war and had successfully demonstrated the determination of the rag-tag nationalist forces. It also made the British reluctant to be sucked into a war it did not need, considering how outstretched their resources in southeast Asia were during the period after the Japanese surrender.

== Dutch Military action ==
As a consequence, the Dutch were asked to take back control, and the number of NICA forces soon increased dramatically. Initially the Netherlands negotiated with the Republic and came to an agreement at Linggarjati, in which the 'United States of Indonesia' were proclaimed, a semi-autonomous federal state keeping as its head the Queen of the Netherlands. Both sides increasingly accused each other of violating the agreement, and as consequence the hawkish forces soon won out on both sides. A major point of concern for the Dutch side was the fate of members of the Dutch minority in Indonesia, most of whom had been held under deplorable conditions in concentration camps by the Japanese. The Indonesians were accused (and guilty) of not cooperating in liberating these prisoners.
[[Image:Nederlandsindie.png|thumb|300px|Situation in Indonesia/Dutch East Indies, 1949]]
The Netherlands government then mounted a large military force to regain what it believed was rightfully its territory. The two major military campaigns that followed were declared as ere 'police actions' to downplay the extent of the operations. There were atrocities and violations of human rights in many forms by both sides in the conflict. Some 6,000 Dutch and 150,000(including civilians) Indonesians are estimated to have been killed.

Although the Dutch and their indigenous allies managed to defeat the Republican Army in almost all major engagements and during the second campaign even to arrest Sukarno himself, Indonesian forces continued to wage a major guerrilla war under the leadership of General Sudirman who had escaped the Dutch onslaught. A few months before the second Dutch offensive, communist elements within the independence movement had staged a failed coup, known as Madiun Affair, with the goal of seizing control of the republican forces.

== Independence and Netherlands New Guinea ==

With the United States government threatening to withdraw the Marshall Plan funds, which were vital to the Dutch rebuild after the Second World War, the Netherlands government was forced back into negotiations, and after the Round Table conference in The Hague, the Dutch finally recognised Indonesian independence on December 27, 1949. At the time, other than most of Sumatra, and small parts of Java, all of Indonesia was under Dutch control. New Guinea was the only part of the East Indies not given up. Elections were held across Dutch New Guinea in 1959 and an elected New Guinea Council officially took office on April 5, 1961, to prepare for full independence by the end of that decade. The Dutch endorsed the council's selection of a new national anthem and the Morning Star as the new national flag on December 1, 1961.

Indonesia attempted to invade the region on December 18, 1961. Following some skirmishes between Indonesian and Dutch forces an agreement was reached and the territory was placed under United Nations administration in October 1962. It was subsequently transferred to Indonesia in May 1963. The territory was formally annexed by Indonesia in 1969.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Flag of Suriname.svg|thumb|300px|Flag of Suriname]]
In 1954, under the &quot;''Statute of the Realm''&quot;, the Netherlands, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles (at the time comprising Aruba) became a composite kingdom. The former colonies were granted autonomy save for certain matters including defense, foreign affairs and citizenship, which were the responsibility of the Realm. In 1969, unrest in Curaçao led to Dutch marines being sent to quell rioting. In 1973, negotiations started in Suriname for independence, and full independence was granted on November 25, 1975. Henk Arron became the first Prime Minister of Suriname. 60,000 immigrants took the opportunity of moving to the Netherlands because many feared Suriname could not survive as an independent country.

A small minority of Indonesians can speak a degree of Dutch. Many Indonesian lawyers and historians can speak Dutch due to historical ties, as do those of the older generation who were schooled in Dutch. Many Indonesian words have come from Dutch. One scholar argues that 20% of Indonesian words can be traced back to Dutch words.

The century and half of Dutch rule in Ceylon and southern India left few to no traces of the Dutch language. In Suriname, Dutch has left its mark as it is the official language of the country. About 60% of the population speaks it as their first language, and most of the remaining 40% know Dutch as well. In Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, Dutch is the official language but spoken as a first language by only by seven to eight percent of the population, although most people on the islands can speak the language and the education system on these islands is in Dutch at some or all levels. The lingua franca of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao is Papiamento, a creole language that originally developed among the slave population of the islands. The population of the three northern Antilles, Sint Maarten, Saba, and Saint Eustatius, is predominantly English-speaking.
[[Image:Dutch Language.png|thumb|300px|The Dutch language today.]]
In New Jersey in the United States, a dialect of Dutch, Jersey Dutch, spoken by descendants of seventeenth century Dutch settlers in Bergen and Passaic counties, was noted to still be spoken as late as 1921. Former American President Franklin Roosovelt said he remembered hearing Dutch spoken when he was growing up in the Hudson Valley.

Arguably, greatest linguistic legacy of the Netherlands was in its colony in South Africa, which attracted large numbers of Dutch farmer (in Dutch, Boer) settlers, who spoke a simplified form of Dutch called Afrikaans, which is largely mutually intelligible with Dutch. After the colony passed into British hands, the settlers spread into the hinterland, taking their language with them. Today, there are 10 million people for whom Afrikaans is either a primary and secondary language, compared with 25 million worldwide speakers of Dutch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">New York City was once called New Amsterdam. Parts of New York City are named after original Dutch colonial settlements: Brooklyn, after Breukelen, Harlem after Haarlem. Staten Island, was originally called Staten Eylandt after the Dutch parliament (Staten) who paid for the expeditions up the Hudson River. The place Old Town on Staten Island was originally called Oude Dorp, which in English means Old Town.

The last Director-General of the colony of New Netherland, Peter Stuyvesant, has given his name to a street, a neighborhood and a few schools in New York City. In Columbia County, near Albany, there is a town named Stuyvesant.
[[Image:Stuyvesant Wolvega 05c.JPG|thumb|250px|Monument of Peter Stuyvesant, it reads &quot;Pieter Stuyvesant, Director General of New Netherland and Aruba&quot;]]
The following towns in New York have names that were derived from Dutch: Claverack, Cobleskill, Greenbush (East and North), Kinderhook, Plattekill, Nassau, Poestenkill, Rensselaer, Saugerties, Valatie, Voorheesville, Watervliet, and Wynantskill.

Many towns and cities in Suriname share names with cities in the Netherlands, such as Alkmaar, and Groningen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the Surinamese Capital of Paramaribo, the Dutch Fort Zeelandia still stands today. In the centre of Malacca, Malaysia, the Stadhuys Building and Christ Church still stand. There are still some archaeological remains of Fort Goede Hoop (modern Hartford) and Fort Orange (modern Albany). 
[[Image:Willemstad harbor.jpg|thumb|299px|Dutch styled houses in Willemstad]]
Dutch architecture is easy to see in Aruba, Curaco, and Bonaire. The Dutch style buildings are especially visible in Willemstad, with its steeply pitched gables, large windows and soaring finials.

USR OPENRFPERM 

=== Revised === 

August, 2002 (Release 7) 

=== Description === 

With the release of Mac OS X, the ability to easily open a resource file has dissipated like smoke. But a simple modification will revive your older FN OPENRFPERM. Just change the FN to USR and a new FB routine will work in version of the System software from System 7.x to Mac OS X. As with the original toolbox function, the parameters are the file name, the volume reference number (which is handled in the background by FB) and the permission constant. Legal permission constants are: 

_fsRdPerm

_fsrdwrperm 

_fsrdwrshperm 

_fscurperm 

_fsrdperm

      <text xml:space="preserve">HTTP is a simple, yet powerful protocol, created at the beginning of 1990s to transport text (first ASCII, then HTML). Its functioning is very simple explaining why it spread so fast. The idea behind it is that there is a resource in the server and the client wants to action over it. For each possible action there is a method in the protocol. The methods available for the protocol are the ones for the basic [[w:Create, read, update and delete|CRUD]] operations, plus some other client-server and proxy-server communications methods.

== HTTP Methods and JEE ==

In the JEE specification, the Web container handles the protocol details and when using HTTP as the communication protocol (the very most part of the situations) the container redirects the request to a class that extends HTTPServlet. The HTTPServlet class is a do nothing handler for HTTP methods. For each one of the protocol methods, except ''Connect'', there is an equivalent method inside the HTTPServlet class. For example, for the ''Get'' method, there is the &lt;code&gt;doGet&lt;/code&gt; method inside the class.

All of them receive to arguments: HTTPServletRequest and HTTPServletResponse. Through these two interfaces it is possible to get access to the input stream that was created with the client and where the request came from and is also possible to get access to the output stream where the answer to the client is going to be written. Actually, that is the way that, normally, servlets answers [[w:HTML|HTML]] to clients, though is not the most recommended way to do it.

HTTPServletRequest also gives access to many other features such as [[Sun Certified Web Component Developer/Section4/|session management]], request parameters and many other features described at [[Sun Certified Web Component Developer/Section1/HTTP Request|HTTP Request]].

[[Sun Certified Web Component Developer/Section1/HTTP Response/|HTTP Response]] also has many other features mainly related to dispatching the response to the correct place.

== HTTP Methods and the Exam ==

For the SCWCD exam, it is not necessary to understand deeply each one of the methods, only two of them are explored because they are, by far, the most used on day-to-day job: ''GET'' and ''POST''. The full list of methods and descriptions for each one of them can be found at the Wikipedia page for the [[w:Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP protocol]], it is recommended that you read this page and understand the basics of the protocol before continue.

== POST and GET ==

These two methods are the most simple to use and most of the time, what the client need is just to ''get'' something from the server. Some times things get more complicated and the user needs to change something in the server, and that is why '''Post''' is there for us. The protocol was build with that in mind, the user would ''get'' things from the server and ''post'' things there.

The main difference between these two methods is that ''POST'' have a body while ''GET'' does not. This body can be used to send data from the client to the server to change something. Any amount of data can be sent in this body.

''GET'' can also send data to the server, but in a different way. A [[w:Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] can have a ''query'' part. This query is where ''get'' can send data to the server. The question mark (?) is used to separate a resource from the query part of the URL. ''POST'' can do that too, data can be sent in both, the body and the URL in a ''POST'' request.

There are two drawbacks in sending data in the URL:
# the first one is that there is a limit of data that can be sent, and in most browsers that is 256 characters - it is a lot but if there is a large form to send, data can be left out
# the second one is confidentiality, because when you send data in he URL it is exposed to any one that can see the browser or the URLs being requested and the user might want to bookmark it and the data will be saved together with it, that is not good if a credit card number or any other confidential data is being sent

Another difference between these methods is that, as the protocol was designed to, ''POST'' - in theory - is '''NOT''' idempotent. That means that if you execute the same request twice, the results might come out different. Notice that a ''in theory'' was added in the middle of the last phrase because an application can be designed to make a ''GET'' method change something in the server and so, result in a different answer for each request. The protocol was designed to be so that ''GET'' '''IS''' idempotent and ''POST'' '''IS NOT''', but the way they are implemented is the developer's choice.

Another important thing to notice is that users don't like to wait, so they will (surely) click more than once in a button after the first request was sent. One thing the application should guarantee is that things like paying for something twice in a web application does not happen. Normally, following the basic rule described in the last paragraph helps. Synchronizing important requests - like paying for a product - can be one way out of this tricky problem.

—This exercise introduces the (confusing) dual meaning of ludus (school/game) without explaining it.

The lesson only mentions that ludus means school.

A student is more likely to give the answer &quot;[the] bad school&quot;.

The answer should really be given as &quot;[the] bad school&quot; with a footnote to the effect that it could also mean &quot;the bad game&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Next Generation Nuclear Power Stations and Waste Management==
{{Subject|waste management}}
It would appear that the Nuclear Power Station will be with us
for the foreseeable future.
Moreover, it is not so much the generation of electricity
that matters but the management of the waste that results.

Waste management is not unique to the domain of nuclear power.
The current need for a green revolution to undercut climate change and global warming
depends crucially on how oil-related products such as plastics are re-cycled
or incinerated. 
Illegal dumping is rife in many countries.

In this section we look at one aspect of waste management,
adopted from the nuclear industry
and show how it may be re-used for general waste management.
In itself the development illustrate a general principle
in (software) process improvement. Real systems evolve
and migrate. They are very rarely begun from scratch.
Any software development plan ought to follow
the same process improvement of the system to match.

Tracking is just like searching. It relies on addresses. 
And now know that addressing may be a matter of
placing cookies or RFID tagging.

===Sources of inspiration===
We will begin our model by looking at some work already published.
That is to say, we will not pretend any originality or creativeness.
Our starting point will be a “tracking manager study” (TMS)&lt;ref&gt;TMS is our acronym. 
It stands for '''T'''racking '''M'''anager '''S'''tudy.
The use of acronyms in Computer Science is widespread. The habiit is probably due to the very concept of programming variable. It would be nice to verify this hypothesis. We will use this acronym in our own model for the Waste Management System. But in this case, TMS will stand for '''T'''racking '''M'''anagement '''S'''ystem. Acronyms can be very flexible, even if ambiguous.&lt;/ref&gt; 
which was carried out as part of the
«''Research  Study into the use of Computer-based Tracking Systems as valuable support
to Safety Cases in Nuclear Power Technology''»&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald&amp;Jones 1998, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence there are two kinds of things: containers and what goes into them. 
The different kinds of containers are easy to point out. In the TMS&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald&amp;Jones 1998, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; there are 5 of them:
&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crate crate]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_packaging package]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;puck&lt;ref&gt;The example of the [http://smb.slac.stanford.edu/robosync/Universal_Puck/index.htm Universal Puck] at SLAC Stanford might give some idea of what sort of thing a puck is, what it might look like, and how it might be used.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report WSRC-MS-98-00571 gives a very good overview of nuclear waste management issues, including a very useful text on the use of the puck.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_(container) drum container]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We already know from our earlier work on Alloy that we can introduce an abstract signature for Container
and introduce the 5 container types as extensions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''abstract''' '''sig''' Container {}&lt;/br&gt;
'''sig''' Crate, Package, Liner, Puck, Drum '''extends''' Container {}&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those things that go into certain kinds of containers may be called materials. 
In our first study of the TMS we will look at just 4 material types&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald&amp;Jones 1998, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;glass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plastic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liquor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Just as for Container above, so we introduce an abstract signature for Material and the four types of material then  become extensions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''abstract''' '''sig''' Material {}&lt;/br&gt;
'''sig''' Glass, Plastic, Metal, Liquor '''extends''' Material {}&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, for this introduction, one notes that the phases of processing within the Waste Management System can be classified analogously:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''abstract''' '''sig''' Phase {}&lt;/br&gt;
'''sig''' Unpacking, Sorting, Assaying, Compacting, Exporting '''extends''' Phase {}&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Instead of using the term Phase, one might prefer Process. Here is the list of Phases modelled:
&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unpacking (crates)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorting (contents)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay Assaying] (materials)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compacting (materials)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exporting (stuff)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;John Fitzgerald and Peter Gorm Larsen, pp. 137-201?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;!---------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

===Introductory text===

A detailled formal model of a system is but one step away from an implementation.
That step consists of the working out 
of the formal mathematical expressions.
Such working out is a mixture of hardware and software.
Much of it will be off-the-self. 
Some of it will necessarily be hand crafted.
But before we get to this stage of detail, 
we need an abstract bird's eye view.
This overview will capture everything in essence 
and will be comprehensible.
Here is such an executive overview supported by Alloy.

===System requirements===

A Tracking Management System (TMS) monitors the position 
of containers of material as they pass through the various 
phases of processing in an industrial plant (IP) such as 
a waste management facility (WMF). 

Each container holds only one type of material and 
can be in at most one processing phase at a time.  
Each processing phase has a maximum container capacity and
can only accept certain types of materials.

===System state===

At any point in time a system state of the TMS must record:
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The catalog of material type contents of each container in the WMS.
 Briefly, this is the simply denoted by the '''cntCatalog'''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The collection of containers in each processing phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phase properties of each processing phase:
       &lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the maximum container capacity ('''maxCapacity''') and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the acceptable types of materials ('''mtrType''').&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===System state constraints===

At any point in time a system state of the TMS must satisfy the following system state constraints:

&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each container can hold at most one type of material. 
Each container can be in at most one processing phase at a given time. 
Each processing phase can have at most one value for it's maximum capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All processing phases have recorded phase properites:
a maximum capacity and 
acceptable material types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each processing phase in the industrial plant has a maximum capacity of at least one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The containers in any given processing phase all have recorded material contents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The active processing phases have recorded phase properites: 
a maximum capacity and 
acceptable material types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each type of material in the IP has a possible processing phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each phase in the IP is operating within capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In any phase, all the containers in that phase have the expected kinds of
materials inside them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===System operations===

The TMS has a number of operations which modify the system state:
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initOp: specifies the properties of an intial state of the TMS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;insertOp: adds a new container whose contents are of a given material type to the industrial plant container catalogue.
 (was introduce operation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remOp: removes a container from given phase of processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delOp: deletes a container from both the container content catalogue and the tracker system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;permitOp: which decides whether a container may be moved into a given phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moveOp: moves a container into a given phase processing within the tracker system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==Alloy module==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''module''' TrackingManagementSystem -- abbreviated TMS
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''open''' util/relation '''as''' rel 		-- Binary relation module.&lt;/br&gt;
'''open''' util/natural '''as''' nat 		-- Natural number module.&lt;/br&gt;
'''open''' util/boolean '''as''' bool 	-- Boolean module&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''sig''' Container, Material, Phase {}	-- Containers, material types, and processing phases.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
sig SystemState {&lt;/br&gt;

     cntCatalog: Container -&gt; Material, -- The container catalogue.&lt;/br&gt;

      trkSystem: Container -&gt; Phase, -- The tracker system.&lt;/br&gt;
	
     maxCapacity: Phase -&gt; Natural, -- Phase max capacity record.&lt;/br&gt;
		
    mtrType: Phase -&gt; Material	-- Phase material types record.&lt;/br&gt;

}&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Visualization==

We know from earlier work on Alloy that this is sufficient information for us to vizualize the 
structure of the metamodel:

}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=A simpler waster management model=

==Containers==
{{Subject|Container}}
Let us begin with the container? Imagine that you are in a building where there are containers for 
* the disposal of empty water bottles, 
* used ink-jet cartridges,
* used batteries, and 
* waste paper.
These containers are collected by the Garbage firm ''NoWasteNoWant'' once a week and brought to the waste management facility in the city.

===Container notes===
When we talk about &quot;empty water bottles&quot; we are thinking of either plastic or glass materials.
For now, we will limit ourselves to just two types:
* glass bottle
* plastic bottle

==Container Types==
For the sake of the first model on waste management. We will asssume there are just two types of container:
* wet container — used for all liquid stuff, that is the plastic or glass bottles.
*dry container — used for everything else

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%&quot;&gt; '''''(a teacher's story)'''''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



== A dedication to my students ==

''I dedicate this exciting story to my students from Faculty of Computer Systems, Technical University of Sofia, spring 2008, that have inspired me to carry out this incredible experiment on the laboratory and to tell about it on [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] wikibook. [[User:circuit-fantasist|Cyril]]''


[[Image:Voltage diagram 1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;The voltage diagram shows the voltage distribution along the resistive film.&lt;/center&gt;]]

I have been teaching analog circuitry for more than 20 years. During this period, my students and I have been carrying out many and many times an attractive computer-based experiment (it is my favorite experiment): ''visualizing the voltage distribution along a linear resistive film'' that is supplied by two voltage sources connected to the two sides of the resistor. For this purpose, we use all kinds of &quot;resistors&quot;, some of them quite odd: resistive wires, pencil's graphites, conductive foam and rubber, and of course, opened potentiometers and the good old rheostats. By sliding on the resistive surface and varying consecutively the two supply voltages, we &quot;invent&quot; various legendary resistive devices: movement sensors, voltage dividers, resistive summers, subtractors, Wheatstone bridge, op-amp inverting, non-inverting and differential amplifier, etc.

In addition, this marvelous experiment presents in an attractive non-traditional way the famous [[w:Ohm's law|Ohm's law]], [[w:Virtual ground|virtual ground concept]], [[w:Negative resistance|negative resistance phenomenon]], etc. to curious students. It even shows directly in a &quot;geometrical&quot; way classical relations between the electrical quantities (I = V/R, U&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = -R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.) Furthermore, this experiment establishes a connection between the elementary passive resistive circuits (voltage divider, resistive summer, etc.) and the more sophisticated electronic op-amp circuits (non-inverting amplifier, inverting amplifier, etc.)

I have been having responsive, clever, curious and capable students that have been helping and inspiring me in my pursuit of revealing the truth about resistive circuits through these years. That is why, I have decided to place this experiment first on my site of [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com circuit-fantasia.com] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/current-ske-3.htm Compound passive converters with voltage output]&lt;/ref&gt; and then on this wikibook.

== Implementation of the web experiment ==

=== Students ===

[[Image:Lecture_03_19_2008_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;In the lecture hall (March 19, 2008).&lt;/center&gt;]]

During this term I teach basic circuitry (both lectures and laboratory exercises) to 150 students from Faculty of Computer Systems, Technical University of Sofia. They are divided into 
five groups (64, 65, 66, 67, 68), each of them containing 30 students. Further, for the purposes of the laboratory exercises, these groups are divided into sub-groups of 15 students. Each laboratory cycle lasts two weeks: the first five sub-groups (64a, 65a, 66a, 67a, 68a) conduct laboratory exercises during every even week; the other five sub-groups (64b, 65b, 66b, 67b, 68b) conduct laboratory exercises during every odd week. My general idea is to carry out the same experiment in the laboratory consecutively with all the student groups during the present cycle (March 17 - 29, 2008).

=== Organization ===

'''Preparation.''' First, in the beginning of the week, I started this story on Circuit idea. For this purpose, I outlined briefly (about 25%) the [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|future page]]: I traced out the contents by inserting the main subtitles; then, I placed semi-drawn pictures and a little explanatory text. By the way, it was very hard for me to refrain from making the whole page...

In the laboratory, I prepared all kinds of resistive elements (wires, pencil's graphites, conductive foam, etc.), power supplies, movements, VOM's, holders, etc. and arranged the laboratory equipment according to the future experiment's purposes.

I also prepared all kinds of recording equipment - a small solid state recorder (for quite a while I have recording my lessons, classes and laboratory exercises), camera and mobile phone. Maybe, next year I have to use a web camera:)?

I have also begun thinking who of famous web writers (mainly, university and college teachers) to invite to join this educational web initiative. For now, I have in mind Tony Kuphaldt ([http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits Lessons in electric circuits]), [http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~thayes/phys123/ Tom Hayes] ([http://frank.harvard.edu/aoe/sm/index.htm Student manual for the art of electronics] - great book!), William Beauty ([http://amasci.com Science hobbyist]] - great site!)...

'''Announcement.''' Then, in the lecture hall, I announced my intention to conduct such a web experiment to students and showed them how can we carry out it. I told them what is the great Wiki idea and how they can join the wikibook [[Circuit Idea]]. I suggested to students to choose meaningful user names consisting of student name and group number (thus I can observe their web achievements and add more credits to the rating).

== During the laboratory exercises ==

In the student group pages, my students and I describe step-by-step how the laboratory exercises have passed. The great mass of the written is extracted from the records but there is also some fragments that is written directly to this page in the laboratory during the exercises. Note that students make their reports in real time at the laboratory; I make also my &quot;report&quot; on the white board (ten times during the cycle!), snap it from time to time and write it on this page. Students and I make a lot of photos during the exercises; they show drafts on the whiteboard, screen shots, laboratory setups and, of course, the very students. 

The idea is first to write up here chronologically what is done in the laboratory; then to systematize and polish these raw materials and place them in the main story. We will use here (and why not in the main page?) a quite informal style. I will mark student's insertions by italic to distinguish them from my teacher's text. Well, let's start!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Prehistory of the World Wide Web==

Let us begin with a  brief [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_World_Wide_Web history of the World Wide Web] (WWW).
Now. Of what might a prehistory of the WWW consist?

=== Hypertext ===
From the history account we learn that the concept of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext hypertext] plays a fundamental role.
But it appears that there was a not unexpected pre-history to the emergence of the hypertext. In discussing the work of
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkins John Wilkins] entitled [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_towards_a_Real_Character_and_a_Philosophical_Language An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language], the author [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco Umberto Eco] makes the following interesting conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
«What if we regarded the defect in Wilkins' system
as its prophetic virtue?
What if we treated Wilkins as if he were obscurely groping towards a notion for which we have only recently invented a name — ''hypertext?''
…
If this were the case, many of [Wilkins'] system's contradictions would disappear, and Wilkins could be considered as a pioneer in the idea of a flexible and multiple organization of complex data
…
his [project] was instead the search for ways to articulate all that natural languages permit us to say.»&lt;ref&gt;Eco 1997, p258-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- (Umberto Eco,
The Search for the Perfect Language, p.258-9, FontanaPress: London, 1997.)--&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The X in XML==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;'''XML is both a boon and a threat to the web dream.'''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berners-Lee 2000, p160.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- (Tim Berners-Lee, Weaving the Web, p.160, paperback edition, 2000)--&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The X in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML XML] stands for eXtensible. This signifies that XML is open. It is open in the sense that it allows growth. Note that the abbreviation is XML and not EML. There is something daring, attractive, exciting about that X. X stands for many things, depending on the culture of the society in which it appears! The two most obvious things denoted are
*X-rated stuff: films, books... intended for adults only!
*X-roads: where choices in direction can be made.

Since the X in XML is pronounced &quot;ex&quot; and may sometimes even be written that way, then we have an opportunity of charting other potential meanings. For example, to say that &quot;she is his ex&quot; implies something in the past. This is not the intention of the X in XML. But we can make it so. We can think of XML ''poetically'' as X-ML to refer to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML SGML] that preceded it.

And we can use exactly the same interpretation for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML XHTML].

==Xwords &amp; partial understanding==
We want to understand exactly how the XML-speaking machines influence the development of our societies. And yes! there is more than one society in the world. And yes! XML is language for the machines.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;XML namespaces will allow documents to work in a mixture
of globally standard terms and locally agreed-upon terms. The inference languages will allow computer to translate not all of a document, but enough of it to be able to act on it. Operating on such 'partial understanding' is fundamental, and we do it all the time in the nonelectronic world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berners-Lee 2000, p188-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- (Tim Berners-Lee, Weaving the Web, p.188-9, paperback edition, 2000) --&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you want to learn the technical details of XML then why not open the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XML_-_Managing_Data_Exchange Wikibook on XML] and start right away?

The X in Xword (or X-word) is usually taken to mean crossword (cross-word). But we will introduce the X meaning of XML and talk about
extensible words. For example, &quot;dossier&quot; is a word which names a special kind of document. The bracketing pair &lt;dossier&gt;...&lt;/dossier&gt; is an Xword which extends &quot;dossier&quot;. How does it extend dossier? Well, by filling in its meaning as structure, the structure of the document.

==XLink==

An XLink is a link belonging to the XML-world (or simply just the X-world). In other words an XLink is an &quot;extensible&quot; link. We can extend the concept and, hence the digital reality, as much as we can imagine. Much of the imagination is often dampened down by the technologies available, especially in general WWW use. It is important to recall, that XLink almost feels like &quot;ancient history&quot; in 2008. It precedes the arrival of 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook Facebook] (2004), 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr Flickr] (2004), 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube YouTube] (2005), 
and so on.

A good technical overview of
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLink XLink]
is available on Wikipedia.

But actual applications based on XLink are very few. Why is that?
One major reason is undoubtedly the subsequent emergence of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework Resource Description Framework] (RDF). In the abstract, the essential component of RDF, called a triple, 
is simply represented by a directed arrow of the form  • → • which connects something on the left (denoted abstractly by ‘•’) to
something on the right (also abstractly by&amp;nbsp;‘•’). For example, the saying &quot;faraway hills are green&quot; is a simple statement connecting hills and the color green. In the arrow form, we might write &quot;faraway hills&quot; → &quot;green&quot; where the directed arrow is to be labelled with something like &quot;hasColor&quot;.
Sometimes the saying may be presented as &quot;far away hills are green&quot; where &quot;faraway&quot; is ''written'' as two separate words &quot;far&quot; and &quot;away&quot;. Because of the focus or intent, the same triple would be used. And in the context of speech, rather than writing, there is '''no''' distinction between &quot;faraway&quot; and &quot;far away&quot;. This remark is significant for the full richness of media in the WWW.

An XLink • → • is not a mere triple in the RDF sense. It is much much more.

===XLink kinds===
There are only two kinds of XLink:
* simple XLink
* extended XLink
Although they are closely related conceptually, the [http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/#simple-links simple-link] is syntactically very different from the extended XLink.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Simple links offer shorthand syntax for a common kind of link, an outbound link with exactly two participating resources (into which category HTML-style A and IMG links fall). Because simple links offer less functionality than extended links, they have no special internal structure.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From this formal text we may deduce that the simple link has exactly the form  • → • and it is an &quot;outbound&quot; link.

==XForms==

A good technical overview of
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XForms Xforms] is available on Wikipedia.
Then if you wish to get into more detail, why not try out the
[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XForms XForms Wikibook]?

Maybe there is also some good wikibook I can refer to?

I have begun to develop the section on XLink (Михал Орела 09:02, 12 July 2008 (UTC))

==Hypertext==

Added in a [surprising] text on hypertext:

«What if we regarded the defect in Wilkins' system as its prophetic virtue? What if we treated Wilkins as if he were obscurely groping towards a notion for which we have only recently invented a name — hypertext? … If this were the case, many of [Wilkins'] system's contradictions would disappear, and Wilkins could be considered as a pioneer in the idea of a flexible and multiple organization of complex data … his [project] was instead the search for ways to articulate all that natural languages permit us to say.» (Umberto Eco, The Search for the Perfect Language, p.258-9, FontanaPress: London, 1997.)

It appears that there was a not unexpected pre-history to the emergence of the hypertext. (Михал Орела)

==History==

It is clear that a preHistory of the WWW and the Hypertext is needed. :) (Михал Орела 08:26, 29 August 2008 (UTC))

Mike, its Graviphoton

I am the author of the work published at BAUT forums. So there is no violation here.

== Suggested reading ==

Have a look at: [[Consciousness_Studies/Table_Of_Theories]] [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 11:41, 16 May 2008 (UTC)

== [[Relativity_-_Advanced]] ==

This book is likely to go the same way as the other one.  Have you considered adding the content to the modern physics bookshelf?  Take a look at [[Special relativity]] for instance. Again, all contributions would need to refer to published work by others. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 11:46, 16 May 2008 (UTC)</text>

You're doinng a wonderful job with the [[Hebrew]] book.  I worked on it earlier and hope to find time to help out again soon.  But, since I'm just learning, it's slow going, and I probably make lots of mistakes.  On the other hand, I can still help by knowing some of what may confuse a new learner or by letting you know what I'd like to learn.  Thanks for the great job!  -[[User:CocoaZen|CocoaZen]] ([[User talk:CocoaZen|talk]]) 14:41, 8 May 2008 (UTC)
:Instead of redirecting pages to new locations, please move them. There is a ''move'' tab at the top of the page to do so.

==Nuclear Deal Likely==
An American expert on South Asia, Bruce Riedel, who has served in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), says the stalled US-India nuclear agreement is likely to be approved next year under a new US president.

'This agreement is probably one that is going to slip over into the next administration,' Riedel, senior fellow at Brookings Institution, said in an interview with the Council on Foreign Relations, a US think tank.

Asked if there is any chance that a new US president would want to scuttle the nuclear deal held up due to opposition from Indian coalition government' s leftist supporters, he said: 'I certainly hope that wouldn't happen.'

'This deal is the basis for strong US-Indian relationship,' he said. 'There is certainly a possibility that a new administration may try to strengthen the non-proliferation parts of it and might, particularly if the Democrats are elected, try to revive the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).'

'But the first step there of course would be for the United States to ratify the CTBT. I don't think we could go to the Indians and ask them to do something that we haven't done so far,' Riedel said.

Indians are determined to push the nuclear deal forward, Riedel said. He was of the view that sooner or later the Manmohan Singh government will force a showdown with the Communists over the issue, but probably closer to the next scheduled Indian election in May 2009.

==New US president to inherit $505bn deficit==
THE next US president will inherit a record budget deficit of $US482 billion ($505.4 billion), according to a new Bush Administration estimate released yesterday.

The Administration said the deficit was being driven to an all-time high by the sagging economy and the stimulus payments being made to 130 million households in an effort to keep the US from falling into a deep recession. 

But the numbers could go even higher if the economy performs worse than the White House has predicted. 

The budget office has predicted the economy will grow 1.6 per cent this year and rebound to 2.2 per cent growth next year. 

That is a half percentage point more than previously anticipated - but also the consensus of leading economists. 

The Administration foresaw inflation averaging 3.8 per cent this year but easing to 2.3 per cent next year - better than the 3 per cent seen by the panel of &quot;blue-chip&quot; economists.

'''''1.The Three Dinemsional Structure of Insulin'''''
[[Image:InsulinHexamer.jpg‎|right|thumb|300px|Insulin hexamers highlighting the threefold symmetry, the zinc ions (center) binding with histidine.]]
Insulin is a small protein with two polypeptide chains joined by two disulfide bonds. It is synthesized in the pancreas as an inactive single chain precursor, preproinsulin, with an amison terminal signal sequence that directs its passage into secretory vesicles.

Insulin (Latin insula, &quot;island&quot;, as it is produced in the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas) is a polypeptide hormone that regulates carbohydrate metabolism. Apart from being the primary effector in carbohydrate homeostasis, it also has a substantial effect on small vessel muscle tone, controls storage and release of fat (triglycerides) and cellular uptake of both amino acids and some electrolytes. In this last sense, it has anabolic properties. Its concentration (more or less, presence or absence) has extremely widespread effects throughout the body.


Insulin is used medically in some forms of diabetes mellitus. Patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus depend on exogenous insulin (injected subcutaneously) for their survival because of an absolute deficiency of the hormone; patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus have either relatively low insulin production or insulin resistance or both, and a non-trivial fraction of Type 2 diabetics eventually require insulin administration when other medications become inadequate in controlling blood glucose levels. Insulin structure varies slightly between species. Its carbohydrate metabolism regulatory function strength in humans also varies. Pig insulin is particularly close to the human one.


The exact sequence of amino acids comprising the insulin molecule, the so-called primary structure, was determined by British molecular biologist Frederick Sanger. It was the first protein the structure of which was completely determined. For this he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958. In 1967, after decades of work, Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin determined the spatial conformation of the molecule, by means of X-ray diffraction studies. She also was awarded a Nobel Prize.



'''''2.Insulin secretion location''''' 


Control of Insulin Secretion
Insulin is secreted in primarily in response to elevated blood concentrations of glucose. This makes sense because insulin is &quot;in charge&quot; of facilitating glucose entry into cells. Some neural stimuli (e.g. sight and taste of food) and increased blood concentrations of other fuel molecules, including amino acids and fatty acids, also promote insulin secretion. 

Glucose is transported into the beta cell by facilitated diffusion through a glucose transporter; elevated concentrations of glucose in extracellular fluid lead to elevated concentrations of glucose within the beta cell. 
Elevated concentrations of glucose within the beta cell ultimately leads to membrane depolarization and an influx of extracellular calcium. The resulting increase in intracellular calcium is thought to be one of the primary triggers for exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules. The mechanisms by which elevated glucose levels within the beta cell cause depolarization is not clearly established, but seems to result from metabolism of glucose and other fuel molecules within the cell, perhaps sensed as an alteration of ATP:ADP ratio and transduced into alterations in membrane conductance. 
Increased levels of glucose within beta cells also appears to activate calcium-independent pathways that participate in insulin secretion. 


'''''3.General Overview'''''

Throughout body it regulates blood glucose levels, increases storage of glycogen, and facilitates glucose intake by body cells. Proteolytic removal of the signal sequence and formation of three disulfide bonds produces proinsulin, which is stored in secretory granules in pancreatic beta cells. When elevated blood glucose triggers insulin secretion, proinsulin is converted to active insulin by specific proteases, which cleave two peptide bonds to form the mature insulin molecule. 



'''''4.Insulin process from precursor''''' 


The effect of insulin is to favor the conversion of excess blood glucose to two storage forms 
glycogen (in the liver and muscle), and triacylglycerol (in adipose tissue) 

Proinsulin is synthesized in the pancreatic beta cells as a 9390 mw polypeptide of 86 amino acids. 

Proinsulin is subsequently cleaved enzymatically, releasing insulin into the circulation along with a residual 3000 mw fragment called C-peptide, so-named because it connects the A and B chains of insulin within the proinsulin molecule. 

Proinsulin, which has relatively low biological activity (approximately 10% of insulin potency), is the major storage form of insulin. Normally, only small amounts (~3% of the amount of insulin, on a molar basis) of proinsulin enter the circulation. Because the hepatic clearance of proinsulin is only 25% of insulin clearance, the half-life of proinsulin is two- to threefold longer and concentrations in the fasting state are approximately 10% to 15% of insulin concentrations.

''Association of Adiposity, Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Exercise Practice with the Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes in Brazilian Elderly Women''

http://www.medsci.org/v04p0288.htm

&lt;big&gt; '''General Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

;:The incidences of diabetes in age increasing women are substantially growing in alarming rate. Therefore it is important to keep close research on this topic to reduce the growing communities in type 2 diabetes. In order to analyze the effects, adiposity, cardio respiratory fitness, and exercise practice in T2D in Brazilian elderly women are put to several exercises to measure their health conditions.   
;:The general and central adiposity were directly associated with T2D, whereas cardio respiratory fitness was inversely related with T2D. The joint effect of exercise practice and central adiposity showed that inactive women had higher rate of odd in facing T2D when compared with active women. 
;:In conclusion, the researchers were able to determine the association of general and central adiposity as well as an inverse relation with CRF (cardio respiratory fitness) and exercise practice side by side with T2D. Elderly women practicing regular exercise had less odd in obtaining T2D than the inactive group of women. By having proper exercise, the exercise will reduce the body fatness and possibly benefiting from reducing the prevalence of T2D in old aging group.

&lt;big&gt;'''New Terms'''&lt;/big&gt;

;Adiposity: loose connective tissue composed of adipocyte, which is derived from lipoblasts and their maine role is to store energy in the form of fat
;CRF (Cardio respiratory fitness): refers to the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscles during sustained physical activity.
;Type 2 diabetes (T2D): common form of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, either the body does not produce enough insulin or the cells ignore the insulin.

''Strength training improves muscle quality and insulin sensitivity in Hispanic older adults with type 2 diabetes''

http://www.medsci.org/v04p0019.htm

&lt;big&gt; '''General Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

;:Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia and disturbances of carbohydrate,fat and protein metabolism. Diet, exercise and weight loss are cornerstones of diabetes management to improve glycemic control, reduce muscle wasting and mortality. Targeted interventions are needed to improve long-term diabetes control in high risk groups,like Hispanic older adults for whom diabetes and poor glycemic control are prevalent. 
;:The inflammatory response is correlated with multiple metabolic markers of insulin resistance. We measured CRP, a systemic marker of low-grade systemic inflammation. It has recently been shown that ten months of aerobic exercise reduced CRP levels in elderly subjects and aerobic exercise training combined with a dietary intervention in diabetic men reduced their CRP levels. The decrease in CRP levels we observed in the present study suggests that the reduction in the inflammatory state of diabetes may be an important factor leading to improved insulin sensitivity and better metabolic control. Furthermore, since adiponectin has anti-inflammatory actions and we showed a significant increase in this adipokine, the reduction in inflammation may be related to this increase.
;:In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest that 16 weeks of strength training results in improved muscle quality, skeletal muscle fiber hypertrophy, accompanied by concomitant changes in biochemical markers known that contribute to whole-body insulin sensitivity; namely, reduced HOMA-IR, increased adiponectin levels and decreased FFA and CRP levels. Further studies are needed to establish the mechanisms associated with these relationships. However, these data show that strength training is an exercise modality worth considering as an adjunct of standard of care for high risk populations with diabetes.

&lt;big&gt;'''New Terms'''&lt;/big&gt;

;Type 2 diabetes: a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia and disturbances of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism
;Muscle quality: maximal force prodection per unit of muscle mass, better indicator of muscle function
;Adipokines: soluble proteins released from adipocytes in response to metabolic signals and are
involved in insulin resistance and inflammation
;Adiponectin levels:decrease with increasing fat mass and higher levels of plasma adiponectin are independently associated with
reduced risk of type 2 diabetes in healthy individuals
;CRP: carbon reactive protein
;ST: strengh training with standard care group
;CON: control group standard care alone
;FFA: free fatty acid
;HOMA IR: metabolic control including insulin resistance (Homeostasis Model Assessment)

=Insulin Regulation=

'''Grb14'''

Interactions between the Grb14 molecular adapter and the autophosphorylated insulin receptor (IR) have been identified. As an IR interacting partner, Grb14 has been identified in insulin sensitive tissues as a selective inhibitor for IR catalytic activity. Enhanced insulin signaling has been identified in adult male Grb14 knockout (KO) mice. However, researchers had been unsure if this phenotype was a result of compensatory action that occurred during growth development. Therefore, in order to determine the exact physiological role of Grb14, small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were used in primary cultured hepatocytes. Grb14 knock-down resulted in improvement of insulin signaling pathways. However, results from another RNA sequence indicated that these observations could not be a consequence of unspecific siRNA action. The resultant Grb14 depletion suggested that Grb14 activity had a second role, in addition to its function as an IR catalytic inhibitor. Experimental results indicated that, under acute modulation of its level of expression, the prevailing effect of Grb14 was more distal.

The assumed inhibitory role of Grb14 was supported by a sustained increase in Akt phosphorylation of Grb14-depleted hepatocytes. This was observed to be in direct response to insulin stimulation. Increased phosphorylation of Akt substrates resulted in an increase of downstream kinases, which accompanied the Grb14 insulin stimulation response. Grb14 knock-down has also been discovered to reduce the impact of insulin. Specifically, Grb14 has been observed to decrease the expression of SREBP-1c, Insig1, GK and FAS, in addition to inhibiting glycogen synthesis.

'''Synaptotagmin'''

Synaptotagmin-7 mutant mice have been proven to undergo a reduction in insulin secretion, which in turn results in higher glucose tolerance. The reduction of insulin secretion had been believed to be a result of a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; defect in insulin-containing granule exocytosis, because there had been no observed abnormalities in steps that lead to increased [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;, or peripheral insulin sensitivity. These observations also supported the capacity of the synaptotagmin-7 calcium sensor as an insulin secretion regulator.

There have been a minimum of fifteen synaptotagmin isoforms identified in brain and peripheral tissues. However, synaptotagmin-1, -2, and -9 are the only established Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensors for fast neurotransmitter release. Synaptotagmin-7 is one of the most proliferate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensors with different affinities, and has been proven to have an exceedingly higher Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; affinity than synaptotagmin-1 and -2, in addition to having insulin secretion regulatory capabilities. When compared with a control, synaptotagmin-7 mutant mice had reduced insulin secretion and impaired glucose tolerance.

As a major anabolic hormone, insulin promotes lipid synthesis while inhibiting lipolysis. In support of this activity, lower plasma insulin levels in synaptotagmin-7 mutant mice were discovered to experience significant reductions of body fat content. Furthermore, exogenous insulin administration was proven to suppress plasma glucose more effectively in synaptotagmin-7 mutant mice than in the controls. It was speculated that, under usual conditions and with high insulin sensitivity, a low level of insulin would be sufficient to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. 

It was discovered that synaptotagmin-7 mutant mice had lower insulin levels from birth. Research has indicated that liver insulin receptor mRNA regulation was increased, in these mice. This implied an adaptation to insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, glucose intolerance in the synaptotagmin-7 mice was believed to be a result of insulin secretion dysfunction in beta-cells, instead of peripheral insulin resistance.

This book project doesn't seems to satisfy the [[WB:WIW]] policy. The book was previously tagged with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{query}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and presumably the author did reply to the information request [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Xetsa here], but as an unregistered user the usefulness of direct dialog may not be good enough and I don't have any idea if another project besides Wikibooks would enable the author to continue the work. The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{vfd}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; discussion should be a better alternative than a summary speedy deletion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:16, 25 April 2008 (UTC)

:{{del}} I believe I deleted this once before as a speedy a few days before it reappeared, so I obviously think it qualifies for a speedy. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:04, 27 April 2008 (UTC)
::The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{query}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; was added by you (and I think you did not speedy delete it in an attempt not to alienate the contributor and due to be a recent edit), a sentiment that I shared with you (I did even tag it for deletion but thought about why you didn't and came to to the conclusion that your idea had merit, so I reverted myself) since the author seems to have replied to the query but doesn't seem to admit that if falls outside of the scope of Wikibooks, I decided to fallow you initial query with a vfd to see if a) a better place can be pointed to the user to continue the work b)he comes to understand why it doesn't fit here. The vfd seemed to be the best place since the user is anonymous. I doubt that anyone will vote to keep it here but if the author needs to understand the reasons behind the decission and wishes to appeal or request help in finding another location maybe some one can help him in this forum, the reply to the query seems to indicate that the creator does place some value on the content and it is not an orphan work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:00, 27 April 2008 (UTC)

:{{del}}. I have a striking suspicion that this is somehow scientology-related, but I may be mistaken in that. Without some sort of preface that it is religious teaching, this looks like fiction and should be deleted. If it were religious, it would have to go to some lengths to fix up the NPOV problems. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:32, 1 May 2008 (UTC)
Xetsa is a completely fictional religion/view, it was made by my friend who has a very deep imagination, i understand that it does not belong in wikibooks and will encourage him to post his imaginations elsewhere thank you

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== frexp ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
double frexp( double num, int* exp );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function frexp() is used to decompose ''num'' into two parts: a mantissa between 0.5 and 1 (returned by the function) and an exponent returned as ''exp''. Scientific notation works like this:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
num = mantissa * (2 ^ exp)   
&lt;/source&gt;

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
double ldexp( double num, int exp );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The ldexp() function returns ''num'' * (2 ^ ''exp''). And get this: if an overflow occurs, '''HUGE_VAL''' is returned.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== modf ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
double modf( double num, double *i );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function modf() splits ''num'' into its integer and fraction parts. It returns the fractional part and loads the integer part into ''i''.

Accepting the gambit seems particularly risky for black, where White gets very good development and an open game.

Glucagon is a peptide hormone that works in conjunction with insulin to maintain a stable blood glucose level.  In situations of high blood glucose, or hyperglycemia, insulin takes over, stimulating the storage of excess blood glucose in the form of glycogen for later use. However, when blood glucose levels fall, it is the duty of glucagon to stimulate gluconeogenesis and glycogen breakdown, whereby replenishing glucose levels in the blood, and inhibit glycolysis. In doing so, glucagon plays a key role in regulating blood glucose levels, providing the fuel necessary for our cells to function even when our bodies are experiencing a low sugar or starved state.

=Discovery=
[[Image:Glucagon.png|thumb|right|150px|Glucagon ball and stick model.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Glucagon.png#file ]]
Physiologists C.P. Kimball and John Murlin from the University of Rochester in Rochester, NY, published a paper in 1923 discussing their attempts to find an inexpensive method of concentrating insulin for medicinal use as well as begin experimenting on methods to isolate the pure substance.  The paper explains their efforts to test a variety of inorganic and organic materials on rabbits and test pancreatic synthesis by measuring blood sugar.  First observed in December 1922, addition of acetone would throw down an unknown substance that had a distinctly hyperglycemic effect.  Purifying this substance and injecting it into a depancreatized dog raised its blood sugar, and the duo named the material glucagon (Kimball, 1923)[http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/58/1/337].



=Physiology=
==Purpose==
The objective of glucagon is to increase the amount of glucose in the blood for use by cells of the body. When there is a lack of glucose in the blood, the islets of langerhans on the pancreas are stimulated to create and release glucagon into the bloodstream. Once glucagon has been released, it travels through the bloodstream until it reaches the liver where it binds to specific glucagon binding sites. Although the liver is the main target of glucagon, receptors for this hormone have also been found in the kidney, intestinal smooth muscle, brain and adipose tissue as well as on insulin producing beta cells where it acts as a feedback mechanism to stimulate the creation of insulin. Because its effects on the liver are extremely important and well understood, however, this will be our main focus. Once bound, the glucagon activates adenylyl cyclase which is the first step in a cascade reaction which ultimately lowers the levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is an important regulatory molecule in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. At high levels, this molecule stimulates glycolysis by allosterically binding to phosphofructokinase-1, which increases its ability to function and so stimulates glycolysis. In this case, by lowering the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate the opposite occurs. Glycolysis is disengaged and gluconeogenesis is stimulated to help restore glucose levels in the body. 

Another very important function of glucagon is its stimulation of glycogen breakdown. Activation of glycogen breakdown hinges on the same cascade reaction described in the previous paragraph. When glucagon binds to receptors in the liver it activates the adenylyl cyclase which increases cyclic AMP. The end result is an activation of glycogen phosphorylase which begins the glycogen breakdown process leading to increased blood sugar levels.

==Function==
Glucagon is an important regulatory hormone and is integral to our ability to properly regulate the amount of glucose in our bodies. Composed of 29 amino acids, the endocrine producing cells known as the Islets of Langerhans on the pancreas are responsible for the synthesis and excretion of this hormone. The specialized cells that produce this molecule are known as alpha cells but several others, including beta cells which produce glucagon's sister hormone insulin, are also located here.

==Regulation==
Although we know of several molecules other than glucose that are important in the regulation of glucagon, many of the exact mechanisms by which this is done are still not fully understood. For example, presence of the hormone insulin down regulates the production of glucagon by alpha cells but details of this process are still being worked out by researchers. Other molecules known to regulate glucagon include somatostatin and GLP-1. Because understanding such processes have the potential to further enhance our ability to treat metabolic diseases such as diabetes, much current research is being put towards understanding these mechanisms.

There are two conditions that are known to trigger glucagon secretion.  The first is elevated blood levels of amino acids.  Persistat after a protein-rich meal, glucagon is utilized to convert the excess amino acids to glucose by gluconeogenesis.  Worth noting is that this is one of the rare situations where both insulin and glucagon are active, as high levels of amino acids in the blood stream triggers its release as well.  The second condition of significant glucagon increase is during exercise, although at the time of the latest update(2002), it was unknown whether exercise was a stimulus or if the increased synthesis was due to the induced depletion of glucose.

----

Postabsorptive plasma glucose concentration has been discovered to be physiologically maintained within the range of  70 mg/dl [3.9 mmol/l] to 110 mg/dl [6.1 mmol/l] in humans. This is accomplished via increased glucose levels from glucagon and decreased glucose levels from insulin. However, there has not yet been any convincing evidence of the involvement of glucagon in postabsorptive plasma glucose concentration maintenance.

Combined deficiency of insulin and glucagon results in an initial drop in plasma glucose levels, but is followed by an increase in plasma glucose levels. This indicates that there is support of postabsorptive plasma glucose concentrations from glucagon, when in concert with insulin. Changes in plasma glucose concentrations also result from changes in glucose production but not from glucose utilization. Furthermore, during insulin and partial glucagon deficiency, and the exclusive partial deficiency glucagon, the rate of glucose appearance increases to a point greater than the rate of glucose disappearance. This rate increase seems to be even larger than during insulin and glucagon deficiency, as well as when glucagon is made exclusively deficient. Both scenarios result in much higher plasma glucose concentrations.

Increases in plasma glucose levels are ultimately followed by plateaus. These plateaus occur within a postabsorptive physiological range, and after octreotide-induced suppression of insulin and glucagon secretion. It has been determined that hormones and additional factors are involved in postabsorptive glucose level maintenance, after short periods of time. However, chronic insulin and glucagon deficiencies still remain victims of diabetes. Therefore, insulin has been proven to contribute to the maintenance of postabsorptive plasma glucose concentrations, while high levels of glucagon are not required to onset diabetes.

These findings do not distinguish the individual roles of insulin and of glucagon. However, chronic insulin and glucagon deficiencies have been proven to cause hyperglycemia and, therefore, strongly suggest that insulin is the predominant factor of postabsorptive glucose levels.

==Pathology==
While there are many Americans affected by an inbalance of insulin (diabetes types I and II [http://www.diabetes.org/about-diabetes.jsp]), there are only very specific and very uncommon situations in which glucagon has been shown to cause disease in humans.  

===Excessive Glucagon Secretion===
Diseases associated with excessively high or low secretion of glucagon are bad. Cancers of alpha cells (glucagonomas) are one situation known to cause excessive glucagon secretion. These tumors typically lead to a wasting syndrome and, interestingly, rash and other skin lesions.
[http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/pancreas/glucagon.html]

===Hyperglycemia===
&lt;u&gt;Hyper&lt;/u&gt;glycemia occurs when blood glucose levels are too high, usually over 11 mmol/L, and occurs most often an hour or so after a large meal, especially one heavily laced with sugars.  Hyperglycaemia occurs when there is too little insulin in the blood, or in the rare situation of an overabundance of glucagon.  Thanks to fairly dependable regulation of glucagon, our body typically prevents an overabundance of glucagon when it senses high blood glucose levels.

This website can be located at:   http://www.glucagon.com/index.html

This webpage was a very useful and informative description of not only the hormone glucagon but of all relating molecules, pathways, regulators, and diseases associated with the molecule. It contains effective descriptions of all information known about glucagon and related molecules up to this point in time. Because this topic has so much research dedicated to it, the site also provides useful links to primary articles most of which demonstrate the most recent discoveries linked to glucagon and related pathways. 


&lt;u&gt;Proglucagon - &lt;/u&gt;Precursor of glucagon which is also secreted by alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans.

&lt;u&gt;Prohormone - &lt;/u&gt;A molecule produced as a precursor to the actual hormone.

&lt;u&gt;Hyperplasia - &lt;/u&gt;The overproduction of cells within an organ or tissue.

&lt;u&gt;Exocytotic - &lt;/u&gt;The process by which a cell excretes vesicles containing the desired molecule or protein.

&lt;u&gt;Polymorphism - &lt;/u&gt;Multiple alleles of a gene within a population.


The information found on this website is extremely relevant to topics learned in class. It fully explains factors involved in the regulation of blood glucose levels which we studied in detail in chapter 15 this quarter. It goes beyond just the functions of insulin and glucagon, however, and describes other mechanisms and molecules which are or are thought to be involved in this important metabolic process.



'''2. Relationship of Glucagon Suppression by Insulin and Somatostatin to the Ambient Glucose Concentration'''

This journal can be found in full text for free at:   http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=423975&amp;blobtype=pdf

The main point of this article was to determine the amount of glucagon suppression exhibited by the molecules insulin and somatostatin. Although both are known to regulate this hormone, the exact effects they have on glucagon regulation are not yet confirmed. 


&lt;u&gt;Hyperglucagonemia - &lt;/u&gt;Abnormally high levels of glucagon in the blood.

&lt;u&gt;Phloridzin - &lt;/u&gt;A dihydrochalcone occurring in many parts of the apple tree which is used experimentally to produce glycosuria in animals.

&lt;u&gt;Glycosuria - &lt;/u&gt;An abnormal condition of osmotic diuresis due to excretion of glucose by the kidneys.

&lt;u&gt;Diuresis - &lt;/u&gt;The increased production of urine by the kidney.

&lt;u&gt;Normoglycemic - &lt;/u&gt;The presence of normal concentrations of glucose in the blood. 


This is an important and relevant article because it delves further into the mechanisms used by the body to keep levels of glucagon regulated. This study is also important to further understand how to control diabetes and other abnormalities in this metabolic pathway.



'''3. Aquaeous Extracts of Pancreas'''

This journal can be found in full text for free at:  http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/58/1/337

As mentioned above in the Discovery section, this paper was the first to identify and name the compound glucagon, making it very relevant to this article, as well as our text.  At the time of publication, 1923, the researchers were looking to synthesize insulin for medical purposes, by adding various compounds to the pancreas.  The subjects involved were rabbits and dogs, and the paper hints at the difficulty of science publication during the era.  Because the paper uses terminology from almost a century ago and the paper's main focus was on insulin, not glucagon, it seems only right to include only the terms that would appear relevant to this wikibook entry.

&lt;u&gt;glucagon&lt;/u&gt; - a substance that exhibits a highly hyperglycemic effect.  When given to a depancreatized dog by subcutaneous injection, blood sugar was reported to rise significantly in 3 hours.

'''4. Colorado State Hypertexts of Biomedical Sciences'''

This website can be found at:  http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/pancreas/glucagon.html

In an effort similar to this wikibook, Colorado State University created an online textbook pertaining to the Endocrine Pancreas in 2000.  Focusing on the page that deals with glucagon, this article lists many new definitions that pertain to biochemistry and enhance the reading.  If the images were available, the source offers several simple but effective images and diagrams that show the pathway and function of not only glucagon but insulin as well.  Information from this source is used in several locations within the 'Physiology' section of this article.

&lt;u&gt;Secretin&lt;/u&gt; - a hormone that is structurally similar to glucagon, secretin is released in response to acid in the small intestine and stimulates the pancreas and bile ducts to release a flood of bicarbonate base, which neutralizes the acid.

&lt;u&gt;Enteroglucagon&lt;/u&gt; - the precursor of glucagon, the proglucagon gene, can also expressed in the terminal small intestine and large intestine, where it is cleaved into a number of peptides other than glucagon. Also known as enteroglucagon or glucagon-like peptides, this alternative pathway for processing of proglucagon occurs in gut endocrinocytes called L cells.

&lt;u&gt;Hypoglycemia&lt;/u&gt; - in Greek the term literally means &quot;under-sweet blood&quot;, hypoglycemia is the term for lower than normal blood glucose levels.  Treatment is typically oral or inject glucose.

&lt;u&gt;Hyperglycemia&lt;/u&gt; -&quot;over sweetened blood&quot;, the polar opposite of hypoglycemia, this is the term for higher than normal blood glucose levels, and is typically treated with additional insulin.  And as mentioned in the wikibook entry, this is the more likely scenario to be created by an irregular level of glucagon, that is, too much in the blood.

&lt;u&gt;Somatostatin&lt;/u&gt; - [[Metabolomics/Hormones/Somatostatin]] is another hormone discussed in this Wikibook, but does play some role with glucagon, in which somatostatin is known to inhibit glucagon when it prevents all pancreatic hormones from being distributed in an effort to regulate the endocrine system,

&lt;u&gt;Glucagonoma&lt;/u&gt; - Cancer of α-cells of the pancreas, which has been known to cause excessive glucagon secretion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{AM&amp;C-top}}
==Introduction==
Until you get into actual from-scratch asset creation, an New Trainzers first efforts will likely to be to take a route that interests you and start modifying it&amp;mdash;try some ideas and see how they work out. This is highly recommended, and how most of us climbed the learning curves of matching terrain, terrain coloring, or altering same vastly, built knowledge of what is available in your stock Trainz. Eventually, we all want to weed those out. This page is about doing that in a smart way, so you don't make the mistakes some of us did. 
{{TrainzTip |With Trainz, you have to learn to sometimes think like a programmer, that is, be a little paranoid, and take steps to make sure you can go back, then start forward again with new knowledge of what not to do! Saving a route before making major additions or radical changes, then cloning it for the big change is one of those {{TL|Good practices}} we urge all to adopt.
}}

==Managing assets you never wanted==
Aside from your own paranoid tendency to save up new routes before making radical trial changes, asset proliferation will come from over use of the DLS (before knowing what not to do, what you don't need, and won't want). Those things take some experience to gain perspective, and a plan or two. A mission of where your Trainz route building is headed. With that, you can decide extra assets are a burden, or not, as you choose. Here we also present some alternatives to deletion.

Many others that could be a weeding target are those assets you'll see which have come down from on high because they were {{TA|dependencies}} of a route you deliberately and innocently brought off the DLS, to find it had a thousand assets you also found in the CM download que. Good news today is you can let those download, launch Trainz a second time and safely run surveyor or Driver (This is what TADdaemon blessed the game with back in upgrading [12.5 hrs with no local content on one older 32 bit machine] TS2009-SP4 and after). The first couple of times ''that happens'' it can be a shock, but when you examine such a you'll find you get disappointed later when it doesn't, for on those &quot;treasure-chest&quot; routes, lies a lot of good content. Or at least I've always found a few gems, even in the bad ones. 

So why would you want to delete such? Beats me, unless it's full of things you can never see yourself using (e.g. Catenary wiring assets and trolley style rail lines just have no current attraction in this brain).
* So one alternative is to '''disable''' such content in CM (Select, {{kp|RMBHd|release}} over the menu item), and it won't appear in the asset lists any more in Surveyor.

{{TrainzTip |You can do that with blocks of assets all at once, or pick and choose through a longer list when they are separated by {{kp|CTRL|SHIFT|RMB}} clicks on individual ones. Clicking again with the shifted Ctrl will toggle beck to unselected status (i.e. Not highlighted, and  without loosing the rest of the highlighted list of 'honored selectees' and needing to start over again.) Best to do this in small groups in any event, no more than a couple of screenfuls at a time. Note the bottom item and do the menu operation, then start with the bottom item just at or off the top of the next screen.
}}
* Archiving (Same 'select, {{kp|RMBHd|release}}' process) it instead is a better method when that one route asset you want to hang onto playing in a Driving mood day will accomplish much the same thing.
{{TrainzTip |In that case you have to set up one or more archive folders. Once archived, you can't move the folder as CM will still read things in there if it needs them for a Driving Session or on another route. This just gets them out of the way in selections modes in Surveyor, as does deleting them or disabling them. Getting them out from underfoot is the goal, and the {{TG|C|CDPA files}} are ready to load for when needed on a route you drive. 
* '''Surprise Point!''', normal local content is NOT ready to load--it needs read in and processed during input. It is semi-ready, partially compressed and organized, but not pre-compiled for use.
}}
* In both cases, the asset unclutters Surveyor menus and frees you up to focus on things to try and things you know work and are compatible with this months/years projects.
{{TrainzTip |Both disabling and archiving won't make them hide in Content Manager searchings, You can't loose them if the data base is tracking them. It and TrainzUtil still can get to them. 
* You can set up a filter that won't display them, so best of both world's, you can see and not see as you choose.
}}
With today's HDDs pushing an average of well over 500 Gbytes, there is less reason than ever to totally delete an asset (excluding a stinky route and it's sessions), but that can also be a good personal challenge&amp;mdash;overhaul the thing and make it into a possession you are proud of. But if your mind is set on deletion, this page will tell you some tips.
==Backing up, in case==
As a safety precaution, you may wish to backup assets that you have created and/or downloaded before removing any of them. Do as you will with routes, but good scenery assets, trackside signals and boxes, and different track and bridge types make the rounds to many a route, so you may need such assets again for some other route. 
# The obvious method for that is to export them to CDP, so you need to scheme out a naming and tracking system for yourself, if nothing else, cut and paste kuids into a text file listing the cdp contents ''using the same name and folder''.
## {{kp|TIMESAVER}} &amp;mdash; Capture that 'name' before saving the first file (recommend the text file first&amp;mdash; when you save as, {{kp|TAB}} to the extension selection line, then {{kp|SHIFT|TAB}} to back-TAB to the Save As title line, this will then be fully highlighted, {{kp|CTRL|C}} to copy the name for the cdp file operation.)
## If CDPing a single asset, one 'Good Practice is to systematically append the KUID as part of the title in a standard never-varying method (to aid searching). {{kp|RECOMMEND}} format syntax &lt;code&gt;(kuid2_nnnnn_mmmmmm_#)&lt;/code&gt;. That's a valid format for base initial KUID codes expressed in Windows compatible file notations&amp;mdash; and it allows you to search for just the &lt;code&gt;(kuid2_nnnnn_mmmmmm'&lt;/code&gt; when needing something.
## If you sort your List after applying selection criteria filters by KUID ({{kp|Handy_Technique}}: Click on the column header, it will sort to that column)
## This dual save by same name gives you a ''Near Instant way'' to find them, going forwar. Many text search utilities (including the built-in Notepad++ {{TG|S|SAR}} ability) can see into many files to Search (Find) a kuid then. Details on how-to see into files is covered elsewhere, but being systematic and organized about the prospect will speed success in finding them later.
# For another method, this one giving you a stash of things you can examine at your leisure to see how content is put together:
## Open them for edit, Run PEV-tools from a batch file in the folder,
## Copy them all to another temporary directory,
## edit their kuid to a Kuid2 suffixed ':+1', pseudo-improvement. (for example:&lt;br
/&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;kuid:zzz:xxx:yyy&gt; to &lt;kuid2:zzz:xxx:yyy:1&gt; or&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br
/&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;kuid2:zzz:xxx:yyy:4&gt; to &lt;kuid2:zzz:xxx:yyy:5&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;)
## re-import the 'pseudo-fixed' asset to verify it is all in that folder (Textures, meshes in particular might be missing)
## recommit both of them (Note: Trainz will have made a new local folder in ..\editing when you import the changed one, ''so best to also change the asset name when promoting the kuid and/or version''. I suffix a '-a' meaning adjusted, and can search ''THAT'' in CM&amp;rarr;Names search to find all non-stock assets immediately.)
### afterwards, copy or move the error tested one in the temp folder (That can just be dragged into your archive directory once you know it's gestalt--next step), then after committing the +1-kuid test version and the original, delete both of them.
### Recommitting before deleting is in some cases an necessary step, so form the habit and make it a ''''good practice'''' of yours from the start. 
## If successful, move the folder to the 'manually managed' archive directory you manage without Trainz knowledge, freeing up the temp folder for 2-3 new assets to pillage. 
## Trainz will promptly forget they were around, especially after quitting out and reloading it, which is recommended every couple hours as a good practice.
{{TrainzTip |Running PEV's tools from the batch will usually grab the meshes and textures into the local folder.
* Recommitting the ''''original folders files'''' after running the batch, will likely get an error complaining that the texture is already in CM's cache folder. So sort by extension, delete all the textures, recommit, then delete using CM. But only ''after you're sure all the contents are in the folder you want to keep''. (Silly to go through all this and not make sure of ''THAT!'') But the goodies will be safe, ...just in case you want them later.
}}

==Pruning Routes and Sessions==
;This section also covers a process to try and move a session onto a newer version of the layout.
Layouts that you have created yourself can be deleted in Surveyor Main Menu where the Table of Contents of Routes, Sessions and Scenarios is displayed.
# First delete any related sessions, for if kept, their referencing the Route asset KUID as a dependency, so will create a {{TR|R|List of Fault types|p=Missing Dependency Fault}} or a problem to be dealt with by deleting in CM.
# The second option has two forks, start by doing a author name search for yourself, this can be your Trainz Kuid pre-fix preceded by the {{kp|#}} key: '#497853' for example. Refine that if you wish by filtering for just Routes and Sessions.
## Now with your target(s) in sight you have a choice, providing you have done as many of us do routinely and saved major change versions with a suffixed version number (Mod XXX, or V15-7) AND you want to try to put some of those old sessions on the new version, before deleting the route, Hand Edit the Session Config.txt for the Route and change it's KUIDs by searching for the old route, and replacing each place the kuid appears. In pre-2009-SP4, their will be one in the body near the English {{TR|tags|description|p=description field}} data or above the English {{TR|Containers|string-table}}, and if later versions hold true, as the last item in the {{TR|Containers|kuid-table}} container. 
## This gives you better than even chances{{check|Need to know what TS10 &amp; TS12 do with an experiment. Layers my be an issue too!}} the old session will work on the new route. It's a crap shoot if you have positioned train consists somewhere where you have adjusted track heights and/or moved the track a bit.
## One reason to hang onto that old Route until testing is it can possibly be recovered by moving back to the old kuids (Reverse the above), Edit the old route &amp; Session, relocate the cars missing the tracks to a place you didn't molest, then repeat starting above. Loop a couple of times through such attempts before giving up.
## If the consist has just been a little off it's 3D co-ordinates, using the {{kp|F7|M}} tool can allow you to grab the engine or cars from the minimap. Best to rotate the camera straight down, do a {{kp|CTRL|F}} (Find) on one of the cars, then without moving the mouse try to grab and move it. If successful, the entire consist will move too, per normal, and you will see it snaps to the track at the new height. All is well... if you can grab them. If not, delete the session and forget it. 
## Did you record the session rules settings as you went on a card-file or spreadsheet? If you did a thorough job documenting it (Easiest way to write a complicated session) you can just refer to that and re-enter it.
# In all the CM versions, all assets can be deleted from inside the Content Manager screen. Once you've done so, it's gone. Hopefully to bit heaven. Other older Trainz are more basic. TRS2004 and earlier Trainz assets can be removed by manually deleting their kuid folder in Windows Explorer. Alternatively, for this older generation, TrainzObjectz can be used to delete unwanted assets.

{{TrainzTip|
Deleting an asset does not delete any of its dependencies. With a layout, the dependencies may number in the hundreds to several thousands.
* TrainzObjectz includes an option to list and delete orphaned dependencies.
* The CMs don't care if you orphan them, but only reports when one is missing. However, you can filter and weed things out if you like. Surround a bunch on the screen with a big selection, test using the dependent assets drop down {{kp|RMBHd}} to see if any kuids need the proposed victims, if not, delete away.
}}

==TRS2006==
{{Trainz-sect-stub}}
{{TRS-cleanup}}
(The following information is kindly supplied by ColPrice2002)

Routes that have been created by you can be deleted in Surveyor.

Also you can delete any asset that is not built-in with CMP.

To delete a layout and its dependencies:

Open CMP, search form &quot;Location = Local&quot; + &quot;Category = Routes&quot; and select the layout to be deleted.

Right-click and select &quot;show dependencies&quot; from the menu. This lists the dependencies in a pop-up window.

Now click the &quot;view in main screen&quot; button, and all of the dependencies are listed. Press CTRL/A (or use the Select All menu option), then &quot;Delete&quot; to actually delete the assets.

Then return to the CMP list of layouts, select the relevant layout and delete that.

You will receive error messages if you try to delete built-in content and these can be ignored.

The only problem is that you may delete a dependency that's used by another route. You won't find out until you look at all the routes you have installed and look for the missing dependency flag (or try to load the route).

One way of reducing the impact is to archive the route and its dependencies (create a new archive for deleted routes). Carry on as before - deleting everything - if you need a deleted asset CMP will pull it from the archive. Once you're happy that the archive isn't needed you can delete it - this saves you re-downloading.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We begin with a short text:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The new electronic interdependence recreates the world in the image of a global village.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The quotation is from Marshall McLuhan's Gutenberg Galaxy (1962), p.31. This &quot;global village&quot; is like living &quot;in a single constricted space resonant resonant with tribal drums.&quot;

Such a concept of tribal drums brings to mind almost immediately the Indian tribal traditions of North America.

Drums are like bells.&lt;/br &gt;
They call to meeting. &lt;/br &gt;
They call to prayer. &lt;/br &gt;
They call to war. &lt;/br &gt;
Without their sound...&lt;/br &gt; 
...there is no community at all.&lt;/br &gt;

Let us imagine that the concept of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Village_%28term%29 global village] used by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan Marshall McLuhan] in his Gutenberg Galaxy is wrong!
What could we possibly mean by this?

And what about the earlier use of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_village_%28Internet%29 global village] by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Lewis Wyndham Lewis]?

Instead of us giving the answer here we invite you to find it for yourself. How would you do that?
It seems obvious that you will '''search''' using something like &quot;''global village''&quot; + &quot;''Wyndham Lewis''&quot;?
Try it out!

On a google search there are around 811 hits {2008-05-08}.

Now the challenge is find the text in which it appears.

=the medium is the MASSAGE=
Later on (1967) in his book &quot;The Medium is the Massage — An inventory of effects&quot; with Quentin Fiore and produced by Jerome Agel, Gingko Press, &quot;We now live in a &lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt; village...a simultaneous happening. We are back in acoustic space.&quot; p.63.

And for good measure, a picture of some of the tribe in action is shown p.66-67. This is a photo by N. R. Farbman, for Time, Inc.

=The Village=
So! How many people here reading this stuff come from a village?
Hands up!&lt;/br &gt;
Ha! I thought as much! No-one!

===Walled Gardens===
Although the Internet offers global communications, it is still heavily divided by the varieties of
language. For example, &quot;Far Eastern&quot; countries have sites in Korean/Chinese/Japanese, which are
unreadable and therefore inaccessible to those who don't know the language. Furthermore there are sites
on the site that actively block users from that don't have a 'correct' address. 
As addresses are typically doled out to ISP who tend to have a strong regional presence
this creates essentially ''walled gardens''.

===Global Village pump===
The concept of the Internet as &quot;Global Village&quot; might be considered erroneous, because communication via electronic means is not entirely analogous to that of real-life interpersonal communication.
 
The methods of communication via electronic means such as Internet fora, IRC, instant messaging etc. (excluding video conferencing) remove the ''somatic'' component from conversation. It is believed that the content of language in conversation accounts for merely 30% of global communication — the remaining 70% is due to body language and tone. The removal of these vital components from the act of communication do not lend themselves to real, meaningful conversation.
 
Also, the extreme cultural and linguistic diversity of the Internet does not correspond well with the definition of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village Village], obtained from Wikipedia:
*&quot;Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings;&quot;
This would imply that the nodes of communication on the Internet are fixed and unchanging. 
However it is a widely regarded fact that web sites and links are mostly transient; Indeed, using the Internet as a reference in academia is often frowned upon for this very reason. Perhaps the concept of a &quot;Global Village Pump&quot;, à la Wikipedia is more semantically accurate.
 
===The view from India===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi Mohandas Gandi] declared that &quot;The soul of India lives in its villages&quot;. What this implies is that villages themselves have their own character and ambience. However, the Internet as a whole does not conform to this idea; In fact, the chimeric nature of the Internet makes this nearly impossible, as the depth of complexity could never permit such a declaration.

      <comment>/* Potential (14) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Inductors in parallel (1) ===
Name the three dots as l, m and n. Redraw the circuit using these three points as reference and you’ll find that the three inductors have their ends joined to the same potential difference. Hence the effective inductance in between A and D is [1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3]&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 H.

This is a very common circuit diagram to represent elements in parallel. Please keep it in mind. What if we replace the inductors with three capacitors of 3μ each? What would be the equivalent capacitance between the points A and D?

=== Projectile (2) ===
Relate everything with the speed. Assume the speed in the beginning to be the V.

Then, &lt;math&gt;\frac{mV^2}{2}=E&lt;/math&gt;. When the ball is at its highest point, its vertical velocity would have decreased to zero (otherwise, won’t it go a little bit higher? Think about it. As a food for thought, after the highest point, the velocity changes its direction and its magnitude increases. No wonder the projectile descends after the highest point!)

Then, at the highest point of the trajectory the speed of the projectile would be its unchanged horizontal velocity - &lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{\sqrt2}&lt;/math&gt;. Find the kinetic energy using this as the speed of the ball. It will be half of E.

=== Falling from a height (3) ===
There is one thing that you need to agree with, the direction of velocity vector of both the balls is the same. If their speeds on reaching the ground are same as well, then we know the answer would be B.

Use the equation of motion &lt;math&gt;v^2=u^2 + 2as&lt;/math&gt;. The balls have the same value of initial speed, same acceleration and most importantly – the same displacement. Yes, s is nothing but displacement and we know that whenever they reach the ground their displacements will be same. We happily conclude that their final speeds would be the same as well.

Speed same, direction of velocity same. This implies their velocities on reaching the ground are same.

By the way, will the time required to reach the ground will be the same for them? You may put forward worded arguments or use equations.

=== Bullet in a block (4) ===
This question requires a little assumption that the acceleration of the bullet is the same throughout its motion. Then, we use the first data to find the acceleration.

We know the initial and final speeds, we know the displacement. So, to find the acceleration &lt;math&gt;v^2=u^2 +2as&lt;/math&gt; will do. We get &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{-v^2}{8}&lt;/math&gt;, the negative sign signifying that acceleration is opposite in direction than velocity.

Use the equation again, &lt;math&gt;0=\left(\frac{v}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{2sv^2}{8}&lt;/math&gt; the further displacement require to stop the bullet comes out to be 1 cm.

=== Satellite (5) ===
The centripetal force required to maintain circular motion is provided by the gravitational force. When a satellite moves around in an orbit its velocity constantly changes. As soon as the force disappears, there is nothing that can alter the instantaneous velocity and so the object continues to move with that velocity. [Newton’s WHAT law? Quick. I give you 5 seconds.]

=== Ammeter/Voltmeter (6) ===
{{recheck}}
Remember that an ammeter has a very low resistance [Why?]. When we use it in place of a voltmeter, the meter will move because the readings are based on deflection. The problem is, for being a nearly ideal voltmeter [one that doesn’t alter the circuit being measured] we need the voltmeter to have a very high resistance [Why?].

Done, we connect the ammeter in parallel to the points of the circuit whose potential difference is to be measured. But in order that the parallel circuit [containing the ammeter] behaves as a voltmeter, we need it to have a high resistance. Kya karein? Just connect a high resistance to the ammeter in series. As simple as that!

So, what was all that special about the question? Very special! This is a type of question which most people will attempt and get it wrong. Remember that we are converting an ammeter into a voltmeter. Generally, we convert a galvanometer into an ammeter and a galvanometer into voltmeter. Expect most study-by-rots to tick the procedure corresponding to any one of this without giving it much of a thought.

=== Ratio of magnetic fields (7) ===
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{\mu_o\left(i\right)}{2\pi\left(2R\right)}}{\frac{\mu_o\left(2i\right)}{ 2\pi\left(R\right)}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Of course, the number of turns of both the coil is one. Even that may have been mentioned to make this a probable candidate for negative marks.

Just keep one thing in mind, whenever solving such questions draw one big line and write down the fraction. Then evaluate it with ease. Otherwise, there are chances of messing up. Its just a personal advice though!

=== Plane mirrors (8) ===
360/n - 1 = 5. This is a pure formulae based problem. Not in your syllabi? Think again! We studied it way back around sixth or seventh standard.

=== Power dissipation (9) ===
Go by the same procedure. We will calculate the power dissipation using &lt;math&gt;P = \frac{V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, since we have to calculate the ratio, we write down the ratio of the two quantities and watch everything get cancelled off. I have provided this solution specifically to point out how lengthy questions can be shortened. It will take some time in realizing what I have written, but it is only to enable you to solve the question by yourself!
&lt;P&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{1}{2}\frac{V^2\left(\frac{l}{2}\right)}{\rho A} \right) \frac{1}{\frac{\rho A}{V^2 l}} = 4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;P&gt;

* When the pieces were cut into two, the resistances of the wire changed to half of the original one. We calculated this using PL/A.
* When the pieces were connected in parallel, their equivalent resistance was half of their individual resistance. [How?]

Note how swiftly we solved this problem! A typical suicidal variation would be to find the current through each circuit, then square it and multiply it with resistance in both cases. Even worse, you might waste your time in calculating the power dissipation across individual resistances and then summing them up in the second case.

=== Hydrogen atom (10) === 
One fourth of the total energy of the first orbit, i.e. -3.4 ev is the energy of the second orbit. If we give the electron 3.4 ev of energy, it’ll leave the atom, ionizing it.

The 13.6 ev KE data is needed to know that the energy of the first orbit is -13.6 ev. [Why? What’s the relation between TE and KE?]

=== Fundamental Frequencies (11) ===
Direct question on waves, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{v}{2l}}{\frac{v}{4l}} = 2&lt;/math&gt;


For practice: -
What are the fundamental wavelengths of the open organ pipe and closed organ pipe? What happens to the wavelengths as the frequency of the organ pipes increase? What series do they form?

Also, this is a question that every deserving candidate will solve. Please, please! Get it right. Also, if you solve the question and get the answer to be 1/2 DO NOT consolidate yourself! You messed up something very obvious!
=== Beats (12) === 
The tuning fork produces 4 beats/sec with another fork of frequency of 288 cps. The possible values of the frequencies of the tuning fork are 284 and 292 cps.

When the tuning fork is loaded with wax, its frequency decreases and so does the difference between the frequencies of the two forks. This eliminates 284 cps and we conclude that the answer is 292 cps.

By the way, beats/sec is in the unit of Hertz. Is Cycles/sec in the same unit? Ofcourse it is, but convince yourself that there is no need of a conversion factor of 2π in it!

=== Wave equation (13) ===
To satisfy the given conditions,
* The wave must be traveling in the opposite direction. (Negative X Axis) That is, the wave equation must be a function of ωt + kx.
* At x=0 the sum of the wave equations must amount to zero for all values of time.

=== Potential (14) ===
&lt;math&gt;Work = \Delta V&lt;/math&gt;&lt;P&gt;

20x = 2J which gives the potential difference between the two points to be 0.1 V. Just recall the definition of potential difference! We do not need anything else.

=== Circular motion in a magnetic field (15) ===
Magnetic force [qvb here] is the source of centripetal force [what’s the equation?]. Equating them, we get the expression for the radius of curvature. [So that you do not need to rot the expression.]

&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{mv}{qb}&lt;/math&gt; This equation is enough to deduce that the radius of curvature of both the particles will be same. [Note the numerator.]

By the way, because the options mention it, the particle with the greater radius will have a less curved path. [Draw two circles of different radii and check by yourself.]

=== Gravitational Potential (16) ===
The gravitational potential difference between the two points is GM/6R [positive, why?] [What is the potential energy difference?] The work done then is nothing but m times the potential difference. [Opposite in sign to the change in potential energy, why?]

=== Spring Constant (17) ===
T is inversely proportional to the square root of k. [Go back to SHM &lt;math&gt;T = 2\pi\sqrt\left(\frac{m}{k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;] K in the second case will be n times that of the first. [I’ll skip the explanation, but recall F/A = Y (∆l/L). From here, we can say that YA/L is the spring constant, since length has decreased by n times the spring constant has increased by n times.]

Using this, we say that the time period of an individual piece would be T/√n.

=== Flux (18) ===
The face BCFG is symmetric with respect to the two charges. Use your existing knowledge of vectors to deduce that the electric field at any point on the face would be perpendicular to the local area vector. [Do not forget the various derivations that use this step, including the deduction that electric field near an infinite planar sheet is perpendicular to it. All of this is elementary physics and discussed one too many times in all textbooks.] 

&lt;font color=red&gt;...and a word of caution (based on personal experiences! Go ahead, take it! Its meant to be a friendly advice!), if you cannot satisfactorily explain such trivial points in words and diagrams then either work harder or give up the hope of scoring 95 percent in your CBSE exams. They require a harmony in your studies, fragmented knowledge will NOT help in the 95% goal!&lt;/font&gt;

That’s it than, the integration of E.ds will be zero over the face. Note that we did not use Gauss’ Law to calculate the flux. It cannot be used anyways, becaue the face is not a closed surface!

=== Power dissipation, again? (19) ===
&lt;math&gt;\frac{15^2}{\frac{2R}{2+R}} = 150 &lt;/math&gt; which gives the value of R to be 6 ohms fairly easily. Infact, if you are in haste – you might skip solving the equation once you make it. Just check among the options for the one that satisfies it [Only if you’re quick at mental calculation!]

=== Resolving power (20) ===
I am not sure if this is still a part of the standard curriculum, but here’s the solution. The resolving power would be inversely proportional to the wavelength of the light used.

=== Center of mass (21) ===
Considering the velocity of the first particle positive...
&lt;math&gt;v_\left(cm\right) = \frac{m\left(2v\right) - m\left(v\right)}{m+m} = v/2&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. V/2 in the direction of the first particle. Anyways, it is obvious that the motion will be along the direction of the faster moving particle out of the two IDENTICAL ones.

=== Current and spring (22) ===
{{recheck}}
When a current is passed through the spring, its turns will act as parallel wires. These parallel wires will attract each other [Why?] and hence the spring will be compressed!

=== Heat capacity (23) ===
Based on definition.
* Heat capacity is nothing but the constant of proportionality in the relation &lt;I&gt;Q is proportional to&lt;/I&gt; ΔT.  Heat capacity in turn depends upon the mass (or more generally, the amount of a substance).
* Specific heat is then the constant of proportionality between heat capacity and mass (Specific heat capacity for mass) or between heat capacity and moles (molar specific heat capacity.

=== Silicon at absolute zero (24) ===
{{recheck}}
It is factual; however there is an explanation for it in our course! It is related to the energy band gap and thermal energy of electrons. 
=== Nature of EM waves (25) ===
Standard textbook stuff – the student is obliged to know it.
=== Optical fibers (26) ===
Again an obligatory question! Basically, what such easy questions do is to filter out insincere students. Otherwise, questions based on logical understanding cannot distinguish between students who have studied whatever they are obliged to (although they might not have gone further) and those who have been reckless.
=== Escape velocity (27) ===
Search for the expression of escape velocity in your textbook. It depends solely on the mass on the planet and not on the mass of the body which wants to escape. [Derive the expression and write two convincing lines why the mass of the body doesn’t feature in it.]
=== EM Waves (28) ===
Beta rays are streams of energetic electrons, so even if you do not know what cosmic rays are – it will not matter! Again we encounter an obligatory question. By the way, cosmic rays are an interesting topic for many. Do consider reading about them online if you are inclined towards such knowledge. And anyways, we have atleast heard of them once in our normal course – in carbon dating. [What exactly is their part over there?]
=== Seebeck Effect (30) ===
This topic is now out of the CBSE syllabi, but the relation they have asked is standard stuff – something which is asked in typical Board exam objective questions.

Anyways, here’s a little explanation. The graph of the thermo-emf and temperature of the hot junction is a downward parabola (what is it’s equation?) with two roots. First is when the two junctions are at the same temperature (obvious!!) and the other is at the inversion temperature. From the geometry of a parabola we know that there will be a maxima in between the two zeroes (! – neutral temperature) and from symmetry we know that the point where an extremum is obtained (in all standard parabolas with a displaced vertex – we are not talking of parabolas which have been inclined to the axis) is the middle point of the two zeroes. (Why? Convert the equation of the parabola in the sum of a perfect square and constant and gawk at it, you’ll know.)
=== Half life (32) ===
Three half lives have been spent and in each half-life the initial amount will be reduced to half (irrespective of its initial concentration.) Again, it is obligatory for a good student (good as in a mix of sincerity and aptitude, not excellent or hardworking!) to solve this question. 
=== Specific Resistance (33) ===
We are talking of specific resistance (and not resistance of the sample). The question is again straight forward! Instead of testing your application or understanding, it just checks if you know this fact or not.

&lt;Font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;A little note&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt; - In examination conditions we find it difficult to recall a trivial point. Once we encounter this – we spend the next few minutes thinking about it and mentally juggling between two options. Maximum amount of time the student will mark the correct option and then change it to the incorrect one. To avoid this kind of a situation, all we can do is to study intelligently. For example, in this particular case, the reason why this happens has been explained in almost all board textbooks. If incase we forget this point as a fact, we can arrive at these conclusions by mentally reconstructing the logic we have read in our course books. [Semiconductors - something related to thermal energy and band gap, conductors - ??? I’d leave it on the student to convince themselves by putting the above hints into a proper format.]

=== Capacitors in parallel (34) ===
&lt;math&gt;Energy = \frac{1}{2}C_\left(equivalent\right)V^2&lt;/math&gt;
=== Reversible cycles (36) ===
The answer can of course be found in your textbook. The only reason why you might not mark option A would be (I suppose) a confusion between some of the other options. You can check them in your textbook one by one (that is because this question, again, is obligatory! I’m emphasizing this again and again so that it can be seen that if you do not get it right, you’ll drag yourself behind others by a big margin! When you encounter such questions, give them due respect and try not to mark them wrongly!).

Here’s a little question – why do irreversible cycles have a lesser efficiency than reversible cycles? [Relate it with the amount of work done and the like...]

=== Checkpoint ===
If you notice, all questions since the early 20s are easy and every student who scores decent at school is expected to solve them! I say this to emphasize that whatever is asked in competitive exams is basically the same thing that we learn in school! Many people just do not realize this and labor unintelligently with stupid books, [The IIT-JEE is an exception only because it requires specific preparation. Otherwise the syllabus is much less than a typical board exam!]

==== Do you study by rote? ====
Also, if you are struggling with these questions even though you score decently, think once. Either what you think is decent is not decent enough or you have been scoring by rote instead of learning. It is common knowledge that in many places (like Gujarat) the students are made to write down the solution of even math problems a number of times so that they can memorize them! The GujCET is again notorious for lifting questions directly from the textbook (keeping the numerical values, statements and even the order of alternatives intact!). No wonder even teachers advise to memorize the answers to the objective questions. If you have been using this loophole to score well, don’t be surprised if you fail here. Extremely examination oriented atmosphere or incompetent teachers might be the cause, though I pay my due respect to the teachers who work hard but never get competent students!

==== Do you ever think while studying? ====
Finally, if you do not belong to any of the above two categories, are doing well and still struggled with the past few Qs – sit down and think. Have you ever practiced writing down on paper the descriptive questions? Have you ever avoided doing a problem or giving a verbal explanation asked in the textbook? Have you ever excused yourself from practicing by saying that if it is asked in the examination you’ll do it just because it is simple? Be wise. If you do something for the first time directly in an examination, either your answer will not be technically sound, or you’ll make some silly mistake. Worse still – you’ll waste some time and not attempt it at all.

Give it some thought. What was the use of reading something and giving it time when you couldn’t answer something as simple as 2+2=4 in the examination? Come out of your comfort zone my friends! Solving problems and writing practice is a must for every student aiming a decent score. &lt;Font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;More so if you dream of scoring 95% in your board exams. Its relatively easy and requires nothing but common sense and sincerity.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt; So, if you really aim 95% or even 90+ please be sincere enough. Practicing and getting out of your comfort zone is more important than laboring. You don’t need to be a genius for that. I say this based on my observation with me and my friends. If you still don’t catch the warning, God bless you!

=== Standing wave (37) ===
Either use the expression for frequency (Must!) or&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;Think!&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt; (optional). The two rigid ends will be nodes. The distance between two nodes is half the wavelength. The more the number of nodes in between, the lesser will be the wavelength. (Common sense, check and see if you can draw a diagram to convince yourself! Remember the warning that preceded!). The wavelength will be maximum when there are no nodes between the two ends. In that case, the length of the string is half the wavelength. (ends are nodes!) In other words, the maximum wavelength will be double the length of the string.&lt;/I&gt;
=== Power factor (38) ===
You know tanφ, (- X&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;/R) and you have to find cosφ. What is the big deal? Cosφ = (secφ)&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = (1 + tan&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;φ)&lt;sup&gt;-0.5&lt;/sup&gt;. This last manipulation is just a brain teaser, nothing that you haven’t learned.
=== Astronomical Telescope (39) ===
{{recheck}}
=== Escape energy (40) ===
This paper is turning out to be quite simple! There are two logics: -
* The kinetic energy required would be equal to the potential energy difference at the surface and at infinity, GMMe/R or mgR.
* The kinetic energy required would correspond to the energy of a mass moving with escape speed.

Kindly note that the first logic was used to derive the expression for the escape speed. Using the expression of the escape speed to find energy would be clumsy in a textbook. Also, GMe/R = gR (Does anyone need an explanation?)

=== Temperature and gas (41) ===
It’s a good question. The point here is that the speed of molecules is related to their temperatures. When the gas container moves, the gas particles acquire extra speed. This is the source of the confusion; does it increase the temperature of the gas?

Go back to the construction used to derive the relation between the kinetic energy and the temperature. The movement of the container walls was not mentioned at all! The change in momentum (and hence force) was with respect to the container. This resolves the confusion. There is no change in the temperature of the gas. (I’m not sure if everyone will even have this confusion – let alone resolving it!)

The above conclusion will seem more obvious when you think about it. If it were not true, wouldn’t the temperature of gas would be different in the frame of the earth and the moon even though we measure them the same time?  Think about two parallel running buses and a stationary observer when a gas cooker is placed in one of the buses.

=== Mass energy equivalence (43) ===
When water is cooled to form ice, energy is given out by the system. Does it mean that the released energy was due to the disintegration of mass into energy according to E=MC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;? Certainly not! It’s simply an enthalpy change! The pity is, some solutions that I have referred to say that this release of energy was due to loss of mass of water. Some even say that since water loses its energy, its mass will have to increase to maintain the equivalence! Please use your understanding and stay immune to such stupidity!

=== SHM (46) ===
At the mean position, the acceleration is zero and the velocity is maximum, i.e. KE - max, PE - min. (Qualitative nature of SHM). However, do not be surprised if you mark KE min and PE max. Such confusions happen! :)

=== Angular momentum (47) ===
This is again a direct question based on conservation of angular momentum. We do not expect people who have been studying in pieces to solve a numerical problem, but if you have worked hard enough for a Board Exam (specially the GSEB) get it right to maintain your dignity! We should not falter on direct questions! Here is the equation, solve ahead yourself!

&lt;math&gt;\frac{MR^2\omega_1}{2} = \left(\frac{MR^2}{2}+mR^2+mR^2\right)\omega_2&lt;/math&gt;

=== Skidding (48) ===
When the car moves around the track, it needs a centripetal force to allow the circular path. &lt;math&gt;\frac{mV^2}{R} = f_s&lt;/math&gt;, the RHS being the force of friction. Since the frictional force can have a range of values from 0 to maximum µN, the speed of the car too has a range. After all, the idea of driving at a fixed speed around a track doesn’t seem observable in nature! Now, when the frictional force reaches its maximum value, we cannot increase the speed further. If we do, the centripetal force will not be enough to maintain circular motion. At that critical speed, &lt;math&gt;\frac{mV^2_\left(max\right)}{R} = \mu mg&lt;/math&gt;, giving V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 30 m/s.

At this stage you might want to revise the case of a car moving on a banked road.

=== Velocity of efflux (49) ===
&lt;math&gt;V =\sqrt 2gh= 20 m/s&lt;/math&gt;. As a practice exercise, derive this expression using Bernoulli’s theorem and equation of continuity.

=== Spring Potential Energy (50) ===
This is a good question. It’s a seen question, but nevertheless a good one. The spring potential energy is 1/2kx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Here x is not the change in extension/compression! It is the absolute value of change in length from normal length!

The work done would be the extra potential energy stored. What would it be? 1/2k(15-5)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 1/2 k(15&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)?  C’mon! Atleast make so much of a decision!

Or be spoon fed. Conserve energy. Initial energy + Work Done = Final Energy.
&lt;math&gt;\frac{k5^2}{2} + W = \frac{k15^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
=== Pendulum (51) === 
This is the case of a physical pendulum, which is a pendulum with a finite size. In the expression &lt;math&gt;T = 2\pi\sqrt\frac{l}{g}&lt;/math&gt; l is the distance of the center of gravity (which is practically the center of mass in this case, but not always!) from the point of suspension. (How did we arrive at this simplification?) When the child stands up, the center of gravity rises up (why? Obvious, but don’t take it factually.) and so the distance from point of suspension decreases.

The time period decreases. If the angular amplitude remains same, this will mean that the speed of swinging has increased. You can observe this yourself. Sit on a swing, swing and raise your hands! (You don’t need to stand up - your aim is simply to raise your center of mass!)

Food for thought: - If center of mass and gravity rise and the angular displacement remains same, doesn’t it mean the maximum potential energy has increased? Let us put it this way, the speed of the system at mean position has increased. Where does the extra kinetic energy/potential energy come from?  Hint – stand on a swing, sit down and repeat this a hundred times. Do you feel hungry?
=== Lift (52) ===
A man standing on the ground will observe the acceleration to be g. Why did the motion of the lift have no effect on the acceleration? Well, the motion of the lift has got nothing to do with the net force on the ball. What about the man inside the lift? Either add the two accelerations according to vector rules (relative motion) or look at it this way. Since the man is inside a non inertial frame, we apply a pseudo force on the ball in direction opposite to motion - that is the upward direction. Acceleration of the ball, considering downward positive will be (mg - ma)/m = g-a downward. I leave the vector addition pathway for practice, but do not be intimidated by the word vectors! Why! You could even find the answer using normal visualization!
=== RMS Velocities (54) ===
&lt;math&gt;\sqrt \frac{3RT_H}{M_H} = \sqrt \frac{3RT_O}{M_O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Here the subscripts H and O represent hydrogen and oxygen gases respectively. Fix the values and get the answer.

There’s one problem if instead of hydrogen you were asked about helium. The molecular mass of helium is 0.004 kg/mol. That of oxygen is 0.032 kg/mol, not 0.016! In the case of hydrogen/oxygen, you might commit the same mistake of substituting atomic mass instead of molar mass twice and benefit, but not here! Also note the SI values of molar mass! Also, we need to be careful; the values of temperature to be substituted are not in Celsius but in Kelvin! To wrap it up I’d say that after a short break, we encounter one more must solve question!

=== Time period in magnetic field (55) ===
A popular question and in fact some people treat it as a fact! Here’s the math, explanation of radius can be found in the solution to Q 15.&lt;P&gt;&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2\pi R}{V} = \frac{2\pi\left(\frac{mV}{qB}\right)}{V}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;P&gt;
The time period is then independent of the speed. This fact is the working principle of the cyclotron.

=== Rigid bodies down a plane (56) ===
Note that the bodies are not rolling because there is absolutely no friction. As if that hint wasn’t enough the paper setter explicitly mentioned this! Their acceleration is then simply component of g along the plane (gsinθ). Incase of rolling, we’d require the moment of inertias and the radii of the bodies to compare. As revision, search for one such problem and solve!

=== Transformer (57) ===
=== Carnot engine (58) ===
Efficiency = 1-T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. For efficiency to be 1, T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has to be zero, which is not possible practically. Even if we achieve that temperature, it might not be feasible to operate a carnot engine. For practice, convince yourself why the other three alternatives are wrong.

Just on a side note, the NCERT textbook mentions that the pronunciation of &lt;I&gt;carnot&lt;/I&gt; isn’t &lt;I&gt;Kar Not&lt;/I&gt;. (Well, that is the place where I read it first, not that its the only place!) You might want to look it up for the actual pronunciation. In fact, even &lt;I&gt;de Broglie&lt;/I&gt; isn’t pronounced as &lt;I&gt;Dee Brog Lee&lt;/I&gt;. Watch out for it too!
=== Ring and its MI (59) ===
Note that the moment of inertia that has been asked is about a diameter, not about the axis perpendicular to its plane! This is the first mistake that people might make.

Use the perpendicular axis theorem. Let Ix and Iy be the moment of inertias about two perpendicular diameters, both (why both?) equal to X (that’s what we have to find). The equation is then, &lt;math&gt;I_x + I_y = I_z&lt;/math&gt; i.e. &lt;math&gt;2x = MR^2&lt;/math&gt;. 
=== Force and acceleration (60) ===
A little analysis is required. If the particle stays in equilibrium under the three forces, doesn’t it mean that F1 is opposite in direction but equal in magnitude to the resultant of F2 and F3? When the force F1 is removed, the resultant force on the particle is the resultant of F2 and F3, which we have seen is equal in magnitude to F1! For practice, arrive at this conclusion yourself by drawing rough vector diagrams. Most people have a phobia for vectors. Just keep in mind that vectors seemed tough only because they were introduced at a transition phase - tenth to eleventh! 
=== Force vectors (61) ===
I’ll put forward two solutions.

&lt;math&gt;A + B = 18&lt;/math&gt; - (1), &lt;math&gt;12 = \sqrt\left(A^2 + B^2 + 2AB\cos\theta\right)&lt;/math&gt; - (2), &lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{B\sin\theta}{A+B\Cos\theta}&lt;/math&gt; - (3)

Solve these three equations. Here B is the magnitude of the smaller vector. Seems difficult, but its simple. To ease your work in objective exams, just eliminate θ and then plug in values of A and B from the alternatives to see which one is correct.
{{insert-diagrams}}

Alternatively, if the resultant is perpendicular to the smaller vector, it means that the component of A along B is antiparallel to B and equal in magnitude. Acosθ = B. The resultant is then simply the component of A perpendicular to B. Asinθ = 12. Eliminate θ from the two equations by &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{B}{A}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{12}{A}\right)^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; Finally, use A + B = 18

It’s a seen question nevertheless, so I don’t think it requires specific preparation for you to solve this Q in AIEEE except revision! Of course people choose such preparatory classes because of incompetent teachers in school or teachers teaching only at their private classes. But choosing slogging for two years when you can enjoy studying in a good school (if it is available) along with all the pleasures of the school life would be a decision worth contemplating. (Don’t forget that the pleasures include everything from diving under the bench to drown laughter to gearing up for school events to freedom to bunking English classes to gossiping about idiots planning a marriage life with one of your classmates to infinity!) Hostel based coaching classes have their own advantages – but they materialize only for people who are very hardworking or have a formidable level of intellect. However, ultimately this remains my own personal opinion!

=== Identical Cars (62) ===
Identical cars imply that the two cars have the same acceleration when braked. To relate speed, displacement and acceleration use V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = u&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2as with a and s having opposite signs.
&lt;math&gt;\frac{u^2}{2s_1} = \frac{\left(4u\right)^2}{2s_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Now find the ratio.
=== Adiabatic Exponent (63) ===
The adiabatic exponent of the mixture will be defined as the ratio of C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; for the mixture. How are the two heat capacities defined? The heat required to raise the temperature of one mole of the sample by one degree at constant volume would be this quantity.
&lt;math&gt;C_v = \frac{\left(1\right) \left(1\right)\left(\frac{3R}{2}\right) + \left(1\right) \left(1\right) \left(\frac{5R}{2}\right)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
Similarly,&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;math&gt;C_p = \frac{\left(1\right) \left(1\right)\left(\frac{5R}{2}\right) + \left(1\right) \left(1\right) \left(\frac{7R}{2}\right)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

What we have done in the two cases is to write the total heat required to raise the temperature of the two gases by using their heat capacities differently and then divide it by total number of moles so that AVERAGE HEAT CAPACITY PER MOLE of the mixture is obtained.
=== Charges in equilibrium (64) ===
This question is a simplified version of a very popular question. Now, we know that the central charge q would be in equilibrium for any value of q. [Electric field is zero in that position, check and see.) The problem here is, we haven’t fixed the other two charges. The force on both of them should be zero for the whole system to be in equilibrium. There’s nothing but the coulomb’s law to be used. Diagram here is not needed.

The charge q should be opposite in sign to Q. This is because the two charges at the end repel each other. The duty of the charge q is to balance this force to zero by attracting both the Qs. Our equation here is to balance the force on any one of the two charges.
&lt;math&gt;\frac{kQq}{\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{kQ^2}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt; which gives q = Q/4 (in magnitude). Also, as we discussed before, the sign is opposite to Q. Alternatively, if you do not want to decide what the sign of the charge is, then just add the two forces as vectors and equate the resultant to zero. The answer will have the sign incorporated.
=== Pulleys and masses (66) ===
This happens to be an elementary problem. Here is the equation, using standard notations as in our textbooks.
&lt;math&gt;T – m_1g = m_1a&lt;/math&gt; (m1 going down)&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;math&gt;m_2g – T = m_2a&lt;/math&gt; (m2 going up)&lt;BR&gt;
Add the two equations so T that is eliminated.
&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{m_2 – m_1}{m_1 + m_2}g = \frac{g}{8}&lt;/math&gt; When you divide both numerator and denominator with m2, the equation will turn into a linear equation in m1/m2.

What are the needs of the following assumptions?
* Strings are inextensible
* Pulley is frictionless
* Pulley is massless (Hint – this assumption is not needed here. Why?)

=== Stefan’s law (67) ===
This question again is direct and does not require any explanation. The power radiated (Energy per second) is given by E = σeAT&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Now evaluate the fraction as we always do. In our case since the bodies have the same material the value of e is same for both.

&lt;Math&gt;\frac{E_1}{E_2} = \frac{\sigmaeA_1T^4_1}{\sigmaeA_2T^4_2} = \frac{\left(r_1\right)^2T^4_1}{\left(r_2\right)^2T^4_2} = \frac{1}{16}16 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
=== Three blocks carried away (68) ===
Use Newton’s second law. The tension in the string would be equal to (mass of block C) x (acceleration of mass C) (we have used net force T = ma). What is the acceleration? Zoom out and see the whole diagram. The acceleration of the block c would be equal to the combined acceleration of the three masses, which would be &lt;math&gt;\frac{m_a + m_b + m_c}{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Remember that when we consider the three blocks and the two strings as a system, the tension of the other two strings becomes internal force and are not counted in the equation of Newton’s law!
=== Climbing up a rope (69) ===
The weight of the man is 60g = 600 N approx! For being able to lift him, the rope should be able to exert a force more than 600 N while in the question it is mentioned that the rope cannot withstand a force greater than 360 Newton. This means that the rope cannot even support his weight, let alone the possibility of climbing up! None of the options match. Since this question paper is reconstructed based on the memory of students who have answered it (AIEEE papers were not given back to students after they answered the exams until last couple of years!) we can safely assume that the reproduction of this question was imperfect.
=== Angular momentum (70) ===
Note that the angular momentum of a particle over another point is RxL (Cross Product), where R is the position vector of that particle with respect to the point and L is the linear momentum vector (absolute, not relative to the point!). The magnitude would be then |R||L|sinθ = m|R||V|sinθ. |R|sinθ is the perpendicular distance of the point from the velocity vector. Refer the diagram. |R|sinθ is then simply l. The answer is hence mvl. Many people with incomplete knowledge of mechanics would mark mvr here, because in standard notation the perpendicular distance or radius is taken as r! AIEEE frequently does this so that people learning the formulae by heart (without knowing their exact meanings) would score a negative here!

=== Wires and magnetic field (71) ===
{{re-check}}
=== Radioactive emission (72) ===
Any particle that has a charge will be deflected in a magnetic field, just go according to that.
=== Work function (73) ===
The question confuses people as to what wavelength they are talking about. It must be the threshold wavelength. When the striking photons are of threshold wavelength, their energy is just equal to the work function of the metal. &lt;math&gt;W_f = \frac{hc}{\lambda_t}&lt;/math&gt;

So, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda_\left(Na\right)}{ \lambda_\left(Cu\right)} = \frac{\frac{hc}{W_fNa}}{\frac{hc}{W_fCu}} = \frac{4.5}{2.3}&lt;/math&gt; which is nearly equal to 2.
=== Covalent Compounds (74) ===
Covalent compounds are formed when two halffilled orbitals (or one filled and one empty in case of co-ordinate bonds) overlap. (refer Chemical Bonding) Recall that orbitals are nothing but wave functions of the electron cloud. The overlap is then an example of the wave nature of electrons.
=== Induced EMF (75) ===
In the loop, Sides AB and DC are moving along their lengths and hence there is no EMF induced in them. Side BC is not moving in a magnetic field so there is no emf across it as well. Only the rod AD has motional EMF induced across it which is equal to vBL.

* A is at a higher potential on the side AD. What does this say about the charge separation inside the rod? Where are the positive charges and what end has the negative charges?
* Suppose the loop is moving as it is but is completely immersed in the magnetic field. We say that the change in flux through it is zero and hence there is no EMF induced in it. The question is, both sides AD and BC have a motional EMF, then why is the net EMF zero? [Hint - induced EMF has a positive and negative side just like the voltage of a battery.]</text>

The case study is part of paper 2 for both SL and HL students, and they share the same case study and some of the questions, but not all.

The case study itself if a real life problem or system, and the tasks the students are asked to perform are of analysis and design. e.g. suitable data structures of the system in the case study.</text>

USR ROUND

USR ROUNDUP

USR ROUNDDOWN

=== Description === 

ROUND

Rounds the specified numericExpression to a whole number using the rounding rule (where .5 and higher are rounded up and lower values are rounded down). 

ROUNDUP

Rounds the specified numericExpression to the next whole number. 

ROUNDDOWN

Rounds the specified numericExpression down to the nearest whole number. This is the same as FIX Example:
DIM i#

FOR i = 1 TO 2 STEP 0.1
  PRINT i#,USR ROUNDDOWN(i#),USR ROUND(i#),USR ROUNDUP(i#)
NEXT output:
  1111
  1.1112
  1.2112
  1.3112
  1.4112
  1.5122
  1.6122

USR SCANFOLDER

=== Revised === 

FEBRUARY, 2002 (Release 6) 

=== Description === 

In order to use this function, you must first create a file scan record. The format for this record can be found in the &quot;Util_Files.incl&quot; header and is as follows:
  BEGIN RECORD FileScanRec
  DIM ScanSpecAS FSSpec ' 70 bytes
  DIM ScanIndex AS LONG ' File Index
  DIM TypeAS OSTYPE ' File Type
  DIM CreatorAS OSTYPE ' Creator Type
  DIM DataLenAS LONG ' Data Fork Size
  DIM RsrcLenAS LONG ' Resource Fork Size
  DIM CDateAS LONG ' Creation Date
  DIM MDateAS LONG ' Modification Date
  DIM BDateAS LONG ' Backup Date
  DIM FndrLocAS LONG ' Finder Location
  DIM FndrFlags AS WORD ' File Flags
  DIM FileAttrAS WORD ' File Attributes
  DIM recursive AS WORD ' True if recursive scan
  END RECORD 
You dimension such a record like this: 
  DIM myFileScanRecord AS FileScanRec 
To begin a scan, you will need to set up a couple of values in the scan record. The first is the FSSpec portion of the record, the second is the index which starts at zero for the first file in a folder. 
  DIM fsr AS FileScanRec
  fsr.ScanIndex = 0
  fsr.ScanSpec = myFSSpecRec 
Each time this statement is executed, the ScanIndex value is incremented and information from the next file in the list is extracted. It is not necessary to manually handle this value, but it is possible to do so when desired. 

'''Detecting Folders:'''

If the scanning process detects a folder, the result code of 1 is returned and the file type is set to _&quot;fldr&quot;. You may use subsequent calls of USR SCANFOLDER to examine embedded folders. If you make these recursive calls, be sure to set the recursive field of the FileScanRec to _zTrue. 

'''Example:'''

The following example lets the user select a folder using FILES$. Then all of the files in the same folder (along with some of the information contained in the FileScanRec) are displayed. The example first demonstrates a non recursive folder search and then a recursive folder search.
 include &quot;Util_Files.incl&quot;
 
 local fn ScanIt( fs as ^FSSpec, recursive as Boolean )
 dim as FileScanRec fsr
 
 fsr.scanIndex = 0
 fsr.recursive = recursive
 do
 fsr.scanSpec = fs
 select usr ScanFolder( fsr )
 case 0 // file
 long if fsr.fndrFlags and _fInvisible
 print fsr.scanIndex, &quot;Not Visible&quot;
 xelse
 print fsr.scanIndex, mki$( fsr.type ), 
 print fsr.dataLen, fsr.scanSpec.name
 end if
 case 1 // folder
 print fsr.scanIndex, mki$( fsr.type ),, fsr.scanSpec.name
 if ( recursive ) then fn ScanIt( fsr.scanSpec, _zTrue )
 case else // error
 exit do
 end select
 until 0
 end fn
 
 dim as FSSpec fs
 window 1,, (0, 0)-(500, 800)
 long if ( files$( _FSSpecFolder, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, fs ) )
 fn ScanIt( fs, _false )
 print &quot;-----&quot;
 fn ScanIt( fs, _zTrue )
 end if
 do
 HandleEvents
 until gFBQuit

USR SENDFILETOTRASH

=== Revised === 

February, 2002 (Release 6) 

=== Description === 

Rather than deleting a file, it is often desirable to move it to the trash. In this way, your user has a chance to retrieve it from the trash if he changes his mind. Note:
You will not be able to use this function unless you include the proper header file as follows: INCLUDE &quot;Util_Files.incl&quot;

WindowID% = Usr WPtr2WNum(WindowPtr&amp;) 

=== Description === 

If WindowPtr&amp; is the pointer to the window record of a FutureBASIC-created window, Usr WPtr2WNum returns the windowÕs ID number (this is the number that your program assigned to the window in the Window statement). Usr WPtr2WNum is the inverse of the Get Window statement and the Window(_wndPointer) function. If WindowPtr&amp; does not point to a window record, or it points to a window record of a window that was created by other means than the Window statement, the Usr WPtr2WNum function returns zero.

UCASE$

UCASE$$

=== Description === 

This function returns a copy of string$ or container$$ with all its lower-case letters converted to upper-case. This also applies to letters with diacritical marks; so for example the string &quot;mágüey&quot; will be converted to &quot;MÁGÜEY&quot;. UCASE$ is useful when you want to compare two strings for equality without regard to their letter case. For example, suppose you want all of the following strings to be treated in the same way: STAZ
Staz
staz
sTAz Any pair from the above set will be considered to &quot;match&quot; if they're compared as follows: IF UCASE$(str1$) = UCASE$(str2$) THEN PRINT &quot;Names match.&quot; The comparison of containers requires the use of an additional function. See FN FBcompareContainers for more information. Note:
To test whether one string is greater than or less than another without regard to letter case, an alternative method is to use the string comparison operators &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;. See Appendix D: Numeric Expressions, for more information.

UNIVERSALFN

=== Description === 

This function executes the routine located at the memory address specified by procPtr&amp;, optionally passing it the parameters specified in parm1, parm2 etc., and optionally returns a result. The flags parameter contains information about how parameters should be interpreted when they're passed to the routine, and what type of value (if any) should be returned. Unlike the CALL statement, the UNIVERSALFN function can be used to make &quot;mixed mode&quot; calls; that is, UNIVERSALFN allows your PPC-compiled program to call 68k-compiled routines, and vice-versa. (Note: if you are making a mixed mode call, then procPtr&amp; must be a pointer to a &quot;routine descriptor.&quot;See Inside Macintosh: PPC System Software for more information.) In the current version of FB, UNIVERSALFN can only call &quot;Pascal stack-based&quot; routines; this is the style which is most often supported by the MacOS Toolbox. Before you use UNIVERSALFN, you should make sure you know how many parameters (if any) the procPtr&amp; routine expects, what the expected data type of each parameter is, and the data type (if any) that the routine will return. Having made this determination, you should then set the flags parameter to the sum of one or more of the following constants, as appropriate (note: the flags parameter must be a static integer expression; it can't be a variable):

Constant                    Description
 
_rtnNone (0)      Routine does not return a value.
 
_rtnByte (16)     Routine returns a byte value.

_rtnWord (32)     Routine returns a word (2-byte) value.
 
_rtnLong (48)     Routine returns a long (4-byte) value.
 
_p1Byte (64)      Routine expects 1st parameter to be a byte. 

_p1Word (128)     Routine expects 1st parameter to be a word. 

_p1Long (192)     Routine expects 1st parameter to be a long. 
  
_p2Byte (256)     Routine expects 2nd parameter to be a byte. 

_p2Word (512)     Routine expects 2nd parameter to be a word. 

_p2Long (768)     Routine expects 2nd parameter to be a long. 
  
_p3Byte (1024)    Routine expects 3rd parameter to be a byte. 

_p3Word (2048)    Routine expects 3rd parameter to be a word. 

_p3Long (3072)    Routine expects 3rd parameter to be a long.
 
_p4Byte (4096)    Routine expects 4th parameter to be a byte. 

_p4Word (8192)    Routine expects 4th parameter to be a word. 

_p4Long (12288)   Routine expects 4th parameter to be a long. 
  
_p5Byte (16384)   Routine expects 5th parameter to be a byte. 

_p5Word (32768)   Routine expects 5th parameter to be a word. 

_p5Long (49152)   Routine expects 5th parameter to be a long. 
  
through...  
 
_p13Byte =        (&amp;40000000) Routine expects 13th parameter to be a byte. 

_p13Word =        (&amp;80000000) Routine expects 13th parameter to be a word. 

_p13Long =        (&amp;C0000000) Routine expects 13th parameter to be a long. 


Routine constants are located in the TlBx Stndard.Incl. The maximum number of parameters that can be used for a universal function is 13. Example:
_myProcFlags = _rtnWord + _p1Word + _p2Long
x% = UNIVERSALFN(procAddr&amp;, _myProcFlags, 307, fred&amp;) Note:
It's vital that you set up the flags parameter properly, so that the stack pointer will be adjusted correctly when the routine is called. An incorrectly adjusted stack pointer can cause your program to crash.

UNS$

=== Description === 

This function interprets the internal bit pattern of expr as an unsigned integer, then returns a string of decimal digits representing that integer's value. The length of the returned string depends on which of DEFSTR BYTE, DEFSTR WORD or DEFSTR LONG is currently in effect; the returned string may be padded on the left with one or more &quot;0&quot; characters, to make a string of the indicated length. If expr is a positive integer, then the number represented in the returned string will be the same as the value of expr (provided that the current DEFSTR mode allows UNS$ to return sufficient digits). If expr is a negative integer, then its internal bit pattern is different from that of an unsigned integer. In this case, the number represented in the returned string will be:


expr + 28, if DEFSTR BYTE is in effect; 

expr + 216, if DEFSTR WORD is in effect; 

expr + 232, if DEFSTR LONG is in effect. 


Note:
To convert a &quot;signed integer&quot; expression sexpr into an &quot;unsigned integer&quot; expression which has the same internal bit pattern, just assign sexpr to an unsigned integer variable. For example: myUnsLong&amp;` = mySignedLong&amp;

USING

=== Description === 

This function returns a decimal string representation of the numeric expr, formatted according to specifications in format$. The characters in format$ are interpreted as follows:   If format$ contains any characters other than the specifiers listed above, they are transferred unaltered to the returned string. Example:
x! = 14.726
PRINT USING &quot;You owe me $#,###.##.&quot;; x! program output:
You owe me $14.73.

DEF REMOVESTR

=== Description === 

Removes a string from the block referenced by str#handle&amp;. The block must be in the format of an &quot;STR#&quot; resource, and typically str#handle&amp; will be the handle to an &quot;STR#&quot; resource that your program has previously loaded, or the handle to a block that you intend to add as an &quot;STR#&quot; resource. The item% parameter indicates the sequential number of the string you want to remove; 1 indicates the first string in the list. If item% is greater than the number of strings currently in the list, then DEF REMOVESTR does nothing. Note:
Never use DEF REMOVESTR on a purgeable resource, unless you first call FN HNOPURGE(str#handle&amp;) to (temporarily) make it unpurgeable. If you think the resource may have been purged before you had a chance to call FN HNOPURGE, then you should also CALLLOADRESOURCE(str#handle&amp;) to make sure it's loaded into memory. If you are using DEF REMOVESTR to update an existing &quot;STR#&quot; resource, then use CALLCHANGEDRESOURCE(str#handle&amp;) after using DEF REMOVESTR, to cause your changes to be written to disk when the resource file is closed or updated.

DEF SETBUTTONFOCUS

=== Revised === 

February, 2002 (Release 6) 

=== Description === 

This procedure sets the target button to be the focus in the current output window. Subsequent key presses will be directed toward that button. Depending on the attributes used when the button was created, this item will usually be encircled by a focus ring.

DEF SETBUTTONFONTSTYLE

=== Revised === 

February, 2002 (Release 6) 

=== Description === 

This procedure sets up all of the font information associated with an Appearance Manager, control-based edit field. You may build such a field using the APPEARANCE BUTTON statement with the type of _kControlEditTextProc. Text may be placed in this type of button using DEF SETBUTTONTEXTSTRING. Before modifying text in an Appearance Manager, control-based edit field, you must create a control font style record. This record is defined in the Tlbx Appearance.Incl as follows: 

BEGIN RECORD 

ControlFontStyleRec
   
   DIM flags     AS SHORT
   
   DIM font      AS SHORT
   
   DIM size      AS SHORT
   
   DIM style     AS SHORT
   
   DIM mode      AS SHORT
   
   DIM just      AS SHORT
   
   DIM foreColor AS RGBCOLOR
   
   DIM backColor AS RGBCOLOR

END RECORD 

You dimension a local copy of the record like this: DIM cfsr AS ControlFontStyleRec The first item that must be filled in for the controlFontStyleRec is the flags entry which will tell the Appearance Manager which parameters are important. Appropriate values for this item are: 

_kControlUseFontMask

_kControlUseFaceMask

_kControlUseSizeMask

_kControlUseForeColorMask

_kControlUseBackColorMask

_kControlUseModeMask

_kControlUseJustMask 

Items may be added together by joining the appropriate constants. For instance, if you wanted to change the font and back color of a field, you would use the following: cfsr.flags = _kControlUseFontMask_kControlUseBackColorMask The following, fully functional program creates an Appearance Manager, control-based
edit field and sets the text to Monaco, bold on a red background: WINDOW 1
APPEARANCE BUTTON 1,1,1,0,1,&quot;&quot;,¬
  (10,10)-(200,200),_kControlEditTextProc DIM cfs AS ControlFontStyleRec cfs.flags = _kControlUseFontMask + ¬
            _kControlUseFaceMask + ¬
            _kControlUseBackColorMask

cfs.font            = _monaco

cfs.style           = _boldBit%

cfs.backColor.red   = -1

cfs.backColor.green = 0

cfs.backColor.blue  = 0 

DEF SETBUTTONFONTSTYLE( 1, cfs ) DEF SETBUTTONTEXTSTRING( 1, &quot;Hello&quot; ) DO
HANDLEEVENTS
UNTIL 0

DEF SETBUTTONTEXTSELECTION

=== Revised === 

February, 2002 (Release 6) 

=== Description === 

Use this procedure to set the selection range of an Appearance Manager, control-based edit field. (Such buttons are created using the APPEARANCE BUTTON statement with a type like _kControlEditTextProc.) The minimum value for selStart is zero for the position before the first character. The maximum value for selEnd is 32767 (or _maxInt). To set the selection to the end of the field, use: DEF SETBUTTONTEXTSELECTION(bRefNum&amp;, _maxInt, _maxInt)

DEF SETDOUBLEBYTE 

=== Revised === 

July 26, 2000 (Release 3) 

=== Description === 

FB provides the tools for you to handle double-byte characters for use with applications that support Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean scripts. FB provides three ways of handling scripts. The choices are available in the Preferences window under the Vars tab. Only one selection (&quot;Automate handlers for 1 &amp; 2 byte strings&quot;) will allow the use of this statement. Because automated handlers are in effect at all times, you may wish to have your program temporarily ignore them by using DEF SETSINGLEBYTE and reinstate them later with DEF SETDOUBLEBYTE.

Syntax 1: DEF SETWINDOWBACKGROUND

Syntax 2: DEF SETWINDOWBACKGROUND

=== Revised === 

February, 2002 (Release 6) 

=== Description === 

Using Syntax 1, this sets the output window's background to be auto-refreshing. It even maintains the background after the closing of an edit field or button without requiring a window update. This also insures that the proper background is used whether your application is operating in OS 9 or X. This only works with the Appearance Runtime. Syntax 2 is used to set a background color for the window. The color is a standard RGBcolor record. The applyNowBool parameter is non-zero if the window is to be updated immediately and false if the change will take place the next time anything is drawn in the window. Acceptable values for the _backgroundconstant are: 

_kThemeActiveDialogBackgroundBrush           ( 1)

_kThemeInactiveDialogBackgroundBrush         ( 2)

_kThemeActiveAlertBackgroundBrush            ( 3)

_kThemeInactiveAlertBackgroundBrush          ( 4)

_kThemeActiveModelessDialogBackgroundBrush   ( 5)

_kThemeInactiveModelessDialogBackgroundBrush ( 6)

_kThemeActiveUtilityWindowBackgroundBrush    ( 7)

_kThemeInactiveUtilityWindowBackgroundBrush  ( 8)

_kThemeListViewSortColumnBackgroundBrush     ( 9)

_kThemeListViewBackgroundBrush               (10)

_kThemeIconLabelBackgroundBrush              (11)

_kThemeListViewSeparatorBrush                (12)

_kThemeChasingArrowsBrush                    (13)

_kThemeDragHiliteBrush                       (14)

_kThemeDocumentWindowBackgroundBrush         (15)

_kThemeFinderWindowBackgroundBrush           (16) 

Example:


The following code builds a window and sets the background. If the same code were run under system 9, the window with the theme background would be solid gray. WINDOW 1 DEF SETWINDOWBACKGROUND(¬
   _kThemeActiveDialogBackgroundBrush,_zTrue)

DEF SHADOWBOX

=== Description === 

This statement draws a box with a single-pixel drop shadow, and erases the interior of the box. The box is drawn just outside of the rectangle specified by rect (which should be an 8-byte variable such as a RECT type) or pointed to by rectAddr&amp;. The box can be used as a border for text, pop-up menu items, and other things. The box is not automatically refreshed, unless you're using the &quot;FB Lite&quot; runtime. Otherwise; your program should explicitly re-draw it (call DEF SHADOWBOX again) when you receive an update event for the window. FB Lite behavior:
When you use the &quot;FB Lite&quot; runtime, DEF SHADOWBOX switches to the Graphics Window before executing. 

Example:

DEF SHOWPOP

=== Description === 

This statement draws a pop-up menu triangle () in the upper-right corner of the rectangle specified by rect (which should be an 8-byte variable such as a RECT type) or pointed to by rectAddr&amp;. This triangle is most often used with pop-up menus. Unless youÕre using the ÒFB LiteÓ runtime, the triangle is not automatically refreshed. Your program should explicitly re-draw it (call DEF SHOWPOP again) when you receive an update event for the window. FB Lite behavior:
When you use the &quot;FB Lite&quot; runtime, DEF SHOWPOP switches to the Graphics Window before executing.

DEF TAB

=== Description === 

This statement sets the default print field width to fieldWidth characters. This affects the number of space characters which are output when a comma is encountered in subsequent PRINT, PRINT# and LPRINT statements. When an item in such a statement follows a comma, FB outputs enough space characters so that each new item begins in a new print field which is fieldWidth characters wide. fieldWidth must be between 1 and 255. When the program starts, the default print field width is 16 characters. The value of the print field width affects comma-delimited items whether they're sent to a disk file or to a display device.

DEF TITLERECT

=== Description === 

This statement draws and titles a rectangle in the current output window, as shown in the figure below. This statement is useful for creating title rectangles around button groupings (especially with radio and checkbox buttons). The titlePosition% parameter specifies the title's horizontal offset (in pixels) from the left side of the rectangle. The rectangle is given by the 8-byte structure contained in the variable rect or pointed to by rectAddr&amp;. The rectangle is drawn using the current pen pattern and pen size. The title is drawn using the current font settings. In general, you will want to set the text copy mode to _srcCopy in order to erase the part of the rectangle where the text appears. Unless you're using the &quot;FB Lite&quot; runtime, the titled rectangle is not automatically refreshed. Your program should explicitly re-draw it (call DEF TITLERECT again) when you receive an update event for the window.

FB Lite behavior:

When you use the &quot;FB Lite&quot; runtime, DEF TITLERECT switches to the Graphics Window before executing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
So far, our polynomials contain only a single term,
such as:

    &lt;math&gt;y = 2 x^3&lt;/math&gt;

This is rather restrictive. For example, the equation of
a line:

    &lt;math&gt;y = m x + b&lt;/math&gt;

can be considered a polynomial whose term has power of
one plus an added constant, ''b''. In other words:

    &lt;math&gt;y = m x^1 + b&lt;/math&gt;

How do we deal with the constant? We could modify our
''term'' constructor to take a third argument, a constant.
In this case, we would model the line:

    &lt;math&gt; y = 3 x - 5 &lt;/math&gt;

as:

    term(3,1,-5)

While this would work, the approach is going to
make things complicated when we start to model
polynomials that are composed of multiple terms.
Consider:

    &lt;math&gt; y = 4 x^4 - 2 x^3 + 5 x^2 + x - 3 &lt;/math&gt;

This polynomial could be represented by the following terms:

    term(4,4,0)
    term(-2,3,0)
    term(5,2,0)
    term(1,1,-3)

with the first three terms having zero as a constant.
Alternatively, we could represent the polynomial this way instead:

    term(4,4,1)
    term(-2,3,2)
    term(5,2,3)
    term(1,1,-9)

Now every term has a constant (note all the constants add
up to -3 as they should). You should see two problems
now with adding a third argument to ''term''.
The first is most terms don't have
(or shouldn't have) a constant.
The second is it is unclear which term, in a collection of terms,
should hold the constant.

Before I give you a better way, I'm going to tell you
a story first. A friend of mine had a brother (or
cousin or whatever, I don't remember which)
who, lacking a crowbar, used
a Craftsman screwdriver to pry some rather heavy
and rather stuck piece of machinery out of its 
housing. The piece refused to budge so the brother
(or cousin or whatever) put his full weight on
the screwdriver, which promptly bent. Now you
may not know this, but a screwdriver that is bent
is nearly useless for doing things a screwdriver
normally does (like screwing or unscrewing screws).
As it happens, Crafstman hand tools had a lifetime
warranty, so the brother (or cousin or whatever) took
the bent screwdriver back to Sears and asked
for a replacement. The clerk happily obtained
a new screwdriver and remarked, as
she exchanged screwdrivers, &quot;You know, Sears sells 
Craftsman crowbars as well&quot;.

What is the moral of the story? It is, of course,
''Use the right tool for the right
job''.
&lt;ref&gt;
Sometimes, Computer Scientists ignore this rule,
preferring an alternate
the moral of the story:
''Next time, use a bigger screwdriver''.
This is because Computer Scientists (again
with the laziness) don't want to write
something from scratch (a crowbar), but would rather
use something else that has already been written
and can be adapted for the
job at hand (the screwdriver).
Sometimes, this works nicely, but sometimes
it leads to added complications down the road.
In this particular case, a constant ''c'' could be represented as
a term with coefficient ''c'' and exponent zero.
Instead, we will design our second kind of object in
our calculus system.
&lt;/ref&gt;
We need a new tool to represent constants.

==Constant Objects==

You are probably asking, what's the big deal with constants
anyway? Why can't we just use numbers? We could, but consider
this exchange:

     sway&gt; var s = t . diff();
     OBJECT: &lt;OBJECT 4369&gt;

Suppose ''t'' is bound to a term object. Then all is well and good;
''s'' is bound to a term object as well. But suppose ''t'' is 
bound instead to the number eight. We get a much nastier response
from the terminal:

    sway&gt; var s = t . diff();
    EVALUATION ERROR: :accessError
    dot operator used on type INTEGER

We tried to treat the number eight as an object, which it is not.
Since numbers are valid mathematical entities and since it is sensible
to take the differential of a number, we are left with two choices:

# Every time we wish to take the differential or find a value or visualize, we need to test to see if the entity we are dealing with is an object  or not.
# Make sure numbers are objects with ''diff'', ''value'', and ''toString'' methods.

The first choice means every bit of code we write in the future has
to take into account that we have two kinds of things to  deal with
and we best not forget it.

The second choice means spending a little time up front, but never
worrying multiple kinds of entities again.

Clearly the second choice is the way to go.
Before we write our constructor for representing
constants, we need to ask ourselves three things:

* What is the value of a constant at a particular point?
* What is the derivative of a constant?
* What is a reasonable string representation of a constant?

These three things correspond to the three methods all of
our constructors must have.

The first of these questions seems to be a bit strange.
The value function for a ''term'' computed a value of the
term given a value of ''x''. As ''x'' varies, the value
of the term varies as well. But for a constant, there is
does not seem to be an ''x''. This is not exactly true,
since there is an equation where the value of ''y'' remains constant
regardless of the value of ''x''. An example is the equation

    &lt;math&gt; y = 5 &lt;/math&gt;
    
We can plot that equation:

   [[Image:ch05-figure01.png]]

and we see that, regardless of the value of ''x'', the
value of ''y'' remains constant.
Thus, the ''value'' method of a constant object should
ignore the given value of ''x'' and return its constant value:

    function constant(n)
        {
        function value(x)
            {
            n;
            }
        this;
        }

Note how the value method always returns ''n'':

    sway&gt; var c = constant(5);

    sway&gt; c . value(0);
    INTEGER: 5

    sway&gt; c . value(3);
    INTEGER: 5

Moving on, what is the differential of a constant? In other words,
how does the value of our object change as the value of ''x'' is
changed. We see from the interaction above that the value doesn't
change at all. In other words the change is zero. You might, therefore
be tempted to write the ''diff'' method for a constant object as:

    function diff()
        {
        0;       //incorrect
        }

This would be incorrect, however, since all ''diff'' methods must return
objects that have ''diff'' methods themselves. We saw that with
terms: the ''diff'' method of a term object
returns a term object, which has a ''diff'' method as desired.
For the task at hand,
what object should be used to represent the number zero?
A constant object!

    function constant(n)
        {
        function value(x)
            {
            n;
            }
        function diff()
            {
            constant(0);
            }
        this;
        }

Our final question to answer is how do we visualize a constant? That is
easy to answer: we simply convert the number into a string. We are left
with our complete constant constructor:

    function constant(n)
        {
        function value(x)
            {
            n;
            }
        function diff()
            {
            constant(0);
            }
        function toString()
            {
            &quot;&quot; + n;
            }
        this;
        }

==Using Constant Objects==

That was quite a detour! Remember, we are trying to model a
line using therm and constants.
The line:

    &lt;math&gt;y = m x + b&lt;/math&gt;

can be represented by two objects:

    term(m,1)
    constant(b)

What happens when we add them together?

    sway&gt; var m = 3;
    sway&gt; var b = -5;
    
    sway&gt; term(m,1) + constant(b);
    EVALUATION ERROR: :argumentTypeError
    addition: cannot add type OBJECT to type OBJECT

What we need now is a way to glue these two objects together.
Clear
Let's test it out. Recall our term constructor:

    function term(a,n)
        {
        function value(x)
            {
            a * (x ^ n);
            }
        this;
        }
    
Let's create a constant with value 7 and see if indeed the resulting
value of the term is constant regardless of the value of
''x''.

    var c = term(7,0);

Contracts are an integral part of everyday life.  Working for an employer; insuring your car or your house and even buying a pint of milk are all governed by the law of contract.  Although each of the three situations given above have their own specialist areas of law (employment law, insurance law and consumer law respectively) they are all governed by a set of underlying fundamental principles often referred to as the &quot;general law of contract&quot;.  The increasing development of specialised areas for particular types of contract has led to some discussion as to whether this general part should be abolished.  Whilst as a matter of legal practice there is unlikely to be a case involving purely the general contractual principles outlined here, it should be emphasised that the basic rules are still fundamental for an understanding of these more advanced fields.

In seeking a definition of what a contract is, that given in the US Restatement may provide a useful starting point: 

A contract is a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty.

This may be seen as giving three interconnected elements:
# A promise &lt;br&gt; In the context of English law, a reference to a promise here may be seen as misleading.  It is often (rightly) stated that English law will not give effect to a mere promise and that an agreement, or meeting of minds, is required.  In fact, this is simply a way of distinguishing between two types of promise, namely those which do and don't give rise to a legal duty.  Thus, a promise to meet one's other half for dinner at 7pm gives rise to no legal obligation - it is a &quot;mere&quot; promise - whereas a promise to sell someone a car for £5000 gives rise to legal obligation. 
# A legal duty arising from that promise &lt;br&gt; Here, English contract doctrine distinguishes between [[#Glossary | '''bilateral''']] and [[#Glossary | '''unilateral''']] contracts.  A [[#Glossary | '''bilateral''']] contract gives rise to obligations on both sides. Thus in a contract of sale, the seller has an obligation to transfer title in the thing sold to the buyer, whilst the buyer has an obligation to pay the price.  A [[#Glossary | '''unilateral''']] contract, by contrast, gives rise to obligations on one side only.  Thus &quot;I will give you £100 if you run a marathon&quot; gives rise to a legal duty on the maker of the statement (the [[#Glossary | '''promisor''']]) to pay the money if the race is run, whilst the person to whom the statement is made (the [[#Glossary | '''promisee''']]) is under no obligation to run in the first place. &lt;br&gt;
# A remedy for breach of that duty &lt;br&gt; In considering the development of remedies, a fundamental distinction in English law between [[#Glossary | '''common law''']] (often just abbreviated to law) and [[#Glossary | '''equity''']] must be understood.  For much of its history, England had two separate systems of law working side by side, each of which had different rules.  One, administered by the courts of common pleas and king's bench, was called &quot;the common law&quot;; the other, presided over by the Lord Chancellor in the court of chancery was &quot;equity&quot;.  Since the Judicature Acts of the nineteenth century the two systems have been administered by the same courts, although they remain separate sets of doctrine.  Most important for our current purposes is that the two systems developed different sets of remedies for breach of contract, although other equitable rules which have application to contracts will be discussed as they arise.

Thus, the first issue this text must discuss is when a promise will be seen to give rise to a legal duty, in other words, the formation of a contract.  Before turning to discuss the remedies offered by the law for breach in the third section, it will be necessary to consider what is considered a breach in the second section.  Finally, the fourth section is intended to deal with a question not raised by the definition above.  This topic is commonly referred to as &quot;vitiation of contract&quot; and covers situations where, although a contract appears to give rise to a ''prima facia'' legal duty, another factor - such as mistake, fraud or duress - intervenes to make the contract unenforcable.

== Contract formation ==
One of the interesting complexities of English contract law is that it bears the marks of two different conceptions of how a contract is formed, which derive from two different periods of English legal history.  On the one hand, most legal historians agree that up until the nineteenth century the predominant conception of a contract in England was as a mechanism of &lt;i&gt; exchange &lt;/i&gt;: giving something of value entitled one to something in return (and hence to an action before a court to obtain it or its monetary equivalent).  When, on the other hand, the first contract textbooks came to be written in the late eighteen and early nineteenth centuries - the era when the teaching of national law began in English universities - authors drew inspiration from continental authors, especially the French legal academics Pothier and Domat.  These authors developed structures and ideas in their work designed to describe the French law of contract, based largely on Roman law as developed by medieval thinkers.  One can therefore explain a great deal of modern English contract doctrine - particularly about how contracts are formed - in terms of the conflict between these two conceptions.

The great theoretical basis developed by the French authors is translated into English as the &lt;i&gt;will theory&lt;/i&gt; (in French &lt;i&gt;l'autonomie de la volonté&lt;/i&gt;) according to which the binding force or legal power of a contract comes, not from the completion of an expected exchange, but from the &lt;i&gt;consensus ad idem&lt;/i&gt; formed by the parties: the meeting of their minds or the agreement they reach about what the contract is to say.  A common way of describing this idea is that a contract becomes &quot;the law of the parties&quot;: what the parties have decided to form as an obligation between themselves assumes the same binding force as, for example, a criminal prohibition.

The conflict between this conception and the traditional English notion of exchange becomes clear if one considers [[#Glossary | &lt;b&gt;donation&lt;/b&gt;]] (the legal term for the giving of a gift).  In French law, this constitutes a contract: there has been consensus between the parties on who is to give what to whom.  English law, on the other hand, does not recognise donation as a type of contract: it is not an exchange but a mere gift and so, following the logic given above, the [[#Glossary | &lt;b&gt;donee&lt;/b&gt;]] (person who receives the gift) has no contractual right to demand anything from the [[#Glossary | '''donor''']]: she has not given anything in return.

Yet, despite these differences, English law still claims to be founded on the supremacy of the parties' consent, on their &lt;i&gt; intention &lt;/i&gt;.  This is therefore the first element of the formation of contract that must be examined.  After that, consideration will be given to the form in which such intention must be expressed before turning to the question of the ''validity of a promise'': what the law expects in order to make a promise given in the required form legally enforceable.  Finally in this section, questions of ''privity and third parties'' will be considered: situations where the obligations and rights which arise from a promise entend beyond the simple pairing of promisor and promisee.

=== The Proof of the Promise: Objective Intention ===
Perhaps the most difficult and important aspect of attempting to determine the intention of contracting parties is one of proof: how to establish what is going on inside the minds of the parties at the time the contract is formed.  In attempting to come up with a satisfactory and practical answer to this problem, a distinction has traditionally been made between ''objective'' and ''subjective'' intention.  

[[#Glossary | '''Subjective intention''']] is a term used to describe the idea of intention as commonly understood - the internal motivation of an individual.  It is simple common sense that this will be very difficult to prove to the standard expected by a court of law: in matters relating to contract (and indeed any context outside of the criminal law) this standard of proof is ''the balance of probablities'', or whether one can be more than 50% sure (on balance) that the evidence produced proves the conclusions that are being sought to be drawn from it.  Clearly it is very difficult to be this sure of the internal psychological workings of another human being.  

By contrast, the notion of [[#Glossary | '''objective intention''']] is used to describe the idea that one can infer the parties' intentions from their actions.  In other words, the question that is asked to determine objective intention is not ''&quot;what was going on inside the heads of the parties&quot;'' but ''&quot;what a reasonable, ordinary observer of their behaviour would think their intention was&quot;''.  The position of this hypothetical external observer is, in effect, that of a court trying to determine the intentions of the parties and it is therefore this objective conception of intention which is used as the legal test.  A case which illustrates this idea nicely is that of ''Smith v. Hughes''.

| This rather complicated nineteenth century case concerned the sale of some oats by the [[#Glossary | '''claimant''']] (referred to in the legal vocabulary of the time as the ''plaintiff'') to the [[#Glossary | '''defendant''']], who owned some stables.  The defendant bought the oats after viewing a sample, it being very important to him that the oats were old oats (newly-harvested oats can cause digestive trouble in horses).  Subsequently, it came to light that the oats were not, as thought, old enough to be suitable for the horses.  The defendant therefore refused to pay the agreed price for the oats and was sued by the claimant.  

This case raises a number of important issues, only one of which is relevant to the current discussion.  Of the three judges in the Queen's Bench Division, one (Cockburn CJ) delivered a judgement irrelevant to our present topic.  The other two (Hannan and Blackburn JJ) decided the case in part by seeking to draw a subtle distinction between the situation where the defendant agreed to take the oats believing that they were old and that in which he agreed to take them in the belief that the claimant was contracting to sell old oats.  In other words, the crucial question raised by the case was whether the defendant believed that the claimant was guaranteeing that the oats would be suitably old so as to be safely fed to his horses.  

The crucial point to note about the judgement at this point is how this belief was to be assessed: were the actions of the claimant such as to lead a reasonable man in the position of the defendant to suppose that he was offering to sell old oats?  In other words, we see here a classic application of what has come to be known as the test of objective intention.

Equally, in ''Thake v. Maurice''([1984] 2 All ER 513) an assurance by a surgeon that a vasectomy would render a man &quot;irreversibly sterile&quot; was held to mean that objectively this was the result he was contracting to produce.  When - although the procedure was properly carried out - the claimant's wife fell pregnant, it was held that the surgeon had breached his obligation, as objectively interpreted.

=== The Form of the Promise: Offer and Acceptance ===
Having discussed the question of what constitutes the intention to contract, we must now turn our attention to the question of the form which any contract must take in order to be considered valid.  The first major requirement is that there has been an [[#Glossary | '''offer''']]: a statement setting out the terms under which the would-be [[#Glossary | '''promisor''']] is willing to be bound.  This must be followed by an unconditional [[#Glossary | '''acceptance''']] on the part of the [[#Glossary | '''promisee''']].  A case giving helpful examples of these ideas is ''Moran v. University College Salford''.

It is now necessary to consider each of these two notions in more detail, in order to distinguish them from other forms of legally-significant statements.  After this will be discussed criticisms that have been made of the concepts and difficulties that can arise.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;Offers and the &quot;Invitation to Treat&quot;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;Acceptance and Counter-Offer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Simplistic Difficulty of Offer and Acceptance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

=== The Form of the Promise: Certainty ===
=== The Validity of the Promise: Intention to Create Legal Relations ===
=== The Validity of the Promise: Consideration ===

Consideration is a requirement to be complied with for a contract to be valid. For a promise to be enforceable as a contract something (some consideration) must be given in exchange for that promise. In other words the promisor should receive some advantage or benefit or, alternatively, the promisee must suffer some detriment. The general rule in English contract law is that without consideration a contract shall be deemed invalid or, to be more precise, there will be no contract concluded at all. 

The doctrine of consideration is a traditional notion which has existed in English and common law for centuries. Effectively, it represents one of the main pillars on which the Law of Contract is based. At the same time it is evident that the requirement of consideration has come under constant and strong criticism. Thus, accepting as a postulate that any significant changes in law should only be initiated when there is a strong case for them we need to investigate the reasons for that criticism and assess whether it is substantiated enough to call for the review.   

It appears that the main argument for preserving the doctrine of consideration is based on its traditional nature and it being an integral part of English contract law. However, the opponents rightly point out to continental legal systems which do well without having this doctrine. Consideration as a doctrine is not present in legal systems of Scotland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. Nor can it be found in countries such as South Africa, Japan or Russia.

=== Parties to the Promise: Privity ===

==Breach of the Contract==
I would like to add what I have learned here that is applicable to what a breach of contract is, and what needs to be proved in a civil court in the US, to win a court case.
As a paralegal it can be explained in a few short paragraphs.
Breach mean &quot;to break&quot;, so thus, breach of contract means to &quot;break a contract&quot;.
You must argue and prove all the following 4 points in a breach of contract case.
1. That a contract existed.
2. That the plaintiff fulfilled his contractual obligations.
3. That the contract was breached.
4. the plaintiff suffered harm.
And we are off to the horse races.
One above states that there was a contract. Preferably written, oral contracts in many cases can be proved too.
Two above says did the plaintiff, fulfill his contractual obligations. Say I offered to buy your car for $2000.  I give you $2000 and a few days later you call and say you do not want to sell the car. Well I fulfilled my part of the contract, I gave you $2000. It works the other way too, you arrive with the car and I don't have $2000.
Three, the defendant did not return with the car, or pay the $2000.
Four, I had to go rent a car for a week, and then bought a similar car for $2500, damages. Or on the opposite hand, you sold the car for $1500 ($500 damages).
There are many court cases and references I need to cite to make this complete.

== Book Structure ==

I find that, if I'm going to learn a new language, the best way is to look at code. Rather than organize the book like this, you could organize the reference part of the book like this. The book itself might be framed by example, for instance:


Chapter one: Hello world.
- Explain everything that goes on in the hello world app, such as the structure of a Java Program, How everything is Object oriented, the main() method, the import statement, and calling a method, prinln(), reference the OOP way: Class.subclass.method().

Chapter two: Hello back.
- Add input to the hello world app. Create an exception for getting bad input. 

Chapter three: Your own class.

...etc.



This is what I had planned, to some extent. I'd rather not
do a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; app; I think that is the wrong way to teach Java.
I'd rather start with something useful - maybe a basic grep-like filter.
Either way, the basics of writing a Java program, compiling it, running it
would be in the [[Java Programming/Overview]] section.

I'm also following the basic structure of [[Ada Programming]],
just changing the details (This outline is much simpler,
but structurally similar). [[Programming:Ruby]] is similar:
a basic overview, then introduction to the major language
concepts.--[[User:Djb|djb]] 01:56, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

It seems like this book is more a hodgepodge of topics than an actual textbook of any kind. I think a more organized structure is desparately needed.
[[User:Darkxxxxillusion|Darkxxxxillusion]] 22:10, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

== Learning by Examples ==

Should the book construct an ever increasingly complex example?
I don't like many bookes/references which contain trivial
examples (&quot;exception handling has been omitted for brevity...&quot; bah!).
But a working application suitable for a book is hard to do well.
Will it require too much context and knowledge from previous
chapters?

For example, I'm thinking of a simple (home) inventory management system
for an example to use throughout the book (other suggestions would be welcome).
An end result would be a working example that used most of the Java features
discussed in the book -- and did so in a meaningful, non-trivial way -- such as
collections, exception handling, patterns, abstractions, interfaces,
IO, generics, etc. But it could start with some of the simpler objects
when we only need to show instantiation, or basic syntax of a class
and the edit/compile/test cycle.--[[User:Djb|djb]] 01:56, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

however I find such books with a long project a lot more difficult to follow for any number of reasons [[User:Easytiger|Easytiger]] 21:31, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

In &lt;i&gt;Database Design for Mere Mortals&lt;/i&gt; by Hernandez, he implemented the learning by example approach quite well by limiting the example continuation to the &lt;b&gt;end&lt;/b&gt; of the chapter. I think such an approach here would be a good idea. That way it's up to the viewer as to whether or not they want the clarification an example provides. If they've &quot;got it&quot;, then they can skip to the next chapter. [[User:darkxxxxillusion|darkxxxxillusion]]

== Additional sub-page ==
Please rename and incorporate [[Transwiki:Packages in Java]] into this book. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 14:47, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

:We need to locate more such pages on the Wiki network and incorporate all to create this book as comprehensive as possible. Thanks for the contribution man.
:- [[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] 07:58, 14 December 2005 (UTC)


== Link to existing textbook ==
The Thinking in Java textbook is [http://mindview.net/Books/TIJ/#StillFree free] for unmodified redistribution and it would be helpful to list it as an additional text or at least the reference.

== Shiny new TOC ==

Please add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Java Programming Nav}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the bottom of any page lacking it and be sure to keep it up-to-date. --[[User:Mikm|Mikm]] 00:52, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

:''Note: see below -- use [[Template:Java Programming|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Java Programming}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] instead (at the bottom of each page). This template will also add the article to the [[:Category:Java Programming]] category. --[[User:Djb|djb]] 03:54, 27 January 2006 (UTC)''

== Properties? ==

I've seen the properties construct in other languages, but never in Java.  Unless I am mistaken, the section dealing with properties should be removed.

:''Java indeed has properties. The Java Beans object model has explicit support for properties so that you can edit the properties of a bean in a generic property sheet. [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyDescriptor.html java.beans.PropertyDescriptor] and [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/beans/Introspector.html java.beans.Introspector] are some starting points. The mention of properties in the TOC is in reference to using getter and setter methods (what I like to call &quot;jetters&quot; -:) to access and alter the state of mutable objects. Other languages may well have different meanings for the term &quot;property&quot;, but this meaning is how the Java platform (if not the language per se) uses the term. --[[User:Djb|djb]] 21:53, 18 January 2006 (UTC)''

== New Category and Template ==

I've create a new category, [[:Category:Java Programming]]
and a new template, [[Template:Java Programming|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Java Programming}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]],
which should be used at the bottom of each topic/module. The template
will add the topic to the [[:Category:Java Programming]] category and
also include the [[Template:Java Programming Nav|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Java Programming Nav}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] navigation aid. --[[User:Djb|djb]] 03:52, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

== Merging Swing, and JSP ==

I think this book should focus on giving a general view of Java programming, with some introduction to JSP and to Swing.
But I would create a separet book for JSP and Swing. They are big topics by their own and some people may be interested only in jSP, some only in Swing.
[[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 03:05, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

: Why not put it all in one big book? As near as I can tell in the Wikibooks projects, more harm than good comes of splitting topics up too much. One programming language should get one book. JSP and Swing are not just semi-related to Java, but part of it. If someone is interested in that topic, then they can come to the Java book first, and then to the section on what they want. We aren't limited by paper constraints, so as long as it's Java, the bigger (and well-written), the better. - [[User:Darkxxxxillusion|Darkxxxxillusion]]
:: I agree with [[User:Darkxxxxillusion|Darkxxxxillusion]] on that. I think we should add everything and anything about Java in this book. What we can then do is to device learning paths for users in a ''How to use this book'' section where the user would be given options how to tread throughout the chapters in this book to get the knowledge relevant to his/her search. This system is implemented in most ''Dietel &amp; Dietel'' and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Media O'Reilly Media] books. - [[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] 14:54, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
----
Agree, to merge the books try to contact the other books communities and placing the merge tag first on the talk and if no response is given in the book's main page, if you need to merge the book you may ask help from the admin. [[User:Darklama|Darklama]], he has been helping with some merges into the C++ Programming book and is active.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:01, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
: To my knowledge those two JSP and Swing books have been already merged into Java Programming. Those two books had introductory information about JSP and Swing. The question now is whether expend on those subjects here in this book, or start new books.  [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 15:04, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

Just moved a page from the old C++ book ([[Programming in C -/- -/-]]) to [[Java Programming/Design_Patterns]], it has some usefully content, similar page exist on the C++ book [[C++ Programming/Design Patterns Introduction]] fill free to get some more info 
from there (remember that wikibooks request that any lengthy use of content from other books needs a special reference as per GFDL.)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:37, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

== No fun to read ==

This book certainly is no fun to read. Except for the techno-jargon and the code-babel, this book merely serves fit for 'How to write a book on Wikibooks that readers would hate to read?'. No, seriously, this book needs serious lifting so as to attract readers to actually get glued to the text. So, has anyone good ideas of making the text more appealing to readers? - [[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] 05:30, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
: To start with one, I would suggest a simple '''Tips and tricks''' box that gives readers tips about a certain topic. And that definitions be embedded into the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cquote&lt;/nowiki&gt;|''definitions''}}&lt;/code&gt;. Makes the text more readable. &lt;font color=&quot;steelblue&quot; face=&quot;georgia&quot;&gt;;)&lt;/font&gt; See how inclusion of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{PTPBox|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''text''}}&lt;/code&gt; made [[Java Programming/Access Modifiers#Access modifiers|this page]] look more interesting to read. - [[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] 05:30, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
----

I personally don't like the PTPBox, the books are intended to be printed in the future that construct can be fun to have in a web resource but in hardcopy (paper) it's ugly and does consume some more ink :) check the [[C++ Programming]] we use the {{NOTE|NOTE box, takes more space but reduces the need for having to remove your eyes from the main text.}}.

I must say that this is may opinion as a Wikibooks user, I'm not contributing to the Java book so I don't consider myself part of this book community.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:58, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

PS: If some one has the time please think about populating the [[Computer_programming#Common_concepts]] table with the missing Java information.

== SVG'd images ==

I've started SVG-ifying a few of the UML diagrams and wanted feedback on the style before I keep going.  [[commons:User:Mikm/Gallery/Java_Wikibook|images here]] [[User:Mikm|Mikm]] 22:36, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

== Help ==

Hello! I have some considerable Java experience so I would really like to help, but I've never contributed to WikiBooks before. So:
# Tell me if there are things that I should start with, or I will just do things randomly.
# I've never written anything serious before, and because English is not my native language it is far from perfect. Can I get any help in reviewing what I write?
# Tell me if I do things wrongly or silly, as I said, I am new.

Enjoy! :) [[User:Untrots|Untrots]] 22:42, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

== How to think Like a Computer Scientist - Java Edition ==

Hi People,

would someone be interested to expand the [How to think like a Computer Scientist - Java Verion http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/] Book. Or incorporate all its Text into this Wikibook. I used it to start with Java programming and it's a really good Book (licensed under GNU FDL), but some things are a little bit outdated and some are too general (what is the purpose of that book, but which can probably be expanded here). - [[User:Horrendus|Horrendus]] 13:42, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

== Operators ==

Where are operators discussed?

== how to write Application Exception ==

How to write an Application specific Exception for a particular Application

== What a book requires to be a featured book? ==

For the past weeks I having been reading through some featured books on Wikibooks and almost all the books that I went through had to-some-extent the same characteristics. Following are what I think we should implement with this book as well.

* &lt;strike&gt;A short table of content, unlike the one we have.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I came up with an idea of a short and concise table of contents that is viewable now.
* A sub-page navigation system amongst sections in a chapter.&lt;br/&gt;Am currently working on it.
* Lots and lots of images.

If you'd like to add more FB characteristics, please feel free to express.&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks - [[User:Arunreginald|Arun Reginald]] 04:16, 22 September 2007 (UTC)

== Organize the book to sections &amp; create navigations ==

I started adding navigation links to each page to the right hand side. That box on the right hand side is for navigating the pages that belongs to a topic.  The link on the top of the box will go to the ''main'' page of that topic. I also started to add navigation boxes for each topic's ''main'' page that is on the left hand side of the topic's ''main'' page. That can be used to navigate through the main pages of each topic that belongs to a topic section.

Then topics are grouped together to a topic section. Currently there are three main sections:
* Beginners Topics section
* User Interface Topics section
* Advanced Topics section

The idea is that each section can be used as a separate mini book in the main Java Programming book.  This will help to extend the book when new features and/or technologies are invented.

I was thinking that this Java Programming book would be best used as a reference book, since lots of other good books are already exist, and there is no one book that contains information about everything. So the focus would be to add as much accurate information about Java &amp; its related technologies as possible, and also the ease of navigation is important.

== Where to put HttpClient? ==
I would like to write a page about using Apache's HttpClient library, but I'm not sure where it should go.  Could someone who is more involved with this book please help?  Thanks!  &amp;mdash; [[Wikipedia:Users:Samwilson|Sam Wilson]] (Australia) 23:35, 31 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">does anyone have some info on ancient china myths and beliefs???-larissa
:Yes. See [[Wikijunior:Ancient Civilizations/Chinese#What did they believe in?]]. As for myths, I know a few since I'm from Hong Kong. Like there are ten suns and some guy shot them down and became king found the elixir of life and her wife stole it and ate it and went to the moon where she met a good-hearted rabbit and a crazy man who kept trying to chop down a tree.

== Report after viewing this page ==
Here is my report:
=== Coverage ===
Acceptable. Needs:
*A concise history of Qin and Han Dynasties
*An introduction of the six types of characters
*How Chanjie created Chinese characters
*Zhu Geliang
*&lt;s&gt;Li Po&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Du Fu&lt;/s&gt;

I guess Li and Du weren't ancient enough. '''[[User:Kayau|&lt;span style=&quot;color:navy&quot;&gt; Kayau &lt;/span&gt;]]''' ''[[User talk:Kayau|David Copperfield]]''  [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;MOBY DICK&lt;/span&gt;]]  &lt;small&gt; [[User:Kayau/guestbook|the great gatsby]] &lt;/small&gt;  06:24, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

=== Accuracy ===
Good - except for the history part. 
*I learnt in school that it's spelt ''Hwang-He'' and not ''Hwang Ho''.
*I also learnt that the word China came from the word china because we Chinese make good china.
*However, the romanisation is terrible.
*The babarians allied with the Marquis of Shen against You of Zhou because You of Zhou neglected his subjects' pleads and divorced Queen Shen.
*They weren't separated by 'chiefs'. China was separated by its lords. They were originally dukes and marquises but many of them declared themselves 'king'.
*During the spring and autumn period, they still listened to the King of Zhou's orders.
*The eastern Zhou dynasty was complicated and messy.
*There is nothing - NOTHING! - about anything after Qin Shihuangdi's conquest.

=== Grammar and tone ===
Good in general. There are one or two spots that 8-year-olds may not be able to comprehend, though. I have corrected a few mistakes, butI'll be looking for more.

I believe that, after these improvements, this module will be able to get the top grade for all three areas.

{{info|Information in this chapter will likely be covered in more detail when and if a book about [[Perl 6]] is created}}

== Advanced PGE ==

We've already looked at some of the basics of parser constructing using PGE and NQP. In this chapter we are going to give a more in-depth look at some of the features of the grammar engine that we haven't seen yet. Some of these more advanced features, such as inline PIR code, assertions, function calls and built-in token types will make the life of a compiler designer much easier, but are not needed for most basic tasks.

{{info|PGE is an implementation of the '''Perl 6 Grammar Rules Engine''', which will eventually be used directly in the Perl6 on Parrot implementation, &quot;Rakudo&quot;. The Perl 6 grammar rules specification is rich and varied, and covering all aspects of it is beyond the scope of this book. We will cover the basics of PGE and the parts of it that are most useful for building compilers, but we cannot possibly cover all the advanced details of it.}}

== &lt;code&gt;regex&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;token&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;proto&lt;/code&gt; ==

A '''regex''' is a high-level matching operation that allows backtracking. A '''token''' is a low-level matching operation that does not allow backtracking. A '''proto''' is like a regex but allows multiple dispatch. Think of a proto declaration as being a prototype or signature that several functions can match.

== Inline PIR Sections ==

PIR can be embedded directly into both PGE grammar files and NQP files. This is important to fill in some gaps that NQP cannot handle due to its limitations. It is also helpful to insert some active processing into a grammar sometimes, to be able to direct the parser in a more intelligent way.

In NQP, PIR code can be inlined using the &lt;code&gt;PIR&lt;/code&gt; statement, followed by a quoted string of PIR code. This quoted string can be in the form of a perl-like &quot;qw&lt; ... &gt;&quot; type of quotation, if you think that looks better.

In PGE, inline PIR can be inserted using double-curly-brackets &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ ... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;. Once in PIR mode, you can access the current match object by calling &lt;code&gt;$Px = find_global &quot;$/&quot;&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;code&gt;$Px&lt;/code&gt; is any of the valid PIR registers where x is a number).

== Built-In Token Types ==

PGE has basic default values of certain rules already defined to help with parsing. However, you can redefine these to be something else, if you don't like the default behavior.

== Calling Functions ==

'''functions''' or '''subroutines''' are an integral part of modern programming practices. As such, support for them is part of the PAST system, and is relatively easy to implement. We're going to cover a little bit of necessary background information first, and then we will discuss how to put all the pieces together to create a system with usable subroutines.

=== &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; Described ===

In Parrot control flow, especially return operations from subroutines, are implemented as special control exceptions. The reason why it is done as an exception and not as a basic &lt;code&gt;.return()&lt;/code&gt; PIR statement is a little bit complicated. Many languages allow for nested lexical scopes, where variables defined in an &quot;inner&quot; scope cannot be seen, accessed, or modified by statements in the &quot;outer&quot; scope. In most compilers, this behavior is enforced by the compiler directly, and is invisible when the code is converted to assembly and machine languages. However PIR is like an assembly language for the Parrot system, and it's not possible to hide things at that level. All local variables are local to the entire subroutine and cannot be localized to a single part of a subroutine. To implement nested scopes, Parrot instead uses nested subroutine

=== Returns and Return Values ===

Functions can be made to return a value use the &quot;return&quot; PAST.op type. The return system is based on a control exception. Exceptions, as we've discussed before, move control flow to a specified location called the &quot;exception handler&quot;. In terms of a return exception, the handler is the code directly after the original function call. The return values (currently, the return PAST node only allows a single return value) are passed as exception data items and are retrieved by the control exception handler.

All of these details are generally hidden from the programmer, and you can treat a return PAST node exactly like you would expect. You pass a return value, if any, to the return PAST node. The current function ends and its scope is destroyed. Control flow returns to the calling function, and the return value from the function is made available.

== Assertions ==

=== Repetition Counting with ** ===

=== MetaSyntactic Assertions ===

You can call a function from within a rule using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;FUNC( )&gt;&lt;/code&gt; format.

=== Non-Capturing Assertions ===

Use &lt;code&gt;&lt;. &gt;&lt;/code&gt; form to create a match object that does not capture its contents.

=== Indirect Rules ===

A rule of the form &lt;code&gt;&lt;$ &gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which can be a string or some other data, is converted into a regular expression and then run.

=== Character Classes ===

Rules of the form &lt;code&gt;&lt;[ ]&gt;&lt;/code&gt; contain custom character classes. Rules with &lt;code&gt;&lt;-[ ]&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are complimented character classes.

=== Built-in Assertions ===

*&lt;code&gt;&lt;?before&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;!before&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;?after&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;!after&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;?same&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;!same&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;.ws&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;?at()&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;!at()&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Partial Matches ===

You can specify a partial match, a match which attempts to match as much as possible and never fails, with the &lt;code&gt;&lt;* &gt;&lt;/code&gt; form.

=== Recursive Calls ===

You can recurse back into subrules of the current match rule using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;~~ &gt;&lt;/code&gt; rule.

An image of the eye can be see to the below right:

===Focussing===

Light must be focussed onto the retina, the most sensitive section of this, and the only place where we can perceive colour, is the fovea. Light rays are travelling parallel until they reach the cornea, where they are refracted inwards as they pass through the eye. The cornea does most of the focussing, and the lens does fine adjustments to the refraction, so that rays from different distances can be brought to focus on the retina. The closer an object is, the more accommodation is required as the lens thickens and becomes more convex. This accommodation - the shape changing - is achieved by varying the tension of the suspensory ligaments which hold the lens in position.

This varying tension is occurs in a rather strange way - there is always pressure and tension inside the eye, and to stretch the lens - make it less spherical - the ciliary muscle relaxes, and thus the pressure pushes the sclera out wide, increasing tension on the sunspensory ligaments, flattening the lens. When the ciliary muscles are contracted, the diameter of the circle decreases and loosens the tension on suspensory ligaments, allowing the lens to become more spherical.

==Retina==

The retina is sensitive to light and energy that comes in the form of light rays is converted to nerve impulses that are carried in the optic nerve.

===Structure===

*Contains rods/cones - photoreceptor cells
*These cells are precisely arranged into a single layer
*Pigmented epithelium in contact with this single layer
*Also contains special neurones known as bi-polar and ganglion cells which convey information to the optic nerve
*Light passes through these cell layers before it reaches the rods and cones, except in fovea
*The blind spot - where the optic nerve leaves the brain, no photoreceptor cells.

====Rods/Cones====

Rods and cones have similar structures. The part of the cell facing the outside of the eye is the outer segment and the inner facing side is the inner segment. The end of the inner segment forms synapses with other cells in the retina. The outer segment contains many stages of membranes, formed from invaginations of the plasma membrane. In a rod cell the invaginations pinch off leaving a stage of unconnected discs, but in a cone cell they stay attached. These discs provide a large surface area of membrane that contains visual pigments, for reactions with light.

In a rod cell the pigment molecule consists of a protein known as opsin plus a compound known as retinal, and the molecule is known as rhodopsin. Pigments in a cone cell are similar except there are 3 different types of opsin, one for each of the primary colours of light. Rod cells are much more sensitive to light for reasons that will be explained later on.

Rods/Cones: [http://www.colour4free.org.uk/Images/RodAndConeFull.png]

====Bi-Polar/Ganglion Cells====

Bipolar cells
*Central body from which two sets of processes arise;
*Those nearest to the rod/cone layer are short and branch into many endings which form synapses with a single cone or a number of rods.
*The other process is longer and forms synapses with a ganglion cell.
*Their role is to transfer information from rods/cones to ganglion cells.


Ganglion cells
*Inner layer of retina
*Numerous dendrites from synapses with bipolar cells
*Location of action potential generation
*Axons of ganglion cells make up the optic nerve


The neurotransmitter released by resting rod/cone cells reaches a bi-polar cell which can either increase or decrease the amount of neurotransmitter substance that it releases. Some ganglion cells fire more slowly, some more quickly in response to this change in the neurotransmitter substance it receives.

===Response to Light===
====Rod Cells====

A rod cell without light maintains a difference in electrical potential across its plasma membrane, but this is usually around -40mV (compared to the -60mV of a normal neurone) due to channels for both sodium and potassium to flow freely in and out. When light hits a rod cell, the retinal part of rhodopsin changes shape, from a carbon-tail-kinked 11-cis-retinal to an all-trans-retinal, which results in retinal no longer being able to bind with opsin. The rhodopsin molecule changes into an unstable form, causing those sodium/potassium channels to close and a greater potential difference -70mV builds up. The rod cell is now said to be hyperpolarised.

====Cone Cells====

Cone cells respond in a similar way, but cone cells require much more light before the cells hyperpolarize, and this is why rods are more sensitive to light (among other reasons). The three pigments are for red blue and green, and the brain judges colour by the intensity of signals from each type of cone.

====Neurotransmitter====

Rod/Cone cells are constantly releasing neurotransmitter - until light falls on them, when they stop

===Visual Acuity===

The reason we have lower visual acuity with rod cells is because several of them interface with one bipolar cell whereas cone cells interface with only one ganglion cell. This aids the detection of dim light as the small responses are pooled to produce a larger response.

==Ageing==

With ageing comes two main problems - loss of visual acuity and cataracts. The loss of visual acuity is due to the loss of elasticity in their lenses, and so the lens cannot return to its correct shape after near focussing.
Cataracts are the result of proteins denaturing and coagulating, resulting in that part of the lens becoming cloudy white and impairing vision. It can be fixed with glasses or surgery.

=Ear=

The ear is responsible for hearing and balance.

===Structure===

The ear can be divided into three parts, outer, middle and inner ear. 

Outer ear:

*Pinna - Collects sound waves and directs them towards tympanic membrane (ear drum).
*Auditory canal - Sound travels along here
*Tympanic membrane - Sound turns to vibrations here

Middle ear

*Auditory ossicles - malleus (hammer), incus (anivil) and stapes (stirrup) - transmit vibrations from tympanic membrane to oval window membrane.
*Eustaschian tube - air filled passage that maintains air pressure on both sides

Inner ear

*Contains fluid
*Embedded within the bones of the skull
*Cochlea - contains receptor cells that convert energy in sound waves into a nerve impulse
*Organ of Corti - the receptor cells inside the cochlear that runs along the basilar membrane throughout the length of the coiled cochlea. When the oval window vibrates, the vibrations are transmitted through the fluid in the cochlea and cause these receptor cells to vibrate.
*The receptor cells also have stereocilia on their upper surface which are embedded in another membrane, and are in close contact with the neurones that form the cochlear nerve.
*Three semi-circular canals, with two chambers called utriculus and sacculus. All full of fluid and contain hair cells. This is the area responsible for balance, and impulses pass from it to the vestibular nerve, which joins with the cochlear nerve, forming the auditory nerve.

===Hearing===

The above section described how vibrations in the air are transmitted to the hair cells which then vibrate. These hair cells were previously maintaining a resting potential across their plasma membranes, same as neurones, and when they vibrate they are depolarised, causing them to release neurotransmitter. This in turn depolarises the endings of nerve cells in the cochlear nerve. This creates action potentials which are then carried into the brain.

====Loudness====

The brain determines the loudness of a sound by the amplitude vibration which is converted into an increased rate of action potentials. Also, some cells only fire if there is an extremely loud sound.

====Frequency====

The frequency (pitch) of a sound is detected by the brain knowing which neurones are conducting nerve impulses into it. The hair cells in the basilar membrane closest to the oval window are receptive to high frequency sounds whilst the furthest away are for low-frequency sounds.

====Direction====

The direction a sound is coming from is determined by the loudness and the timing of the sound arriving in each ear.

===Balance===

Our sense of balance is provided by the receptor cells in the semicircular canals, the utriculus and the sacculus. The receptor cells synapse with the sensory endings of the vestibular nerve. In both semicircular canals, there is a patch of cells called a macula, and this is covered with a gelatinous layer containing crystals of calcium carbonate called otoliths. Each macula also contains numerous hair cells which have stiff stereocilia projecting from their upper surfaces, and the ends of the cilia are embedded in the gelatin layer, forming synapses with the neurones of the vestibular nerve.

The crystals of calcium carbonate, the otoliths, are heavy and are pulled downards by gravity, and they pull the hairs of the hair cells with them, depolarising the ones they pull with them, changing the pattern of action potentials transmitted along the vestibular nerve. The macula in the two semicircular canals are arranged differently providing a 3D image to the brain of how the head is positioned. The hair cells in the utriculus are in the horizontal plane, sensing the orientation of the head when you are upright, whereas those in the sacculus are in the vertical plane, sensing the orientation of the head when you are lying down.

The semicircular canals are filled with viscous fluid and have a swelling at the end called an ampulla. In each ampulla there is a gellatinous structure called a cupula with stereocilia from hair cells embedded in it. When the head moves the fluid stays where it is (inertia) and so collects in the ampulla. This bends the cupula to one side, pulling the cilia and causing depolarisation of the hair cells. The three ampullae are orientated differently so at least two will detect a movement, regardless of direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Behaviour=

Behaviour is everything an animal does, and is influenced by both nature (genes) and nurture (envrionment).

==Innate==

Innate (instinctive) behaviour is defined as inherited, pre-set behaviour that doesn't require learning or practice.

===Genes===

You'll remember the concept of alleles being selected for in a population as part of natural selection - the same is true for alleles for evolutionary-advantageous behaviour, and so the behaviour becomes more common. However, a lot of behaviour we used to consider completely innate we are now not so sure about - an animal's genes produce the basic structure of its body, and the behaviour it shows is an interaction between these features and the environment that the animal has developed in.

===Reflexes===  

Reflexes are rapid, automatic responses to stumulus, such as pulling your hand away when you touch something hot - the signals are not passed to the brain before we act, as to speed up our reaction. Removing your hand from something hot, or ducking when you see something flying toward you are examples of innate reflexes. We can also develop condition reflexes, as shown by Pavlov's dogs for example.

===Experience===

Innate behaviour can be influenced by experience, for example in birds that feed their young by fetching food for them and putting it in their beaks. To begin with the chicks just open and close their beaks but after a few days they learn how to twist their heads in order to grab the parent's beak to get at the food quicker - the basis is innate, but the refinement is learning.

=The Nature of Learning=

Learning is a change in behaviour as the result of experience, and you are required to know three case studies on learning performed in the last century.

===Skinner===

B.F. Skinner became well known for studying operant conditioning with the use of his 'Skinner box', which isn't as dangerous as it sounds. It is a cage in which an animal is placed, and inside the cage there is a lever that can be depressed that will produce a reward. At first, the animal wanders around looking for a way out, but by accident hits the lever and food appears. After a few times of doing this, the animal begins to purposefully press the lever, and this shows that the animal has learned to associate the behaviour with the reward.

===Pavlov===

Ivan Pavlov worked on classical conditioning, with dogs as the subject of his experiments. Pavlov measured the salivation of dogs when meat powder was puffed into their mouths, and then began to introduce some other stimulus right before the food - a bell. The bell was rung, and the food was given, and after several occurrences of this the dog began to salivate upoun just hearing the bell - classical conditioning. 

Initially the dog had a reflex, producing saliva in response to food, an unconditioned stimulus, but the sound of the bell that was associated with the food is known as the conditioned stimulus. The response, combined with the stimulus is known as a conditioned reflex.

====Advantages====

The adapative value of conditioning can be valuable indeed - the animal learns to change it's behaviour based on a reinforcer, a reward or a negative event that tells it to do or not to do the action. This can be seen for example with animals who might try and eat a wasp, and be stung. The yellow and black colours of a wasp will in the future cause the animal to back off since it has learned that it will be hurt if it does try to eat the wasp.

===Kohler===

Kohler worked on more complex types of learning than simple association, known as insight learning. He studied primates, chimpanzees. A chimp with a stick inside it's cage and a banana outside of the cage quickly learned to use the stick to reach the banana to eat it - a reward. Once this had been learnt, the chimp was given two sticks that fit together end to end, and the banana was placed such that it would require both sticks to reach it. The chimp attempted to reach it with just the one but could not, and quickly gave up. 

The chimp then began to play with the sticks, and during this realised that he could fit the two sticks together, and immediately rushed back to the banana and retrieved it with the extended stick. This is known as insight learning - applying one situation to another, since the chimp was not doing something directly related to food but connected it to food.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Organisation=

The nervous system of mammals has two major cells - neurones and glial cells. The neurones transmit action potentials whilst the glial cells help nutrients from the blood into the neurones and maintaing the correct balance of ions in the tissue fluid surrounding them. Schwann cells are glial cells.  The nervous system has two major components - central and peripheral.

===Central===

The central nervous system comprises the brain and spinal cord - it has mostly intermediate neurone (short dendrited) and many synpases, with further neighbouring neurones. These neurones receive and integrate information arriving via the synapses and then pass off the information via an action potential to other neurones.

The spinal cord extends from the base of the brain, down to the first lumbar vertebra. It comprises a canal in the centre containing cerebrospinal fluid, and at the centre of the cord there is unmyelinated neurones which appear grey, and the rest appears white. The brain is simply an extension of the spinal cord.

===Peripheral===

Peripheral nervous system includes all the neurones that are outside of the brain and spinal cord - sensory and motor neurones. Sensory neurones are situated just outside the spinal cord, in the dorsal root and pickup information at receptors and transmit action potential from the receptor toward their cell bodies. The action potential then goes to the central nervous system. Motor neurones carry action potentials from the central nervous system to effectors, and the cell bodies of them are usually in the spinal cord - their long axons pass from the spinal cord to the effectors. 

Cell bodies of sensory neurones are situated in the dorsal root ganglia just outside the spinal cord. A ganglion is a group of nerve cell bodies.

The cell bodies of motor neurones are in the spinal cord  and their axons pass out of the spinal cord and towards effectors.

Axons and dendrons are arranged in bundles known as nerves. They leave and enter the spinal cord in spinal nerves, each with a dorsal root, which carrys impulses towards the spinal cord and a ventral root, which carries the impulses towards efffectors.

The peripheral nervous system has two further subsections - the somatic and the autonomic nervous system - the somatic is all sensory neurones, and motor neurones that take information to skeletal muscles, for example a typical reflex arc involvement is only somatic. The autonomic will be discussed in the next section.

=Autonomic=

The autonomic nervous system is all the motor neurones that supply the internal organs - autonomic means self adjusting and this is because we do not usually voluntarily control it. It controls the activity of all smooth muscle in the body e.g. walls of arterioles and alimentary canal, the rate of beating in the cardiac muscle in the heart and activities of exocrine glands e.g. salivary glands. It is further divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic.

===Sympathetic===

The sympathetic nervous system can be summarised as the fight or flight system. The motor neurone cell bodies lie in the ganglia outside the spinal cord - their axons pass out through the ventral roo, synapsing with the motor neurone cell bodies in these ganglia, where they pass to all organs within the body. Synapses to the heart muscle, smooth muscles are formed, and the transmitter across most of these substances is noradrenaline, stimulating them. 

Its effects are;

*Heart - increases rate and force of contraction.
*Digestive system - contracts sphincter, releases glucose into blood.
*Eye - dilates, relaxs ciliary muscles for distant vision.
*Skin - increases sweating, vasoconstriction.

===Parasympathetic===

The parasympathetic nervous system's nerve pathways all begin in the brain, and the neurone which carries the impulse of the brain keeps going until it is inside the organ that it will stimulate the effector neurone of. The parasympathetic nervous system usually utilises acetylcholine, which often as an inhibitory effect on organs.

Its effects are;

*Heart - reduces rate and force.
*Digestive system - stimulates gland secretion, relaxes sphincter muscles, glycogen production increased.
*Eye - constricts, ciliary muscles contract for near vision.
*Skin - slight increase in palm sweat.

=Brain=
[[Image:Brainlobes.png|right|framed|The lobes of the brain. *Red: Frontal lobe
*Orange: Parietal lobe
*Yellow: Occpital lobe
*Green: Temporal lobe
*Blue: Cerebellum
*Black: Medoullea oblongata + brain stem]]

The brain is studied in a variety of ways - CAT, PET, MRI scans, and studying people who have brain damage. For example, Pierre Broca studied people who could not speak or write intelligibly, dissecting their brains and he found a small area near the front of the left side that was damaged - now know as the Broca's area, the section of the brain responsible for the production of language.

===Structure===

The brain is an extended spinal cord, and his highly specialised. It contains ventricles filled with cerebro -spinal fluid and is made up of neurones. The largest section of the brain is the ''cerebrum'', divided into right and left ''hemispheres'', connected by the ''corpus callosum''. The surface of each hemisphere is covered by a highly folded layer of tissue known as the ''cerebral cortex''. The parts of ceberal cortex have been given different names (see picture to the right). Within the cereberum, there are several areas with their own names, such as the ''hippocampus'' and the ''amygdala''. 

Inside the brain itself is the ''diencephalon'', containing the ''thalmus'' and the ''hypothalmus'' (closely associated with the ''pituitary gland''). Behind the thalamus is the midbrain, and above this is the ''cerebellum'', like the cerebrum has a folded surface and is divided into several lobes. Below the cerebellum is the ''medulla oblongata'' which merges into the ''spinal cord''.

This diagram is highly recommended: [http://www.brainhealthandpuzzles.com/images/labeled_diagram_human_brain_sagittal.jpg]

==Function==
===Cerebrum Function===

The cerebrum is responsible for all higher-level processes, thinking, language and emotions for example. It is much larger in humans than other animals. The cerebral cortex of both hemispheres receives sensory impulses from many different sources. The part of the cerebral cortex that first receive this information are known as primary sensory areas. Association areas integrate the information for the primnary sensory areas, or receive information from them.

===Cerebellum Function===

The cerebellum is the control center for movement and posture, and receives inputs from all other parts of the central nervous system to do this, and some directly from sensory neurones. Impulses are then sent to other parts of the brain, such as the motor centre.

===Medulla Oblongata Function===
The medulla oblongata is a small section at the base of the brain. It controls breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. The medulla oblongata's groups of neurone produce rhythmic patterns of impulses which pass to the muscles of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, and this pattern can be changed by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the blood, and the breathing rate will be increased. 

A different section controls heart rate and blood pressure by receiving information from baroreceptors (pressure) - connected to the autonomic nervous system going to the SAN in the heart and can increase or decrease the heart beat. High CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations, or low blood pressure increases the rate and the reverse has the reverse effect.

===Hypothalmus Function===

The hypothalamus receives information in the form of nerve impulses from many parts of the brain. This information is about the body, and the hypothalamus integrates it and the brings about responses either through the autonomic nervous systems or pituitary gland secretions. An example of this is in homeostasis - the hypothalamus receives information about skin temperature from sensory neurones, and receptors inside the hypothalamus itself, which measures blood temperature. It can then send impulses which bring about appropriate responses.

The hypothalamus helps to control the secretion of hormones from endocrine glands, and is directly connected to the pituitary gland.

====Pituitary gland====

The posterior pituitary gland are controlled by neurones running straight from the hypothalamus, the role of which is to secrete the hormones (very unusual for a neurone). These hormones are carried to their endings and released similar to a neurotransmitter. ADH and oxtocin are produced in this way.

The anterior pituitary gland uses neurones in the hypothalamus to produce several hromones and secrete these into the surrounding blood vessels. The hormones are then carried through those blood vessels into the anterior pituitary gland where they affect the production (stimulation: releasing hormones, inhibition: inhibiting hormones) and release a variety of other hormones.

==Alzheimer's==

Alzheimer's disease is a form of dementia, a general loss and reduction in mental abilities.

===Symptoms===

Physiological symptoms in the brain include neurones which had bundles of fibres in them, called tangles, and dark-staining deposits between the neurones known as plaques, but these are only visible post-mortem. CAT or MRI scans show a reduction in brain size.

However, generic symptoms are increasing loss of memory, anxiety, hallucinations, personality changes. 

===Causes===

The tangles in the neurones are made of a protein known as tau, and that the plaques contain a peptide known as beta amyloid. This peptide is made from a large protein molecule called beta amyloid precursor protein (APP), an enzyme of which the function is not known. The plaques form because far too much beta amyloid is secreted, and this abnormal metabolism could be the cause of Alzheimers. Inherited Alzheimers often shows different allele of the gene that codes for APP. However, genetics cannot explain it purely, but there is another gene that codes for a protein that is suspect. Over half of all people with ALzheimers have a particular allele of the gene that codes for APOe, and evidence shows that this may increase the rate at which beta amyloid is deposited into plaques.


Ageing is also a risk factor, as is severe blows to the head especially for the elderly.

===Treatment===

There is as of yet no cure for alzheimers, or effective treatment.

Tandem mass spectrometry, also known as MS/MS, involves multiple steps of mass spectrometry selection, with some form of fragmentation occurring in between the stages. Fragmentation of gas-phase ions is very important in MS/MS, and it takes place between various stages of mass analysis. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_mass_spectrometry) Different fragmentation methods are: In-source fragmentation and Post-source fragmentation. Tandem mass spectrometry is used to identify chemicals, that are very hard or impossible to identify by any other methods due to their low concentrations, polarity, or lack of chromophore. It is a powerful tool in identification of inherited metabolic disorders, when an accurate and timely diagnostics of which can be essential to the wellbeing of the patient. 



    ''Article 1:''

== Clinical applications of tandem mass spectrometry: ten years of diagnosis and screening for inherited metabolic diseases. ==

(By: Mohamed S. Rashed)

''URL:'' 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TG9-433PCKJ-3&amp;_user=47004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000005018&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=47004&amp;md5=9382088a05662f18a95f6bfb87888334



&lt;u&gt;'''''General Overview:'''''&lt;/u&gt; 

The main focus of this article is to provide a detailed explanation of the two main Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS-MS) screening methods, such as MS–MS-based newborn screening, and MS–MS-based selective. The review contains information about the evolution and development of MS-MS from fast atom bombardment MS-MS to electrospray ionization MS-MS. The author shows the unique advantages of MS-MS for use in genetic laboratories and at the newborn screening programs around the world. Also the review points out benefits of the tandem mass spectrometry over the other analytical methods available. 



&lt;u&gt;'''''New Terms:'''''&lt;/u&gt;

'''Beta-ketothiolase deficiency''' – a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disorder in which the body cannot properly process the amino acid isoleucine or the products of lipid breakdown. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-ketothiolase_deficiency

'''Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)''' – also called branched-chain ketoaciduria, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting branched-chain amino acids. It is one type of organic acidemia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_syrup_urine_disease

'''Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)''' – is a syndrome marked by the symptoms of sudden and unexplained death of an apparently healthy infant aged one month to one year. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome

'''Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency''' – is an autosomal recessive fatty acid oxidation disorder that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during periods without food . People with this disorder have inadequate levels of an enzyme that breaks down a certain group of fats called long-chain fatty acids. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_trifunctional_protein_deficiency

'''Propionic academia''' – also known as propionic aciduria, or sometimes referred to as ketotic glycinemia, is an autosomal recessive amino acid disorder, classified as a branched-chain organic acidemia, which presents in the early neonatal period with progressive encephalopathy. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propionic_acidemia



&lt;u&gt;'''''Metabolomics Relevance:'''''&lt;/u&gt; 

The article points out new methods for identification of metabolic disorders, which are caused by mitochondrial enzyme defects, and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation defects, in which acetyl-CoA accumulates in mitochondria. L-carnitine helps remove acetyl-CoA through formation of acylcarnitine esters, restoring mitochondrial homeostasis. Acylcarnitine can be considered a unique chemical fingerprint, which metabolomics is a study of. 
    


    ''Article 2:''

== Screening blood spots for inborn errors of metabolism by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry with a microplate batch process and a computer algorithm for automated flagging of abnormal profiles. ==
(by: Mohamed S. Rashed et al.)

''URL:'' 
http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/abstract/43/7/1129



&lt;u&gt;'''''General Overview:'''''&lt;/u&gt; 

This article focuses on ESI-MS/MS (electrospray tandem mass spectrometry) and how it is paving the way for new opportunities. The introduction of ESI-MS/MS as a diagnostic tool in our metabolic unit has had a great impact on the number of cases diagnosed as organic acidemias or aminoacidopathies from sick children. It focuses on the research that is being done in order to find biomarkers in metabolomics in order to better understand the human body.



&lt;u&gt;'''''New Terms:'''''&lt;/u&gt;

'''Neonatal screening''' - Newborn screening is the process of testing newborn babies for treatable genetic, endocrinologic, metabolic and hematologic diseases.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_screening

'''Hypermethioninemia''' - an excess of the amino acid methionine, in the blood. This condition can occur when methionine is not broken down properly in the body.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermethioninemia

'''Homocystinuria''' - also known as Cystathionine beta synthase deficiency, is an inherited disorder of the metabolism of the amino acid methionine, often involving cystathionine beta synthase. It is an inherited autosomal recessive trait, which means a child needs to inherit the defective gene from both parents to be affected.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocystinuria

'''Galactosemia''' - is a rare genetic metabolic disorder which affects an individual's ability to properly metabolize the sugar galactose.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactosemia

'''Acylcarnitines''' - are fatty acids or organic acids that are bound to carnitine.
http://www.idph.state.il.us/HealthWellness/msmsfaq.htm



&lt;u&gt;'''''Metabolomics Relevance:'''''&lt;/u&gt; 

MS/MS detects abnormal levels of amino acids and acylcarnitines. Abnormal elevations of these amino acids may indicate the newborn is at risk for disorders of amino acid metabolism. This is relevant to what we have learned so far in the course in that we have talked about free carnitine as a chemical that acts as a transporter of fatty acids into and out of the mitochondria, and is necessary for normal energy metabolism. Acylcarnitines are fatty acids or organic acids that are bound to carnitine. These acylcarnitines vary in size, based on the number of carbon atoms and the type of chemical bonds within the molecule. Abnormal levels of these acylcarnitines can act as markers for certain organic acid and fatty acid oxidation metabolic disorders.

      <comment>/* Creating subject pages */ fixed link</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Useful}}

The subject pages are an organization and navigational tool here at Wikibooks. We use these pages to group our books together by subject, group sub-topics together into larger topics, and provide an easy hierarchical way to find books from our large collection. Subject pages are the replacement for the older Department/Bookshelf system that was not nearly as expandable or versatile.

== Creating subject pages ==

There is no single way that Subject pages must look. In fact, it's probably better if subject pages for different topics are unique and specifically tailored for the reading audience. However, some pages in the Subject: namespace were created using templates, and that's okay too. Ideally, all those template-created subject pages will be improved to look better over time. 

In general, there are a few things that a subject page might want to have:
#A list of books in that subject. You can use {{tlx|CategoryList|CATEGORY NAME}} to produce this automatically
#A list of topic books in other categories, such as [[:Category:Books with print version]], [[:Category:Books with PDF version]], and [[:Category:Featured books]]. You can find books that are simultaneously in two categories at once using the {{tlx|CategoryJunction|CAT 1|CAT 2}} template.
#A list of books in similar topics, but not in this topic. Use {{tlx|CategoryIntersection|CAT 1|CAT 2}} to create these lists
#Links to information on the topic on other Wikimedia projects, such as Wikipedia, Wikiversity, and Wiktionary. Use {{tl|Sisterlinks}} or {{tl|Associated Wikimedia}} for this.
#A link to a parent category. It's important that all subject pages have a parent. This makes them easier to find. To put a subject page into the category of a parent, use the {{tl|subjects}} template.

Feel free to get creative with these lists. The more relevant information that you can present to readers, the better.

== Subject casing ==

Books and their categories are title cased. Partly to reduce conflicts where possible, Subject pages and their corresponding categories are sentence cased.

== History ==

Subject pages were implemented in [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2007/September#Subject:_Namespace.2C_implemented|August 2007]] and the decision to phase out bookshelves in [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2007/November#Phase_out_Bookshelves|November 2007]].</text>

==Introduction==
[[Image:PBB_Protein_ADIPOQ_image.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Adiponectin, C1Q and collagen domain containing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Adiponectin.png#file ]]
Adiponectin (Acrp30) is a protein hormone that is secreted adipoctyes, also known as fat cells.  The adipocytes are the only producers and secretors of this hormone.  Two receptors for adiponectin are known to date, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2; which are expressed on the liver and skeletal muscle.  The protein is produced as a monomer and it can then assemble into higher order complexes (trimers, hexamers, oligomers), the full length protein can also be cleaved to produce the globular head.  The different forms of the hormone show different signaling affects.  This hormone affects a range of metabolic processes such as glucose flux, lipid catabolism and response to insulin.  Specifically, the release of adiponectin causes an increased tolerance to glucose as well as an increased sensitivity to insulin in peripheral tissues of the body.  Low levels of adiponectin have been linked to increased risk of heart attack, obesity, and type 2 diabetes; while high levels of this hormone show decreased weight gain and risk of heart attack.{{subject|Metabolomics/Hormones/Adiponectin}}

==Adiponectin and Mitochondrial Function==

Mitochondrial function is crucial for adiponectin production in adipocytes. Rosiglitazone and mitochondrial biogenesis enhancement (Ad-NRF-1) treatments have been discovered to increase adiponectin synthesis. Chemicals that are detrimental to mitochondrial function and mitochondrial biogenesis reduction (mtTFA-specific siRNA) treatments lead to attenuated adiponectin synthesis. The impairment of mitochondrial function has also proven to place stress on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which results in overall decreased adiponectin transcription.

It is an established fact that adiponectin synthesis is elevated in small fat cells, as a result of enhanced mitochondrial function. By contrast, hypertrophied fat cells experience decreased adiponectin synthesis, as a result of impaired mitochondrial function. Obese individuals are proven to have a high number of hypertrophied fat cells, which provides an explanation for reduced levels of adiponectin. Researchers have assumed that adiponectin synthesis is regulated by the cellular energy-production system of mitochondria, because adipocytes are known to produce large quantities of adiponectin, when compared to other proteins.

Calcium-handling and protein-folding processes in the ER require large amounts of ATP, glucose deprivation and hypoxia – all of which are stimuli that elicit ER stress. Impaired mitochondrial function has also proven to place stress upon the ER. This stress was reversed in the event of enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. By comparison, impaired mitochondrial function was discovered to activate c-Jun NH2-terminating kinase (JNK) and the activating transcription factor (ATF3), both of which are proven to be activated in the event of ER stress. JNK and ATF3 inhibition reverses mitochondrial function and reduces adiponectin transcription. This further demonstrates that reduced adiponectin transcription is a result of mitochondrial dysfunction.

Adiponectin expression is also impaired by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased CHOP10 expression. These factors inhibit adiponectin gene expression via CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-binding region interference of the adiponectin gene promoter.

A number of hormones and transcription factors that are involved in adiponectin synthesis have been identified in previous studies. These include TNF-  and interleukin-6, which are both known to reduce adiponectin synthesis. These adipocytokines are also believed to contribute to the reduced adiponectin levels in obesity. Researchers have also proven that TNF-  reduces mitochondrial biogenesis, while increasing the potential for mitochondrial injury. The impact of rosiglitazone on adiponectin synthesis is believed to involve mechanisms that are independent of mitochondrial function. Specifically, PPAR /retinoid X receptors bind directly to functional PPAR-responsive elements in human adiponectin promoters, which increases the promoter activity.

It has been established that adiponectin levels increase mitochondrial number and function in skeletal muscle via 5-AMP-activated protein kinase activation. This activation has also been proven to stimulate skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis. This presents the potential for mitochondrial or metabolic activity in adipocytes to regulate mitochondrial, metabolic, or insulin activity in skeletal muscle by way of adiponectin.

Researchers have surmised that mitochondrial function is directly linked to adiponectin synthesis in adipocytes. The impaired mitochondrial function in adipose tissue is also believed to contribute to decreased plasma adiponectin levels, during obesity. Adiponectin synthesis has been proven to be onset by the activation of mechanisms involving ER stress, JNK, and ATF3 that result from impaired mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress have been identified as determinants of insulin resistance, in tissue samples from obese subjects.

1) '''&lt;big&gt;Mechanisms regulating energy metabolism by adiponectin in obesity and diabetes&lt;/big&gt;'''
http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/bst/034/0798/0340798.pdf

This, fairly short, journal article, gives a broad overview of the interaction of the hormone adiponectin on metabolism by looking at its structure, function, and regulation. Adiponectin is a protein hormone that is secreted from fat cells. The authors show that adiponectin’s structure relates to function, adiponectin can exist in multiple forms (monomers, trimers, hexamers, oligomers, and as the globular C-terminal domain) and that each form produces a different affect on different tissues. The article also explains that adiponectin acts by binding to two receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) and that the expression of the receptors can be changed to regulate the action of adiponectin; also liver and skeletal muscle show different profiles of expression for AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. The authors point out the downstream molecules that adiponectin signaling affects, some of them include: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), p38, and cAMP. The author demonstrated the insulin sensitizing effects of adiponectin by injecting mice with it and by creating knockout mice. Injection of adiponectin increased blood glucose uptake in normal mice and prevented insulin-resistance in obese mice. Expression of globular adiponectin in transgenic ob/ob mice showed decreased insulin resistance and diabetes compared with transgenic ob/ob mice not expressing globular adiponectin. From their research the authors concluded that regulation of adiponectin is complicated; that it plays a role in obesity and diabetes type 2 by affects on glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. 

'''New Terms:'''

Adipokines – a group of cytokines secreted by adipose tissue

Hyperinsulinaemia – excessively high levels of insulin in blood

Metabolic syndrome – a combination of disorders that increase risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes

Pathophysiology – functional changes due to disease

Ameliorating – to make better or improve



2)  '''&lt;big&gt;Adiponectin: A Fat Cell Hormone That Promotes Insulin Sensitivity &lt;/big&gt;'''

http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/438373&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8)

This web resource summarizes speeches and articles about the function of adiponectin. It states that adiponectin increases insulin sensitivity, decreases gluconeogenesis, and activates AMP-activated protein kinase and protein kinase B. It says that research suggests that adiponectin regulation may relate to the distrobution, as opposed to amount, of body fat (shown in rats). The article says that regulation of adiponectin secretion is affected by glucocorticoids, proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) agonists, testosterone, estrogen, and prolactin. The article also explores research looking at defects in adiponectin and insulin resistance; adiponectin gene polymorphisms are shown to be linked to type 2 diabetes. It then goes on to say that further research is being done on adiponectin for potential therapeutic use.

'''New Terms:'''

Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp – a test to quantify insulin resistance

Thiazolidinediones – a type of drug used to treat type 2 diabetes

Metformin – a type of drug used to treat type 2 diabetes

Glucocorticoids – a group of hormones produced by the adrenal cortex and involved in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism

Adiposity – synonym for obesity


3)  '''&lt;big&gt;Adiponectin Receptor-1 &amp;-2 (AdipoR1 &amp; AdipoR2) two recently identified receptors   &lt;/big&gt;'''

http://www.phoenixbiotech.net/Catalog%20Files/Adiponectin/adiponectin-receptor.htm

This web resource gives an overview of the adiponectin receptors one and two, also known as AdipoR1 and AdipoR2.  The article focuses on how the two receptors were discovered and provides summaries for three experiments that were based around adiponectin receptors.  This article goes into depth on the different analyses for the receptors including western blot analysis and immuno-staining.  Five new words I encountered while reading this resource include: Immunohistochemistry, atherosclerotic lesions, leptin, LXR ligands, and lipolysis.  Immunohistochemistry is the microscopic localization of specific antigens in tissues by staining with antibodies labeled with fluorescent or pigmented material.  Atherosclerotic lesions are characterized by foam cells derived from cholesterol-loaded macrophages.  Leptin is a peptide hormone neurotransmitter produced by fat cells and involved in the regulation of appetite.  LXR ligands are metabolites of cholesterol, such as 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol, and are known to activate both LXR and LXRβ.  Lipolysis is the hydrolysis of fats into fatty acids and glycerol, by lipase.  Adiponectin effects gluconeogenesis and glucose uptake via increased tolerance to glucose and increased sensitivity to insulin in peripheral tissues.  The receptors for Adiponectin allow it to help regulate these pathways through concentration levels of these receptors and the adiponectin itself.

'''New Terms:'''

Immunohistochemistry - A type of assay in which specific antigens are made visible by the use of fluorescent dye or enzyme markers.

Atherosclerotic lesions - Formed via inflammation leading to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial tunica intima which then rupture to form lesions.

Leptin - A peptide hormone that is produced by fat cells. It plays a role in body weight regulation by acting on the hypothalamus to suppress appetite and burn fat stored in adipose tissue.

LXR ligands - ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes controlling lipid metabolism.

Lipolysis - The hydrolysis of triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol.



4)  '''&lt;big&gt;Reduced response to adiponectin and lower abundance of adiponectin receptor proteins in type 2 diabetic monocytes &lt;/big&gt;'''

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T36-4SCTWNX-4&amp;_user=47004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000005018&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=47004&amp;md5=bac23b7223919347d2bf3f392c20ee6e


This journal resource focuses mainly on the abundance of the adiponectin receptors and the effects of the antidiabetic  adipokine adiponectin in monocytes of normal-weight, overweight controls, and type two diabetic patients.   The journal goes into specific detail regarding adiponectin resistance in monocytes as well as it’s upregulation of interleukin.  The new definition terms I have found while viewing this journal are as follows: antiatherosclerotic, metformin, p38 MAPK, statins, and fibrates.  Metformin is an oral antidiabetic agent, C4H11N5, that decreases glucose production by the liver and lowers plasma glucose levels.  P38 MAPK is the archetypal member of the third MAPK-related pathway in mammalian cells.  Statins are any of a class of lipid-lowering drugs that reduce serum cholesterol levels by inhibiting a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol.  Fibrates are a class of amphipathic carboxylic acids. They are used for a range of metabolic disorders, mainly hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol), and are therefore hypolipidemic agents.  This journal resource reviews adiponectin’s effect as an upregulator for IL-6 and IL-8 through the p38 MAPK pathway.   It also touches upon the effect the concentration of adiponectin receptors one and two have on the activity of adiponectin.

'''New Terms:'''

Antiatherosclerotic - formation of multiple plaques within the arteries which cause a range of effects to the idividual.

Metformin - an antidiabetic drug (trade name Glucophage) prescribed to treat type II diabetes.

p38 MAPK - protein kinase activated by environmental stress such as ultraviolet radiation and osmotic shock and by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)

Statins - a class of hypolipidemic agents, used as pharmaceutical agents to lower cholesterol levels in people with or at risk for cardiovascular disease.

Fibrates - a group of cholesterol-moderating drugs in use since the early 1960s that includes bezafibrate, gemfibrozil, and fenofibrate. Fibrates are used primarily to treat high triglyceride levels. They can also help to increase HDL levels.

{{Hebrew/Aleph-Bet}}

Welcome to the final Aleph-Bet test! This will examine your knowledge of what you've learned so far in the Aleph-Bet level. Unlike the exercises, the test will include open questions. You must print it out, fill it, look at the [[Hebrew/Aleph-Bet/Test/Answers|answers]] and mark using the given points each question is worth.

Good luck!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Hebrew/Aleph-Bet}}

Welcome to the Aleph-Bet level of Learning Hebrew!

This level is aimed at junior-high students and older, and can be used by anyone with firm foundations in the English language who wants to begin to learn the Hebrew language or any language that uses the Hebrew alphabet ([[Yiddish]], Ladino, Aramaic etc.). 

The goal of this level is to make you capable of reading Hebrew. '''Any vocabulary or grammar information you may learn in any of the lesson is given to you to enhance your reading and interpreting skills.''' You will re-learn them anyway in the next lessons. This is also true for the vocabulary exercises.

The lessons are cumulative, which means that they are based on the presumption that you know the material learned in the former lesson.

==Lesson Layout==
Every lesson is structured in the following way:
* Centred title in which you are given the chronological position of the lesson and the letters you will learn in it.
* A brief introduction that states what letters and niqqud symbols you will learn.
* Each letter will be written using the [[Template:Hebrew-Huge|Hebrew-Huge]] template.
* Under the letter will be the letter's name and position in the alphabet, its pronunciation, [[:w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] equivalent and example from the English or closely-related languages.
* Some further notes will be given about the letter's final and &quot;soft&quot; form (if it has any).
* Niqqud symbols would be placed under either Ħet, Vav, Shin or Bet, though the standard is on Bet.
* Under the niqqud symbol would be the symbol's name and sound, as well as some extra notes if there is need of any.
* Grammar notes if any.
* Vocabulary that can be put together from the letters and/or vowels you've learned. Again, '''any vocabulary or grammar information you may learn in any of the lesson is given to you to enhance your reading and interpreting skills.''' It is of no importance in regards to your knowledge of the Hebrew language, and you will re-learn it anyway.
* Summary of what you have learned in the lesson.
* Link to the corresponding exercise page. Each exercises page would include letters and niqqud exercises, vocabulary exercises and reading-without-vowels exercises, at the end of which you would be directed to either the corresponding lesson or to the next lesson.
* Link to the next lessons.
* Every five lessons there would be a review of what you've learned in the past five lessons.

Good luck!

{{Hebrew/Aleph-Bet}}

Welcome to the first lesson in the Hebrew alphabet! In this lesson you will learn the first two and most basic Hebrew letters - {{Hebrew|א בּ}} and the last letter, {{Hebrew|ת}}, and the first two ''niqqud'' symbols - pataħ and shva.

'''Important note:''' the Hebrew alphabet, unlike the Latin alphabet (which English uses), is read from right to left.

==Letters==

The Hebrew alphabet has no vowel letters. The letters only mark consonants, which means that when you look at a word you would have no idea how it is pronounced. Such alphabets are known  as &quot;abjads&quot;. The vowels would be explained immediately after this section. But we will begin with the two, first consonants. 

===Aleph===
[[Image:Aleph stroke order.png|thumb|right|150px|When handwritten, Aleph looks like this. Blue represents first stroke, red second. '''Exercise:''' Fill out a line with cursive Alephs. Do this until you write naturally and develop your own handwriting.]]
{{Hebrew-Huge|א}}
The first letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Aleph. It has 3 uses:
# It makes a consonant called &quot;glottal stop&quot;, as in &quot;co'''’'''operate&quot; or &quot;re'''’'''enact&quot;. 
::{| |- ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || {{Listen|filename=Glottal stop.ogg|title=Glottal stop|format=[[Ogg]]}}  
|}
:2. When at the beginning of a word, it means the word starts with a vowel.
:3. When preceded by any &quot;a&quot; vowel, when at the end of a word (there are exceptions) and in foreign words (because in most texts there are no marked vowels) it makes the &quot;a&quot; sound (IPA: /a/, &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;sp'''a'''&quot;).

&lt;br&gt;

===Bet===
[[Image:Bet stroke order.png|thumb|right|150px|Here's how Bet looks like when written. Remember: blue represents first stroke, red second. Do the same exercise as you did with Aleph. In cursive there is no need for vowels so you don't have to write the dot.]]
{{Hebrew-Huge|בּ}}
The second letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Bet. It makes the &quot;b&quot; sound (IPA: /b/, &quot;b&quot; as in &quot;'''b'''all&quot;). When there is no dot in the middle, the letter makes a different sound, so make sure to remember the dot. 

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

===Tav===
[[Image:Tav stroke order.png|thumb|right|150px|Here's how Tav looks like when written. Do that exercise, as usual. In Hebrew there are two forms of the same alphabet: print ''dfus'' for typing, handwriting ''ktav'' for writing.]]
{{Hebrew-Huge|ת}}
The last letter in the Hebrew alphabet and the third you will learn is Tav. It makes the &quot;t&quot; sound (IPA: /t/, &quot;t&quot; as in &quot;'''t'''omato&quot;).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now you've learned the first three letters! But all you have is consonants. In order to be actually able to pronounce words, you need vowels.

==Vowels==
In Hebrew, vowels appear as dots and bars above, beneath or to the left of letters. This system of dots and lines is known as ''niqqud'', a Hebrew word which means &quot;applying dots&quot;. It was devised by a group of early Medieval Jewish scribes and Bible scholars known as the Masoretes (''masoret'' means &quot;tradition&quot; in Hebrew). They invented the niqqud to make sure that the &quot;correct&quot; pronunciation of the Bible would not be lost. 

You would eventually have to learn to read without niqqud. It might seem daunting, but with a little exercise you would learn to recognize words and know how to pronounce them. But until then, you must learn the niqqud symbols first. Now you learn the first two:

===Pataħ===

{{Hebrew-Huge|בַּ}}
The pataħ is the 
line under the Bet.

The pataħ produces the &quot;a&quot; sound (IPA: /a/, &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;sp'''a'''&quot;).

===Shva===

{{Hebrew-Huge|בְּ}}
The shva is the 
two vertical dots 
under the Bet.

Shva does two things:
#''Shva naħ'' (resting Shva): placed under a consonant to mark the end of a syllable.
#''Shva na‘'' (moving Shva): when shva is at the beginning of a syllable, it produces the &quot;ə&quot; sound (IPA: /ə/, &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;'''a'''bout&quot;). Many Israelis pronounce it as &quot;e&quot;.

==Words==
Now that we have three consonants and two vowels, we can produce words!

Vocabulary:

{{Hebrew-Vocab|אַתְּ| you|feminine, singular|at}}
{{Hebrew-Vocab|בַּתּ| daughter, girl|feminine, singular|bat}}&lt;ref&gt;When Tav is at the end of a letter it loses the dot but does not change its pronunciation. In order to avoid confusion with the Bet/Vet pronunciation, in this lesson only there will be a dot in the Tav in the end of the word ''bat''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This word {{Hebrew|בַּתּ}} or bat is pronounced closer to the second syllable in the English word ro'''bot''' (American pronunciation) than the English word bat (the animal, or the thing you use to hit a baseball or cricket ball).  Similarly, the word {{Hebrew|אַתְּ}} or at, is  pronounced as in the word '''att'''raction. (notice - it is not pronounced like the English word that is spelled as at.)

Try to read these words out loud. Remember that Hebrew is read from right to left!

==Notes about these letters==

A common phrase that English speakers may know is Bat Mitzvah.  This phrase is usually translated as Daughter of the Commandments and is used to refer to a young, Jewish woman, who is old enough to be morally responsible for her actions.  This would be at age 12 or 13 depending on the Jewish denomination.

A very simple sentence is &lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew|אַתְּ בַּתּ }} &lt;br&gt;
which means &quot;you are a daughter&quot; or &quot;you are a girl&quot;.  (We'll explain in later lessons about the &quot;to be&quot; verbs like are and the article a.)

The English word for our letters, alphabet, comes from aleph-bet, the first two letters in the Hebrew language.

Each Hebrew letter also has a numeric value.  Those are explained separately.  The letter Aleph ({{Hebrew|א}}) has the value of 1.  The letter Bet ({{Hebrew|בּ}}) has the value of 2. The letter  Tav ({{Hebrew|תּ}}) is the 22nd and last letter of the Hebrew Aleph-Bet; it has the value of 400.

==Exercises==
Remember the letters you have learned: Aleph ({{Hebrew|א}}), Bet ({{Hebrew|בּ}}) and Tav ({{Hebrew|תּ}}).
&lt;br&gt;
Also remember the vowels you have learned: Pataħ ({{Hebrew|ַ}}) and Shva ({{Hebrew|ְ}}).
&lt;br&gt;
With this knowledge, you can make six possible combinations:
&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|אַ אְ בַּ בְּ תַּ תְּ}}
&lt;br&gt;
Assign each letter to the sound it makes:
{{Question-answer
| question = ''
* {{Hebrew|תַּ}}
* {{Hebrew|בְּ}}
* {{Hebrew|אְ}}
* {{Hebrew|אַ}}
* {{Hebrew|בַּ}}
* {{Hebrew|תְּ}}
| answer =
* Ta
* B
* ’
* A
* Ba
* T
}}

Now do the opposite. Assign each sound to the equivalent Hebrew letter:
{{Question-answer
| question = ''
* T
* A
* Ba
* B
* Ta
* ’
| answer =
* {{Hebrew|תְּ}}
* {{Hebrew|אַ}}
* {{Hebrew|בַּ}}
* {{Hebrew|בְּ}}
* {{Hebrew|תַּ}}
* {{Hebrew|אְ}}
}}

How do you spell each of the following words (most of which are fictional)?
&lt;br&gt;''Example: {{Hebrew|אַבְּ}} Aleph-pataħ Bet-shva''
{{Question-answer
| question = בַּתּ
| answer = Bet-pataħ Tav
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = בַּתַּא
| answer = Bet-pataħ Tav-pataħ Aleph
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = תְּבַּ
|answer = Tav-shva Bet-pataħ
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = אַתְּ
| answer = Aleph-pataħ Tav-shva
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = אַבְּתּ
| answer = Aleph-pataħ Bet-shva Tav
}}

How do you pronounce each of the following words?
&lt;br&gt;''Example: {{Hebrew|אַבְּ}} Ab''
{{Question-answer
| question = אַתְּבּ 
| answer = Atb
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = תְּבַּ
| answer = Tba
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = אַתְּ
| answer = At
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = בַּאְתּ
| answer = Ba’t
}}

there is no such thing as אְ (Alef with Shva), because Alef is A &quot;Gronit&quot; (גרונית) lettre [from hebrew- guttural] it can not be vowelized with Shva. in a situation like this one, the Alef &quot;יחטוף&quot; [kidnap] a patach, segol....

{{Hebrew/Aleph-Bet}}

Welcome to the second lesson of the Hebrew alphabet! In this lesson you will learn three new Hebrew letters - {{Hebrew|ב ה}} and {{Hebrew|נן}}, two new ''niqqud'' symbols - qamats and tsere, as well as the definite article in Hebrew.

==Letters==

So far we have learned 3 letters: {{Hebrew|א}}, {{Hebrew|בּ}} and {{Hebrew|תּ}}. Now we will learn two new letters:

===Vet===
{{Hebrew-Huge|ב}}
Remember the previous lesson we learned that the dot in the Bet is important? Well, here is why. When Bet loses the dot it becomes Vet and stands for the &quot;v&quot; sound (IPA: /v/, &quot;v&quot; as in &quot;'''v'''iolin&quot;). Note that normally it isn't considered a separate letter from Bet.

===He===
[[Image:He stroke order.png|thumb|right|150px|Cursive He looks like this. Remember that blue represents first stroke, red second. Do the same exercise you did last time.]]
{{Hebrew-Huge|ה}}
The fifth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is He. It makes the &quot;h&quot; sound (IPA: /h/, &quot;h&quot; as in &quot;'''h'''eart&quot;). When at the end of a word it is silent.

===Nun===
{{Hebrew-Huge|נ  ן}}
The fourteenth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Nun. It makes the &quot;n&quot; sound (IPA: /n/, &quot;n&quot; as in &quot;'''n'''ame&quot;). When at the end of a word, it changes form. This final form is known as Nun Sofit - {{Hebrew|ן}} (&quot;Sofit&quot; is Hebrew for &quot;final&quot;). A few letters in the Hebrew have this property, and Nun is one of them.


==Vowels==

The following vowels resemble in pronunciation Pataħ and Shva, but they are different depending on the accent. Many Israelis pronounce them (Pataħ and Qamats, Shva and Tsere) the same.

===Qamats===

{{Hebrew-Huge|בָּ}}
The qamats is the horizontal line with the smaller vertical line under the Bet.

Like pataħ, qamats produces the &quot;a&quot; sound (IPA: /a/, &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;sp'''a'''&quot;).

===Tsere===

{{Hebrew-Huge|בֵּ}}

The tsere is the two horizontal dots under the Bet.

Tsere produces the &quot;e&quot; sound (IPA: /e/, &quot;e&quot; as in &quot;b'''e'''t&quot;).

==Definite He - ''He Hayedi‘ah''==

In English there are two different types of articles: definite (&quot;the&quot;) and indefinite (&quot;a&quot;/&quot;an&quot;). In Hebrew, while there is a separation between the definite and indefinite, there exists an article only for the definite; that is, there is no &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot; in Hebrew, just &quot;the&quot;. If the noun or adjective doesn't have the definite article, it simply means it is indefinite.

Unlike English, where the definite/indefinite article exists as free form (a separate word), in Hebrew the definite article appears as an affix. By simply adding the letter He {{Hebrew|ה}} to the beginning of any noun or adjective, regardless of its gender and number, the word becomes definite. The definite He is known as ''He Hayedi‘ah'' (lit. &quot;knowledge He&quot;). 

Why don't we implement it on the noun we know?

{{Hebrew-Large|בַּת}} ''bat'' (singular, feminine, indefinite) &quot;daughter&quot;
&lt;br&gt;We add the letter {{Hebrew|ה}} and the result:
&lt;br&gt;{{Hebrew-Large|הַבַּת}} ''habat'' (singular, feminine, definite) &quot;the daughter&quot;

==Words==
In Hebrew there are two genders: masculine and feminine. Learning the gender of every word is important, because in Hebrew, almost ''everything'' has a gender, even numbers. Finding a gender just by looking at a word is harder than the Romance languages, especially Spanish, but somewhat easier than say German. In most cases, words ending with Tav or He are feminine. '''There are numerous exceptions.'''

With two new letters and two new niqqud signs we can put together even more words! First let's look at the vocabulary we have so far: &lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|אַתְּ}} ''at'' you (singular, feminine) &lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|בַּת}} ''bat'' daughter, girl (singular, feminine)

Now we'll add some more words. We have the singular feminine form of &quot;you&quot;. What about the masculine form? &lt;br&gt; 
{{Hebrew-Large|אַתָּה}} ''atah'' you (singular, masculine)&lt;ref&gt;In the word ''atah'' the &quot;h&quot; is not spoken, it is simply an indicator that the word ends with a He. This does not change the pronunciation of the word (which should be ''ata'').&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;br&gt;

And we have a &quot;girl&quot;, what about a boy? &lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|בֵּן}} ''ben'' son, boy (masculine, singular) &lt;br&gt;

Other new words: &lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|תָּא}} ''ta''  cell, cab (truck), cabin, locker, cubicle, group (people) (masculine, singular) &lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|אָב}} ''av'' father (masculine, singular) &lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|אַבָּא}} ''aba'' dad (masculine, singular, informal) &lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|בָּנָנָה}} ''banana'' banana (feminine, singular)&lt;ref&gt;The proper Hebrew word is ''moz'', banana is a popular loanword from European languages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Summary==
In the past 2 lessons, you have learned:
* The Hebrew letters and forms Aleph {{Hebrew|א}}, Bet {{Hebrew|בּ}}, Vet {{Hebrew|ב}}, He {{Hebrew|ה}}, Nun {{Hebrew|נ}}, Nun Sofit {{Hebrew|ן}} and Tav {{Hebrew|ת}}. 
* The niqqud symbols Qamats ({{Hebrew|ָ}}), Pataħ ({{Hebrew|ַ}}), Tsere ({{Hebrew|ֵ}}) and Shva ({{Hebrew|ְ}}).
* The words {{Hebrew|אַתְּ}}, {{Hebrew|אַתָּה}}, {{Hebrew|בַּת}}, {{Hebrew|בֵּן}}, {{Hebrew|תָּא}}, {{Hebrew|אָב}}, {{Hebrew|אַבָּא}} and {{Hebrew|בָּנָנָה}}. 
* The definite article in Hebrew - He Hayedi‘ah.

{{Hebrew/Aleph-Bet}}

Welcome to the third lesson of the Hebrew alphabet! In this lesson you will learn the two most common Hebrew letters - {{Hebrew|מם}} and {{Hebrew|שׁשׂ}}, and two new ''niqqud'' symbols - segol and ħiriq.

==Letters==
The two letters (and four forms) you will learn now are the most common in the Hebrew language:

===Mem===
{{Hebrew-Huge|מ}} {{Hebrew-Huge|ם}}
The thirteenth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Mem. It makes the &quot;m&quot; sound (IPA: /m/, &quot;m&quot; as in &quot;'''m'''other&quot;). Like Nun, when it is at the end of a word, it changes form. This final form is known as Mem Sofit - {{Hebrew|ם}}.

===Shin===
{{Hebrew-Huge|שׁ}} {{Hebrew-Huge|שׂ}}
The penultimate letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Shin. It has two forms:
* When the dot above the letter is on the right - it's called Shin and it makes the &quot;sh&quot; sound (IPA: /{{IPA|ʃ}}/, &quot;sh&quot; as in &quot;'''sh'''ip&quot;).  This is more common.
* When the dot above the letter is on the left - it's called Sin and it makes the &quot;s&quot; sound (IPA: /s/, &quot;s&quot; as in &quot;'''s'''afe&quot;).

==Vowels==
You will now learn another way to express the &quot;e&quot; sound as well as the exclusive vowel for the &quot;i&quot; sound:

===Segol===
{{Hebrew-Huge|בֶּ}}
The segol is the three dots under the Bet.

Like Tsere, it produces the &quot;e&quot; sound (IPA: /e/, &quot;e&quot; as in &quot;b'''e'''t&quot;).

===Ħiriq===
{{Hebrew-Huge|בִּ}}
The ħiriq is the dot under the Bet.

It produces the &quot;i&quot; sound (IPA: /i/, &quot;i&quot; as in &quot;sk'''i'''&quot;).

==Words==
Thanks to the letter Mem and the symbol Segol, we can complete our collection of 2nd person pronouns (all appearing as &quot;you&quot; in English)!

{{Hebrew-Large|אַתָּה}} ''atah'' you (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|אַתְּ}} ''at'' you (feminine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|אַתֶּם}} ''atem'' you (masculine, plural)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|אַתֶּן}} ''aten'' you (feminine, plural)&lt;ref&gt;When addressing a group of people from both genders use ''atem''.&lt;/ref&gt;

You might notice that all of them begin with ''at''&lt;ref&gt;Usually when a consonant is at the end of a syllable it loses the ''dagesh'' (dot in the middle). The words for &quot;you&quot; have a dot in the Tav because in ancient times the they were ''ant'' or ''antah'' and when the Nun was lost the Tav received the dagesh.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Hebrew|אַתּ}}.&lt;br&gt;
Some more pronouns:

{{Hebrew-Large|הֵם}} ''hem'' they (masculine)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|הֵן}} ''hen'' they (feminine)

So we have daughter, son, and father. Now we need the mother.

{{Hebrew-Large|אֵם}} ''em'' mother (feminine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|אִמָּא}} ''ima'' mom (feminine, singular, informal)&lt;ref&gt;The difference between ''em'' and ''ima'', like ''av'' and ''aba'', is historical. The proper Hebrew words are ''av'' and ''em'', and ''aba'' and ''ima'' are loanwords from Aramaic. Eventually ''aba'' and ''ima'' became the standard form for speaking to your mom or dad, and ''av'' and ''em'' are considered even more formal than &quot;father&quot; and &quot;mother&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other new words:

{{Hebrew-Large|מָה}} ''mah'' what&lt;br&gt; 
{{Hebrew-Large|שֵׁם}} ''shem'' name (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|שַׁבָּת}} ''shabbat'' sabbath, Saturday (feminine, singular)&lt;ref&gt;As you might have guessed (or already know), &quot;sabbath&quot; is a loanword from Hebrew.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Summary==
In this lesson, you have learned:
* The Hebrew letters and forms Mem {{Hebrew|מ}}, Mem Sofit {{Hebrew|ם}}, Shin {{Hebrew|שׁ}} and Sin {{Hebrew|שׂ}}.
* The niqqud symbols Segol (ֶ) and Ħiriq (ִ).
* The 2nd person pronouns in Hebrew.
* The words {{Hebrew|הֵם, הֵן, אֵם, אִמָּא, מָה, שֵם}} and {{Hebrew|שַׁבָּת}}.

{{Hebrew/Aleph-Bet}}

Welcome to the fourth lesson of the Hebrew alphabet! In this lesson you will learn the two new Hebrew letters - {{Hebrew|ל}} and {{Hebrew|ו}}, and two new ''niqqud'' symbols - ħolam and shuruq.

==Letters==
This lesson we will learn two letters, each has only one form:

===Lamed===
{{Hebrew-Huge|ל}}
The twelfth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Lamed. It makes the &quot;l&quot; sound (IPA: /l/, &quot;l&quot; as in &quot;'''l'''amb&quot;). It is the only letter in the print Hebrew alphabet&lt;ref&gt;There are two forms of the Hebrew alphabet: a print form for printing and reading, and a handwritten form for reading. Since the purpose of this level is to learn how to read Hebrew, the print version is taught. In the handwritten alphabet some other letters rise above the line.&lt;/ref&gt; that rises above the line.

===Vav===
{{Hebrew-Huge|ו}}
The sixth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Vav. It makes three sounds:
# The &quot;v&quot; sound (IPA: /v/, &quot;v&quot; as in &quot;'''v'''iolin&quot;).
# The &quot;o&quot; sound (IPA: /o/, &quot;o&quot; as in &quot;g'''o'''re&quot;).
# The &quot;u&quot; sound (IPA: /u/, &quot;u&quot; as in &quot;fl'''u'''&quot;). &lt;br&gt;
Also
* When doubled ({{Hebrew|וו}}) it makes the &quot;w&quot; semivowel (IPA: /w/, &quot;w&quot; as in &quot;'''w'''ell&quot;), but only in foreign words.

You might remember that we learned that the letter Aleph has three purposes: 1) It makes the glottal stop 2) When at the beginning of a word it means the word starts with a vowel and 3) When preceded by any &quot;a&quot; vowel, when at the end of a word (there are exceptions) and in foreign words (because in most texts there are no marked vowels) it makes the &quot;a&quot; sound (IPA: /a/, &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;sp'''a'''&quot;).

Vav plays the same roles as Aleph (except for 2., that's reserved for Aleph): it makes the &quot;v&quot; sound and when charged with an &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot; vowel or in foreign words (because in most texts there are no marked vowels) it makes the &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot; sound. More about that in the next section.

==Vowels==
How do we know if Vav makes the &quot;v&quot;, &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot; sound?&lt;br&gt;
Two ''niqqud'' signs are there to help us:

===Ħolam===
{{Hebrew-Huge|וֹ}}  
The ħolam is the dot above the Vav.

It produces the &quot;o&quot; sound (IPA: /o/, &quot;o&quot; as in &quot;g'''o'''re&quot;). It can appear as a dot in the top of the space between two letters (x{{Hebrew|ֹ}}x) and then it's called ''Ħolam Ħaser'' (&quot;empty ħolam&quot;) or on a Vav ({{Hebrew|וֹ}}), and then it is called ''Ħolam Malei'' (&quot;full ħolam&quot;). In modern Israeli Hebrew there is no distinction between the two save spelling. 

===Shuruq===
{{Hebrew-Huge|וּ}}
The shuruq is the dot to the left of the Vav.&lt;ref&gt;In some browsers, the dot may appear in the wrong place.  It should show up on the left of the vav about vertically midway.&lt;/ref&gt;

It produces the &quot;u&quot; sound (IPA: /u/, &quot;u&quot; as in &quot;fl'''u'''&quot;).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When charged by any other vowel Vav is pronounced as a &quot;v&quot;.

==Connection Vav - ''Vav Haħibur''==
You remember the Definite He? We learned then that while in English the definite article exists as a separate word (&quot;the&quot;), in Hebrew it exists as an affix, namely the letter He. So if ''bat'' means &quot;a daughter&quot;, ''habat'' means &quot;the daughter&quot;.

The same is true for the conjunction &quot;and&quot;. While, in English, &quot;and&quot; is a separate word, in Hebrew it appears as an affix, a letter that you add to the beginning of any word and functions as a separate word. For example:

{{Hebrew-Large|אָב}} ''av'' father&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|אֵם}} ''em'' mother&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|אָב וָאֵם}} ''av va’em'' father and mother

==Words==
{{Hebrew-Large| שָׁלוֹם}} ''shalom'' peace (masculine, singular), hello, goodbye&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large| בּוּל}} ''bul'' postal stamp (masculine, singular), bull's-eye, spot on!&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large| שֵׁן}} ''shen'' tooth (feminine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large| מַתָּנָה}} ''matanah'' gift, present (feminine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large| מָלוֹן}} ''malon'' hotel (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large| מִלָה}} ''milah'' word, circumcision (feminine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large| אוֹת}} ''ot'' letter (alphabet), sign (feminine, singular)&lt;br&gt;

==Summary==
In this lesson, you have learned:
* The letters Lamed {{Hebrew|ל}} and Vav {{Hebrew|ו}}.
* The niqqud symbols Ħolam (ֹ) and Shuruq (ּ).
* The words {{Hebrew|שָׁלוֹם, בּוּל, שֵׁן, מַתָּנָה, מָלוֹן, מִלָה}} and {{Hebrew|אוֹת}}.
* The conjunction &quot;and&quot; in Hebrew - Vav Haħibur.
Practice what you've learned in the [[Hebrew/Exercises/Aleph-Bet 4|exercises]].

{{Hebrew/Aleph-Bet}}

Welcome to the fifth lesson of the Hebrew alphabet! In this lesson we will do some reviewing, and you will learn three important letters: {{Hebrew|ד}}, {{Hebrew|ר}} and {{Hebrew|י}}.

==Review==
We've been through 4 lessons and we've learned quite a bit since we started. Let's look at the letters we learned:

===Letters===
{{Hebrew-Large|א}} Aleph: makes the &quot;a&quot; sound, makes the glottal stop (’) or simply indicates the word starts with a vowel.

{{Hebrew-Large|בּ ב}} Bet: makes the &quot;b&quot; sound. When there is no dot, it makes the &quot;v&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|ה}} He: makes the &quot;h&quot; sound. When at the end of a word it makes the &quot;a&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|ו}} Vav: makes the &quot;v&quot;, &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; sounds.

{{Hebrew-Large|ל}} Lamed: makes the &quot;l&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|מ ם}} Mem: makes the &quot;m&quot; sound. Changes form when at the end of a word.

{{Hebrew-Large|נ ן}} Nun: makes the &quot;n&quot; sound. Changes form when at the end of a word.

{{Hebrew-Large|שׁ שׂ}} Shin: makes the &quot;sh&quot; sound when the dot is on the right; when it's on the left, it makes the &quot;s&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|ת}} Tav: makes the &quot;t&quot; sound. 

===Vowels===
But we have also learned the [optional] vowel markers that go with them:

{{Hebrew-Large|בְּ}} Shva: marks the end of a syllable or makes the &quot;ə&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בַּ}} Pataħ: makes the &quot;a&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בָּ}} Qamats: makes the &quot;a&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בֵּ}} Tsere: makes the &quot;e&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בֶּ}} Segol: makes the &quot;e&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בִּ}} Ħiriq: makes the &quot;i&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|וֹ}} Ħolam: makes the &quot;o&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|וּ}} Shuruq: makes the &quot;u&quot; sound.

Now we have all the sounds, but not all the symbols. All vowels (except for &quot;i&quot;) are marked by more than one symbol, with the most being &quot;a&quot; with 4 different ways to represent it (so far we've learned two). Don't be intimidated by this, though, because the rest of the symbols are based on the ones we've already learned (save the one we are going to learn this lesson).

==New Letters==

===Dalet===
{{Hebrew-Huge|ד}}
The fourth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Dalet. It makes the &quot;d&quot; sound (IPA: /d/, &quot;d&quot; as in &quot;'''d'''og&quot;).

===Resh===
{{Hebrew-Huge|ר}}
The twentieth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Resh. Pronunciation varies, but the standard Israeli pronunciation is a sound called &quot;voiced uvular fricative&quot; (IPA: /{{IPA|ʁ}}/, &quot;r&quot; as in German &quot;F'''r'''au&quot;, in French &quot;f'''r'''ançais&quot;).
{{Listen|filename=Voiced uvular fricative.ogg|title=Voiced uvular fricative|format=[[Ogg]]}} 

===Yod===
{{Hebrew-Huge|י}}
The tenth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Yod. It makes the &quot;y&quot; sound (IPA: /j/, &quot;y&quot; as in &quot;'''y'''ard&quot;). Like Aleph and Vav, when preceded by a consonant marked with the &quot;i&quot; vowel, it makes the &quot;i&quot; sound. It is the only letter in the Hebrew alphabet that does not reach the bottom border of the letters (it &quot;floats&quot;).

==New Vowels==
As you might have noticed in the previous lesson and in the exercises, the shuruq can only be placed on a Vav, otherwise it would be the same dot that distinguishes Bet from Vet (it's called ''dagesh'', &quot;emphasis&quot;). So what if there is an &quot;u&quot; sound but no Vav? There is a symbol for that purpose.

===Qubuts===
{{Hebrew-Huge|בֻּ}}
The qubuts is the three diagonal dots under the Bet.

It produces the &quot;u&quot; sound (IPA: /u/, &quot;u&quot; as in &quot;fl'''u'''&quot;).
 
==Words==
This time vocabulary more related to the culture that comes with Hebrew:&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|תּוֹדָה}} ''todah'' thank you (feminine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|מַיִם}} ''mayim'' water (masculine, plural [no sing.])&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|דּוֹד}} ''dod'' uncle, friend, beloved, one of the names of God (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|יִשְׂרָאֵל}} ''yisra’el'' Israel&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|יְרוּשָׁלַיִם}} ''yerushalayim'' Jerusalem&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|יְהוּדִי}} ''yehudi'' Jew (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|בַּיִת}} ''bayit'' house, home (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|דָּם}} ''dam'' blood (masculine, singular)

Have you noticed that in Jerusalem and Jew, the letter {{Hebrew|יְ}} is pronounced as &quot;ye&quot;? This is an example where Shva is pronounced as &quot;ə&quot;. That's because the Yod is in the beginning of a syllable.

==Summary==
In this lesson, you have learned:
* The letters {{Hebrew|ד, ר}} and {{Hebrew|י}}.
* The niqqud symbol qubuts ({{Hebrew|ֻ}}).
* The words {{Hebrew|תּוֹדָה, מַיִם, דּוֹד, יִשְׁרָאֵל, יְרוּשָׁלַיִם, יְהוּדִי, בַּיִת}} and {{Hebrew|דָּם}}.

{{Hebrew/Aleph-Bet}}

Welcome to the sixth lesson of the Hebrew alphabet! In this lesson you will learn three new Hebrew letters - {{Hebrew|ג}}, {{Hebrew|ז}} and {{Hebrew|ח}} and two new ''niqqud'' symbols - ħataf-pataħ and ħataf-qamats.

==Letters==
After reviewing the first nine letters and learning another three, you've already learned more than half the alphabet! Just 10 letters to go. 

Now the next three letters:

===Gimmel===
{{Hebrew-Huge|ג}}
The third letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Gimmel. It makes the &quot;g&quot; sound (IPA: /g/, &quot;g&quot; as in &quot;'''g'''ive&quot;).

===Zayin===
{{Hebrew-Huge|ז}}
The seventh letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Zayin. It makes the &quot;z&quot; sound (IPA: /z/, &quot;z&quot; as in &quot;'''z'''oo&quot;).

===Ħet===
{{Hebrew-Huge|ח}}
The eighth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Ħet.&lt;br&gt;
You must have seen the names of vowels like ħiriq, pataħ and ħolam, and have been thinking: &quot;What is that strange letter?&quot;. Well, that letter is called Ħet, and is transliterated in the WikiBook as Ħħ. This is to distinguish between it and Khaf, a letter you will later learn. The traditional sound this letter makes is marked in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and the Maltese language as well as many Semitic transliterations as ħ, which is the phoneme we used. Most Israelis, however, pronounce it the same as Khaf.

Now what is that sound? This sound is called voiceless uvular fricative - same as Resh only that you don't use your vocal cords (IPA: /χ/, &quot;ch&quot; as in German &quot;Ba'''ch'''&quot;, in Dutch &quot;a'''ch'''t&quot;). A similar sound exists in English, voiceless velar fricative (IPA: /x/, &quot;h&quot; as in &quot;'''h'''uman&quot;).

{{Listen|filename=Voiceless uvular fricative.ogg|title=Voiceless uvular fricative|format=[[Ogg]]}}

==Vowels==
We have learned that Shva can either mean the end of a syllable or stand for the &quot;ə&quot; sound. However, the Shva Na‘ (ə) can't be put in guttural letters. What if one wants to make the &quot;ħə&quot; sound? The &quot;hə&quot; sound? The &quot;ə&quot; sound? For that purpose, three special reduced vowels, known as ''ħataf'' (&quot;interrupted&quot;) have been devised. In this lesson we're going to learn the first two:

===Ħataf-Pataħ===
{{Hebrew-Huge|חֲ}}
The Shva and Pataħ under the Ħet&lt;ref&gt;Ħataf forms can appear only on the guttural letters {{Hebrew|א, ה, ח}} and {{Hebrew|ע}} (a letter you haven't learned). The standard form for showing these is Ħet.&lt;/ref&gt; are the ħataf-pataħ.

It produces the &quot;a&quot; sound (IPA: /a/, &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;sp'''a'''&quot;).

===Ħataf-Qamats===
{{Hebrew-Huge|חֳ}}
The Shva and Qamats under the Ħet are the ħataf-qamats.

It produces the &quot;o&quot; sound (IPA: /o/, &quot;o&quot; as in &quot;g'''o'''re&quot;).

==Words==
{{Hebrew-Large|אֲנִי}} ''ani'' I&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|אֲנַחְנוּ}} ''anaħnu'' we&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|אֳנִיָה}} ''oniyyah'' ship (feminine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|חַג}} ''ħag'' holiday (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|חָבֵר}} ''ħaver'' friend (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|זַחַל}} ''zaħal'' caterpillar (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|חַלָּה}} ''ħalah'' chalah, traditional Jewish bread made on the Sabbath and other festivities (feminine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|גֶּזֶר}} ''gezer'' carrot (masculine, singular)

==Summary==
In this lesson, you've learned:
* The letters Gimmel {{Hebrew|ג}}, Zayin {{Hebrew|ז}} and Ħet {{Hebrew|ח}}.
* The niqqud symbols ħataf-pataħ ({{Hebrew|ֲ}}) and ħataf-qamats ({{Hebrew|ֳ}}).
* The words {{Hebrew|אֲנִי, אֲנַחְנוּ, אֳנִיָה, חַג, חָבֵר, זַחַל, חַלָּה}} and {{Hebrew|גֶּזֶר}}.

{{Hebrew/Aleph-Bet}}

Welcome to the seventh lesson of the Hebrew alphabet! In this lesson you will learn two new Hebrew letters - {{Hebrew|ט}} and {{Hebrew|כ}} - and the ''niqqud'' symbol ħataf-segol.

==Letters==
===Tet===
{{Hebrew-Huge|ט}}
The ninth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Tet. Like Tav, it makes the &quot;t&quot; sound (IPA: /t/, &quot;t&quot; as in &quot;'''t'''omato&quot;).

===Kaf===
{{Hebrew-Huge|כּ}}
The eleventh letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Kaf. It has three forms:
* When the dot is inside {{Hebrew|כּ}}, it makes the &quot;k&quot; sound (IPA: /k/, &quot;k&quot; as in &quot;'''k'''itten&quot;).
* When there is no dot inside {{Hebrew|כ}}, it makes the same sound as [[Hebrew/Aleph-Bet6#Ħet|Ħet]]. For spelling distinction purposes, Ħet (Het, Chet) is transliterated as &quot;ħ&quot; whilst Khaf is transliterated as &quot;kh&quot;. 
* At the end of a word, it changes form {{Hebrew|ך}}. This form is known as Khaf Sofit. There is a hard K final form ({{Hebrew|ךּ}}), but it is rarely used.

It is about time for the dot to be explained. This dot, appearing in the letters Bet {{Hebrew|בּ}}, Gimmel {{Hebrew|גּ}}, Dalet {{Hebrew|דּ}}, Kaf {{Hebrew|כּ}}, a letter we haven't learned yet and Tav {{Hebrew|תּ}}, is known as ''dagesh'' (&quot;emphasis&quot;). What it does is to make sounds &quot;harder&quot;: &quot;v&quot; to &quot;b&quot;, &quot;kh&quot; to &quot;k&quot;, and in ancient times &quot;th&quot; to &quot;t&quot;, &quot;dh&quot; to &quot;d&quot; etc. Do not confuse the ''dagesh'' with ''mappiq'' (which indicates that He needs to be pronounced at the end of a word) or ''dagesh ħazaq'' (which indicates that a consonant must be emphasized, as in {{Hebrew|אִמָּא}}).

==Vowels==
One more and we're done!

===Ħataf-Segol===
{{Hebrew-Huge|בֱּ}}
The shva and segol under the Bet are the Ħataf-Segol.

It produces the &quot;e&quot; sound (IPA: /e/, &quot;e&quot; as in &quot;b'''e'''t&quot;).

==Words==
{{Hebrew-Large|טוֹב}} ''tov'' good, well (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|אֱלוֹהִים}} ''elohim'' God&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|מִטָּה}} ''mitah'' bed (feminine, singular)&lt;ref&gt;''Ktiv malei'' (&quot;full writing&quot;, with Aleph, Vav and Yod): {{Hebrew|מִיטָּה}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|כָּךְ}} ''kakh'' like this, like so&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|כֶּלֶב}} ''kelev'' dog, hound (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|חָתוּל}} ''ħatul'' cat (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|כֵּן}} ''ken'' yes&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|לֹא}} ''lo'' no&lt;ref&gt;The Aleph is not pronounced. It is an orthographic irregularity.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
In this lesson, you've learned:
* The letters and forms Tet {{Hebrew|ט}}, Kaf {{Hebrew|כּ}}, Khaf {{Hebrew|כ}} and Khaf Sofit {{Hebrew|ך}}.
* The niqqud symbol ħataf-segol ({{Hebrew|ֱ}}).
* The words {{Hebrew|טוֹב, אֱלוֹהִים, מִטָּה, כָּךְ, כֶּלֶב, חָתוּל, כֵּן}} and {{Hebrew|לֹּא}}.

{{Hebrew/Aleph-Bet}}

Welcome to the eighth lesson of the Hebrew alphabet! In this relatively short lesson you will learn two new Hebrew letters - {{Hebrew|ס}} and {{Hebrew|ק}}. 

==Letters==
===Samekh===
{{Hebrew-Huge|ס}}
The fifteenth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Samekh. Like Sin, it makes the &quot;s&quot; sound (IPA: /s/, &quot;s&quot; as in &quot;'''s'''afe&quot;).

===Qof===
{{Hebrew-Huge|ק}}
The nineteenth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Qof (many Israelis pronounce the letter's name as &quot;Q''u''f&quot;). Like Kaf, it makes the &quot;k&quot; sound (IPA: /k/, &quot;k&quot; as in &quot;'''k'''itten&quot;). 

In order to make the distinction between Qof and Kaf (something which will assist you in spelling), Qof is transliterated as a Q. Traditionally, Qof is pronounced as IPA: /q/, same as Kaf only that you make the sound deeper in your throat. The International Phonetic Alphabet symbol for this sound, as well as the common transliteration of it in Semitic languages, is Q - which is why this letter was chosen for that purpose.

==Full Writing - ''Ktiv Malei''==
As we have already learned, in most texts niqqud aren't written. But there are some letters - Aleph, Vav and Yod - that also produce the &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot; and &quot;i&quot; sounds respectively. How can these be expressed when there are no vowels?

These letters are used to assist the reader in distinguishing between words. For instance:

''Ktiv ħasser'' (&quot;empty writing, with niqqud, without vowel letters): &lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|מִטָּה}} ''mitah'' bed &lt;br&gt;
''Ktiv malei'' (&quot;full writing&quot;, without niqqud, with vowel letters): &lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|מיטה}} ''mitah'' bed &lt;br&gt;

This form - without niqqud, but with vowel letters for support - is known as ''ktiv malei'' &quot;full writing&quot; - because it incorporates the &quot;full&quot; form of the word, with the most letters.

'''Note:''' There is no vowel letter for the &quot;e&quot; sound, though it's supposed to be Yod. Also, Aleph is '''rarely''' used in Hebrew as a vowel letter, mostly in foreign words (as in {{Hebrew|וָארְשָׁה}} ''varshah'' Warsaw).

==Words==
{{Hebrew-Large|סְלִיחָה}} ''sliħah'' excuse me, pardon, sorry, forgiveness (feminine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|דַּקָּה}} ''daqqah'' minute, thin (feminine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|סֻכּוֹת}} ''sukkot'' Sukkot, Feast of Booths, Feast of Tabernacles ([[:w:Sukkot|Jewish holiday]]) (feminine, plural) (full writing: {{Hebrew|סוכות}})&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|סִימָן}} ''siman'' sign, symbol, mark&lt;ref&gt;Ancient loanword from Greek
(σημανσις ''semansis'').&lt;/ref&gt;‏ (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;

{{Hebrew/Aleph-Bet}}

Welcome to the ninth lesson of the Hebrew alphabet! In this lesson we will do some reviewing, and you will learn two new Hebrew letters - {{Hebrew|ע}} and {{Hebrew|פ}} onto its many forms. 

==Review==
We've been through 8 lessons and we've learned a lot. Let's look at the letters we've learned:

===Letters===
{{Hebrew-Large|א}} Aleph: makes the &quot;a&quot; sound, makes the glottal stop (’) or simply indicates the word starts with a vowel.

{{Hebrew-Large|בּ ב}} Bet: makes the &quot;b&quot; sound. When there is no dot, it makes the &quot;v&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|ג}} Gimmel: makes the &quot;g&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|ד}} Dalet: makes the &quot;d&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|ה}} He: makes the &quot;h&quot; sound. When at the end of a word it makes the &quot;a&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|ו}} Vav: makes the &quot;v&quot;, &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; sounds.

{{Hebrew-Large|ז}} Zayin: makes the &quot;z&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|ח}} Ħet: makes the &quot;kh&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|ט}} Tet: makes the &quot;t&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|י}} Yod: makes the &quot;y&quot; and &quot;i&quot; sounds.

{{Hebrew-Large|כּ כ ך}} Kaf: makes the &quot;k&quot; sound. When there is no dot, it makes the &quot;kh&quot; sound. Changes form when at the end of a word.

{{Hebrew-Large|ל}} Lamed: makes the &quot;l&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|מ ם}} Mem: makes the &quot;m&quot; sound. Changes form when at the end of a word.

{{Hebrew-Large|נ ן}} Nun: makes the &quot;n&quot; sound. Changes form when at the end of a word.

{{Hebrew-Large|ס}} Samekh: makes the &quot;s&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|ק}} Qof: makes the &quot;k&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|ר}} Resh: makes the &quot;r&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|שׁ שׂ}} Shin: makes the &quot;sh&quot; sound when the dot is on the right; when it's on the left, it makes the &quot;s&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|ת}} Tav: makes the &quot;t&quot; sound. 

===Vowels===
And we've covered all the vowels:

{{Hebrew-Large|בְּ}} Shva: marks the end of a syllable or makes the &quot;ə&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בַּ}} Pataħ: makes the &quot;a&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בָּ}} Qamats: makes the &quot;a&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בֵּ}} Tsere: makes the &quot;e&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בֶּ}} Segol: makes the &quot;e&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בִּ}} Ħiriq: makes the &quot;i&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בֻּ}} Qubbuts: makes the &quot;u&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|וֹ}} Ħolam: makes the &quot;o&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|וּ}} Shuruq: makes the &quot;u&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בֳּ}} Ħataf-Qamats: makes the &quot;o&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בֲּ}} Ħataf-Pataħ: makes the &quot;a&quot; sound.

{{Hebrew-Large|בֱּ}} Ħataf-Segol: makes the &quot;e&quot; sound.

==New Letters==
Three to go!
===‘Ayin===
{{Hebrew-Huge|ע}} 
The sixteenth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is ‘Ayin. Like Aleph, it stands for the glottal stop (co'''’'''operate) or silent if it is at the end of a syllable.

===Pe===
{{Hebrew-Huge|פּ}}
The seventeenth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Pe. It has three forms:
* When the dot (dagesh) is inside {{Hebrew|פּ}}, it makes the &quot;p&quot; sound (IPA: /p/, &quot;p&quot; as in &quot;'''p'''ort&quot;).
* When there is no dot inside {{Hebrew|פ}}, it makes the &quot;f&quot; sound (IPA: /f/, &quot;f&quot; as in &quot;'''f'''ame&quot;).
* At the end of a word, it changes form {{Hebrew|ף}}. This form is known as Fe Sofit. Unlike Kaf, however, there is '''no''' Pe Sofit (*{{Hebrew|ףּ}}).

==Words==
{{Hebrew-Large|עִבְרִית}} ''‘ivrit'' the Hebrew language&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|עַפְעַף}} ''‘af‘af'' eyelid (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|פֶּה}} ''peh'' mouth (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|שָׂפָה}} ''safah'' language, lip, edge (feminine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|סֵפֶר}} ''sefer'' book (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|מִסְפָּר}} ''mispar'' number (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|עוֹף}} ''‘of'' fowl, chicken meat (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|פַּס}} ''pas'' line, strip (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;

==Summary==
In this lesson, you've learned:
* The letters and forms ‘Ayin {{Hebrew|ע}}, Pe {{Hebrew|פּ}}, Fe {{Hebrew|פ}} and Fe Sofit {{Hebrew|ף}}.
* The words {{Hebrew|עִבְרִית, עַפְעַף, פֶּה, שָׂפָה, סֵפֶר, מִסְפָּר, עוֹף}} and {{Hebrew|פַס}}.

{{Hebrew/Aleph-Bet}}

Welcome to the tenth and last lesson in the Hebrew alphabet! In this lesson we'll learn {{Hebrew|צ}} and traditional numbers in Hebrew.

==Tsadi צ==
{{Hebrew-Huge|צ}}
The eighteenth letter in the Hebrew alphabet is Tsadi. It makes the &quot;ts&quot; sound (IPA: /{{IPA|ʦ}}/, &quot;zz&quot; as in &quot;pi'''zz'''a&quot;, or &quot;ts&quot; as in &quot;'''Ts'''ar&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Many times you will see it transliterated as &quot;tz&quot;, &quot;z&quot; or even &quot;s&quot;. Because the traditional sound of this letter was a pharyngealised s (same as &quot;s&quot; only that the sound is emitted from deeper in the throat) and the current pronunciation is &quot;tz&quot;, a neutral transliteration - &quot;ts&quot; - is used in this WikiBook.&lt;/ref&gt;.

When it is at the end of a word, it changes form. This final form is known as Tsadi Sofit ({{Hebrew|ץ}}).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That's it, you've learned them all!

==Words==
{{Hebrew-Large|מִצְרַיִם}} ''mitsrayim'' Egypt&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|עֵץ}} ''‘ets'' tree (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|צָהֹב}} ''tsahov'' yellow (masculine, singular) (FW: {{Hebrew|צהוב}})&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|צֶבַע}} ''tseva‘'' color (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|עֶצֶם}} ''‘etsem'' bone (feminine, singular), object (masculine, singular)&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|צָרְפַת}} ''tsorfat''&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes Qamats is pronounced as &quot;o&quot;. This is known as ''Qamats Qatan'' (&quot;little Qamats&quot;). However, many Israelis mispronounce {{Hebrew|צָרְפַת}} as ''tsarfat''.&lt;/ref&gt; France&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|בֹּץ}} ''bots'' mud (masculine, singular [no pl.]) (FW: {{Hebrew|בוץ}})&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|צַיִד}} ''tsayid'' hunt (masculine, singular [no pl.]

==Numbers==
In traditional Jewish texts (in any Orthodox text, really) a numeric system, based on the letters of the alphabet is used. This system is known as ''gematria''. In everyday secular life, the Arabic numerical system (1, 2, 3) is used.

==Letters that sound the same==
Traditional Hebrew had many phonemes that don't exist today. Most of these sounds are called by linguists &quot;pharyngealised&quot;, that is, to produce them you need to &quot;voice&quot; (use your vocal cords) while sticking the root of your tongue to the pharynx. Many European Jews found it impossible to make such sounds, so they replaced them with regular consonants, all of which were already existent in Hebrew. For instance:

Kaf used to be a regular &quot;k&quot; sound (k).&lt;br&gt;
Qof used to be a pharyngealised &quot;k&quot; sound (q).&lt;br&gt;
Eventually Qof was pronounced the same as the regular &quot;k&quot;.&lt;br&gt;

As a result of this merging, many sounds have two letters to represent them. To prevent confusion, here are all the common sounds:

*Aleph {{Hebrew|א}} and ‘Ayn {{Hebrew|ע}} both make the glottal stop (’).
*Vet {{Hebrew|ב}} and Vav {{Hebrew|ו}} both make the &quot;v&quot; sound (v).
*At the end of a word, Aleph {{Hebrew|א}} and He {{Hebrew|ה}} both make the &quot;a&quot; sound (a).
*Ħet {{Hebrew|ח}} and Khaf {{Hebrew|כך}} both make the &quot;kh&quot; sound (χ).
*Tet {{Hebrew|ט}} and Tav {{Hebrew|ת}} both make the &quot;t&quot; sound (t).
*Kaf {{Hebrew|כּ}} and Qof {{Hebrew|ק}} both make the &quot;k&quot; sound (k).
*Samekh {{Hebrew|ס}} and Sin {{Hebrew|שׂ}} both make the &quot;s&quot; sound (s).

==Letters that look the same==
Many letters in Hebrew are based on other letters. One could almost call them diacritics. For example:

*Resh {{Hebrew|ר}}
*Yod {{Hebrew|י}}
*Vav {{Hebrew|ו}}

Many inexperienced readers tend to confuse these letters.

*{{Hebrew|ז}} Zayin
*{{Hebrew|ו}} Vav
*{{Hebrew|ן}} Nun Sofit
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*{{Hebrew|ם}} Mem Sofit
*{{Hebrew|ס}} Samekh
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*{{Hebrew|ה}} He
*{{Hebrew|ח}} Ħet
*{{Hebrew|ת}} Tav
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*{{Hebrew|כ}} Kaf
*{{Hebrew|ב}} Bet
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*{{Hebrew|ג}} Gimmel
*{{Hebrew|נ}} Nun
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*{{Hebrew|ד}} Dalet
*{{Hebrew|ר}} Resh
*{{Hebrew|ך}} Kaf Sofit

==Foreign transliteration==
The fact that there are multiple letters for the same sounds, creates a problem. What letters would you use for foreign words, using the Hebrew alphabet? Can you use any of them?

The answer is no. While Tet and Tav, for instance, sound the same, and supposedly we could use both of them, only Tet can be used for the &quot;t&quot; sound. This is because in foreign transliterations Tav might represent the &quot;th&quot; sound ({{Hebrew|פְּלִימוּת}} ''plimuth'' Plymouth).

===European Languages===

*A &amp;mdash; Aleph {{Hebrew|א}}
*V &amp;mdash; Vav in the beginning of syllables; Vet anywhere else
*Ch, kh, h &amp;mdash; Khaf {{Hebrew|כך}} in German and Greek; Ħet {{Hebrew|ח}} anywhere else
*T &amp;mdash; Tet {{Hebrew|ט}}
*Th &amp;mdash; Tav {{Hebrew|ת}}, Thav {{Hebrew|ת׳}}
*S &amp;mdash; Samekh {{Hebrew|ס}}
*Sh &amp;mdash; Shin {{Hebrew|שׁ}}
*Ts, tz, z &amp;mdash; Tsadi {{Hebrew|צ}}
*K &amp;mdash; Qof {{Hebrew|ק}}
*Any form of R &amp;mdash; Resh {{Hebrew|ר}}
*Tch (as in &quot;chair&quot;) &amp;mdash; Tchadi {{Hebrew|צ׳ ץ׳}}
*Zh, j, s (as in &quot;pleasure&quot;) &amp;mdash; Zhayin {{Hebrew|ז׳}}
*J, dzh (as in &quot;jam&quot;) &amp;mdash; Jimmel {{Hebrew|ג׳}}

===Arabic===
These transliterations apply only to words of Arabic origin:
*T &amp;mdash; Tav {{Hebrew|ת}}
*Th &amp;mdash; Thav {{Hebrew|ת׳}}
*Dj &amp;mdash; Jimmel {{Hebrew|ג׳}}
*Ħ &amp;mdash; Ħet {{Hebrew|ח}}
*Kh &amp;mdash; Khet {{Hebrew|ח׳}}
*Dh &amp;mdash; Dhal {{Hebrew|ד׳}}
*S' &amp;mdash; Tsadi {{Hebrew|צ}}
*D' &amp;mdash; Dadi {{Hebrew|צ׳}}
*T' &amp;mdash; Tet {{Hebrew|ט}}
*Dh' &amp;mdash; Dhet {{Hebrew|ט׳}}
*Gh &amp;mdash; Ghayin {{Hebrew|ע׳}}
*Q &amp;mdash; Qof {{Hebrew|ק}}
*K &amp;mdash; Kaf {{Hebrew|כּ}}

===Niqqud===
When writing foreign words, always use the vowel letters Aleph {{Hebrew|א}}, Vav {{Hebrew|ו}} and {{Hebrew|י}}.

'''There are many exceptions regarding Aleph, but don't take the risk.'''

For example: based on the former table, Tokaj (a town in Hungary famous for its wine) would never be written with Kaf and Tav (then it would be Thokhaj), but rather with Qof and Tet, respectively. But what niqqud would be used?

There are some rules:

* Never use ħataf forms.
* &quot;O&quot; is always written with ħolam malei ({{Hebrew|וֹ}}).
* &quot;U&quot; is always shuruq ({{Hebrew|וּ}}), never qubbuts ({{Hebrew|בֻּ}}).
* As stated before, always use vowel letters, or in other words, malei forms ({{Hebrew|בָּה/בָּא בַּה/בַּא בִּי בּוֹ בּוּ}}). It doesn't matter whether the word is written with niqqud or without.
* Write the &quot;e&quot; without using any vowel letter (this might cause confusion between &quot;e&quot; and &quot;ְ&quot; but this is something you'd have to guess).
* You can use either Qamats or Pataħ for &quot;a&quot;, Segol or Tsere for &quot;e&quot;.

Then the word Tokaj would be written {{Hebrew|טוֹקָאי}}.

= Introduction =


Somatostatin (SS) was first discovered in hypothalamic extracts. It is defined as a polypeptide hormone that inhibited secretion of other hormones, especially growth hormone, glucagons, insulin, thyrotropin, gastrin, and etc, depending on physiologic situation. Besides hypothalamus, it is found to be secreted by many other tissues such as pancreas, intestinal tract, and regions of the central nervous system outside the hypothalamus. Regardless where it is found, the synthesis and structure appears to be identical. Also, no matter where it is found, the action of it is always inhibitory. 

Link to the website: [http://www.med.harvard.edu/JPNM/TF93_94/Mar8/WriteUpMar8.html]

= Structure and Synthesis =
[[Image:Somatostatin_structure.GIF‎|right|thumb|200px|Somatostatin]]

Somatostatin is synthesized as a 116 amino acid preprohormone that is subsequently cleaved to two forms. The two forms are SS-14 and SS-28 amino acid coupounds. They reflect their amino acid length. 
Both forms of somatostatin are produced by proteolytic cleavage of prosomatostatin, which itself is derived from preprosomatostatin. Two cysteine residules in SS-14 allow the peptide to form an internal disulfide bond. 



Fig. 1: Shows the formation of SS-14 and SS-28

The production amount of the two forms, SS-14 and SS-28, depends upon the tissue they are being secreted in. SS-14 is the predominates in the hypothalamus and endocrine pancreas. SS-28 is more abundant in the GI tract. The two forms also can have the different biological potencies.

{{dropimage|align=center|width=200px|Somatostatin structure animation|[[image:Somatostatin.gif|300x225px|center]]}}

== Receptors and Mechanism of Action ==

Somatostatin acts by both endocrine and paracrine pathways to affect its target cells. There are all together five stomatostatin receptors that are recognized and characterized. All of them five belong to G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Each of the receptors activates different signaling mechanisms within cells. However, all inhibit adenylyl cyclase. It is found that four of the five receptors do not differentiate SS-14 from SS-28.

== Effects on the Pituitary Gland ==

Growth hormones is produced in the pituitary and it is stimulated by hypothalamic growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH). The growth hormone secretion is controlled by the interaction of somatostatin and growth hormone. The figure above shows the feedback system how the inhibition takes place.

== Effects on the Pancreas ==









Fig. 3: Shows the pancreatic islet and what is secreted in it. [http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.mfi.ku.dk/ppaulev/chapter27/images/27-3.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.mfi.ku.dk/ppaulev/chapter27/kap%252027.htm&amp;h=457&amp;w=647&amp;sz=55&amp;hl=en&amp;start=15&amp;um=1&amp;tbnid=4j8-GyUzVbetoM:&amp;tbnh=97&amp;tbnw=137&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dsomatostatin%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN]

The diagram shows cells within pancreatic islets secrete insulin, glucagon and somatostatin. Somatostatin appears to act primarily in a paracrine manner to inhibit the secretion of both insulin and glucagon. It also has the effect in suppressing pancreatic exocrine secretions, by inhibiting cholecystokinin-stimulated enzyme secretion and secretin-stimulated bicarbonate secretion.

[http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/otherendo/somatostatin.html]

== Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract ==

Somatostatin is secreted by scattered cells in the GI epithelium. Somatostatin shows the inhibition of many GI hormones such as gastrin, cholecystokinin, secretin, and so on. It also suppresses the secretion of gastric and pepsin which lowers the rate of gastric emptying and reduces smooth muscle contractions and blood flow within the intestine. Overall, these effects tend to decrease the rate of nutrient absorption.[http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/otherendo/somatostatin.html]

== Effects on the Nervous System ==

Somatostatin is also produced in the nervous system. It has neuromodulatory activity within the central nervous sytem. It has a variety of complex effects on neural transmission. For example, injection of somatostatin into the brain of rodents leads to such things as increased arousal and decreased sleep, and impairment of some motor responses. 

[http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/otherendo/somatostatin.html]

== Pharmacologic Uses ==

Somatostatin and its synthetic analogs are used clinically  due to its ability to inhibit certain hormones secretion. It is used to treat a variety of neoplasms such as giantism and acromegaly.

== Somatostatin Analogs for Diagnosis and Staging of Tumors ==

http://www.med.harvard.edu/JPNM/TF93_94/Mar8/WriteUpMar8.html

This article is a case presentation of a 49 year old female who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma stage IIIA in 1983.  After successful chemotherapy, the cancer went into remission.  However, in 1990 a recurrence was detected using a gallium-67 scintigraphy which suggested that the tumor was an indolent tumor.  Since most human tumors originating from somatostatin target tissue have conserved their somatostatin receptors, a somatostatin analog, octreotide, was given to the patient and traced inside her body.  This analog has all of the same pharmaceutical properties as somatostatin, except that it stays in the body much longer.  Using in vitro audiography with 25-I-Tyr-3-Octreotide, the somatostatin receptor’s status was evaluated in the tumor cells.  It showed that the high grade lymphomas expressed a very high density of receptors.  The low to intermediate grade lymphomas also expressed a moderate density of receptors.

This relates to the course because it shows that the hormone somatostatin is still present on tumor cells. It has some functionality in the regulation of the tumor because the tumor cells exhibit different densities of somatostatin receptors at different stages of the cancer.


== Somatostatin ==

http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/otherendo/somatostatin.html

This article gives a summary of somatostatin and its regulation and effects on different organs or glands in the body.  Somatostatin has two polypeptide forms, a 14 amino acid chain (SS-14) and a 28 amino acid chain (SS-28).  These are both generated by the cleavage of prosomatostatin.  The effects of somatostatin can be summarized in that it inhibits the secretion of many other hormones.  
	
Specifically, somatostatin affects the pituitary gland in that it causes inhibition of secretion of growth hormone which is vital to cells in growth and metabolism.  In the pancreas, somatostatin inhibits the secretion of insulin and glucagon which play an important role in glucose regulation in the body.  

Somatostatin affects the gastrointestinal tract (GI) by inhibiting the secretion of gastrin, cholecystokinin, secretin and vasoactive intestinal peptide. Finally, injection of somatostatin into the nervous system of rodents can cause increased arousal, decreased sleep, and an impairment of some motor responses.

This article relates to the course because it talks about somatostatin’s role in the pancreas in which it affects insulin and glucagon.  Insulin and glucagon regulate the body’s glucose levels.  The regulation of these hormones were studied in-depth, but without much talk on somatostatin.  This article shows that somatostatin has a regulation effect on these hormones.


== Can somatostatin control acute bleeding from oesophageal varices in Schistosoma mansoni patients? ==

http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=539281&amp;blobtype=pdf

This article deals with a proposed study on subjects infected with Schistosoma mansoni.  People infected by the parasite suffer from fibrosis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, haematemesis, varices, portal hypertension, ascites formation and eventually can lead to death.  Portal hypertension can lead to the formation of gastro-oesophageal varices.  Due to their fragility, these gastro-oesophageal varices are prone to bleed and can lead to death.  So far, treatments such as praziquantel are effective against the worm stages of the parasite but they are not effective against the bleeding.  The neuropeptide, somatostatin, has been proposed to be able to reduce bleeding in Schistosoma mansoni infected subjects.  A research study is to be put underway in which adolescent subjects, age range varying from 12–17 years, will be chosen who are infected with the parasite and will be split into two groups.  One group will be given praziquantel and somatostatin, while the other will be given praziquantel and propanolol.  The results of this have not been included in the article.  However it is believed that the patients who are given somatostatin will stop bleeding immediately and delay rebleeding and mortality.   
	
Even though this article talks about medical uses of somatostatin, which was not covered in the course, it still has relations to the course.  This article gives a medical use of somatostatin, a hormone, which is involved in regulation of growth and metabolism of cells.  In many of the chapters studied, biochemistry has been linked with medicine.


== A pilot study of a long acting somatostatin analogue for the treatment of refractory rheumatoid arthritis ==

http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1753815&amp;blobtype=pdf

This article deals with a study for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with long acting somatostatin.  Chronic inflammation, which is caused by this arthritis, can lead to development of a pannus, which causes progressive destruction of the joints.  In vitro studies of somatostatin have shown to inhibit the proliferation of human lymphocytes, the production of immunoglobulins by B lymphocytes, and neutrophilchemotaxis. Activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, B cells and the cytokines they produce are involved in the aggravated inflammatory tissue which develops into the pannus.  From this past research, researches set out to test the effect of a somatostatin analogue on patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Ten patients (all of whom were women age 18-70) with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis who had no reaction to multiple disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were chosen for this experiment.  These patients were treated with monthly injections of 20 mg Sandostatin-Lar, which contains an analogue of somatostatin, for three months.  The results showed that six patients responded achieving an ACR 20 response.  This concluded that treatment of somatostatin on patients with active, refractory rheumatoid arthritis led to significant clinical improvements that were also safe.
	
This article relates to the class because, like the Schistosomiosis paper, it relates biochemistry to medicine and how the hormone somatostatin can play a part in medicinal purposes.

=Oxidative Phosphorylation &amp; Molecular Oxygen Regulation=

Somatostatin has been proven to be incapable of affecting changes of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption (ΔO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that had been stimulated by mitochondrial fuels. It was once assumed that somatotstatin is produced during alterations in respiratory control of oxidative phosphorylation. Findings indicated that the hormone directly inhibits oxidative phosphorylation at a step prior to the TCA cycle.

An 8-CPT stable membrane permeable cAMP analog has been proven to not inhibit ΔO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by somatostatin, which removed the possibility of reduced levels of cytosolic cAMP being involved in this inhibition. However, the molecular target(s) for this inhibition remain unknown.

The inhibition of ΔO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the somatostatin receptor type- (sstr) selective analogs is in support of the effects of somatostatin developing exclusively through binding to sstr5. This sstr5 is responsible for mediating activation of the K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channel, and inhibiting the secretion of insulin in mice, rats, and men.

O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction can occur via the mitochondrial electron transport chain, or NAD(P)H oxidase activity and superoxide production. A range of NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms have been identified as being expressed within pancreatic islet tissue. The p47&lt;sup&gt;''PHOX''&lt;/sup&gt; isoform has been discovered to be predominantly expressed in pancreatic beta-cells, at the plasma membrane. Somatostatin was discovered to inhibit ΔO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without mechanisms involving NAD(P)H oxidase activity. Furthermore, the inhibition of the mitochondrial reduction of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by azides was proven to nullify the effect of somatostatin on ΔO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This indicates that azides have no effect on the oxidase activity of NAD(P)H. Overall, the role of NAD(P)H oxidases in the effect of somatostatin on ΔO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is still undetermined.

| (1572)1581-1584
| William I of Orange, also known as William the Silent, was the main leader of the Dutch revolt against the Spanish that set off the Eighty Years' War and resulted in the independence of the Dutch Republic. He was elected as Stadtholder in 1572, although Phillip II, the King of Spain, had appointed another one. William the Silent was assassinated in 1584. In the Netherlands, he is also known as the Vader des Vaderlands, &quot;Father of the Fatherland&quot;, and the Dutch national anthem, Het Wilhelmus, is written in his honor.

On Frederick Henry's death, he was buried with great pomp beside his father and brother at Delft.

= Sicilian - Hyper-Accelerated Dragon =
===2...g6===
This early g6 in the Sicilian signifies the Hyper-Accelerated Dragon, also called the Hungarian variation (not to be mistaken with the Hungarian Defense, which appears after  1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Be7). The main idea in the Hyper-Accelerated Dragon (HAD) is to delay d6, in order to be able to play the liberating d5 push in one go. This move is a gambit but is sound and is considered mainline. The advantage of this is that if white goes for the classical moves 3.d4 c.cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6 5.Nc3, Black can choose to prevent White from having the usual setup with Be3, Bc4, Qd2, and O-O-O. He can also transpose back into the regular dragon by playing d6.

The main drawback of this variation is that having delayed Nf6, White can play c4 before Nc3, setting up a Maroczy bind. The position is still equal, but black must know how to respond effectively, because it is easy to suffocate in this cramped position. 

The main 5.Nc3 (or 6.Nc3 if 5.Be3) goes : '''1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6 5.Nc3 Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Bc4 O-O 8.Bb3 a5 9.f3 d5''' blasting the position open before white can castle queenside. White's best response is '''10.exd5''', and it is important for black to study the plans and tactics involved beforehand.

The 4.Qxd4 line is perfectly fine for black : '''1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4 Nf6 5.e5 Nc6''' followed by Nd5.

The Maroczy bind variation with an early c4 (due to black delaying Nf6) can be fought via different means by Black. It can be met with '''1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6 5.c4 Nf6 6.Be3 d6''' with the idea of exchanging the knights on d4 to prevent the Be3/Qd2 battering ram that would take away Black's strongest piece, its g7 bishop. This is the line that has been played in recent years as an attempt to fight the Maroczy setup. Another possible way of playing it is like the regular Accelerated Dragon (Bg7 d6 etc.), with ideas of Qa5 or Qb6. These variations are critical for Black, as his position remains cramped for quite a long time. However, with good play, black is fine.

The other Maroczy bind line goes '''1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6 5.c4 Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Nc3 Ng4!? 8.Qxg4 Nxd4 9.Qd1 Ne6'''. At this point, White must choose between a few options : Qd2, Be2, and Rc1 are the most popular. 10.Be2 is considered inferior, as Black has the unorthodox reply 10...Bxc3 !. The idea is that, after doubling white pawns, the pawn on c4 is weaker, as it can't be defended with the rook via c1. The setup for white after this is a hedgehog setup, where he keeps moving his pieces to threaten c4 and e4. The light-squared bishop usually moves quite a lot, on the squares c8-b7-a6-c6. The pawns on the queen side usually go on b6 and d6, with the formation Qc7, Rac8, Rfd8, preparing Nc5.
Therefore, 10.Rc1 and 10.Qd2 are prefered, when Black can continue with the regular Qa5 plan.

An attempt to avoid the regular Maroczy is for black to delay cxd4. E.g. '''1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.d4 Bg7'''. If White plays 4.c4, then Black has the possiblity of 4...Qb6!, transposing into a variation of the Modern Defense, and with the idea of having an active queen on the dark squares. However, this is considered inferior, not because of 4.d5 (although playable) but because of the line '''4.dxc5 Qa5+ 5.c3 Qxc5 6.Na3!''', where White has the better game.

Yet another plan can be played to fight the Maroczy bind, which has been played up to the 70's, but lost popularity over the years. The idea is to play Nh6 with Nxd4 and f5. However, this is rarely played nowadays, as black usually has to exchange the dark-squared bishops, and has trouble on the dark-squares afterwards. Black has, however, active pieces, and can be a try for the well-prepared club player, preferring dynamic positions.

=Sicilian - O'Kelly variation=
===2...a6===
This early a6 prevents White from occupying b5, so after 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 and then 6. Nb5 is prevented. The main problem with this variation is how to deal with 3. c3, which transposes to an Alapin Sicilian with the useless a6 move.

Often White falls for the following trap: '''1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 a6 3.d4? cxd4 4.Nxd4 e5! 5.Nb3 Nf6 6.Nc3 Bb4 7.Bd3 d5!''' and Black has a clear advantage. He is simply too active.

      <comment>refuted credibility of codalyzer, 93.173.252.100</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Added in a shuffle algorithm I used in a card game.
Formating isn't perfect and there is little in the
way of explanation.

Here is a source code for find-median that uses the idea presented in the text, excluding the separation into 'partition' and 'find'.
This code works (well at least for a bunch of tests that I did). It partially sorts the array, so that values on the left hand side
of the array are less then values on the right hand side of it. Its time complexity is O(n), because it make one pass, and its
memory complexity is O(n), because it creates a copy of the array, in order not to change the original. If original array is
allowed to be changed, then, this can be modified so that memory complexity is constant.

I hope this code will help the writers of this section or anybody else.
the programming language is JAVA.

 }
&lt;/code&gt;

Algorithm in that code is not randomized at all and doesn't compute median either (try to set that array to (10,7,3,88,55,21,-2,3,0,1,65,35,25,90,2) ).

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chapter 1. Introduction==
&lt;!-- Place image here --&gt;
KTorrent is an application for KDE which allows you to download files by making use of the BitTorrent protocol. It enables you to run multiple torrents at the same time and comes with extended features to make it a full-featured client for BitTorrent.

Key features of KTorrent include the following:

* Queuing of torrents
* Global and per-torrent speed limits
* Previewing of certain file types (video and audio)
* Importing of partially or fully downloaded files
* File prioritization for multi-file torrents
* Selective downloading for multi-file torrents
* Kick/ban peers with an additional IP Filter dialog for list/edit purposes
* UDP tracker support
* Support for private trackers and torrents
* Directory scanner to automatically load torrents from certain directories
* Support for µTorrent's peer exchange
* Support for protocol encryption (compatible with Azureus)
* Support for creating trackerless torrents
* Support for distributed hash tables (DHT, the Mainline version)
* Support for UPnP to automatically forward ports on a LAN with dynamic assigned hosts
* System tray integration
* Tracker authentication support
* Connection though a proxy

In addition to the built-in functionality, the following plug-ins are available for KTorrent:

* Searching for torrent files with popular search engines 
* Web interface to support the control from a web browser
* RSS to keep up with new released torrents
* Bandwidth scheduling 
* IP Blocking filter 
* Infowidget which shows you seeders/leechers, a file selection part, webseed tab with edit functionality, chunks information and a trackers tab also with edit purposes.
* Logviewer to get up with the protocol and networking messages

So you see KTorrent can be configured by enabling or disabling plug-ins which extend KTorrent. We hope these plug-ins will help provide freedom for our users. Experienced users but also new users should feel at home with KTorrent.

Our goal is to make KTorrent...(guys?)


If you are uncertain about something, or just have random questions, you may always submit a question on the KTorrent forums (http://ktorrent.org/forum/).

KTorrent's homepage can be found at http://ktorrent.org. You will also find some frequently asked questions on the web site and some packages for different GNU/Linux distributions.

Please report any problems or feature requests to the KDE Bug Tracking system (http://bugs.kde.org) or alternatively to the KTorrent forums (http://ktorrent.org/forum/).

We hope you will enjoy using KTorrent!

      <comment>/* Using an XML Schema to validate your XForms */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have multiple XML documents and you want the semantics and business rules for all the shared data elements to be driven from a single model.

== Method ==
We will use two types of XML Schemas.  A '''semantic schema''' or '''subset schema''' is a sequence of all of the elements of a document exchange including the meaning of the enumerated values of the elements.  A '''constraint schema''' or '''exchange schema''' will import the semantic schema and include the document constraints such the order, grouping and what cardinality each of the elements in the document.

We will leverage many of the concepts of [[w:ISO/IEC 11179|ISO/IEC 11179]] [[w:Metadata registry|metadata registry]]. We will use a single XQuery that takes in a wantlist and generates a semantic subschema from this registry.  This assures that all leaf-level elements in a family of XML Schemas have consistent datatypes and precise semantic definitions that all refer back to the  metadata registry.  This automatic generation of structures from a central data model is known as model-driven design.

== Background on Subset Generation ==
Subset generation techniques were first developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology in support of the [[w:GJXDM|GJXDM]] and [[w:NIEM|NIEM]]standards.  The tools took the form of a web site that allowed a user to shop for data elements in the registry and keep a list of those data elements in a file called a wantlist.  This wantlist was then used to generate a subset of the GJXDM system that is guaranteed to be consistent with the GJXDM.  These tools were carried forward for use in the National Information Exchange Model as well as the Minnesota Department of Revenue subschema generators.

== Method ==
A subset generator is part two of a three part process.

[[Image:subset-generation-process.png|right|500px]]

* '''Step one:''' Use a [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/XRX/Metadata_shopper metadata shopping] cart to shop for data elements in your registry and to create a [[wantlist]].  A shopping cart tool with an integrated search function allows non-programmers to take an active role in schema creation.
* '''Step two:''' is to generate a [[Subset Schema]] that conforms to the [[w:Liskov substitution principle|Liskov Substitution Principle]] using the wantlist generated in part one as the input.
* '''Step three:''' Import that subset XML Schema into a [[Constraint Schema]].  This can be done my referencing the REST parameters to the wantlist directly in the import or it can be done by saving the subset into a discrete file.

== Wantlist ==
A Wantlist is a simple enumeration of all the data elements you will place at leaf-elements in your XML Schema.  Wantlists do not contain any cardinality (number for repetitions) or complex branch structures.  They are much like the grocery list you take shopping in which the quantities of items are not specified.

[http://justicexml.gtri.gatech.edu/wantlist_1.xsd GTRI Wantlist XML Schema]

== Sample Wantlist ==

The following is a sample wantlist generated from the US [[w:NIEM|NIEM]] metadata shopping cart tool.  Not only is the three-part property specified (ObjectClass, Property, [[w:Representation Term|Representation Term]]) but the isReference indicators are also available.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;w:WantList xmlns:w=&quot;http://niem.gov/niem/wantlist/1&quot; w:release=&quot;2.0&quot; w:product=&quot;NIEM&quot;&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;LocationCityName&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;LocationCounty&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;LocationCountyCode&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;LocationPostalCode&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;LocationStateFIPS5-2AlphaCode&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;LocationStateName&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;LocationStateUSPostalServiceCode&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;StreetCategoryText&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;StreetExtensionText&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;StreetFullText&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;StreetName&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;StreetNumberText&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;StreetPostdirectionalText&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;w:Element w:prefix=&quot;nc&quot; w:name=&quot;StreetPredirectionalText&quot; w:isReference=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/w:WantList&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This wantlist can be saved from the web-shopping-cart tool to your local file system and then reloaded at a future date. In our example, any wantlist can be saved on the eXist server and passed as a parameter to a subset generator. This allows developers to reuse and version wantlists in addition to other XML Schema components.

== XQuery Based Subschema Generator ==

This XQuery takes as a single argument a wantlist file name stored in a wantlist collection.  It iterates through each element in the wantlist and generates the appropriate XML Schema types.

The format of the URL for the Query is:

[WEBSERVER]/db/wantlists/subset.xq?wantlist=WANTLISTNAME

In this case the .xml file extension can be omitted.


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
import module namespace mdr = &quot;http://mdr.example.com&quot; at &quot;/db/mdr/modules/mdr.xq&quot;;

declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/xml indent=yes&quot;;

let $wantlist := request:get-parameter('wantlist', '')
return

   then (

           &lt;message&gt;Error: &quot;wantlist&quot; is a required parameter.&lt;/message&gt;
        &lt;/results&gt;
    )
    else (

            &lt;/xsd:schema&gt;
)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Using an XML Schema to validate your XForms ==
Some XForms systems allow you to use an XML Schema to validate your form.  For example, with Orbeon forms you can do the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:model schema=&quot;MyTypeLibrary.xsd&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chapter 2. What is BitTorrent?==

BitTorrent is a protocol allowing you to download files quickly by allowing other people downloading the file to upload (distribute) parts of it at the same time. BitTorrent is often used for distribution of very large and freely available files, as it is a lot cheaper, faster, and more efficient to distribute files using BitTorrent than a regular download.

For more information on the BitTorrent protocol visit the web site (http://www.bittorrent.org/introduction.html).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chapter 3. How do I download files using BitTorrent?==

Just like visiting a URL (e.g. www.google.com) to a web site and downloading a file, you will need a &quot;.torrent file&quot; (often referred to as a &quot;torrent&quot;) to download content using BitTorrent. Most of the time, you will download torrent files from a web site, although you could also get the torrent from a friend or a CD. Many web sites offer torrents as an additional method of downloading files. For example, OpenOffice.org, a free office suite, can be downloaded using BitTorrent. Sites that offer torrent downloads are just repositories of torrents and usually do not actually create any of the content available. Once you have obtained the torrent file from wherever, you simply need to import it into your BitTorrent client. There are several ways of doing this with KTorrent.

===Opening a New Torrent===
There are several ways to open a torrent in KTorrent, depending on your computer's configuration. The following methods of opening a torrent file into KTorrent are listed— choose your preferred method.

*Double-click the torrent file on the desktop (only works if .torrent files are associated with KTorrent), or…
*Right-click the torrent file on the desktop, choose Open With, and select KTorrent in the list (if KTorrent is not listed, select Open with Other Application to locate where KTorrent is installed), or…
*In KTorrent, click File, then Open… (or press CTRL+O) and locate the torrent file, or…
*In KTorrent, click File, then Paste Torrent URL, paste the torrent URL into the text box and click OK.

===Importing a Torrent With Existing Data (a partial download)===

*In KTorrent, click File, then Import Torrent. Fill in the Torrent: text box with the location of torrent file and fill the Data: text box with the location of the existing downloaded data.
*Do it without the torrent importer and just open the torrent file in the folder of the partially downloaded data by any of the methods described in Opening a New Torrent. KTorrent will automatically recognize the existing downloaded data by file name and start rehashing the data to verify the data integrity.

White captures the pawn with the Queen. This move is not uncommon among amateur players. Black has the possibility of playing Nc6 at some stage and if so White could pin it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chapter 4. Configuring KTorrent==
So you have already read that KTorrent comes with plug-ins to enable or disable features.
You can find the KTorrent preferences dialog by clicking Settings-&gt; Configure KTorrent.

&lt;!-- add image --&gt;

==Downloads==
===Queue Manager===
Looking at the Downloads tab, you will find the section Queue Manager. Effectively, this section allows you to put a limit on the maximum number of active downloads or uploads when torrents are driven by the Queue Manager. The idea behind the Queue Manager is that it provides you a way to configure which torrent should start downloading (or uploading) after another torrent switches its status. Switching from a status can mean:
*a torrent (automatically) switches from downloading to seeding
*a torrent (automatically) switches from seeding to seeding completed
*an active torrent driven by queue manager gets stopped manually by user interaction
*an active torrent driven by queue manager gets removed from the queue manually to a user-driven state by the user

The Queue Manager always takes the torrent highest in queue when it starts another torrent. The queue manager is a nice tool to automatically start queued torrents, and while doing so, it gives you a method to dedicate your bandwidth on a few torrents. If you do not want to make use of the queue manager, you are free to disable it by setting the max uploads and max downloads to 0.

The queue manager threads two different torrents— torrents in user-driven state and torrents in queue manager driven state.

Every torrent in a user-driven state will be excluded by the restrictions of the Queue Manager, until the torrent is put back in queue manager state by the user. The benefit of user-driven torrents is that it is an easy way to go over the limit of maximum running torrents if you want.

While loading a torrent in KTorrent, it will start in the queue manager and be set to the lowest priority of torrents which are already in the queue.

If you manually stop the torrent, the torrent will get changed from queue-driven to user-driven and will be excluded from the max downloads/uploads limitation.

There are three ways of changing the state of a torrent:
* open the Queue Manager, select the torrent to change, and select Controlled by Queue Manager or Controlled by User
* right click a torrent and choose Enqueue/Dequeue
* select a torrent and click the queue icon in the tool bar 

There are also two possibilities to view whether a torrent is driven by Queue Manager or by the user:
* open the Queue Manager and look in the column, Controlled By
* clicking the icon Groups on the side panel to the left of the screen, and select the appropriate filter.

===Preferences===

The preferences section is where you can configure the main preferences of KTorrent.
====Maximum connections per torrent====

With max connections per torrent, you can set how many peers KTorrent will allow you to connect to per torrent.

Having too many established connections can make the response time on your internet connection a lot slower. For this reason, it is wise to have a limit for connections.

Normally, 45 to 65 maximum connections per torrent is enough for running a single torrent, though some people who have a fast connection can configure this higher (together with a higher number of upload slots and a higher upload speed). Note it is possible to have good results with setting the per torrent limit to a 25-35 range (this really depends on the overall speed and health of a swarm you are in).

In practice, you should see what works best for you. Do *NOT* assume high settings will automatically improve your download speeds. Speed is more dependent on the health of the swarm and your own upload behavior than the number of connections.

====Maximum connections global====

Global Connection Limit is a setting you can configure for the maximum number of peers KTorrent should connect to over all running torrents combined.

The same rules apply here as with the maximum number of connections per torrent above. Keep in mind that this setting ideally should be high enough for the amount of torrents you want to run, while still trying to avoid losing responsiveness of your internet connection or even worse— capping your own bandwidth.

====Maximum upload rate====

With Maximum Upload Rate, you can configure the maximum speed KTorrent should upload at. Generally, it is safe to set this somewhere at 85-90% of your upload ability. Depending on the quality of your internet connection, you can set this a little high, but if you set this too high, it might compromise your download speed.

Do not be confused if your configured maximum upload speed is not always reached. This is normal practice; when downloading with peer to peer technologies, the uploads and downloads always depend on the &quot;peer&quot;, or other user connected (e.g. Maybe the other peer is already downloading at full speed, there might not be any peers to upload to, or maybe there are &quot;leechers&quot; (those who already have all the files completed they requested).

====Maximum download rate====

With maximum download rate, you can configure KTorrent's maximum download speed. This can be useful if you want to use a web browser while running KTorrent, or maybe there are other users on your LAN who would like to claim some of the bandwidth too.

Just like with the upload speed, the download speed will depend on the other side and overall health in the swarm.

====Port====

You can configure which port KTorrent should use to listen for incoming connections from other peers in the swarm.

Normally, it is okay to leave the port number as it is. Some internet providers however, do not like traffic on known p2p ports, and have either blocked them or made the use of these ports less comfortable in other ways. Because of this, there are trackers that have banned known p2p ports and only allow you to use other ports. It is advisable to read the FAQ section of the tracker so you know whether you need to change the ports. Ports which are generally OK to use are numbers in the range 49152 to 65535. This range is also known as unregistered, dynamic, and/or private. There are no known programs registered to use these ports, so anyone should be able to use these ports freely without having to worry whether another program has already been assigned to it.

BitTorrent connections are established in one direction only. That is, peer A only tries to connect to peer B once, and if it fails in doing so, peer A must wait until peer B announces others may connect. 

Because of this mechanism of connecting in BitTorrent (not a flaw of the protocol!), there are two reasons why one should be connectable:

* If two peers want to do business with each other, but both do not accept outside connections, they will find themselves not being able to share any data at all.

* If peer A is accepting connections, loads a torrent, and tries to connect to a firewalled peer B, he/she would have to wait until peer B announces a free connection. Before data would be able to transfer, there would be time wasted. Of course, in that time you could potentially have had a re-transmission of data between the two.

It is advisable to forward your ports so others can connect easily. It improves the speed and health of a swarm.

====UDP tracker port====

The UDP tracker port is a port for the communication with trackers that support the UDP transmission protocol. Communicating with a tracker on the UDP protocol is more efficient, although the amount of trackers which support UDP is not that high. The torrent file should include an URL which looks like udp://tracker-url.com:port/announce, instead of the normal variant http://tracker-url.com:port/announce (used with TCP). The port for UDP trackers is the only port which does not need to be forwarded if you are located behind a router or software firewall.

====Number of upload slots====

You can set KTorrent to how many peers per torrent it requires to give away an upload slot. It is essential to not set this option too high or too low because if you, do your download speed will regress. Use the following two rules as a guide:

A. If you really can not upload a lot because of a bandwidth limitation, then try to keep the upload limit at least 12KB/s with at least 2KB/s per peer. This is recommended because you have to try and maintain a number of upload slots for other peers. The 2KB/s minimum is to lower the chance that another peer will choke you, and 12KB/s is to keep 6 peers happy.

B. If you have a larger upload bandwidth on your connection, it is generally good and logical to assign more speed per peer. This can improve the efficiency of the data flow in swarm, and it stimulates the peers you are uploading to to give something back (they will be more interested in you due to your higher upload speed).

In practice, example B would start with raising the maximum upload speed setting while keeping the amount of upload slots the same. Then if you think you are uploading too much per peer, you can raise this number a little (i.e. 5000Kb/s maximum upload speed for 6 upload slots in a large swarm would not stimulate the swarm to upload to you, whereas if you would have set it to 20 upload slots).

====Max share ratio====

Max share ratio is a setting which is automatically applied to each torrent file you open in KTorrent. It tells KTorrent to automatically stop a completed torrent when it has reached a certain configured share ratio. This setting is useful if you do not want to upload too much data for a particular reason. An example of this would include a data limitation on your internet connection or if you prefer to distribute your share ratio over all seeding torrents as quickly as possible.

You can also configure the share ratio of each torrent separately. This can be done from the status panel, to the right of where it says max ratio.

====Keep seeding after download is finished====

This setting is enabled by default. Normally, you would not want to disable this setting, since BitTorrent is a sharing protocol. It is important that peers who have completed all the data they have requested keep seeding to a certain level. This option can be changed and is useful if you have a very low data limit for your internet connection.

===Attention/forward port===

You should forward your ports if your computer is located behind a router or firewall. Some users might not need to configure anything to ensure their port for BitTorrent is accepting connections. This is because some do not have a software firewall enabled or are not located behind any router. 

How do I know whether my computer will accept BitTorrent connections?

Take a look at the log viewer panel and search for a message which says “Authentication(S) to 99.999.99.99 : ok”. If you can find one such message with the (S) behind authentication, peers are able to establish incoming connections. You can start downloading! If you can not find a single (S) in the log from the time you started the torrent and the first announce, you should forward your ports.

Port forwarding in a router can be done either by using NAT or the UPnP functionality inside the router. You can choose either, although UPnP might be easier if you are stationed in a LAN with dynamic IP address assignments. For the UPnP plug-in to work, you should first check your router documentation to check whether it is supported on your model. If it is supported, login to your router either by a web browser or by telnet and enable it before you load the UPnP plug-in of KTorrent. Check http://portforward.com and search for your router model if you do not know how to login to your router. This site tells you how to enable port forwarding from a router by using NAT as well, if you happen to choose the NAT method. Note that if you have chosen NAT and it is working correctly, you can disable the UPnP plug-in of KTorrent.

If you are unsure whether you are actually located behind a router, you can use the site http://whatismyip.com to find out and compare the IP address listed with your address from the output in the command ifconfig.

===Folders===
Here you can configure where KTorrent should store its files. These files can either be the torrent data you want to download, or the torrent settings and stats KTorrent keeps track of. Downloaded files and torrent profile files will have to be saved in their own folders.

The temporary folder is the folder where KTorrent stores a profile for each torrent which includes information such as the settings for file priority on a multi-file torrent, settings for which files you do not want to download, the torrent file for the torrent itself, and symlinks so that KTorrent knows where the data for a particular torrent should be saved.

The setting “automatically save downloads to” will effectively disable the dialog which requests you to choose a save location after you open a torrent.

===System tray icon===
The setting, show system tray icon, is for selecting whether you want to have an icon placed in the system tray while KTorrent is running. If you have enabled this option, it will change the function of the quit button from quitting program to only minimizing the window into the system tray. Clicking on the system tray icon will also display a menu to control some of KTorrent's settings. The system tray icon is useful for users who want quick access and control of torrents while using other programs.

The Show speed bar allows you to enable an additional bandwidth indicator on the system tray to easily monitor how fast your torrents are being uploaded and downloaded.

Show system tray pop-up messages is a useful option if you like passive messages to pop up when events such as a torrent getting completed, a torrent reaching its configured share ratio, or a chunk failing the hash test while  uploading occur.

===Custom IP===
You can configure KTorrent to send a fixed IP address or hostname to the tracker. This is useful if you use a proxy.

===DHT===
Use DHT to get additional peers to enable or disable DHT globally. While using DHT, you can:

* potentially find more peers for a torrent
* make use of DHT as a second method for collecting peers, especially if a tracker goes down
* run KTorrent with trackerless torrents 

KTorrent respects the private flag inside torrent files and will automatically exclude private torrents from using DHT.

NOTE:
DHT will increase the load on a router.  If you are finding that your Internet is bogging down, you can disable DHT to increase the Maximum number of Downloads and Seeds available.
The

===Encryption===

Encryption was introduced by the maintainers of two other BitTorrent clients after some ISPs decided to throttle their customers' internet connections. Throttling was introduced because some ISPs thought it would be a good idea if they could spare themselves costs generated by the use of the BitTorrent protocol. Encryption in BitTorrent was designed to obfuscate BitTorrent traffic so the detection of BitTorrent traffic, and therefore throttling of bandwidth, would fail. The encryption standard used in BitTorrent, RC4, is BY NO MEANS designed to make data secure. It was designed only to get around bandwidth throttling.

screen shot 

KTorrent is able to establish both unencrypted and encrypted connections.

Even if your ISP is not throttling your connection, you still may find enabling encryption helps some peers to send data with a proper download bandwidth. Other peers may use BitTorrent applications that do not support encryption, and you will not be able to connect to them. You will need to experiment with the encryption settings to see what works best with the torrent you are trying to download.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Advanced==
&lt;!--image--&gt;
===Performance===
You can configure some advanced options such as memory usage, interface refresh time, data verification options while uploading, and the type of service field for networking.

In the first row, the setting for memory assignment has options for low, medium, and high. These settings are profiles for how much RAM should be assigned for torrents as they download. It is generally safe to say most users with 512MB RAM will want to set this to medium or high, and users with more than 512MB RAM will want to set it to high. Higher memory usage will help when the chunk size of a torrent is 2MB and higher.

Interface refresh time is to configure how many milliseconds KTorrent should wait before it refreshes the statics display.

===Data Checking===

Data checking allows you to configure extra functionality which most other BitTorrent clients do not have. This functionality can be best described as an alternative to automated full rehashes on data when a download completes. It was introduced to KTorrent to allow the user to verify the data after a download completes, while trying to avoid the CPU intensive task a normal rehash on data takes. Basically, this feature will continuously verify every chunk a leecher requests on a torrent in uploading mode. Then if a chunk fails the hash verification test, it will be dropped and the torrent will revert to downloading mode to replace the corrupt data. It is recommended to use this feature, because it will continuously try to prevent uploading any bogus data into swarm.

The option Do a data integrity check after x corrupted chunks is an extra function on top of the normal data checking during upload mode. It is there if you want more aggressive prevention of uploading of bogus data.

===Networking===

I honestly don't know what to tell users about TOS guys, so this i will leave for you.

&quot;Maximum number of connection setups:&quot; identifies ??? and if set too high will bog down other traffic if your router can not handle the number of concurrent open connections it creates.  If you are having general performance issues, try setting this number to &quot;10.&quot;

The plug-in tab allows you to load or unload one or more KTorrent plug-ins. As you load or unload plug-ins, configuration tabs are added or removed in the preferences dialog. If memory is an issue on your computer, disabling unused plug-ins will free memory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scan Folder plug-in==
The scan folder plug-in can monitor one or more directories for new torrent files to automatically load. One can use this plug-in to monitor any storage location, as long as the user account running KTorrent has read and write permissions to the location where the torrent file is saved.

There are three additional options for the user to choose from— open torrents silently, delete after downloading, and move to loaded directory.

The option Open Torrents Silently will remove the dialog which would normally request you to choose which files you want to download for a multi-file torrent. This option is useful if you want to upload a torrent from another computer with SSH in one of the configured paths and have KTorrent immediately load it.

The option Delete After Downloading is useful if you want to clean up the .torrent files once KTorrent has loaded them. If you like clean directories, you will love this option.

The option Move To Loaded Directory is an alternative to the previous option, of removing the torrent file. It makes an extra folder “loaded” in the monitored path and moves the loaded .torrent file there.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==UPnP plug-in==
The UPnP tab is to forward ports from a router to your computer. Use this option if peers are unable to establish connections to you. 

If you do not have a router in use, you do not need to use this plug-in. If you use a router, you have the choice to use either NAT or UPnP. UPnP needs to be activated from inside your router before KTorrent's UPnP plug-in will work.

It is good to note that some users can not use UPnP because their router does not support it. If your router does not support UPnP, the only way for peers to connect to you is to use NAT. 

Users without a router in their network do not have to make use of a method to establish port forwarding. Check to make sure your software firewall allows connections to the ports you want BitTorrent to use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Search plug-in==
The search tab allows you to edit, remove, or add search engines to KTorrent. After you add your favorite torrent search engine, you can use the search panel (located to the left of the normal KTorrent interface) to search for torrents using your selected search engine. 

The external browser section allows you to configure which browser should be opened by default when you do a search and Open External web browser is set. Use default browser will use your computer's default web browser.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Web interface plug-in==
The configuration dialog for the web interface plug-in lets you configure if you want to be able to remotely control KTorrent or remotely monitor your download statics with a web browser.

The Port option allows you to configure which port KTorrent should listen to for incoming connections. You can use any port here as long as you know for sure no other program on your computer is (or will be) using it. As a safety precaution, use a port in the range 49152 to 65535. 

Forward Port will forward the configured port by using the UPnP plug-in. If your local network does not use a router, or if you only want to make use of the web interface from inside your LAN, you will not need to set the Forward Port.

Session TTL is for configuring how long one should be able to stay logged in while idle.

PHP executable path is where the binary file for PHP is located. If it is not automatically set after KTorrent is installed, launch Konsole or any other terminal program and use the command “which php” to find where the path to PHP is on your computer.

Fill in a Username and Password to allow access to the web interface only after proving your selected Username and Password.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chapter 7. Questions and Answers==


====What is this “port forwarding” I hear about, how do I enable it and why is it clever to use this?====
	

Port forwarding will allow other computers to request a connection from you.  In general it allows more connections as your machine is now able to both make and receive “phone calls.”  If possible you should enable it, unless your equipment (computer, router, etc.) is adversely affected by the extra open connections.


====What are the two most common mistakes by BitTorrent newbies?====
	

The two most common mistakes made by BitTorrent newbies are not forwarding ports and not seeding torrents. If you don't forward your ports and don't allow KTorrent full access on your software/hardware firewall (if you have enabled one), you will not get the most out of BitTorrent. You can get help on port forwarding at portforward.com, and some (slightly technical) information is available at Brian's BitTorrent FAQ and Guide. Seeding is when you leave your BitTorrent client open after your download has finished to help redistribute it (you share the file a little while downloading, but it is even more helpful if you continue to distribute the completed file). It is most likely that most of the data you downloaded was from other seeders, so help give back to the community! KTorrent will begin seeding your torrents once they are completely downloaded, and will continue until the torrent is removed (right click the torrent, then click Remove). Remember that while seeding, KTorrent is uploading using your internet connection, and if your internet service provider limits the amount you may upload, you might want to monitor how much data and for how long you seed your torrents.

====How can I check whether I have forwarded my ports correctly?====
	
Check in the log viewer for Authentication(S) messages. If you can spot a single message with (S), you know you can receive incoming connections.

====Can I use KTorrent to index and share a folder on my disk without creating a torrent file?====

No. KTorrent uses the BitTorrent protocol, which does not use a global network like Kazaa. Instead, BitTorrent uses a separate network for each torrent file. To share a file or folder, you will need to generate a torrent file for the files.

====Can I configure KTorrent to use a single port?====
	

Yes. You can use DHT (UDP) on the same port as the normal TCP traffic.

====Sometimes I see peers in my peer list with a low score. Are these bad leechers, and should I kick or ban them?====

No. KTorrent uses a scoring system to calculate which peers are most worth uploading to. Peers not interested in your data will get a lower score than others.

====Why is my download so slow?====

The most common reason is that the torrent source is not shared well enough (the swarm is unhealthy). Another reason could be that you are not uploading fast enough yourself.

====Why is there only a handful of peers in the swarm?====

Every torrent depends on other users who are downloading the same torrent. You might find a torrent which does not have a lot of peers yet. Just let the torrent run and most of the time, it will speed up after a while.

====I just added a torrent, but there aren't any seeders or leechers in the swarm. What is wrong?====

Check whether the torrent was taken offline by the tracker. Some trackers send a message for this, which you can find in the trackers tab.

====Why can't I configure KTorrent to announce every five minutes?====

This is against the BitTorrent protocol. Every client should use the announce time supplied by the tracker in the announce response.

====Some torrents have a longer announce interval. Is this a bug?====
	

No. KTorrent uses the announce interval given by tracker.

====My download speed is horrible! What can I do to improve this?====

Every torrent depends on how many peers are in its swarm and how well they are seeding. Make sure you are able to receive incoming connections so others will be able to share the file with you. Also ensure you are seeding well enough yourself. You can check whether the torrent has a good potential by looking at how many leechers and seeders have joined the swarm.

====I have generated a torrent file. What now? How do I share my data with a friend?====

You will first have to upload a torrent file to a BitTorrent tracker. The torrent file should contain a tracker URL for it to work correctly, and some (private) trackers have a separate URL for each registered account so they can keep track of your traffic. After that, your friend can download the torrent from the tracker.

====I have set the max connections to a few thousand, but no matter how many peers connect, the download is not any faster!====

Speed does not depend on how many connections are established, but rather on how well peers are sharing a file.

====Can I use KTorrent to send a file to my friend without having to share it with other peers?====

Yes. Use 127.0.0.1 as your tracker URL and send the torrent to your friend. After that, add your friend's IP manually by right clicking the torrent and choose Add Peers.

====I have configured NAT in my router to forward ports to my computer, but once in a while, peers are unable to connect to me. Can I fix this?====
	

Most routers assign IP addresses by using DHCP, and most of them do not lock the IP address. Your computer might be getting another IP address, because another computer in your LAN went online. In this case, your router is still forwarding to the old address, which would be another computer in your LAN! To fix the problem, try using UPnP and the UPnP plug-in if your router supports this, lock DHCP by using your MAC address, or use statically assigned IPs on your network.

====When I set my upload rate to a minimum, my download speed drops too. Why is this, and can it be fixed?====

BitTorrent, as a file sharing system, depends on users uploading data. When you do not upload enough data to the swarm, other peers will not be willing to share data with you, and your download speeds will drop. If you are able to upload at a faster rate with your internet connection, you should set the upload rate higher and make sure you seed your torrents after they finish downloading.

====I have set KTorrent to use 120 upload slots, but my download is only getting slower.====

If are not uploading enough, peers will simply ignore you even if you have enough slots. Check that you have set at least 2KB/s per slot to ensure peers will receive enough data.

====Can i download or seed a torrent from my usb stick with KTorrent?====
	

aa

====I want to seed data from my NTFS partition, is this possible?====
	

aa

====Why does the tracker tab sometimes tells me that I can not add another tracker to the torrent?====
	

aa

====I would like KTorrent to seed an existing torrent. How should i do this?====
	

aa

====Why does KTorrent not let me download to NTFS and FAT32 partitions?====
	

You need to disable diskspace pre-allocation for this to be possible.

====Why does KTorrent not let me use the zip file from bluetack in the ip filter plug-in?====
	

Kdebase-kio-plugins is required to extract the zip file, so check whether this is installed.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Denmark]] | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]]

'''Rugbrødslagkage''' (Danish for &quot;rye bread layered cake&quot;) is a cake with whipped cream and layers having grated rye bread. Layered cakes of this type are eaten at birthday parties in Denmark, but this recipe with rye bread is quite rare though.

==Ingredients==

* 125g dark rye bread without sunflower seeds etc.
* 6 eggs
* 250 g sugar
* 15 ml cacao powder
* 15 ml potato flour
* 5 ml baking powder
* butter for greasing baking paper
* 500 ml cream for whipping

==Procedure==
===Three days before serving ===
Leave a couple of slices of rye bread to dry outside of the fridge and without wrapping.

=== The day before serving ===

Grate the now-dry rye bread.

Turn on oven at 220C (for convection ovens: 200C).

Separate the eggs and beat the egg whites stiff.
In a separate bowl, whip the egg yolk with sugar, cacao, potato flour, baking powder and grated rye bread. Carefully mix in the beaten whites with a spoon.

Baking: 10 minutes at 220C. Apply 1 cm thickness, on ''buttered'' baking paper in a cake form. Only in case of convection oven, more layers can be baked above each other. The dough should be enough for 4 or 5 layers.

Let the layers cool.

Whip two thirds of the cream and distribute it between the layers. Only just before serving should the top and the side of the torte be covered with whipped cream. Leave the cake in the fridge. 

===Just before serving ===
Cover top and sides with whipped cream.

==Notes, tips and variations==

* Leaving the half-done cake in the fridge overnight improves the taste.
