==What is Computing==
Information processes

==Information and Data Representation==
Information is abstract but it is always conveyed (carried) by concrete things, such as sound waves, light wave (images, signs, sign languages, and motion pictures), and electromagnetic waves (radio and TV programs, cellular phone signals, and ...). After information is quantified/digitalized it can be processed. This process turns information into (data) representations that use symbols. 

Claude E. Shannon studied [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory information theory] and discovered that the fundamental unit of information is a yes or no answer to a question or one bit (two distinct state). To represent two states we only need two symbols. We are familiar with the decimal representation of numbers, which is base-ten using ten different symbols (0-9). To represent the same information (quantity) we could use only two symbols, which should be the simplest representation. This representation is call binary representation or base-two system. 

In a base-two (binary) system each digit a position represents a power of two.

A digital computer stores everything internally using binary representation (data) in its storage components. Each storage location has an address, which can be used to count the capacity of the storage. The longer the address the more location we can identify hence larger address space (storage). The following measurement units are used:

&lt;math&gt;K(killo)=2^{10}=1024 \approx 1,000&lt;/math&gt; one thousand

&lt;math&gt;M(mega)=2^{20}=K \times 1024 \approx 1,000,000&lt;/math&gt; one million

&lt;math&gt;G(giga)=2^{30}=M \times 1024 \approx 1,000,000,000&lt;/math&gt; one billion

&lt;math&gt;T(tera)=2^{40}=G \times 1024 \approx 1,000,000,000,000&lt;/math&gt; one trillion (one million million)

&lt;math&gt;P(peta)=2^{50}=T \times 1024 \approx 1,000,000,000,000,000&lt;/math&gt; one quadrillion (one million billion)

&lt;math&gt;E(exa)=2^{60}=P \times 1024 \approx 1,000,000,000,000,000,000&lt;/math&gt; quintillion (one billion billion)

==Algorithms and Programs==
==Recursion==
Recursion is a pattern that is self-similar - the whole consists of smaller parts that are structurally similar to the whole. For example, a tree consist of branches that look like smaller trees. Similarly, a directory tree of a file system on a computer and an ancestry tree genealogy exhibit a similar pattern. 

Self-similarity allows us to define concepts that exhibit such a pattern in a more concise and elegant way. A tree can be either a trunk with no branches or a trunk with a number of branches, each of which is a tree. This definition covers all possible tree structures. A factorial function in math is 1!=1 and for all n&gt;1 n! = n*(n-1)! This recursive definition not only defines factorial but also describes a way to calculate factorial. For example, 5! can be calculated from 4!, which is 4 times 3!, which is 3 time 2!, which is 2 times 1!, which is 1 by definition. 

If the problem we are solving is self-similar - solving the whole problem is a matter of solving the parts that are similar to the whole - the solution may be defined using recursion as well (sometimes the definition is the solution as in the factorial example). We practice wishful thinking - as we describe the solution to whole problem we use the solution being defined (wish it will be fully defined) to solve the subproblems. In computer programming, this is called recursive thinking/programming. To program recursively, we describe the solution to a problem as a function/procedure/block, in which we break the bigger problems into smaller ones and use function we defining to solve the smaller problems. If the problem is finite, eventually the smaller problems are so simple that they are directly solvable. In such cases the recursion stops. We call them base cases. By the time our program reaches all base cases, we would have solved the whole problem because all the subproblems are solved including the problem we start with. In any recursive function, two essential parts must exist: base cases and recursive cases. The recursive cases part breaks a bigger problem into smaller ones. The base cases stops the recursion by solving the directly solvable problems. If both parts exists and are structured properly, the algorithm (function) can solve problems of any size by asking clones of itself to solve partial problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Business data is a key asset for any organization.  The information contained within data plays a large role in the operations, reporting and measurement of how the organization is performing.  An information system provides the means to capture and share data, and to monitor business performance.  A sound data structure is universally required to ensure data integrity and to minimize future application maintenance costs.  Creating the ‘right’ data store for an information application involves data governance, understanding data flows, and developing a reliable foundation to ensure ongoing reliability, stability, and maximal effectiveness for the investment.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Business Data==
===Data Governance and Security===
The investments in information systems necessary to build new applications, modify existing applications, or to buy and migrate to COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) solutions can be very high for any organization.  In order to ensure that those investments result in maximum returns, controls may be implemented in the form of data governance and security.  These controls may exist within an organizational subdivision, across subdivisions, or across an entire organization.  Some controls are even global in nature, determined by international agreements and guided by generally accepted standards.

Data governance is concerned with who is responsible for the organizational data and how governance decisions and processes are executed.  One or more different approaches may be used in the governance of business data.  These include:
* Top-down – decisions are authoritative and affect the entire organization
* Bottom-up – decisions relating to data are established at low level (e.g., naming conventions)
* Center-out – typically involves a consultant hired to consider governance needs from all stakeholders and make organization-wide recommendation (results in Top-down for approved decisions)
* Silo-in - multiple groups set governance standards based on collective agreement &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datagovernance.com/gbg_governance_models.html|title=Choosing Governance Models|publisher= Data Governance Institute|author=Thomas, Gwen|accessdate=02/05/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Goals of data governance include ensuring the quality and security of business data, conformance of the data to organizational standards, overarching data rules and definitions, and the assurance that the data will be trustable.
&lt;br /&gt;

===Business Ownership===
When creating a new information system, the application is generally sponsored by one or more business program areas or departments.  Organizational data governance requires the identification of those who will ‘own’ the data.  These owners will be responsible for oversight, coordination with the organization’s Governance Board, conformance with adopted standards and law, and securing the data access rights.  An ‘Owner’ may be responsible for data within the domain of the application, or the responsibility may be spread out between multiple owners across a group of integrated applications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.datagovernance.com/gbg_assigning_data_ownership.html|title=Assigning Data Ownership|author=Thomas, Gwen|publisher=Data Governance Institute|accessdate=02/05/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Regardless of how the owner (or owners) of the data is determined within an organization, the approvals for project data requirements will come from within this ownership role.
&lt;br /&gt;

===Eliminate Redundancy===
Data redundancy is caused when the same information is captured multiple times within the same or multiple data store(s). Most information systems today are supported by data stores built on the relational schema originally designed by Edgar Codd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/builders/builders_codd.html|title=Edgar F. Codd|publisher=IBM Research News|year=2003|accessdate=02/12/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This type of schema minimizes redundancy and ensures data integrity.  Data redundancy means that there are multiple instances of the same information captured within the same or multiple integrated data store(s).  Issues relating to data redundancy revolve around conflicts between these multiple instances of the data and lead to higher operational costs associated with the data.  These costs include those associated with data entry, retrieval and maintenance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eai.ittoolbox.com/groups/vendor-selection/eai-select/estimating-the-cost-of-data-redundancy-10000|title=Estimating the Costs of Data Redundancy?|year=2001|author=Streiff, John|accessdate=02/12/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Proper data definition ensures that any redundancy is identified and can be corrected or mitigated before the system is actually designed, lowering the associated development and ongoing maintenance costs .

&lt;br /&gt;

==Data Documentation==
Documentation of application data is critical to ensure a common understanding of the information contained within the data and to assure the reliability of that information.  Business Analysts are often responsible for creating data documentation for information system projects and the alignment of this documentation with governance processes and rules.  Documentation artifacts will span the entire SDLC from Initiation through Implementation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Data Flow Diagrams===
[[File:YD Workers Comp DFD.png|thumb|NYS Worker's Comp Claiming]]
Tracing the flow of data through an application includes identifying the sources, transformations and destinations of the data that will be supported.  The destinations include both the data stores and the downstream processes that use the data.  Data sources may be shared within and across the organization or may involve external entities.  They include data entry, existing databases, computer files, and data streams from external applications.  Once the sources are determined, the processes that must occur to transform or manipulate the data are defined.  These processes include the conversion of data from the source format to the destination format. The destinations include databases, files, reports and external applications that receive the output from the transformation processes. A Data Flow Diagram captures this information for verification and design purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are many tutorials available on the Internet to refer to for the creation of a data flow diagram.  Generally, consistency in rendering the data input(s), processing and data output(s) will accomplish the goals of defining data flows in a manner that is easily understood by those who will review and verify the diagram contents.  An example of a Data Flow diagram using the Yourdon/DeMarco notation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdon.com/PDF/oldJESA/SAch9.pdf|title=Just Enough Structured Analysis, Chapter 9|author=Yourdon, E.|year=2006|accessdate=02/05/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is included in the image at right.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

===Data Definitions===
[[File:DataDictionary.PNG|thumb|Data Dictionary with field descriptions]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The most common format used to capture the definition of data elements is the Data Dictionary.  This artifact is critical for purposes of data governance and for ensuring that all stakeholders share a common understanding of what the data is.  Typical information that is contained in the data dictionary includes identification of where the data resides (information system, relational table), the exact database field or data element, what the data element represents and the format of the element.  The image at right provides an example of what a data dictionary may look like.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===Common Data Matrix===

[[File:Common Data Matrix.png|thumb|Common Data Matrix - D = Define; P = Provide; U=Use]]
A Common Data Matrix is used during the Requirements Gathering phase of a project when there is at least some level of data integration required involving multiple applications, and /or some degree of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Data_Management MDM], and /or some form of organizational data governance.  It is a form of a data dictionary that encompasses the scope of the governance domain.  To construct this type of matrix, data elements are listed for the scope domain, with information about that data in relation to the organizational units, or applications, that interact with that data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdan.com/view-articles/4042|title=The Data Stewardship Approach to Data Management|author=Seiner, Robert S.|year=2006|publisher=The Data Administration Newsletter - TDan.com|accessdate=02/05/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  This type of diagram should be constructed to include information applicable to the problem under consideration (see image at right). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Consider an information system that uses external data elements from other organizational (internal) applications.  The definitions, meanings and formats of these elements become critical for integration. Within a high governance maturity level organization, a customer first name (for example) would have the same data element definition and format across the organization. In reality, most organizations have not fully conformed all data definitions across the entire organization; data elements for integration projects should be summarized using a Common Data Matrix when determining project requirements for the integration effort.   In such an instance, the information included within the matrix (the matrix cells) might contain data element formatting information to identify any transformation(s) that may be needed for integrating the data with the project information.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

===Modeling Data Requirements===
For purposes of establishing a new application and for application enhancements, modeling the data at a high level provides guidance in the design efforts.  Typically, Business Analysts are not involved in the actual development of an application, but the requirements associated with a project will determine what is needed to support the project deliverables.  This information is captured in data models, expressed at varying levels of detail.&lt;br /&gt;

====Conceptual Model====
A conceptual data model provides an illustration of business rules in relation to the data entities, including organizations, things, and/or applications, that must be captured within an application and the relationships needed between those elements to support operations.  It provides an outline of the data interactions between those entities included within the scope of a project, illustrating the context for the data flows that need to occur. This type of model is very high-level, providing justifications for the design of the data store for an application, and does not include any specific entity attributes.  The model is independent of whatever technology is used to implement the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Software Requirements Memory Jogger, 1st edition|last= Gottesdiener|first= Ellen|year= 2005|publisher= GOAL/APC|page= 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

==&lt;span id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;4. Restrictions==
The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;4.a&quot;&gt;You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;4.b&quot;&gt;You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the &quot;Applicable License&quot;), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;4.c&quot;&gt;If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;4.d&quot;&gt;Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==&lt;span id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer==

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

==&lt;span id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;6. Limitation on Liability==
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

==&lt;span id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;7. Termination==

&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;7.a&quot;&gt;This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;7.b&quot;&gt;Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==&lt;span id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;8. Miscellaneous==

&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;8.a&quot;&gt;Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;8.b&quot;&gt;Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;8.c&quot;&gt;If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;8.d&quot;&gt;No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;8.e&quot;&gt;This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;8.f&quot;&gt;The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

=GNU Free Documentation License=

==0. PREAMBLE==

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

==1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS==

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The &quot;publisher&quot; means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.

A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

==2. VERBATIM COPYING==

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

==3. COPYING IN QUANTITY==

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

==4. MODIFICATIONS==

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

&lt;ol type=&quot;A&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include an unaltered copy of this License.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

==5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS==

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.

==6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS==

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

==7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS==

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

==8. TRANSLATION==

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

==9. TERMINATION==

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

==10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE==

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

==11. RELICENSING==

&quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&quot; (or &quot;MMC Site&quot;) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A &quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&quot; (or &quot;MMC&quot;) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

&quot;CC-BY-SA&quot; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.

&quot;Incorporate&quot; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is &quot;eligible for relicensing&quot; if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
= How to use this License for your documents =

== A ==

&lt;u&gt;Activity diagram&lt;/u&gt;
A type of flowchart, part of the UML standard, that depicts activities, their sequence, and the flow of control.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Analysis paralysis&lt;/u&gt;
An informal phrase applied to when the opportunity cost of decision analysis exceeds the benefits. In software development, analysis paralysis manifests itself through exceedingly long phases of project planning, requirements gathering, program design and modeling, with little or no extra value created by those steps.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Artifact&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;As-is modeling&lt;/u&gt;
Refers to gathering information about the current state of the business area being analyzed; e.g., current processes and data.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Assumptions and Constraints&lt;/u&gt;
Assumptions and constraints identify aspects of the problem domain that are not functional requirements of a solution, and will limit or impact the design of the solution.&lt;br /&gt;



== B ==

Business Analysis Requirements Document&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Business analysis&lt;/u&gt;
Business analysis is the set of tasks, knowledge, and techniques required to identify business needs and determine solutions to business problems. Solutions often include a systems development component, but may also consist of process improvement or organizational change.&lt;br /&gt;



&lt;u&gt;Business analyst&lt;/u&gt;
A business analyst works as a liaison among stakeholders in order to elicit, analyze, communicate and validate requirements for changes to business processes, policies and information systems. The business analyst understands business problems and opportunities in the context of the requirements and recommends solutions that enable the organization to achieve its goals.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Business area&lt;/u&gt;
A naturally cohesive group of activities that share data and may cross organizational boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Business case&lt;/u&gt;
The first document completed during project initiation; it contains the analysis and results of business assessments providing the justification to pursue a project opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Business process improvement&lt;/u&gt;
Analyzing a business process to increase its efficiency and effectiveness; identifying and eliminating causes of poor quality, process variation, and non-value-added activities.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Business requirements&lt;/u&gt;
Higher-level statements of the goals, objectives, or needs of the enterprise. They describe such things as the reason a project was initiated and the things the project will achieve.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Business requirements document&lt;/u&gt;
The document or artifact that captures gathered requirements and serves to communicate them.&lt;br /&gt;

== C ==

&lt;u&gt;Candidate solution&lt;/u&gt;
A suggestion that might be a good thing to do.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Context diagram&lt;/u&gt;
Represents the entire system as if it were a single process; often used to determine a system boundary or solution scope with stakeholders or SME’s.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Customer&lt;/u&gt;
The business units at all levels of the organization that identified the need for the product or service the project will develop.&lt;br /&gt;



== D ==

&lt;u&gt;Data flow diagram&lt;/u&gt;
Graphical representation of the flow of data through a manual or automated information system which Illustrates the processes, data stores, and external entities in a business or other system and the connecting data flows.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Data model&lt;/u&gt;
A model showing data requirements of a business area. An Entity Relationship Diagram is a common type of data model.&lt;br /&gt;







== E ==

&lt;u&gt;Elicit&lt;/u&gt;
The process of drawing requirements from stakeholders and SME’s.&lt;br /&gt;



== F ==

&lt;u&gt;Features&lt;/u&gt;
A service a solution provides to meet a need. Typically high-level abstractions of solution that will turn into functional or non-functional requirements. They allow for early prioritization and scope management, and for getting a high-level sense of the stakeholders view of the solution.  &lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Functional requirements&lt;/u&gt;

What the systems/products are, do, or provide from the customer’s point of view.&lt;br /&gt;



- G -


- H -


- I-


== J == 

&lt;u&gt;JAD&lt;/u&gt;
Joint application development&lt;br /&gt;



- K - 


- L -


- M - 


== N == 

&lt;u&gt;Non-functional requirements&lt;/u&gt;
Requirements that do not directly relate to the behavior or functionality of the solution, but rather describe environmental conditions under which the solution must remain effective or qualities that the systems must have.&lt;br /&gt;



== O ==

&lt;u&gt;Object-oriented modeling&lt;/u&gt;
An approach to business or software engineering in which components are made up of encapsulated groups of data and functions which can inherit behavior and attributes from other components, and whose components communicate via messages to one another.&lt;br /&gt;


== P ==

&lt;u&gt;Pains and pleasures&lt;/u&gt;
Pain – something that is currently causing frustration, lack of productivity, poor quality, etc. Pleasure – something that is currently working well. It would be good to continue it.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Product scope&lt;/u&gt;
The functions or features that characterize a product or service.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Project scope&lt;/u&gt;
The work that must be done to deliver a product with the specified features and functions.&lt;br /&gt;



== Q ==

&lt;u&gt;QA&lt;/u&gt;
Quality assurance&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;QC&lt;/u&gt;
Quality control&lt;br /&gt;



== R ==

&lt;u&gt;Requirements&lt;/u&gt;
Conditions or capabilities needed by a stakeholder to solve a problem or achieve an objective.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;RFP&lt;/u&gt;
Request for proposal&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;RFQ&lt;/u&gt;
Request for quotations&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Requirements work plan&lt;/u&gt;

== S == 

&lt;u&gt;Schedule&lt;/u&gt;
Planned dates for performing activities and for meeting deliverables.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Scope Creep&lt;/u&gt;
Gradual addition of new requirements to the original product specifications.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;SDLC&lt;/u&gt;
System development life cycle &lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Subject matter expert (SME)&lt;/u&gt;
A person expert in the particular business area being analyzed. SME’s are often the primary source of requirements for a business analyst.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Solution&lt;/u&gt;
Something that fills a business need. Solutions do not always involve automation; they could involve streamlining a business process, etc.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Statement of work&lt;/u&gt;
A narrative description of products or services to be supplied under contract.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Stakeholder&lt;/u&gt;
Individuals and organizations that are involved in, or may be affected by, project activities.&lt;br /&gt;



== T ==

&lt;u&gt;To-be modeling&lt;/u&gt;
Refers to analyzing and documenting the potential future state of the business area being analyzed; processes, data, activities, how the activities would be accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Traceability&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;User acceptance testing&lt;/u&gt;
User Acceptance Testing is typically the final phase in a software development process in which the software is given to the intended audience to be tested for functionality. UAT is also called beta testing, end-user testing or application testing.&lt;br /&gt;





== V == 

&lt;u&gt;Validate&lt;/u&gt;
Reviewing requirements to ensure they are correct.&lt;br /&gt;



== W == 

&lt;u&gt;WBS&lt;/u&gt;
Work breakdown structure&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Workflow model&lt;/u&gt;
Describes the tasks, decisions, inputs and outputs, people and tools involved in a specific process.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is an Operating System==

==The Unix Shell==
The Unix shell is a command interpreter program that serves as the primary interface between uses and the OS in a command line environment, e.g. a terminal or terminal simulator. A shell is an essential (often preferred) tool, but it is just a ordinary user program that uses system calls to get most of the work done - so its just a &quot;shell&quot;. 
  
===Functions of a Shell===
A shell presents its users a command prompt (e.g. $), waits for a command, and executes the command.  executes user commands 
The primary duty of a shell 
===Creating a Shell===

The overall structure of a shell can be:

  repeat forever
    read one line 
    parse the command into a list of arguments
    if the line starts with a command name (e.g. cd and exit)
    then 
      perform the function (if it's exit, break out of the loop)
    else (it invokes a program, e.g. ls and cat) 
      execute the program 

To read a command we read one line at a time and tokenize the line into tokens. 

To execute a program the following needs to take place:
Use fork() system call to duplicate the current process:

====use fork() to clone a process====
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* modified from fork.c in Advanced Linux Programming (page 49) */
/* http://www.makelinux.net/alp/024 */

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main(){
  pid_t child_pid;
  
  printf(&quot;the main program process ID is %d\n&quot;, (int) getpid());

  child_pid = fork();
  if(child_pid != 0){
    printf(&quot;this is the parent process, with id %d\n&quot;, (int)getpid());
    printf(&quot;child_pid=%d\n&quot;, child_pid);
  }else{
    printf(&quot;this is the child  process, with id %d\n&quot;, (int)getpid());
    printf(&quot;child_pid=%d\n&quot;, child_pid);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This example shows how to create a new process by forking the current process. Note that the fork() function call (system call) is invoked '''once''' but return '''twice''' because when the call finishes there are two processes executing the same code.

====use execvp() to run a new program in the background====
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* from Advanced Linux Programming (page 51) */
/* http://www.makelinux.net/alp/024 */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; 
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; 

/* Spawn a child process running a new program. PROGRAM is the name 
   of the program to run; the path will be searched for this program. 
   ARG_LIST is a NULL-terminated list of character strings to be 
   passed as the program's argument list. Returns  the process ID of 
   the spawned process.  */ 

int spawn (char* program, char** arg_list) {
  pid_t child_pid; 

  /* Duplicate this process. */ 
  child_pid = fork (); 

  if (child_pid != 0){
    /* This is the parent process. */ 
    return child_pid; 
  }else {
    /* Now execute PROGRAM, searching for it in the path.  */ 
    execvp (program,  arg_list); 
    /* The execvp  function returns only if an error occurs.  */ 
    fprintf (stderr,  &quot;an error occurred in execvp\n&quot;); 
    abort (); 
  } 
} 

int main () {
  /*  The argument list to pass to the &quot;ls&quot; command.  */ 
  char* arg_list[] = {
    &quot;ls&quot;,     /* argv[0], the name of the program.  */ 
    &quot;-l&quot;, 
    &quot;/&quot;, 
    NULL      /* The argument list must end with a NULL.  */ 
  }; 

  /* Spawn a child process running the &quot;ls&quot; command. Ignore the 
     returned child process ID.  */ 
  spawn (&quot;ls&quot;, arg_list); 
  printf (&quot;done with main program\n&quot;); 
  return 0; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

====use execvp() to run a new program in the foreground====
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* from Advanced Linux Programming (page 51) */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; 

/* Spawn a child process running a new program. PROGRAM is the name 
   of the program to run; the path will be searched for this program. 
   ARG_LIST is a NULL-terminated list of character strings to be 
   passed as the program's argument list. Returns  the process ID of 
   the spawned process.  */ 

int spawn (char* program, char** arg_list) {
  pid_t child_pid; 

  /* Duplicate this process. */ 
  child_pid = fork (); 

  if (child_pid != 0){
    /* This is the parent process. */ 
    return child_pid; 
  }else {
    /* Now execute PROGRAM, searching for it in the path.  */ 
    execvp (program,  arg_list); 
    /* The execvp  function returns only if an error occurs.  */ 
    fprintf (stderr,  &quot;an error occurred in execvp\n&quot;); 
    abort (); 
  } 
} 

int main () {
  /*  The argument list to pass to the &quot;ls&quot; command.  */ 
  char* arg_list[] = {
    &quot;ls&quot;,     /* argv[0], the name of the program.  */ 
    &quot;-l&quot;, 
    &quot;/&quot;, 
    NULL      /* The argument list must end with a NULL.  */ 
  }; 

  /* Spawn a child process running the &quot;ls&quot; command. Ignore the 
     returned child process ID.  */ 
  pid_t pid = spawn (&quot;ls&quot;, arg_list); 

  /* Wait for the child process to complete.  */ 
  int child_status;
  waitpid (pid, &amp;child_status, 0); 
  
  if (WIFEXITED (child_status)){
    printf (&quot;the child process exited normally, with exit code %d\n&quot;, 
	     WEXITSTATUS (child_status)); 
  }else{ 
    printf (&quot;the child process exited abnormally\n&quot;); 
  }
  
  return  0; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the argument list must contain the program name as the first argument and '''MUST''' end with a NULL, which indicates the end of the list. Otherwise, execvp() won't function correctly.
====use dup2() to redirect standard output====
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
 
int main(){
  int overwrite = 0;
  int fd;
  if(overwrite){
    printf(&quot;open test.txt to overwrite.\n&quot;);
    fd =  open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, S_IRWXU);
  }else{
    printf(&quot;open test.txt to append.\n&quot;);
    fd =  open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, O_WRONLY | O_APPEND | O_CREAT, S_IRWXU);
  }
  dup2 (fd, STDOUT_FILENO);
  printf(&quot;hello world!&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This example opens a file (&quot;test.txt&quot;) for write and makes the standard synonymous to the open file - bytes sent to the standard output will go to the file. The &quot;O_WRONLY | O_CREAT&quot; flags cause the file to be opened for write and the file to be created if it doesn't already exist.

Information about each open file is recorded in a table managed by the OS. Each entry corresponds to an open file and the index of each entry is an integer (file descriptor), which is returned to the process opening the file as the return value of the open() system call. The entries for standard input, standard output, and standard error are reserved with predefined indices: STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and STDERR_FILENO (defined in &lt;unistd.h&gt;). The dup2(index1, index2) function will copy the entry content at index1 to the entry at index2, which make the file descriptor index2 synonymous to the file descriptor index1.
====redirect standard output in a child process====
The &quot;dup2 (fd, STDOUT_FILENO)&quot; line (in the previous example) redirects the standard output of the current (main) process to the open file. If you want to redirect the standard output of a child process to a file, you will need to wait till the child process is created - after the fork() function call. The following example demonstrate the idea. You will see that the &quot;hello&quot; message from the parent process still goes to the standard output, but the standard output from the child process gets redirected to the file.
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

int main () {
  /*  The argument list to pass to the &quot;ls&quot; command.  */ 
  char* arg_list[] = {
    &quot;ls&quot;,     /* argv[0], the name of the program.  */ 
    &quot;-l&quot;, 
    &quot;/&quot;, 
    NULL      /* The argument list must end with a NULL.  */ 
  }; 

  /* Spawn a child process running the &quot;ls&quot; command. */
  pid_t child_pid = fork (); 

  if (child_pid == 0){
    /* This is the child process. */ 
    char * filename = &quot;test.txt&quot;;
    int outfile = open(filename, O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, S_IRWXU);
    if (outfile == -1){
      fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: failed to create file %s\n&quot;, filename);
    }else{
      /* redirect the standard output from this process to the file. */
      if(dup2(outfile, STDOUT_FILENO) != STDOUT_FILENO){
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: failed to redirect standard output\n&quot;);
      }

      /* Now execute PROGRAM, searching for it in the path.  */ 
      execvp (arg_list[0],  arg_list); 
      /* The execvp  function returns only if an error occurs.  */ 
      fprintf (stderr,  &quot;an error occurred in execvp\n&quot;); 
      abort (); 
    }
  }
  /* only the parent process executes the following code. */
  fprintf(stdout, &quot;Hello from the parent process.\n&quot;);

  /* Wait for the child process to complete.  */ 
  int child_status;
  waitpid (child_pid, &amp;child_status, 0); 
  
  if (WIFEXITED (child_status)){
    printf (&quot;the child process exited normally, with exit code %d\n&quot;, 
	     WEXITSTATUS (child_status)); 
  }else{ 
    printf (&quot;the child process exited abnormally\n&quot;); 
  }
  
  return  0; 
}

====An example pipe connecting two commands====
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; 
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; 
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; 

int run_command(char** arg_list, int rd, int wd) {
  pid_t child_pid; 

  /* Duplicate this process. */ 
  child_pid = fork(); 

  if (child_pid != 0){
    /* This is the parent process. */ 
    return child_pid; 
  }else {
    if (rd != STDIN_FILENO){
      if(dup2(rd, STDIN_FILENO) != STDIN_FILENO){
	fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: failed to redirect standard input\n&quot;);
        return -1;
      }
    }

    if (wd != STDOUT_FILENO){
      printf(&quot;redirect stdout to %d.&quot;, wd);
      if(dup2(wd, STDOUT_FILENO) != STDOUT_FILENO){
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: failed to redirect standard output\n&quot;);
        return -1;
      }
    }
    /* Now execute PROGRAM, searching for it in the path.  */ 
    execvp (arg_list[0], arg_list); 
    /* The execvp  function returns only if an error occurs.  */ 
    fprintf (stderr,  &quot;an error occurred in execvp\n&quot;); 
    abort (); 
  } 
} 

int main () {
  /*  The argument list to pass to the &quot;ls&quot; command.  */ 
  char* arg_list[] = {
    &quot;ls&quot;,     /* argv[0], the name of the program.  */ 
    &quot;-l&quot;, 
    &quot;|&quot;,      /* the pipe symbol is at index 2 */
    &quot;wc&quot;,
    &quot;-l&quot;, 
    NULL      /* The argument list must end with a NULL.  */ 
  }; 
 
  int pipe_index = 2;
  int rd = STDIN_FILENO;
  int wd = STDOUT_FILENO;
  int fds[2];
  if (pipe(fds) != 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: unable to pipe command '%s'\n&quot;, arg_list1[0]);
    return -1;
  }
  
  wd = fds[1]; /*file descriptor for the write end of the pipe*/

  // delete the pipe symbol and insert a null to terminate the
  // first command's argument list
  args[pipe_index] = NULL;

  // run first command: read from STDIN and write to the pipe
  run_command(arg_list, rd, wd);
  close(fds[1]);

  rd = fds[0];
  wd = STDOUT_FILENO;

  // run the second command: read from the pipe and write to STDOUT
  // the argument for this command starts at pipe_index+1
  run_command(arg_list+pipe_index+1, rd, wd);

  fprintf (stderr, &quot;done with main program\n&quot;); 
  return 0; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example, the original list of arguments is broken into two list at the pipe symbol, which is replaced by a null value. This allows us to use the two argument lists to run the two separate commands/programs connected by the pipe.

A process is a program in execution. It is a metaphor for a entity managed by the OS. A process has its own address space and other information in OS managed data structures.

===Input and Output===

[[File:Von Neumann architecture.svg|thumb|center|alt=The Von Neumann Architecture.|The Von Neumann Architecture Scheme]]

==File System==
===File System Concepts=== 
file abstraction - a byte stream, meaning is imposed by file system users
file system users - end users (humans) and direct users (programs, e.g. an application or the shell)
user perspective - a collection of system calls, such as creat, open, close, seek, delete ...
file attributes - meta data: owner, size, timestamps ...
directory abstraction - a list of files and directory, map the name of a file/directory onto the information needed to locate the data. 
absolute path and relative path
directory operations - create, delete, open, close, rename, link, unlink

===File System Implementations===
layout: partition, boot block, superblock,...
disk block allocation:
  contiguous allocation
  linked list allocation: the first word in each block is used as a pointer to the next one.
  file allocation table: linked list allocation using a table in memory. 
  i-node (index-node): an i-node is in memory when the corresponding file is open. With a i-node design we can calculate the largest possible file size.
directory implementation: i-node, long file names
file sharing: symbolic v.s. hard link
disk block size: tradeoff and compromise, wasting disk space v.s. performance (data rate)
keeping track of free blocks: linked list v.s. bitmap
system backup: 
caching:
steps in looking up a file under a path

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Strategic vs. Tactical vs. Operational ==
The term strategic is often used interchangeably with tactical, which can lead to lack of clarity.  Essentially, '''strategic''' is what you are planning to achieve and '''tactical''' is more of how you will achieve it.  Examples of these two terms are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Strategy #1&lt;/u&gt;: Improve retention of key staff by 5%&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Tactic #1&lt;/u&gt;: Create opportunities for key staff that appeal to them—allow time for R&amp;D, implement their ideas, and allow them to participate on cross enterprise initiatives. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Strategy #2&lt;/u&gt;: Reduce maintenance costs by 10%&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Tactic #2&lt;/u&gt;: Work towards eliminating legacy systems with high maintenance, seek to automate routine maintenance tasks, and establish controls to ensure work performed is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;

The term operational refers to day to day efforts to run the business.  Once strategies and tactics are incorporated and achieved, they become how the business or organization operates.&lt;br /&gt;

==Strategic Planning Components==
Traditional strategic plans contain a variety of core elements to help the organization achieve success.  Each of these serves a critical role in the overall plan development.  At a macro level, they include:&lt;br /&gt;

# Mission and Vision
# Values and Behaviors
# SWOT Analysis and Environmental Scans
# Goals and Objectives
# Measures
# Strategic Projects

Each of these elements is detailed below and includes actual governmental examples.&lt;br /&gt;

===Mission and Vision===
The mission of an organization serves as a foundation of the organization and conveys what the organization does, who it serves and often describes what its primary purpose is.  Noted examples found on the internet include:&lt;br /&gt;

* ''NYS Department of Health'': We protect, improve and promote the health, productivity and well being of all New Yorkers.

* ''The Office of Children and Family Services'' serves New York's public by promoting the safety, permanency and well-being of our children, families and communities. We will achieve results by setting and enforcing policies, building partnerships, and funding and providing quality services.
* It is the mission of the ''New York State Department of Transportation'' to ensure our customers - those who live, work and travel in New York State -- have a safe, efficient, balanced and environmentally sound transportation system.&lt;br /&gt;

The vision is a statement which describes an organization’s mental picture of success and where it is striving to be in 3-7 years.  Without knowing where you are headed—then any path will do—but you may end up in circles along the way!  A vision of what the future you are striving for can often help guide staff in the absence of specific directions.  &lt;br /&gt;


Sample Vision Statements include:&lt;br /&gt;

* The ''New York State Archives'' provides unparalleled services that build, maintain, and provide access to New York's records to sustain a free, open, and democratic society and to support the cultural and intellectual life of all New Yorkers. We relentlessly pursue excellence in all our endeavors .
* ''New York State Police'' Vision: To build on our tradition of service.
* ''NYS Department of Health'' Vision: New Yorkers will be the healthiest people in the world - living in communities that promote health, protected from health threats, and having access to quality, evidence-based, cost-effective health services.&lt;br /&gt;

===Values and Behaviors===
One softer side of the strategic planning process is identification of values and behaviors that are critical to organization success.  Research has shown that values typically influence behaviors, which in turn can drive results—particularly if the organizations culture and policies are aligned to support and recognize them.  Organizations that adopt a standard set of values or behaviors need to ensure that the leadership of the organization demonstrates and role models what is acceptable.  Clearly the values will be dependent on the type of organization.  For example, an audit agency would likely value accuracy, credibility and integrity over innovative, customer service or respect for the individual, but perhaps an IT organization would value dependability, excellence, state-of-the–art and reliability.  These values are often incorporated into mission statements or code of conducts.&lt;br /&gt;


Government examples in this area include:&lt;br /&gt;

''Department of Motor Vehicle'' Operating Principles:
* We work with each other and our customers in an ethical, honest and respectful manner
* We protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information in our care
* We encourage the open exchange of ideas and perspectives and provide opportunities throughout the agency to suggest improvements&lt;br /&gt;

''Department of Health'' Values: Dedication to the public good, Innovation, Excellence, Integrity, Teamwork, Efficiency&lt;br /&gt;

''New York State Troopers'' Value:
	
* Integrity: To live and work in accordance with high ethical standards.
* Respect: To treat people fairly while safeguarding their rights.
* Customer Service: To ensure that everyone we meet receives dedicated and conscientious service.
* Continuous Improvement and Learning: To constantly improve ourselves and our organization.
* Leadership: To inspire, influence and support others in our organization and communities.&lt;br /&gt;

===Enterprise Analysis=== 

Enterprise Analysis, as described in the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge v2 is to “''assess the capabilities of the enterprise in order to understand the change needed to meet business needs and achieve strategic goals''.”  &lt;br /&gt;

There are a variety of techniques that can be done to analyze the enterprise at a strategic level, and we will profile three of the most common ones here: environmental scan, SWOT analysis, and a customer and product/service matrix.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;''Environmental Scan:''&lt;/u&gt;
Prior to embarking on the development of goals and strategies, it if often valuable to conduct an environmental scan to see which, if any, appear to be influencing the organization more than others.  By looking at the components of each factor and ranking them in order of importance, an organization can try to be more tactical in developing strategies to help achieve their goals.
* '''Customers/Constituents''':  Who are the people that are receiving goods and services from your organization?  What are their requirements, how do they interface with you, what are their demographics?
* '''Economy''': How is the current economy influencing your organization?  What is the impact of inflation, unemployment, interest rates, credit availability and local taxes on the organization?
* '''Human Resource'''s: How are we doing as an organization attracting ans retaining top talent?  Are our employees, manager and departments as productive as possible?  Are we growing the right skills sets to enable us to thrive in the future? 
* '''Infrastructure''': This relates to the internal systems and operations of the organization and includes things like information systems, equipment, tools and procedures.  Are they optimized or are we spending tons of time on maintenance and patching old equipment and systems?
* '''Organizational Culture''': This relates to the values of the organization including norms, policies, rules and rewards.  Are these aligned and support where the organization wants to be in the future?
* '''Policy''': This variable relates to the overall objectives of the organization and includes policies, plans, targets, measures, key performance indicators and strategies.  Are these aligned with the organizations values and goals?
* '''Products/Services''': Do we have the appropriate mix of products and services that will help the organization meet client needs and the achievement of the organizational mission?  Are our services offered in a manner that today’s customer expects and demands?
* '''Public Sector''': This references the influence of government such as laws, regulations and politics.  Is government ensuring free markets and corporate growth, or are the policies stifling expansion?
* '''Social''': Is the organization aligned and in tune with the overall needs of the citizens and the communities that they live in?
* '''Technology''':  This refers to the investment the organization makes in equipment, software, tools and telecommunications.  Are we leveraging current technology and economies of scale, or have we diversified away our potential savings?&lt;br /&gt;

Once an organization sees themselves in the eyes of those whom they influence, then they are ready to conduct the next exercise, a SWOT analysis.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;''SWOT Analysis'':&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses Opportunities, and Threats, and is a common technique used by organizations to develop a common understanding of where they are today.  Using a simple 2x2 matrix, participants brainstorm the various areas as a starting point prior to development of strategies. A completed matrix is below for illustrative purposes:&lt;br /&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| &lt;u&gt;'''Strengths'''&lt;/u&gt;: * Talented, diverse workforce. * Strong partnerships with industry associations. * Mature processes have been optimized to increase efficiencies. || &lt;u&gt;'''Weaknesses'''&lt;/u&gt;: * Aging workforce.  * Limited knowledge transfer tools.
|-
| &lt;u&gt;'''Opportunities'''&lt;/u&gt;: * Need to grow social media presence. * IT transformation facilitates sharing of resources across agencies. * Optimize website to incorporate responsive design. || &lt;u&gt;'''Threats'''&lt;/u&gt;: * Security, security, security.  * Economy still rebounding. * Limited pool of funds for infrastructure investment.
|}

===Goals and Objectives===

At a minimum, goals should include an action verb and a noun.  They can be as succinct as Improve Employee Satisfaction, Provide Quality Customer Service or Protect Consumers.  Typically they refer to where the agency wants to go, and the objectives are the actionable steps an agency employs to get there.  One of the most widely used acronym to measure the effectiveness of goals (and requirements) is SMART, attributed to a paper by George T. Doran published in the November 1981 issue of Management Review called There's a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management's goals and objectives!  In this instance, SMART stands for specific, measureable, assignable, realistic and time bound.  For example, using the goal “Provide Quality Customer Service”, possible key objectives can include:&lt;br /&gt;

* Increase/improve access to services through use of technology, including website enhancements
* Improve response time to customers
* Provide complete and accurate information to customers
* Provide fair and courteous customer service&lt;br /&gt;

Each of these is specific as a standalone goal.  They convey a specific actionable action that can be taken that is not vague or left up to the reader for interpretation.  These objectives could be measured—either through use of service delivery channels (mail vs. phone vs. internet vs. in person), cycle time process measures, and number of interactions needed to complete a transaction, and also customer satisfaction surveys.  In terms of assignable—can someone take responsibility for the achievement and measurement of each of these goals?  The next letter of the acronym is R for realistic.  While you don’t want really simple objectives, you should avoid totally unachievable ones either (e.g. world peace comes to mind)!  Realistic and time bound go together.  If you can take steps to move in a positive direction in achieving an objective, even if you cannot totally achieve it, then it is likely a worthwhile endeavor.&lt;br /&gt;

===Measures===
Often measures are referred to as key performance indicators.  In recent years, with the proliferation of data and the tools needed to link disparate and/or mine large data sets, the ability to measure performance has been enhanced.  For measures, there are a variety of different types, including process measures such as inputs and outputs, as well as outcome type measures aimed at effectiveness and efficiency of products and services delivered.  Illustrative examples of each type are in the table below:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Type of Measure !! Basic Types !! Examples of Measure Type
|-
| Inputs refer to resources used to complete or improve operations || Resources Used || * level of personal services/man hours to perform a task            * equipment usage (vs. idle time)
|-
|  || Operating Costs || * warranty Cost           * cost per transaction (by type of service delivery channel)
|-
|  || Cash Expenditures || * % capital investment             * % R&amp;D
|-
| Outputs refer to the units of work completed || Completed Work || * % of project complete            * number of workorders closed
|-
| Effectiveness refers to how well a product or service meets needs of the customer || Process Quality || * rework hours            * number of visits/calls customer had to make to complete the transaction
|-
|  || Satisfaction (customer) || * did products and services conform to requirements            * eere employees courteous
|-
|  || Satisfaction (employee) || * attrition rate            * # of employee suggestions implemented
|-
| Efficiency refers to how effectively resources were used in delivering products and services || Timeliness || * project completed on time or early             * process cycle time
|-
|  || Operating Ratios || * supervisory span of control * direct to indirect costs
|}


The key with performance measures, especially relative to strategic planning, is to select a variety of measures that show you how you are doing relative to your goals.  When establishing measures, it is helpful to keep the following criteria in mind:&lt;br /&gt;

* The measures should be relevant to what you are trying to achieve
* It must be important to the stakeholders
* The data must be obtainable and cost effective to acquire and report
* It must be easily understandable by all who review it
* Must be used for constructive purposes.

One thing to keep in mind about data—people will typically give you the information they trust you to use.  If people perceive the information will be used against them for non-constructive purposes, it is possible the numbers could be adjusted before receiving.&lt;br /&gt;

===Strategic Projects===
While measures and objectives are helpful in achieving goals, often an agency or organization needs to undertake a series of projects in order to make substantial progress towards achieving the goal.  When organizations are evaluating their portfolio for project selection, one common criteria used is alignment with strategic goals.  Will the outcomes and deliverables of the project help the organization to achieve one or more strategic goals?  How closely is the project aligned with a goal—it shouldn’t just “fit” but embody the essence of what the agency is attempting to achieve.  If a project does not help foster a goal, and it is not critical to agency infrastructure, or offer a positive ROI, then perhaps it should not be undertaken.  Projects deemed as “strategic” should be of a high enough priority that it gets the attention it deserves.  Conversely, if every project in the portfolio is considered strategic and of a high priority, then you may have diluted the importance of all of the projects.  See the section on prioritization for additional guidance on strategic project selection.&lt;br /&gt;

==Session Planning Guidelines==
When putting together a strategic planning session, there are several recommended guidelines for successful sessions, including:&lt;br /&gt;

* Allow enough time for thoughtful discussion.  Perhaps give the questions in advance for key managers to solicit input from their staff beforehand.  Typically strategic planning should be done over a full day, if not more.
* Ensure you have the right people.  Strategic Planning requires leadership commitment to carry it out.  If you do not have executive management on board, you will have difficulty implementing.
* Where possible, plan to do this off site.  If people are close enough to the office, they will pop in and out during the day and not dedicate the time and effort.
* If possible, have smaller groups do some of the up front analysis and planning and have them present their results to the larger group for input and acceptance.
* Don’t get so caught up in completing the technique that you forgot why you started the process
* Don’t let the lack of data stop you from completing the process.  Use your judgment and experience when needed.
* The plan is only as good as the follow through.  If you don’t work the plan, all you really have is a good doorstop at the end of it all.

==Techniques to Engage Staff==

Depending upon the importance and maturity level of planning within the organization, a variety of techniques can be employed to gain employee engagement.  Some examples to consider are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;

* Seek input on mission/vision—ask people to provide examples of how they would apply it in their day to day job
* Ask employees to contribute their personal values up front and feed this into the plan
* Engage staff at the department/bureau/office level to do strategic planning, cascaded from the overall agency strategic plan
* Have employees develop process measures aimed at demonstrating achievement of the organizations goals
* Engage staff at all levels of the organization to participate in strategic planning in order to gain broader input
* Publish the organizations mission, vision and values statement on the intranet.  Create posters of these and place them in the meeting rooms.&lt;br /&gt;

The important part is to communicate the plan to employees and them have them validate it.  Does it ring true?  Can they see themselves within the mission and vision?&lt;br /&gt;

==Facilitating the Generation/Acceptance of the Plan==

Once the planning has been completed, the statements drafted, the goals written and the measures established, it is time to put all the elements together in a document.  The actual format or framework varies from organization to organization—but it should be something that is published and distributed throughout the organization—not only to your managers and employees, but also your customers, suppliers and stakeholders so they have a picture of what matters most and where you are going as an organization.&lt;br /&gt;

Ideally, once the plan is finalized, it is time to “work the plan.”  This involves regularly measuring performance, and publishing the results so that all are aware how the organization is doing relative to its goals.  Where possible, leaders should use the plan to help reinforce what matters—whether it is post it notes listing the mission, putting the current measure and target on a wall for all workers to see, a key phrase on a coffee cup, employee rewards and recognition noting excellence in the values/behavior area or sharing results upon completion of a strategic project.  It is important to keep the plan alive through regular and frequent communication that reinforces key elements of the plan.&lt;br /&gt;

==Prioritization and When to Use==
Prioritization focuses on what is most important—whether it be project deliverables or an organization’s goals—prioritization helps to ranks the multiples into what matters most.  We are all faced with the need for prioritization, whether it’s juggling a large number of tasks, the email flag noting a high priority or in a medical emergency room, where those with the greatest need are served first.  The ability to prioritize can serve organizations and their staff well—when faced with multiple demands within a finite timeframe, a relative ranking of what is more important than something else can guide employees to work on the right things.&lt;br /&gt;

Typically, a good rule of thumb for prioritization is when you have more than three items, issues, requirements, projects or goals—discerning the relative importance of the items against one another offers value to those who must use them.&lt;br /&gt;

There are a number of different techniques that help organizations and teams rank the relative order of importance of like items, including:&lt;br /&gt;

	
* Strategic Alignment
* High-Medium-Low or Small-Medium-Large
* Weighted/Criteria
* Ranking
* Matrix
* Impact Analysis

Each of these are detailed below with examples in order to provide guidance in their completion.&lt;br /&gt;


==Prioritization Techniques==
While many different techniques are listed below—they are often paired together.  For example, strategic alignment may be one criteria in a weighted matrix!  Each are presented separately in recognition that they can be done individually.
===Strategic Alignment===
Strategic alignment refers to the linkage between what the organizations is trying to achieve, e.g. vision, goals, and values against a core set of deliverables, such as projects, priorities, or business processes.  Alignment refers to comparing each of the deliverables against what the organization is trying to achieve to discern relative fit.  If items are strongly aligned, then it is surmised that there is alignment.  When items kind of fit or do not seem to match up—then one could surmise there is not an alignment.  In most instances, these are a judgment call.  Items which appear to offer real value in meeting the organizations vision, goals and values should receive a higher prioritization.  Those deliverables that meet more than one strategic area should be rated even higher than those that link to a single element.&lt;br /&gt;

===High-Medium-Low===
In its simplest form, High-Medium-Low is subjective criteria that could be applied to a list of deliverables that use relative size as the criteria.  While size is used most often when ranking items high-medium-low or small-medium-large, the same criteria can also be applied to complexity, duration, benefits and cost relatively easy.&lt;br /&gt;

Caution!  When applying the use of small-medium-large or high-medium-low to multiple criteria—it is critical to ensure that when applied, all are referencing the same “desired” outcome.  Merely assuming “high” is good in all categories may result in ambiguity in your results.  For example, if we apply benefit and cost using high as a good outcome, we will tend to favor expensive outcomes (cost=high=good) over other options or alternatives.  This caution will be detailed further later in this section.  Use of high-medium-low as a simple prioritization technique is detailed below:&lt;br /&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Options !! RISK Low-Good,  Med-Depends,  High-Bad !! COST  Low-Good,  Med-Depends,  High-Bad !! TIME TO DO  Low-Good,  Med-Depends,  High-Bad !! RANK
|-
| Option A || High || High || High || 3
|-
| Option B || Med || Med || High || 2
|-
| Option C || Low || Low || Med || 1
|}


As noted in the above example, items ranked low are preferred over items ranked high.&lt;br /&gt;

===Weighted Criteria===
This form of prioritization recognizes that all criteria are not created equal.  A weighted criteria approach allows the prioritizers to identify which criteria are more important and assign a higher value/weight to the criteria.  An example of this form of prioritization can be found in the decision making section.&lt;br /&gt;

Weighted criteria is generally accepted as the best form of prioritization, however it does require additional steps and is viewed as taking too much time or as too complex in some organizations.&lt;br /&gt;

===Ranking===
This form of prioritization is seen as the most difficult to undertake when done alone.  The more items to rank, the more difficult it is to classify.  Given the subjective nature of the analysis, e.g. item “C” is more important than “A” and “E” is more important than “C”, etc., this is often best done in group settings with 2-3 people assigning the relative importance.&lt;br /&gt;

There are several techniques used to help  facilitating rank ordering items, namely a clear focus as to why they are ranked as they are and using pre-sorting to ease completion.  The clear focus technique identifies a single set of values by which to make the decision of what is most important.  Often in business, the focus is a positive impact on the bottom line.  Conversely, in government and non-profits will often look at what is best for citizens/clients.  The higher likelihood of a beneficial outcome, the higher the item will be ranked.  &lt;br /&gt;

Using a pre-sort technique suggests sorting items into different categories before ranking, such as looking at items from a high-medium and low perspective.  The items with high benefits are put in the top category and those with lessor benefits are put in the bottom category.  Once all items are initially sorted, ranking within the individual categories is an easier task.  Once completed, it is best to revisit the entire list to ensure that it is ranked appropriately and that each rank number (1,2,3,4) is used only once.&lt;br /&gt;

===Matrix===
Matrices can come in various shapes and forms—with the most commonly done in squares or linear fashion.  Square matrices typically have the criteria on the top and the alternatives being ranked in the left hand column as shown below:&lt;br /&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Option !! Criteria A !! Criteria B !! Criteria C !! Rank
|-
| Option 1 ||   ||   ||   ||  
|-
| Option 2 ||   ||   ||   ||  
|-
| Option 3 ||   ||   ||   ||  
|-
| Option 4 ||   ||   ||   ||  
|}
	

Another form of matrix is a linear one, often referred to as a quadrant, which uses a 2 dimensional Cartesian system and typically two criteria.  While seemingly more complex, it offers a unique visual representation of alternatives that can facilitate decision making.&lt;br /&gt;

To illustrate this tool, the following example and resulting chart will evaluate which projects a particular organization should undertake.&lt;br /&gt;


INSERT PEARL/etc. file…send from work.&lt;br /&gt;

This type of matrix has many alternate uses.  For example, Gartner, a major IT consulting firm uses a similar matrix to profile multiple vendors in a similar space and call them magic quadrants.  Another application is called a customer window where you apply what a customer wants versus what they receive they are getting, as a form of gap analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Types of Procurements (RFx)==
One role typically facilitated by business analysts within an organization is that of defining business and system requirements used in procurement.&lt;br /&gt;
  
There are a number of different types of procurements, and they each have unique features.  Procurement guidelines vary from state to state (and country to country), so it is generally best to consult your finance and legal offices for specific dos and don’ts.  The material covered here is generic in nature to ensure applicability across all organizations.&lt;br /&gt;

The type of purchase methodology generally depends on the types of goods and services being procured.  Below are the most common forms:&lt;br /&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Type of Procurement !! Description
|-
| Invitation for Bid (IFB) || Typically the goods or services being tendered are commercially available from more than one vendor.  In this type of procurement, specifications are provided and the responsible bidder with the best price is awarded a contract.  A company must be able to clearly define specifics, including terms and conditions, in the solicitation.
|-
| Request for Information (RFI) || When companies or governments are considering procurement, they may start with a request for information from various vendors in order to better frame their procurement.  The RFI is typically not binding, and result in specific information, versus a quotation.  Generally when done, this step occurs before a formal IFB/RFQ or RFP.
|-
| Request for Quotation (RFQ) || This is the same as an IFB.
|-
| Request for Proposal (RFP) || When a custom solution is desired, often involving hardware, software and/or system development and ongoing maintenance, a request for proposal is issued.  This results in a proposal outlining how the bidder firm will meet the requirements.  Generally these take the longest to complete, but are very helpful when introducing new technologies or systems that a firm wishes to outsource.
|}

Some entities opt to try demonstration projects or proofs of concept on some technologies before making significant investments.  These types of “try before you buy” techniques can also be incorporated into the procurement.&lt;br /&gt;

All but the RFI typically results in some sort of procurement to the winning bidder(s), whether it be a purchased order (PO), in the case of a IFB/RFQ, or a contract, in the case of an RFP.  Depending upon the request, the award of a PO or contract can be to one or more vendors.&lt;br /&gt;

===Make vs. Buy===
Business and governmental agencies face the decision whether to “make or buy” on a regular basis, and typically the analysis is conducted by a business analyst.  Many factors go into these decisions, namely:
* Is this part of our current (or desired) core competence
* Do we have the necessary skills, time and capacity to build in house
* Can we develop more cost effectively than buying
* Number and reliability of suppliers in the marketplace
* Ongoing maintenance costs if we build versus likely inflation costs of suppliers in the future
* Ability to easily scale (up or down) as demand occurs in the future
* Ability to reuse or recycle components/parts into other products and services
*  Authority to contract out the products/services
* Opportunity costs of the decision (e.g. if resources diverted to build, what do we no longer have the capacity to do)

While not an exhaustive list—the one above does cover some of the more important ones to consider.  In recent years, the decision whether to make or buy has turned gray!  There is often a middle of the road option, called a hybrid, which has a little bit of both as a third alternative.  Below is a hypothetical example which outlines the three alternatives:&lt;br /&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Make !! Hybrid !! Buy
|-
| Large custom software build using internal resources || Purchase of configurable software; tweaking by internal resources || Outsource development and ongoing maintenance to a 3rd party
|-
| Integrate functionality into current systems || Use of external experts in the software to facilitate knowledge transfer for maintenance || Use of 3rd parties to assits with change management (staff training &amp; materials)
|-
| Approx 24-36 months to do || Approx 12-24 months to do || Approx 9-12 months to do
|}

Hybrid solutions can be partnering and collaboration with other parties—whether it be purchase cooperative, private-public partnership, or any variation that leverages external parties to achieve the organizational mission.&lt;br /&gt;

==Procurement Guidelines==
While these will vary by the entity letting the procurement, elements of contract law, procuring the best value for the organization, and ability to withstand scrutiny are common across all jurisdictions.  Generally, these include items such as:&lt;br /&gt;

* Posting the offering so that the opportunity is known to potential bidders (in NYS this entails posting in the NYS Contract Reporter)
* Shielding those doing the procurement from influence by potential bidders (in NYS an active procurement goes into a quiet period, bidders must avoid discussing the current offering except where allowed by law, and all contact must be noted and reported where required)
* Allowing sufficient time for bidders to put together a quote or a proposal (in NYS, these timeframes are detailed in procurement guidelines)
* Security on the part of the bidders in the form of bid bonds, letters of credit, and assurances from the corporate executives that the company will meet requirements if awarded the bid
* Development of the evaluation methodology in advance of the bids.  In NYS the categories, where applicable, are published with the values assigned, e.g. cost = 25%, technical proposal = 50%, references = 10%, etc.)
* Acknowledgement that submission of the bid creates a binding price/offer for a specified duration.

The terms and conditions specific to the procurement are generally detailed as part of the RFP/RFQ issued. &lt;br /&gt;
 
==Best Practices and Timelines==
The role of the business analyst is critical to a successful outcome.  It is generally not possible to add additional items during negotiations and contracting, so carefully detailing the specifications into a statement of work is the key to a successful contract down the road.
Below are some techniques that have helped to facilitate successful procurements:&lt;br /&gt;

* Clearly understand the industry from which you are soliciting from.  Are there industry standards to consider,

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Foreword==

This Guidebook was written by NYS Business Analysts for NYS Business Analysts.  At the request of the NYS CIO Council, specifically Adam Gigandet, Moses Kamya and Daniel Chan--a workgroup was formed to help develop Business Analysts in NYS Government, and to help establish a consistent approach across the various state agencies.  The Guidebook Committee, often on their own personal time, developed the following wikibook over two years in an effort to provide a &quot;how to&quot; guide that could be used in combination with the IIBA's Business Analysis Body of Knowledge.

As co-chair of the Guidebook Committee, I would like to thank all of the committee members for their knowledge, drafted sections, and passion in putting this terrific resource together. This would not be possible without your commitment and experience.  For a list of initial contributors, please go to the Noted Contributors later in this book.

I'd also like to thank ITS Leadership and also the NYS Forum for recognizing the importance of business analysts in IT projects; your support for our work in invaluable.  As a PM Director, I find that projects with a dedicated BA are far more efficient and effective than those without one. 

This wikibook is dedicated to all the Business Analysts out there helping their business units meet their goals, day after day, project after project!!

==About This Book==

Business Analysts are all about communication!  They carefully capture business area requirements and skillfully document and validate the needs, work closely with the customer to identify must haves from nice to haves, carefully work with the customer to draft a solution and then verify at the end that the customer requirements proposed were delivered at the time of customer acceptance.  When we initially envisioned this Guidebook--we had grand plans of not only developing this book, but also developing training and a companion mentorship program to help grow Business Analysts in NYS Government.  Won't you join us on this journey? 

==Helping us Edit The Book==

You will note there are a few section headings and notes within this wikibook that are blank or reference things to come.  We felt that to gain acceptance of this guide as a NYS standard--we would be better served having NYS help us put on the finishing touches together.  We would like this to be a collaborative effort that we can all use and follow.  While we will happily accept any and all feedback and edits--we strongly encourage you to set up a wiki account and make your edits logged in.  This will be helpful to the Committee as we review and modify the book going forward. It will also prevent your IP address from being publicly exposed while you make edits.  We look forward to your collaborative contributions to define a common approach for Business Analysis work in New York State!  Thank you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Creativity and Its Role in Business Analysis==
===Importance of Creativity===
The Business Analyst not only needs to have a comprehensive understanding of the business and stakeholder needs, but ideally will be able to help come up with solutions to the business problems and needs.  This is where creativity comes into play.  Creativity helps to produce non-obvious solutions and decisions that are not expected through exploration of the unknown.  Creativity through idea generation, knowledge sharing and team collaboration can lead to ingenuity, resourcefulness and original ideas, resulting in more efficient, smarter solutions.&lt;br /&gt;


===Balancing Left Brain and Right Brain Thinking===
Business analysis is a finely balanced blend of left brain and right brain thinking, bringing together the logic and analytical strengths of the left brain and the more abstract and artistic capabilities of the right brain to both analyze (left brain) and then overcome the problem.  Business analysis requires “whole brain” thinking.&lt;br /&gt;

==Creativity Techniques==
===Brainstorming and Brainwriting===
Brainstorming is a technique by which a group generates ideas to solve a team problem through contributing as many ideas as possible and deferring judgment on those ideas. There is a focus on quantity and coming up with the unusual, followed by evaluation and attempt to combine and build on the ideas generated.  It is a good exercise to get a group discussing a common problem and building on participant suggestions, but it requires a good facilitator.  The facilitator will need to: &lt;br /&gt;

	
* Understand and define the problem
* Provide guidance and direction for the session
* Keep things moving and on track (without inhibiting ideas)
* Ensure all participants have the opportunity to contribute&lt;br /&gt;

Brainwriting is a technique used to generate a large volume of ideas when running a brainstorming session. Compared to brainstorming, Brainwriting can easily generate twice the number of ideas in the same time. It can be a preferred choice for solving team problems, for efficiency and participants, due to the approach it uses. &lt;br /&gt;

The Brainwriting technique starts with defining the problem and convening a group to come up with solutions.  The group first assembles as many solutions as possible, and then evaluates the solutions qualitatively. The key point of differentiation from brainstorming is that with Brainwriting each participant thinks and records their ideas individually and anonymously and without any verbal interaction. These relatively small differences change the quantity of ideas and the dynamics of the group.

&lt;u&gt;Running a Brainwriting Session&lt;/u&gt;
# Assemble the team and distribute paper.  Ask each participant to write down the defined problem at the top of a sheet of paper and then draw 3 columns down the page. Select a rounds timer. Note: Papers are to remain anonymous—no name at the top of each sheet. 
# Each participant writes 3 solutions to the problem in each of the 3 columns. They should write freely without editing the ideas.  The ideas remain anonymous and there is no discussion at this stage.
# After 3 minutes, move on to round two. Collect the papers, shuffle them and redistribute the sheets at random.  Each participant is then asked to jot down 3 more ideas under the existing row. They can build on the first 3 ideas or think of something totally new. (Note: No one should get his or her own same sheet back during round two).
# Continue for as many rounds as people want. (After round one, it doesn't matter if participants get a paper that they've already written on). 
# When all rounds are finished, collect the papers, and transfer all the ideas onto a whiteboard or flipchart for everyone to see. You can now begin the process of evaluation and selection of a solution.&lt;br /&gt;

Brainwriting is also useful in that it can be conducted with a group that is not co-located.&lt;br /&gt;

===Checklists===
Alex Osborn (the father of brainstorming) used checklists to stimulate creativity and Bob Eberle expanded on this to produce SCAMPER, a list of words to trigger the thought process.&lt;br /&gt;

Imagine you worked for a company and your latest product wasn’t selling. What could be done?&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;big&gt;S&lt;/big&gt; -Substitute Use cheaper materials?
&lt;big&gt;C&lt;/big&gt; -Combine Bundle the product?
&lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt; -Adapt Change the way it’s used?
&lt;big&gt;M&lt;/big&gt; -Modify Change the packaging/design?
&lt;big&gt;P&lt;/big&gt; -Put any other uses/benefits?
&lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt; -Eliminate too many features?
&lt;big&gt;R&lt;/big&gt; -Rearrange Change the sales process?&lt;br /&gt;

SCAMPER, and other checklists, helps you to manipulate problems by changing the way you look at them. If you can break away from the conventional view of a problem, how many new ideas and solutions can you come up with? Try it for any product, service or process you’re having a problem with.&lt;br /&gt;


===What-If Scenarios===
What-if analysis is a brainstorming technique used to determine how projected performance/behavior/result is affected by changes in the assumptions that those projections are based upon. There are many scenario management tools available like those built in Microsoft Excel. Modeling and simulation techniques can also be used to do What-if analysis.&lt;br /&gt;
 

===Reformulating the Problem===
Simply put, this means re-stating the problem in a different way. If we have a business process that we want to improve but Step B in the process is causing a problem:&lt;br /&gt;


* Can we re-sequence B or make it parallel?
* Can we change who (or what) does it?&lt;br /&gt;

===Role Playing===
Role playing is used where participants rehearse situations or play out solutions as a method of testing potential performance and improving solution capability/suitability.  One type of role playing may be a simulation, where a business process or function is tested through participants acting out the roles in the new solution.&lt;br /&gt;

===Provocation Techniques===
Provocation technique is a type of lateral thinking using an indirect approach. Through the generation of ideas that are outside what can realistically be implemented (via distortion, wishful thinking, etc.) a list of dramatic ideas can then be used to provoke new solutions and forward thinking.&lt;br /&gt;

===Mapping===
Mind maps are diagrams used to visually outline information and may include categories, text, ideas, and images, with a focus on one word or idea.
Concept maps focus on the connections between multiple ideas and may include text labels.

===Reverse Engineering===
Reverse engineering refers to looking at the solution to figure out how it works. By looking at working of the software application or systems, business analyst can figure out how they’re processing business rules, how they are sourcing data and how they make decision.  Thus analyst can understand how an application is supporting business. This technique is primarily useful in situation when:&lt;br /&gt;

	
* Documentation is out of date
* When current business user is not aware of the enforced business rules 
* When an old system/application needs to be upgraded and current staff does not have knowledge of system beyond maintaining it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What's a compiled language? ==
Before knowing what that means we'll need a little insight on what happens inside a computer. Computers work with two numbers 0s and 1s, anything else is constructed using those. Now imagine for a moment you want to write an application, and small application can have thousands of those, so if we tried to write directly in binary (that's the name which receives those 0s and 1s) (indeed, possible) you should wish tipying everything perfect because only one number not in place would make the application misbehave (if it worked at all), so writing in binary it's something not thought about. So if we don't write directly computer's language, how we do to talk to the computer? Well let's consider this: your friend receives a letter in English but he doesn't know English, let's say he's German (yes, a german who does not know English) what you would do? You could do two things: either rewrite it in German or translate the letter directly in front of him.

=== Interpret ===
In computer science taking the letter and translating it directly to your friend it's known as interpreting. Just as you would do with your friend a program (called interpreter) translates those sentences to the computer and executes them, this is done when you need to execute the program. The languages which interpret are called interpreted languages.

=== Compile ===
However,rewriting the letter it's known as compiling. The program which translates from the language you can understand (called source code) to the so called binary code or machine code is called compiler,what's more, languages which use a compiler are called compiled languages.

=== Interpret vs Compile ===
So which it's better? None of those. &quot;Why?&quot; you may be asking, in computer science there's not always a &quot;better&quot;, the fact that you choose one or another depends on what you want to achieve. Interpreted languages are generally slower when executed but in turn they don't need that phase of translating everything from source code to machine code (which can be really slow!) and they normally offer some features which make them easier.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why Learn Nimrod? ==
Before answering why you should learn something it's better to know what is that something. So..
=== What is Nimrod? ===
Nimrod is a programming language, you know, those flowings of expressions  which are used in movies and which seem to work by black magic. The truth it's that it's no black magic (indeed, it's no magic at all!) it's a language, what's more, a language used to interact with a computer. Programming languages (themselves) can't be used to pass information for that you would need a normal language, instead they pass instructions, they are like grandma's recipes, they tell people (in this case computers) how to achieve a set of things.

== Nimrod description as a programming language ==

Nimrod it's a compiled language (What means it is compiled?). So why choose a language which it's potentially difficult? (due to the fact that it is compiled) because it isn't. Nimrod it's that one in a million which is it not really difficult (as it could be C or C++) but neither slow.

== Nimrod's objectives ==
Nimrod want be a programming languges like this:
* Elegant
* Efficient (this is to be very fast and to consume less resources)
* Expressive

      <text xml:space="preserve">== First steps, hello world! ==
So here we are let's start with our very first program, shall we?
In programming languages it's been a tradition to start by writing an example of the language which displays in the console (that window with black background and white letters which seems to be from a hacker's movie) &quot;Hello world!&quot;, and it would be like this in Nimrod:

&lt;code&gt;echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

Easy, isn't it? If you want to try it just save it to a file with extension .nim (e.g: helloworld.nim) and then compile it, for doing this open a terminal, and issue in the terminal:

&lt;code&gt;cd &quot;yourPath&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

Then type:

&lt;code&gt;nimrod c -r &quot;filename&quot; &lt;/code&gt;

This command will make it compile, then will execute it (that's the job of the &quot;-r&quot; argument), when this is done you'll see in the console &quot;Hello world!&quot;.

=== Understanding and extending ===

But how we did that? Basically we told the PC to print &quot;Hello world!&quot; by writing &quot;echo&quot; (which is what we call a function) and then telling what we wanted to print out if we wanted we could made it write other things:

&lt;code&gt;echo (&quot;It's a good day!&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;

But we are not limited to one expression we can put as many of them as we want:

&lt;code&gt;echo (&quot;It's a good day!&quot;)

echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;

Compile this (just as we did earlier) and it'll print out into the console:

&lt;code&gt;It's a good day!

Hello world!
&lt;/code&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Scribunto: An Introduction''' is a book for people who want to learn how to program using Scribunto. Scribunto enables users to embed the Lua programming language into wikis that use MediaWiki, the software that powers Wikipedia. This book covers how to get started, basic programming techniques, and how to use some of the Lua libraries that are unique to Scribunto. It is aimed at beginners to programming, particularly those who have some familiarity with the MediaWiki software, but may also be useful to experienced programmers who are new to Scribunto.

Welcome to wikibooks.  Thank you for the comments and updates on https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Computing/AQA/Processing_and_Programming_Techniques/Machine_Level_Structure TBH I didn't realise this page still existed, it's not part of the current book, was created by a student 8 years ago, and shouldn't be linked as such.  I'll start the process to delete it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to ''Scribunto: An Introduction''. This book is a guide to using Scribunto for non-programmers. It will tell you everything you need to know about Scribunto, from what it is, to how to write your own Scribunto programs.

== Who this book is for ==

This book is aimed at readers who are interested in learning more about Scribunto, but don't have any significant programming experience. Perhaps you have heard about Scribunto, but are not exactly sure what it is. Perhaps you want to run a Scribunto program that somebody else has written, but are confused about how to do so. Perhaps you are experienced with writing MediaWiki templates, and want to see how template coding can be translated to Scribunto coding. Or perhaps you want to learn how to program, and would like to have your work used in real life on a wiki powered by MediaWiki.

Readers who already know one or more programming languages might find that this book covers much familiar ground. Such readers may find it quicker to browse some of the materials listed in the Resources chapter or to consult the Scribunto reference manual. Even so, these readers may consider looking at the chapters that introduce constructs and libraries that are specific to Scribunto, as they are covered in more depth than they are in the reference manual.

== What is Scribunto? ==

To know what Scribunto is, first you need to know about MediaWiki. MediaWiki is the software that powers Wikipedia, the popular online encyclopedia. It is a wiki engine, which means that generally anyone can edit any page at any time. MediaWiki was built for Wikipedia, and Wikipedia's success has meant that MediaWiki has also flourished. As of February 2014, over 9,000 websites are using MediaWiki,&lt;ref&gt;https://wikiapiary.com/wiki/Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; and  over 2,000 extensions to the core MediaWiki software have been written.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_Matrix/AllExtensions&lt;/ref&gt;

Scribunto is one of these 2,000 extensions. The name Scribunto is Latin for ''[[wikt:scribunto|they shall write]]'', which is fitting, as Scribunto allows users to write computer programs on MediaWiki wikis. Specifically, it allows users to embed scripts written in the Lua programming language. The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organisation who operate Wikipedia and oversee the development of the MediaWiki software, intends these scripts as an alternative to the existing system of MediaWiki templates. Lua scripts have a significant performance advantage over MediaWiki templates, particularly for more complex templates with many parameters and multiple sub-templates. Lua scripts are also more flexible than MediaWiki templates, in some cases allowing a dramatic reduction in code size for the same functionality.

== What is Lua? ==

Lua is a programming language developed in 1993 by computer scientists at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is fast and lightweight, making it ideal for use in embedded applications. It also has a relatively simple syntax, and is known for its short learning curve.

== History ==

Scribunto has its origins in MediaWiki's template system. Originally, templates were intended as a way to reuse the same content on many different pages. For example, on Wikipedia they were used to make maintenance banners for articles needing improvement, and navigational boxes for linking related articles. This greatly simplified maintenance of articles, as users could make changes to hundreds of articles simply by making one edit to a template.

In version 1.3, the MediaWiki developers added the ability to use parameters with templates, meaning the same template could display different output on different pages. Furthermore, starting with MediaWiki 1.6, these parameters could accept a default value. This made templates a lot more flexible, but had an unintended downside. By manipulating parameter names and default values, it became possible to add conditional logic to templates.

The ability to use conditional logic enabled templates to be used as a kind of programming language. Templates were never designed to do this kind of work, and using them in this way had several disadvantages. One was that the display code became mixed with the logic code, with the result that templates could not easily be indented to aid understanding. Another was that they were slow; MediaWiki was already written in a programming language with conditional logic (PHP), and adding another quasi-programming-language on top of that had a significant performance cost, especially for complicated templates. One template in particular, the &quot;[[w:Template:Qif|qif]]&quot; template, provided an easier way to use conditional logic than manipulating template parameters directly, and became quite widely used on Wikipedia, with a corresponding negative effect on performance.

To try and improve this situation, one of the lead MediaWiki developers, Tim Starling, wrote the ParserFunctions extension, which introduced logical operators including &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#switch&lt;/code&gt;. This improved performance somewhat, but was never intended as a permanent fix. Sure enough, templates based on ParserFunctions became even more complicated than those that had used qif.

A further innovation to address template performance was introduced in MediaWiki 1.12, in the form of a new preprocessor for the MediaWiki parser. This new preprocessor was designed to only evaluate template code if it was necessary. So if a template used an &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt; parser function, MediaWiki would only evaluate the &quot;true&quot; code if the test evaluated to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, and would only evaluate the &quot;false&quot; code if the test evaluated to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. Again, this preprocessor was successful in improving MediaWiki's parsing performance, but was still slow on pages that used many complex templates.

Scribunto is the latest effort to address the performance problems of MediaWiki templates. Rather than making more improvements to parser functions or to MediaWiki's core software, the MediaWiki developers have elected to allow users to use a fully-fledged scripting language on wiki pages. This means that Scribunto-based templates have a dramatic performance increase from their ParserFunctions-based counterparts. Depending on the template, the Scribunto version can be anything from twice as fast to 50 times as fast.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dragons_flight/Lua_performance&lt;/ref&gt; Scribunto also provides proper separation of logic code and display code, meaning that Scribunto-based templates can be easily indented and commented for readability.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is closer than previous one but has a few problems

I will assume that the instructions create a short addressing or offset addressing mode when referencing other locations so the address and instruction can be stored in data width for one instruction fetch cycle, as other full address modes would require the instruction then the following location(s) to contain the full address that would need to be fetched as well as part of instruction decode fetch cycles.

Registers involved is missing Accumulator (ACC) description that just appears in the diagrams.

The initial diagrams are correct enough

Final diagram has mistakes

# It does &quot;as if by magic&quot; jump of missing the extra fetch cycle of fetching from memory (address 206) to MBR then execute of MBR to ACC
# Due to (1) some of the registers have WRONG contents
   MAR = 206 (the memory address fetched) as ONE of the stages of the instruction decode, hence why different addressing
               modes or moving  data between registers is quicker.

   MBR = 1 the data fetched from 206

Depending on processor and memory organisation an instruction decode phase can involve many fetch cycles (multibyte reads) before it is executed, and the execution may involve a fetch (well actually store) cycle as well.

I dont know if the xercises is '''supposed''' to be a complete answer it is not as it starts on one instruction but finishes on second with bits missing in the middle the first three expanded sections end with the same wrong diagram

You could do with some ordered MNEMONICS to explain difference meant between LOAD 167 and LOAD #166 as experienced engineer with over 30 years on many languages and processors I know but someone new wont!

:Hi and thanks for the feedback. Will try and tackle your points in reverse order:
: - The previous page [[A-level_Computing/AQA/Computer_Components,_The_Stored_Program_Concept_and_the_Internet/Machine_Level_Architecture/Machine_code_and_processor_instruction_set]] covers LOAD 167 and LOAD #166, which should mean they can handle these questions.
: - You seem correct on the MBR, this is a simplification of the process in line with the register notation. I'll look to see if we can get an easier diagram.
: - ACC should be added to registers, do you fancy jumping in and adding a definition?

      <comment>addpath syntax</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi there,
I'm new to it all but finally figured out that the correct syntax for addpath with my version is:

    addpath('C:/Program Files (x86)/MATLAB/R2013a Student/spm/spm8')

I'm using MATLAB's latest student version.
Maybe this is some help for others.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a list of terms often used in this book.

; args
:   Short form of &quot;arguments&quot;.
; arguments
:   The inputs to a function. For example, if I passed the argument &quot;Fred&quot; to a greeting function, it might return the result &quot;Hello, Fred!&quot; ''Arguments'' also refers to the input values that a Lua module receives from a wiki page. Such arguments are often stored in a table named &lt;var&gt;args&lt;/var&gt;. Arguments are almost the same as parameters; the difference is that parameters are the possible inputs to a function, whereas arguments are what you actually put in.
; block
:   A group of code statements that form a cohesive unit. Think &quot;chunk of code&quot;. The code inside a function definition is a block, as is the code between &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; in an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; construct.
; child
:   The frame that is one step lower in the frame hierarchy than another given frame. For example, if a wiki page calls a template, which in turn calls a Lua module via #invoke, the frame created by #invoke is the child of the template's frame.
; debug console
:   An console for interactively running Scribunto code. It can be found on the edit screen for Lua modules, underneath the edit window and the edit summary box, and is preloaded with the code you type into the edit window. Requires JavaScript.
; frame
:   Frame objects are the interface between wiki pages and Scribunto. They allow access to arguments passed to #invoke, and to the MediaWiki parser.
; function
:   A block of code that can be reused in different places. Functions can have parameters, which allows them to produce different output for different inputs.
; invoke
:   The &lt;code&gt;#invoke&lt;/code&gt; parser function is used to run Lua modules from wiki pages. The result returned from the module is shown on the wiki page in place of the parser function code.
; key
:   Keys are the indexes for Lua tables. Normally, to find a value in a table, you let Lua know which table you want, and specify which key Lua should check. 
; library
:   Software used to write other software. Using libraries to write software is usually a lot easier than writing equivalent software from scratch. Scribunto uses both standard Lua libraries and libraries written specifically for MediaWiki. 
; Lua
:   The programming language used by Scribunto. Lua was developed in 1993 at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is fast, easily embeddable, and has a relatively simple syntax. 
; MediaWiki
:   The wiki collaboration software used to power Wikipedia, the popular online encyclopaedia. Scribunto is an extension for the MediaWiki software.
; method
:   A special kind of function that belongs to an object. Used in object-oriented programming.
; module
:   The container for a Lua script. In MediaWiki, a module is a page in the Module namespace which contains Lua code. To run a Lua script you must specify both the module name and the function name. 
; namespace
:   MediaWiki's main way of organising different types of content. For example, on most MediaWiki installations, the main content is located in the main namespace, images and audio are located in the File namespace, and templates are located in the Template namespace. Namespaces are differentiated by their prefix; pages in the main namespace might have no prefix, pages in the File namespace might have a prefix of &quot;File:&quot;, and pages in the template namespace might have a prefix of &quot;Template:&quot;.
; object
:   A programming construct which contains data and the functions used to act on that data. Functions belonging to an object are known as ''methods''. Objects are the basic unit of object-oriented programming.
; parameters
:   The possible inputs to a function. See ''arguments''.
; parent
:   The frame that is one step higher in the frame hierarchy than another given frame. For example, if a wiki page calls a template, which in turn calls a Lua module via #invoke, the template's frame is the parent of the frame created by #invoke.
; parser
:   The part of the MediaWiki software that converts wikitext into HTML. Some of the steps that the parser takes to do this can be accessed from Scribunto. For example, it is possible to expand a MediaWiki template and use the resulting wikitext in a Lua module by using a frame object.
; parser function
:   Wikitext that the parser treats as special, usually delineated by double curly braces &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;#invoke&lt;/code&gt; is an example of a parser function. May also refer to the ParserFunctions extension, which provides conditional logic structures such as &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#switch&lt;/code&gt; to MediaWiki templates.
; return
:   A return value is the output of a function. If, for a given input, a function outputs the number 12, you would say the function &quot;returns 12&quot;.
; Scribunto
:   An extension to the MediaWiki software allowing scripts written in the Lua programming language to be embedded into wiki pages.
; table
:   Lua's basic data structure. A table contains pairs of keys and values. You find a value by looking up a key in the table.
; template
:   A type of MediaWiki page used to display similar or identical content on multiple pages. For example, on Wikipedia, templates are used to create navigational boxes and maintenance banners for encyclopaedia articles.
; wiki
:   A type of web application that allows people to create and edit content collaboratively. Wikipedia is an example of a wiki.
; Wikipedia
:   The popular online encyclopaedia, powered by the MediaWiki software.
; wikitext
:   MediaWiki's markup language. An innovation made early in the history of MediaWiki, wikitext allowed users to quickly create structures such as HTML lists and HTML tables without having to learn HTML itself. However, nowadays it is seen as somewhat hard to learn for the average web user who is used to more visual interfaces for creating content. Scribunto modules must output wikitext, which is then transformed into HTML by the MediaWiki parser.

:This is wiki'''books''' not wiki'''pedia'''. We don't have &quot;articles,&quot; we have books. Books are created as a nested series of pages not as stand alone pages. &quot;A guide to sex&quot; with sub pages &quot;A guide to sex/Anal sex&quot; for example is fine. You can't just have a page called &quot;Condom&quot; or &quot;Anal sex&quot;. Please identify the book you think these should form part of it and they can be merged together.

::So rename the page. What's the problem? And like this, specify the book?
:::I thought you might like to actively participate in creating a useful book rather than just dump the problem on someone else - that's the problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fitness can be achieved at various levels, making the individual feel good, which may be carrying out the exercise they enjoy, this can include a daily 10 minute walk or even football on a regular basis, as it helps to build more energy within an individual’s body. Keeping fit and healthy can reduce the risks of certain diseases, as this routine produces a great change in the lifestyle to improve levels of fitness. Fitness is also the well-being of an individual as this will involve them achieving fitness through nutrition also; this will fall under the various factors to be achieved in order to actually perform activities reaching fitness.
Fitness is the term related to physical activity, it can consist of various meanings to different people, and this is because some may believe an individual should reach several goals before they can achieve fitness, whereas some may believe that fitness is the term to describe the physical activity an individual has the ability to perform.

      <comment>/* Storing Values */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Storing Values ==
We learned how to print something (using echo) but our program it's right now incredibly static, it'll just say the same thing again every time we execute it, not very instersting. So how we can solve it? Using something called variables, before explaining them let's consider an example:
&lt;code&gt;
echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)

echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)

echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)

echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)

echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)

echo (&quot;Hello world!&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;
What this will do it's to write on the console &quot;Hello world!&quot; a bunch of times (I'm aware this example it's pretty idiot but it serves for what I want to explain). But always &quot;Hello world!&quot; it's boring we want another phrase here, we could change every line (in computer science those &quot;lines&quot; are called statements ), but if we wanted to change it a lots of times it would be very time consuming. So what we can do? We can use something called variables. A variable it's basically like a case where we can store information (numbers, characters, sentences), then only thing we have to do it's to announce the existence of that variable, if we don't do that the compiler (which also checks for errors) will thing we made a mistake and won't compile (and hence we won't be able to execute this). The above example with variables would be like this:
&lt;code&gt;
var sentence = &quot;Hello world!&quot;

echo (sentence)

echo (sentence)

echo (sentence)

echo (sentence)

echo (sentence)

echo (sentence)
&lt;/code&gt;
Neat. You want to change the phrase which is displayed? Fine, just change the the variable sentence and every line will change. But what we did? Let's take a careful read about that new example.

The first line it's this:

&lt;code&gt;var sentence = &quot;Hello world!&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

Indeed, we are doing here two things. We first tell the computer the existence of a new variable (using the word &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;) and it's name (in this case the variable it's called &quot;sentence&quot;), this first step  it's called declaration (we are declaring the existance of a variable). The second thing we did is to assign a value to our variable, now our variable represents that value, writing somewhere sentence would be as if we wrote &quot;Hello world!&quot;.

Since the first line it's undesrtood, we should move on to the others:

&lt;code&gt;echo (sentence)&lt;/code&gt;

As you can see be tell the computer to print what it's inside the sentence variable (in the example it was &quot;Hello world!&quot;), the computer it's smart enough to search for a variable called sentence and display it's contents.However, you'll be wondering one thing, why we did put double quotes on the first example but not on the second? Because of the fact the second example was a variable and the first not, when we to take one string as it is (and not consider it an expression) we must put double quotes before and after the sentence (just as you would do in English).

One last thing it's the variable have types: they can be integers, decimal numbers, strings. And once declared one variable can't change it's type in Nimrod. We didn't said which type our variable is how can the computer know which type it is? We assigned some value to our variable, Nimrod it's pretty smart and understands you want your variable to be the same type as what you put there (in this case it's a string). In the case we didn't assign anything we should make explicit it's type explicitly:

&lt;code&gt;
var sentence: TString
&lt;/code&gt;

TString it's how the string type it's called in Nimrod.
As a side note you should know that variables are stored in computer's RAM (indeed, that's RAM's job, to store values needed by applications) and thus it's not infinite, but you should also not worry today's computers have a sheer ammount of RAM and can have millions of these variables.</text>

== A review note ==

So's you know.  I discovered you'd sighted {{plainlinks|{{fullurl:Wikijunior:How Things Work/Nuclear Bomb|diff=2618323&amp;oldid=2618321}}|these edits}} on Wikijunior, which are clearly vandalism.  The main point of the review bit on Wikibooks being, after all, to record when someone has looked at edits and certified they aren't vandalism.

Computers are very powerful tool. Today what ever we see wouldn't have been really possible without advent of the Computers. And today computers have been able to accomplish all these task because of their Graphic Capabilities. Computer graphics makes it easy for a user to interact with the computers. Graphical display finds application is almost all the fields of knowledge known to mankind like science, engineering, government, finance, art, entertainment, education, training, etc.

Computers are powerful tool that can be used for creating various visual objects, and with the combinations of those computers can produce fantastic objects that can depicts real world objects. Computer Graphics are mainly used for design process particularly for engineering and architectural systems, almost what ever we see today are actually designed with some aid of computers. Before we explain various concepts about Computer Graphics let us have a look at various applications of Computer Graphics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[w:Kidneys|Kidneys]]''' &quot;are bean shaped organs that serve several essential regulatory roles in vertebrate animals. They are essential in the urinary system and also serve homeostatic functions such as the regulation of electrolytes, maintenance of acid–base balance, and regulation of blood pressure (via maintaining salt and water balance). They serve the body as a natural filter of the blood, and remove wastes, which are diverted to the urinary bladder. In producing urine, the kidneys excrete wastes such as urea and ammonium, and they are also responsible for the reabsorption of water, glucose, and amino acids. The kidneys also produce hormones including calcitriol, erythropoietin, and the enzyme renin.&quot;&lt;small&gt;[1]&lt;/small&gt;
[[File:FullUSys copy.png|thumbnail|right]]
== What do they do? ==
Kidneys separates the waste from the nutrients using nephrons. Then, the nutrients are taken up to the body where it will be useful and help us with our other systems. Next, the extra water or wastes go down through a tube called the uterus, which then goes to your bladder. 

When you go to the bathroom, you push the urine out of your bladder and it goes to the penis, which then pushes down the urine. Now, your healthy and the wastes are gone.

== Are they useful? ==
Yes

== How can we protect our kidneys? ==
[[File:Nefrolit.jpg|thumbnail|right|A kidney stone]]
Eat the right foods and exercise daily. Also, when you have to go and use the bathroom, its a good idea to go. Or else, you will form &quot;solid concretion or crystal aggregation formed in the kidneys from dietary minerals in the urine.&quot; &lt;small&gt;[2]&lt;/small&gt; called [[w:Kidney stone|Kidney stones]]. They form in the kidneys and hurts your body badly. '''Don't hold your urine inside your bladder, or you will get kidney stones'''. 

Drink a lot of water also, and exercise a lot! 

Well... More will come later! :-)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is there anyone still using this wikibook?  It seems quite out-of-date.  No mention of digital controllers like the Arduino.  There seems to be a lack of high-quality, peer reviewed open source tutorials on digital electronics.  Most of the examples are not kept up to date.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter helps you to get started with Scribunto. It covers installation of the Scribunto software, and where on your wiki you can program in Lua.

== Installation ==

If you are using a wiki hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation such as Wikipedia, Wikibooks or Wiktionary, Scribunto is already installed. Scribunto has been enabled on all Wikimedia wikis since March 2013.

For other wikis using the MediaWiki software, you can check whether Scribunto is installed by going to the wiki's version page. On most wikis this can be accessed by typing &quot;Special:Version&quot; into the search bar. For some wikis, you may need to type &quot;Special:Version&quot; directly into the URL. Once you reach the version page, you will see Scribunto listed under the &quot;Installed extensions&quot; heading if it is installed.

If Scribunto isn't installed, there are installation instructions available on the extension's home page.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Scribunto&lt;/ref&gt;

== Module namespace ==

When Scribunto was being designed, it was decided that embedding Lua code directly onto wiki pages was undesirable. As a consequence, all Lua code run with Scribunto is contained in the Module namespace. Pages in the Module namespace that contain Lua code are often called &quot;Lua modules&quot; or just &quot;modules&quot;. All Lua modules begin with the text &quot;Module:&quot; or its equivalent in that wiki's language. Whatever the language, though, &quot;Module:&quot; will always work as a prefix to find the wiki's Module namespace.

==General==
'''Keylogging is the recording of a computer user's keystrokes.   It is used by thieves to steal internet passwords and bank details, mainly during web-page data entry.   This page describes a method for their avoidance'''.

==The Threat==
'''Keyloggers are software products that infect computers'''.   Technically, these functions can also be implemented by hard-wired circuit design in the keyboards themselves, but this matter is outside the scope of these notes.   Good anti-virus software that is available for personal computers will detect keyloggers and remove them, but every once in a while there is an omission in the virus-signature package and a keylogger persists for a while.

The main problem is to avoid a keylogger getting a clear listing of your passwords when you enter them into a text field on an internet web-page.   Fortunately, most loggers have limitations and a method exists, if not to prevent it trying, at least to give its user a hard time with your most sensitive passwords.

==Dodging the Keylogger==
'''A keylogger knows only which keys were pressed.   It does not know ''where'' the insertion point is located at the time'''.   That is to say, if instead of having the insertion point, the cursor, in the text field of interest, it were placed somewhere else on the page, the keylogger could ''not'' detect that.   If at that time twenty characters were typed, the keylogger would quite happily record these as being significant.

'''The web-page will consider only the characters typed into its password text field'''.  

The method to use is therefore this:
*'''Before starting the password entry''' click the mouse ''outside'' the text box somewhere else on the web-page.   Type a string of data that resembles the type that you use for the text field, for example, digits, letters, or mixed etc.
*'''Then click the mouse ''inside'' the text field''' and type the first character of your password.
*'''Click somewhere on the page ''again''''' and enter dummy characters, lots of them.
*'''''Back'' into the text field again''', and type another password character, then back out to do dummy data.   Move back and forth entering dummy data and password characters until the password is complete.
*'''''After'' the password is completed''' move the mouse insertion point ''outside'' the field again and add a dummy tail-piece in the same way as before.

The user can decide how much dummy data is needed and how many real characters can be typed at a time.   The main point is to make sure that the characters of the password and the sections before and after the password are padded thoroughly with data indistinguishable from that used for the password itself.

Any intruder will be faced with a very long string of key-presses to resolve, while the password will work in the normal way.

==Advanced Keyloggers==
Some more advanced keyloggers, not sure which ones, are said to be able to make images of the screen after each key-press.   In this way they can get around the more basic loggers' limitations.   The process is still undoubtedly more complex with an increased data string, but it is unclear as to whether a large set of images would be detected by the user, or what form the detection could take.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== My question is: what would an example of code that does not utilize this pattern look like (in this specific context)? ==

It's not exactly explicit to me how this design pattern solves the problem because I haven't even visualized the &quot;problem&quot; (in this specific context) yet.  I guess what I'm asking for is essentially a before and after look at working code that has been updated to use the flyweight pattern to more clearly see the benefits of the pattern comparatively and in context.

:There is no standard bad code. However, a bad code would be a code where you create as many objects as you use. In this case, each time you use a new object, you create it and lots of data are duplicate and the memory overheat. This would be a bad example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rigid body equilibrium exists when a rigid body under the influence of a force system is in a stable equilibrium. 
== What is a rigid body? ==
It is a fictional object that is a useful approximation. The rigid body cannot be deformed, which means it cannot be squished or broken. Mathematically, we would say that every point on the rigid body will retain their distance and position relative to one another not matter the force.  If we were to subject it to two forces approaching infinity, it would not be harmed. 
== How are they useful? ==
Rigid bodies are useful approximations because we will often be faced with materials that are not under enormous amounts of strain- the force is very small relative to the material's modulus of elasticity. We will go over how to see whether or not a rigid body is in equilibrium in [[Statics/Two-Dimensional Equilibrium|two dimensions]], and then be able to generalize that to three dimensions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sidechaining is an often misunderstood tool in the mixers bag that can be used to fix a variety of sonic challenges in a mix, and to shape sounds creatively as well. Technically, sidechaining is simply using a compressor on a track, but instead of the compressor listening to the input, the compressor is 'listening' to a different audio source altogether. There are many situations where it can be useful to control the volume of one track by responding to the volume changes of another. 

Ducking - Ducking is often used in producing commercial spots. The compressor listens to the announcers track and 'ducks' the background music underneath the announcer so that the volume of the music bed is raised when there is silent pauses in the announcers performance. If set properly, the effect is that the music is loud but is pushed under the voice keeping the words out in front. 

Ducking can also be used to keep the low end from 'piling up' in heavy dance music. The bass track 'listens' to the kick track so that the volume of the bass is lowered momentarily to allow the kick to dominate the bottom on the kick drum's attack.

Another popular trick is to put several rhythm guitar tracks on a bus, then set that bus compressor to 'listen' to another rhythm guitar track. This will subtly 'tighten' all the rhythm guitars together.

Sidechaining can also be used to tame a problem frequency that only occasionally pops out of a track without gutting that frequency from the entire track.
A more advanced trick is to add an eq in before the sidechained compressor and exaggerate a problem frequency. A copy of the track with the problem is made and given a separate track. When the two are sidechained together the track will play normally until the 'problem' pops up in the drum or vocal part. When the annoying frequency happens, the track is lowered momentarily without having to pull that frequency out of the entire track. This is often used on vocal tracks to tame the sibilance(high frequency content in 's'es and 't's). This is also called 'de-essing'.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">To start a mix, it's more important to have a system that you know well, than it is to have the world's most expensive speakers. Many hits have been mixed on classic Yamah NS-10's which retailed at well under US $500 for a pair. The general consensus being that if you can get a mix to sound good on NS-10's, it would sound good anywhere. The first step is to listen to as many professionally done recordings on your speakers as you can so that you can hear how things should sound on YOUR speakers and in YOUR listening environment.</text>

      <comment>Listed a few problems with the page.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I am having a hard time understanding this page because there seem to be so many errors. I don't feel confident enough to just correct them myself, so I will list them here.
# 300px-Cartesian_plane.svg.png labels the negative X axis incorrectly. The -1 label should be -2, the -2 label should be -3, and so on. Point P(-1, -2) is drawn at (-2, -2), although it agrees with the x axis label. The X and Y labels pointed to by the Y and X axis rays (arrows) should be labeled Y and X, respectively to indicate increasing positive Y and X.
# The statement &quot;For example, if P (3, 4) is on the same vertical line as Q (3, y), then y = 4.&quot; seems incorrect. Points on the same vertical line have the same x values, as do P and Q, but you cannot say anything about Q's y value. The example should read &quot;For example, if P (3, 4) is on the same vertical line as Q (x, 2), then x = 3.&quot;
# in Cartesian_plane_problem.svg, points P and Q are drawn switched.
# When I saw the page, the \begin \end and bracketed formatting codes were not working, displaying in bright red text &quot;Failed to parse(unknown function '\begin')&quot; and so on.
These problems are beyond my ability to fix.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that you are set up with a working version of Scribunto, it is time for you to write your first Lua program. All this program will do is output the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot; Not so useful by itself, perhaps, but we have to start somewhere.

== The debug console ==

First, we will run the program in the ''debug console'', a text entry box that you can use to try out Lua code. To find the debug console, enter any module page in &quot;edit&quot; mode. You should see it near the bottom of the page.&lt;ref&gt;The debug console requires JavaScript to run. For most people JavaScript will be turned on by default, but if you have disabled it then you will not be able to use the debug console. If you have JavaScript enabled but the debug console is not visible, there may be a JavaScript conflict preventing it from loading. Please ask your wiki's technical support staff for help. For Wikimedia wikis, the English Wikipedia's [[w:WP:VPT|technical village pump]] may be able to provide assistance.&lt;/ref&gt; It looks like this:

[[File:Scribunto debug console.PNG|frame|none|alt=A grey text-entry box with usage instructions above, and a &quot;clear&quot; button below.|The Scribunto debug console.]]

Once you've found the debug console, click on the text entry box, type the following code, and press enter.

{{Code:Lua
| code =
= &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
}}

After you press enter, you should see the following appear below the text you wrote:

{{Code:Lua
| output =
Hello, world!
}}

Congratulations! You have just written your first Lua program. Let's look at the code in more detail.

The equals sign (&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;) at the start of the program is a special command used in the debug console that runs the code on the current line. It must be used at the beginning of a line, and it can only be used in the debug console. So in our program, the code &lt;code&gt;= &quot;Hello, world!&quot;&lt;/code&gt; means 'run the code &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello, world!&quot;&lt;/code&gt;'.

The two double quotes (&lt;code&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) tell Lua to make everything inside them behave as a block of text. Blocks of text like this are known as ''strings'' to programmers. If you don't include the double quotes, Lua thinks that you are trying to input a command, and gets confused.

{{Code:Lua error
| code =
= Hello, world!
| output =
Lua error in console input at line 6: ')' expected near '!'.
}}

Lua knows that you made a mistake somewhere, but doesn't know exactly what it was, so it guesses that you need a &quot;)&quot; somewhere (wrong in this case).

Note that the spacing doesn't matter. You can put as many spaces as you want between the equals sign and &quot;Hello, world!&quot;

{{Code:Lua
| code =
=        &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
| output =
Hello, world!
}}

== Running the code on wiki pages ==

At this stage, you are probably wondering how we can get our program to display on a wiki page. To do this, things get slightly more complicated. The creators of Scribunto, in their infinite wisdom, have decided that Scribunto programs have to be structured in a certain way, and that certain Lua functions (such as the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; function) should not be available. This was done to increase the quality of code that Scribunto users will write. The theory goes that teaching people good habits is more important than the convenience of being able to use functions like &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;. This means that what would be a very simple program to write in standard Lua becomes more involved in Scribunto. The code we need is this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
p = {}

function p.hello_world()
	return &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
end

return p
&lt;/source&gt;

To run this code, we need to make a new module page. We will use &quot;[[Module:Hello]]&quot;, but you can call it whatever you want. To get to the new page, you can make a link to your module using the syntax &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Module:Hello]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and then follow that link, or you can type &quot;Module:Hello&quot; into the URL in place of the page name. Some wikis, for example the English Wikipedia, will also give you a link to follow if you type &quot;Module:Hello&quot; into the search bar. Once you are at the module page, click on the &quot;Edit&quot; or &quot;Create&quot; tab at the top of the page to get the edit view. Then copy and paste the code above into the edit box, and save the page. Your module is now ready to be run. 

You can run the code from any normal page on your wiki, for example [[Special:MyPage|your user page]] or a [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox page]]. Edit the page, and type in the following text:

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:Hello|hello_world}}

If you named your module something other than &quot;Module:Hello&quot;, then replace the first &quot;Hello&quot; with the name of your module. Then save the page. The page should now display the text, &quot;Hello, world!&quot; If this worked, then give yourself a pat on the back. You have just written a Lua module and displayed it from wikitext; that's not something that every wiki editor can do.

There are quite a few concepts in the module code above that are new to us. Try not to worry about them too much. For now, it is enough that you know that this module code will produce &quot;Hello, world!&quot; on a wiki page. You will learn about all the other concepts as you progress further through this book.

This is an example module that demonstrates how to access arguments. It is used in [[Scribunto: An Introduction]].

=== Hello world ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello_world}}

This function displays the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot;. It doesn't use any arguments.

Example:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello_world}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello_world}}

=== Hello ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello|''name''}}

This function greets the specified user. It uses one argument, ''name''.

Examples:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello|Fred}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello|Fred}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello|Jane}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|hello|Jane}}

=== Add ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|add|''num1''|''num2''}}

This function adds two numbers, ''num1'' and ''num2''.

Examples:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|add|5|3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|add|5|3}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|add|100|25}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|add|100|25}}

=== Count fruit ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|count|bananas=''number''|apples=''number''}}

This function displays how many apples and how many bananas we have. It uses named arguments.

Examples:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|count_fruit|bananas=5|apples=3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|count_fruit|bananas=5|apples=3}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|count_fruit|apples=7|bananas=4}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|count_fruit|apples=7|bananas=4}}

=== Has fruit ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|has_fruit|''name''|bananas=''number''|apples=''number''|cherries=''number''}}

Displays the number of bananas, apples and cherries a named person has. This function mixes positional arguments with optional named arguments.

Examples:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|has_fruit|Fred|bananas=5|cherries=7}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|has_fruit|Fred|bananas=5|cherries=7}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|has_fruit|Jane|cherries=9|apples=4}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|has_fruit|Jane|cherries=9|apples=4}}

=== Custom fruit ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit|''fruit1''=''number''|''fruit2''=''number''|...}}

Displays the number of items of different fruit. Any fruit can be displayed; the function is not limited to particular types of fruit as it was in previous functions. This is done by iterating over the arguments. Note that the arguments are processed in an arbitrary order.

Examples:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit|pineapples=10|oranges=5}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit|pineapples=10|oranges=5}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit|lemons=6|grapefruits=3|bananas=4|grapes=20}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit|lemons=6|grapefruits=3|bananas=4|grapes=20}}

=== Custom fruit 2 ===

 &amp;#123;{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit_2|''name''|''fruit1''=''number''|''fruit2''=''number''|...}}

Displays the number of items of different fruit that a named person has. Similarly to the &lt;code&gt;custom_fruit&lt;/code&gt; function, this function iterates over the arguments, and so is not limited to any particular types of fruit. The difference is that the function checks that each fruit is not the first positional parameter, so that ''name'' isn't erroneously listed as a fruit.
 
Examples:

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit_2|Fred|pineapples=10|oranges=5}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit_2|Fred|pineapples=10|oranges=5}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit_2|Jane|lemons=6|grapefruits=3|bananas=4|grapes=20}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; {{#invoke:ArgsDemo|custom_fruit_2|Jane|lemons=6|grapefruits=3|bananas=4|grapes=20}}

''Formal Syntax and Semantics of Programming Languages''. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;] is the technique of transforming a [[w:function (mathematics)|function]] that takes multiple [[w:parameter (computer science)|arguments]] (or a [[w:tuple]] of arguments) in such a way that it can be called as a chain of functions, each with a single argument ([[w:partial application]]). It was originated by [[w:Moses Schönfinkel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Christopher|last=Strachey|authorlink=Christopher Strachey|title=Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages|journal=[[Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation]]|volume=13|pages=11–49|year=2000|quote=There is a device originated by Schönfinkel, for reducing operators with several operands to the successive application of single operand operators.|doi=10.1023/A:1010000313106|ref=harv}} (Reprinted lecture notes from 1967.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional languages allow the partial application of functions with currying, for example we can currify operators:

val * = (a:Int) =&gt; (b:Int) =&gt; a * b
val timesthree = *(3)
timesthree(4)
&lt;/source&gt;

And the result of &lt;code&gt;timesthree(4)&lt;/code&gt; will be 12.

This allows defining new functions easily by passing only some of the arguments that the curried function needs. These functions are normal functions that can be used in any other higher order function (e.g. map).

Here are some examples of curried function definitions and invocations:

&lt;source lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;
object smallExamples {
  
  def currysum(x:Int)(y:Int)(z:Int) = x + y + z
  
  val currysum2 = (x: Int) =&gt; (y: Int) =&gt; (z: Int) =&gt; x + y + z
  
  val currysum3: Int =&gt; Int =&gt; Int =&gt; Int = x =&gt; y =&gt; z =&gt; x + y + z
  
  def nocurrysum(x:Int, y:Int, z:Int) = x + y + z
  
  val currysum4 = (x: Int) =&gt; (y: Int) =&gt; (z: Int) =&gt; nocurrysum(x, y, z) 

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
      val res = (smallExamples currysum 2)(3)(4)
      val res2 = (smallExamples currysum2 2)(3)(4)
      val res3 = smallExamples.currysum3(2)(3)(4)
      val res4a = (smallExamples currysum4 2)
      val res4b = res4a(3)
      val res4 = res4b(4)
      val res5 = smallExamples.nocurrysum(2, 3, 4)
      val resno = ((smallExamples.nocurrysum(2, _:Int, _:Int))(3, _:Int))(4)
      println(res)
      println(res2)
      println(res3)
      println(res4)
      println(res5)
      println(resno)
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the function &lt;code&gt;nocurrysum&lt;/code&gt; is not curried but we can create a curried function by specifying an empty parameters (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;) indicating their type.

Hey. I work mostly reverting vandalism and I think that having the reviewer flag will be beneficial, given that my edits would not need to be reviewed. I could say that I'm a globally trusted user who works fighting vandalism cross-wiki :) — [[User:Hahc21|&lt;font color=&quot;#333333&quot;&gt;'''ΛΧΣ'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Hahc21|&lt;font color=&quot;#336699&quot;&gt;'''&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 06:22, 3 March 2013 (UTC)
* Hm.  You've made one content-space edit here.  Note the autopromotion criteria at [[Wikibooks:Reviewers]]; we ''do'' sometimes promote folks manually ahead of schedule, but the reason we set the criteria to wait until a user is moderately seasoned is so that reviewers have some familiarity with the ways we do things that make us different from other projects (usually Wikipedia is the biggest hazard since, realistically, regular contributors to most of the other sisters are already aware that every sister is different, whereas it's really easy for a Wikipedian to be so overwhelmed by that place that they just don't realize how things vary from sister to sister).

: You only just arrived here.  To me, it does seem a little early for promotion.  Remember, other than Wikijunior, when you revert vandalism the revert is instantly visible (and when you undo it on Wikijunior, the vandalism wasn't instantly visible anyway).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:26, 3 March 2013 (UTC)

I've made close to 60 edits to Wikibooks, so, while I'm not really experienced, I'm not miles and miles from being automatically promoted. That said, my main focus here is reverting vandalism, and it would be good to have a rollback button for that. I have experience with being a rollbacker on WMF projects--I have been a rollbacker on the English Wikipedia since January and was a rollbacker on Wikidata for several months (before I became an admin there). Thanks, --[[User:King jakob c 2|Jakob]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:King jakob c 2|Scream about]] [[Special:Contributions/King jakob c 2|the things I've broken]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:34, 13 November 2013 (UTC)
: Afaics, the two autopromotion criteria you're short on are total edits (criterion is at least 100, you've got a little more than fifty) and total content-space edits (criterion is at least 50, I think you've got about forty); you look fine on things like at least 8 edits spaced 2 days apart.
: I'd forgotten rollback is bundled with reviewer.  I'm inclined to grant, though I'll wait just a bit just in case somebody wants to object.  (Usually if there are objectors I'm one of them, so I have a certain sympathy for someone who wants to object but finds it's already been granted.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 21:14, 13 November 2013 (UTC)

ظَرْفُ المَكَانِ و ظَرْفُ الزَََّمَانِ designs to the time and the place of an event (المَفْعُولُ فِيهِ). It is considered an optional part of phrase structure. The word &quot;ظَرْفُ&quot; literary means container, in the Arabic grammar it generally means the container of event. It contains the time الزَََّمَانِ and the place  of a certain event المَكَانِ. The tool of questioning about time is &quot;مَتَى&quot; and place is &quot;أَيْنَ&quot;. 


== ظَرْفُ الزَََّمَانِ ==
There is a difference between time and time container. Time container refers to the time of an event but you can use time as a subject or a object (mark the no use of container in other phrase structure). For example:
Yesterday was great. الأَمْسُ كَانَ رَائِعََا. In this sentence, yesterday is the subject of the sentence. 
I came yesterday. جِئْتُ بِالأَمْسِ. In this sentence, yesterday is a time container. (the sentence &quot;I came&quot; still have sence without yesterday just less precision. It is the same in Arabic, &quot;جِئْتُ&quot; represents a complete sentence. 

Time container in Arabic grammar has different groups. There are the inflective words &quot;الظّرفُ المُعْرَبُ&quot; (words that can be used in different positions not only as a time container like the one in the examples). There are the built words (time prepositions) &quot;الظّرفُ المبنيُّ&quot; (these are complex words or simple words that can only refer to time container and cannot be used in other position.


==== الظّرفُ المُعْرَب ====
The inflective words, they refer to time in general and can be used as a time container:
Second ثانية. I left for a second: غِبْتُ لثَانِيَةٍ
Hour ساعة. he will arrive after an hour: سَيَأْتِي بَعْدَ سَاعَةٍ
Never أبداً. It will never fly: لَنْ تَطِيرَ أَبَدًا


==== الظّرفُ المبنيُّ ====
The built words can't be used in time for general use, it means time container and some time other different meanings.
Examples:
Since منذُ. I was awake since 6am: كُنْتُ مُسْتَيْقِظًا مُنْذُ السَّادِسَةِ صَبَاحًا. 
Now الآنَ. I am reading now: أَنَا أَقْرَأُ الآنَ.
Until ريثما. I will wait until he comes: سَأَنْتظِر رَيْثَمَا يَأْتِي.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Hans Adler or other maintainers,

Here's a first attempt at filling in the &quot;[something about 7, 8 or 9 cards in the stock which I cannot follow]&quot; section.  I'm working from the 1896 edition of &quot;Encyclopédie des jeux de cartes&quot; available on http://gallica.bnf.fr/

As you've already translated, the section on misdealing (top of p. 24) covers the case of one person having 13 cards instead of 12, the other person having 12, and the talon having 7 cards instead of 8.  I mention this to clarify the logic of the game rules, because the section you are confused about refers to this case.

The confusing section itself primarily refers to one face-up card in the talon.  I am assuming &quot;retournée&quot; means &quot;turned over&quot;, not &quot;taken and then given back&quot;.  The top of p. 23 seems to use it in the same sense.  Translating the section fairly literally, but simplifying the nuances of the writing style, I come up with:

&quot;Whenever a turned-up card is found in the talon, even if the talon may have 7, 8, or 9 cards, that is if the deal must be played, the deal shall stand, provided however that the card turned up was not the card on top of the talon or the topmost of the three cards allotted to nondealer.  The rule for misdeal is not relevant here, of giving nondealer the right to have a new deal or keep the hand and thereby giving him the power to act according to whether his hand is good or bad.&quot;

The part about &quot;that is if the deal must be played&quot; seems to distinguish these cases:
* 8 cards in the talon and 12 in both players' hands.
* 7 cards in the talon, 12 in one player's hand, 13 in the other's, and nondealer has decided to play, as covered in the section on misdeals.
* 9 cards in the talon, but where is this covered?
…from these:
* There can't be 6 or fewer cards in the talon, because then someone would have 14 or more cards in hand, forcing a redeal as described in the section on misdeals.
* 10 or more cards in the talon?
but I am still a little confused about that myself.

Happy to discuss translations,

Derek Peschel

Olivier Burlot checked the translation and suggested these changes (in a private message on BoardGameGeek).  I have incorporated most of them.  When I check the original, I will include the rest.

* 'so long as no card has been &quot;played and covered&quot;' I don't see it meaning anywhere else than during the trick playing phase.

* I think it isn't mentioned that non-dealer must discard at least one card.

* &quot;compter à la muette&quot; means that the penalised player can't score points for whatever combinations he holds while his opponent's combinations are all considered valid (and score) even those who are of an inferior strenght than the penalised player's. (It is briefly explained later in the original book).

* &quot;As a result, the last trick consists only of a single card&quot; can be &quot;the last tricks&quot; in the case of 11 cards or less.

* &quot;announces it as a major huitième, [...] if it contains the Ace, otherwise as a second, third etc. such.&quot; The book doesn't mention the obligation to indicate the strength of the sequence that you hold during the originl announcement (in practice this must be done only if the opponent says he has a sequence of equal length, this prevents giving too much information in the case of an inferior sequence).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- Please add categories to the bottom of this page, and add interwikis to Wikidata. --&gt;

This module provides a way to generate tables of contents for books.

=== Usage ===

This module, in order to be used, must be invoked directly, which means there is no intermediary template. In theory, an intermediary template could be created, but it would only support a limited number of arguments, while the direct invocation of the modules allows an unlimited number of arguments.

This module recognizes an unlimited number of sequences of four numbered parameters that respectively indicate the name of a section, the page of that section (the name of the page on the wiki to which the section label will link), the description of that section and the completion status of that section (a multiple of 25 smaller than 100 followed by a percentage sign). Only the first is required, and the format of the table of contents will adapt automatically depending on which parameters are given values to.

The module recognizes some named parameters that are described in the next section. Parameters, both named and numbered, are considered to have a value when they are provided an argument that does not contain only whitespace.

=== Parameters ===

All the parameters described here are optional.

; indent
: This is the length of the left margin of the section list, specified as [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#value-def-margin-width a CSS margin length].
; list style
: The value of this parameter will be used as the value for the &lt;code&gt;list-style&lt;/code&gt; CSS property of the section list. The most common use is to remove the bullets of a list by setting it to &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;.
; page name prefix
: This is a prefix added to all page names given for sections. It is most commonly used to add the name of the book to the page names with &lt;code&gt;{{FULLBOOKNAME}}&lt;/code&gt;.
; unordered
: The list of sections will be ordered unless an argument is provided for this parameter.

=== Examples ===

This module will, depending on whether descriptions are provided and on whether the section list is ordered or not, adapt the layout and appearance of the table of contents.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Elm''' is a [[w:functional programming|functional programming]] language for [[w:Declarative programming|declaratively]] creating [[w:web browser|web browser]] based [[w:graphical user interface|graphical user interface]]s.

Elm uses the [[w:Functional reactive programming|Functional Reactive Programming]] style and [[w:purely functional|purely functional]] graphical layout to build user interface without any destructive updates.

== Description ==

The primary implementation of Elm compiles to JavaScript and HTML, with the use of CSS styles.

In Elm, Functional Reactive Programming takes the place of event handlers and callbacks; it also manages all screen updates automatically. Purely functional graphical layout takes the place of working with the DOM. Elm also allows [[w:Markdown|Markdown]] to be embedded directly.

== Syntax and Semantics ==

Elm adopts a [[w:Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] styled syntax, with influences from [[w:OCaml|OCaml]] and [[w:FSharp|FSharp]]. For example, &quot;has type&quot; is written with a single colon &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt;, and forward and backward function application use the &lt;code&gt;(&lt;|)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(|&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; operators&lt;ref name=&quot;syntax&quot;&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/Syntax.elm The Syntax of Elm]&lt;/ref&gt; where &lt;code&gt;(f x)&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;(f &lt;| x)&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;(x |&gt; f)&lt;/code&gt;.

Elm has extensible records&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/Records.elm Elm - Extensible Records]&lt;/ref&gt; which safely provide much of the flexibility of [[w:Javascript|Javascript]]'s object model.

The type system supports primitive types like integers and floats, structured data like tuples and records, and custom [[w:Algebraic data type|ADT's]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/Getting-started-with-Types.elm Elm - Getting started with Types]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elm's version of [[w:Functional reactive programming|Functional Reactive Programming]] is event-driven, meaning that updates are only performed as necessary. It shares the closest resemblance to Event-Driven FRP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last1 = Wan | first1 = Zhanyong
 | last2 = Taha | first2 = Walid
 | last3 = Hudak | first3 = Paul
 | author3-link = Paul Hudak
 | title = Event-Driven FRP
 | journal = Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages
 | pages = 155–172
 | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/What-is-FRP.elm Elm - What is Functional Reactive Programming?]&lt;/ref&gt; and Arrowized FRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1145/581690.581695}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arrowized&quot;&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/blog/announce/0.5.0.elm#automatons Elm - The Libraries You Need] ''Automaton'' as an arrow implementation&lt;/ref&gt;

The following program displays the position of the mouse as it moves around the screen, automatically updating the screen in real-time. Note: Elm ''import'' correspond to Haskell's ''import qualified''.&lt;ref name=&quot;import&quot;&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/blog/announce/0.8.elm#importing-modules Version 0.8 release notes] Section &quot;Importing modules&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Mouse     -- qualified import

main = lift asText Mouse.position
&lt;/source&gt;

The value of main is displayed on screen. Function asText turns any value into a displayable textual representation. Mouse.position is a value that changes over time, called a signal. Function lift ensures that asText is applied to Mouse.position every time the mouse moves.

Elm has a small but expressive set of language constructs, including if-expressions, let-expressions, case-expressions, anonymous functions, and list interpolation.&lt;ref name=&quot;syntax&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/About.elm About Elm] Elm features&lt;/ref&gt;

Elm also has both a module system and a foreign function interface for JavaScript.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/JavaScript-Integration.elm Elm - JavaScript Integration]&lt;/ref&gt;

The predefined functions are in the ''Prelude'' module.&lt;ref name=&quot;prelude&quot;&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Prelude.elm Elm's Prelude]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Values ===

Values are immutable:

* Bool, Int, Float.&lt;ref name=&quot;prelude&quot;/&gt;
* Char,&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Char.elm Char library]&lt;/ref&gt; String,&lt;ref name=&quot;prelude&quot;/&gt; (styled) Text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Text.elm Text library]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Time, Date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Date.elm Date library]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Element (html structural elements).&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Graphics/Element.elm Element library]&lt;/ref&gt;
* graphic representations (called Forms), shapes and paths.&lt;ref name=&quot;collage-lib&quot;&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Graphics/Collage.elm Collage library]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
toForm : Element -&gt; Form
&lt;/source&gt;
&gt;&gt; toForm turns any Element into a Form. This lets you use text, gifs, and video in your collage. This means you can move, rotate, and scale an Element however you want.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Records values.
* [[w:Algebraic data type|Algebraic data type]]s (''data'' clause) values.

=== Signals ===

Signals are value varying items and have types as &lt;code&gt;(Signal value_type)&lt;/code&gt;.

They include time varying items (also called [[w:behavior#Computer science|behaviors]]) and event driven sources.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- current time, updated every t (from Time lib)
every : Time -&gt; Signal Time

-- current mouse position (from Mouse lib)
position : Signal (Int,Int)
&lt;/source&gt;

Html form input elements, may vary in style and state. Their generator functions mostly return a pair (element signal, status signal)&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Graphics/Input.elm Graphics.Input library]&lt;/ref&gt; as in
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- create a checkbox with a given start state.
checkbox : Bool -&gt; (Signal Element, Signal Bool)
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Dependent signals ====

Dependent signals are like [[w:formula|formula]] cells in a [[w:spreadsheet|spreadsheet]]. They may react to updates of their operand signals.

The one defined as ''main'' starts the scanning of the dependency/reaction [[w:directed graph|directed graph]] to find the independent signal variables for inclusion in the source event loop.

You define signal ''formulas'' by using signal filter functions, or by applying lifted value functions to previously defined signals. To apply a function of N parameters, you have to lift the type of a '''values''' function to a '''signals''' function, either through the ''lift&lt;N&gt;'' function, or by applying ''lift'' to the function, followed by signal applicative terms as &lt;code&gt;((~) signal)&lt;/code&gt; for functional parameters application exposed below.&lt;ref name=&quot;signal-lib&quot;&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Signal.elm Signal library]&lt;/ref&gt;

You can use a value in a signal position by lifting its type through the ''Signal.constant'' function.

==== From a [[w:Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] perspective ====
===== Signal as a Haskell's Functor instance =====

See Functor class def.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Control-Monad.html#t:Functor Haskell class Functor def.]&lt;/ref&gt; From Elm's Signal library:&lt;ref name=&quot;signal-lib&quot;/&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- lift a ''values'' function type to a ''signals'' function one

-- similar to Haskell's ''fmap'' and ''Control.Applicative.liftA''
lift : (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Signal a -&gt; Signal b

-- (&lt;~) is an alias for lift
&lt;/source&gt;

===== Signal as a Haskell's Applicative instance =====
See Applicative class def.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Control-Applicative.html#t:Applicative Haskell class Applicative def.]&lt;/ref&gt; From Elm's Signal library:&lt;ref name=&quot;signal-lib&quot;/&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- lift a Value
constant : a -&gt; Signal a

-- signal application
(~) : Signal (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Signal a -&gt; Signal b

-- sample from the second input every time an event occurs on the first input
-- like Haskell's Control.Applicative.(*&gt;) sequence actions discarding the first result
sampleOn : Signal a -&gt; Signal b -&gt; Signal b

----
-- lift&lt;N&gt;: to lift a function of N value parameters (defined lift2 to lift8)
-- similar to Haskell's Control.Applicative.liftA&lt;N&gt; 
result_signal = liftN fun_N_ary signal1 signal2 ... signalN

-- equivalent with binary infix operators
result_signal = fun_N_ary &lt;~ signal1 ~ signal2 ~ ... ~ signalN
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Composable signal transformers. Automatons ===

This is used to generate signal transformers as a chain. 

Individual chain links, with type &lt;code&gt;''(Automaton input output)''&lt;/code&gt; behave like computation (side effect) functions with only one parameter. 

To chain two of them the input type of the follower must match the output result type of the precedent.

This concept is borrowed from ''[[w:Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s arrows'' ([[w:Effect system|effects]] sequencing through chaining of [[w:morphism|morphisms]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;arrowized&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.org/arrows/ Haskell Arrows introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

You may apply them to a ''Signal'' with the ''Automaton.run'' library function, specifying the ''Automaton'' and a default result for the case of lack of input value.

From Elm's Automaton library:&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/docs/Automaton.elm Automaton library]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- generator from a pure mapping function
pure : (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Automaton a b

-- generators from an initial state and a function of input and state
state : b -&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; Automaton a b   
hiddenState : s -&gt; (a -&gt; s -&gt; (s,b)) -&gt; Automaton a b

-- automaton application
run : Automaton a b -&gt; b -&gt; Signal a -&gt; Signal b

result_signal = run myAutomaton result_default input_signal


-- compose two automatons, chaining them together.
(&gt;&gt;&gt;) : Automaton a b -&gt; Automaton b c -&gt; Automaton a c

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Containers ===

See ref.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/Documentation.elm Documentation]&lt;/ref&gt;
* List, Set, Dict
* Maybe (for optional parameters, and partially defined function results, as Just v or Nothing)
* Either (error aware results, as Right correct_result or Left error)

To process a list of signals as one:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- combine a list of signals into a signal of their value list 
Signal.combine : [Signal a] -&gt; Signal [a]
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Polymorphism on Record types ====
See records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/Syntax.elm#records Syntax - records]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;

module MyModule where

names = [ getName dude, getName lady]

fullData = [show dude, show lady]

staticElement : Element
staticElement = flow down &lt;| map plainText
                                 [&quot;Names: &quot; ++ show names

&lt;/source&gt;
* embedding it in a ''div'' element

==== Parameterizing an Elm script ====

The ''port'' FFI (Foreign function interface with [[w:JavaScript|JavaScript]]) feature&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/learn/Syntax.elm#javascript-ffi JavaScript FFI]&lt;/ref&gt; gives the oportunity to supply parameters at the [[w:html|html]] level.
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module ElmMain where

port arg1 : String
port arg2 : Int
port arg3 : [String]

implode : [String] -&gt; String
implode = concat . intersperse &quot;, &quot;

main = asText &lt;| implode [arg1, show arg2, implode arg3]
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;!-- elm-runtime.js and js compiled modules 
      (if compiled with --make the ElmMain.js contains also the possibly imported user modules) --&gt;

  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;

  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;ElmMain.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;myId&quot; style=&quot;width:100;height:100;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- Elm container must be a &quot;div&quot; element and must be empty --&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;

var myPorts = {arg1: &quot;do re mi&quot;,   // after &quot;The Jackson five&quot; &quot;abc&quot; lyrics
               arg2: 123,
               arg3: [&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;you and me&quot;]  
               } ;

var myContainer = document.getElementById('myId') ; 

Elm.embed(Elm.ElmMain, myContainer, myPorts) ;
  &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;noscript&gt;Javascript is not enabled&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Signals (varying) examples ===
* ''lift'': is like [[w:Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s ''fmap'' for Signals
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
lift : (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Signal a -&gt; Signal b
&lt;/source&gt;
* ''lift&amp;lt;N&amp;gt;'' : applies a function of N values to N Signals; it acts like [[w:Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s Applicative ''liftA&amp;lt;N&amp;gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Applicative_functor Haskellwiki - Applicative functor]&lt;/ref&gt;
* (&lt;~) and (~) are Elm replacements for Haskell's infix Applicative operators (&amp;lt;$&amp;gt;) and (&amp;lt;*&amp;gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm-lang.org/blog/announce/0.7.elm#do-you-even-lift Elm v.0.7 release notes] Section: &quot;Do you even lift?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Password double field retype checker ====

Note, as of Elm 0.10 Strings are no longer lists of characters, so the above becomes something more like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;

import Graphics.Element as Elem
import String as S

-- button color modifier (pointfree)
passwdOkColour : String -&gt; String -&gt; Element -&gt; Element
passwdOkColour passwd1 passwd2 = 
    if S.length passwd1 &gt;= 6 &amp;&amp; passwd1 == passwd2
    then Elem.color green 
    else Elem.color red
 
display field1Elem field2Elem submitButtonElem =
    field1Elem `above` field2Elem `above` submitButtonElem
 
prependLabel = beside . plainText

dynamicElement : Signal Element
dynamicElement = 
    let (field1ElemSignal, fld1StateSignal) = Input.password &quot;Type password (min. 6 characters)!&quot;
        labeledField1Signal = lift (prependLabel &quot;passwd: &quot;) field1ElemSignal
        (field2ElemSignal, fld2StateSignal) = Input.password &quot;Retype password!&quot;
        labeledField2Signal = lift (prependLabel &quot;control: &quot;) field2ElemSignal
        (submitButton, _) = Input.button &quot;Submit&quot;
        coloredButSignal = constant submitButton 
                         |&gt; lift3 passwdOkColour fld1StateSignal fld2StateSignal 
    in lift3 display labeledField1Signal labeledField2Signal coloredButSignal
 
main = dynamicElement
&lt;/source&gt;

== Tip ==

Hi Aldnonymous, as seen above, you have gotten the reviewer rights. Here's a handy tip: Use the rollback feature for vandalism and &quot;reject changes&quot; for good faith edits that did not fit in the page properly or appropriately. --[[User:Goldenburg111|goldenburg111]] ([[User talk:Goldenburg111|talk]]) 13:39, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
:Well you know I like Undo rather than rollback I love adding advice on edit summary to let them know whattowhat and how to do something, thanks for the advice :D--[[User:Aldnonymous|Aldnonymous]] ([[User talk:Aldnonymous|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Aldnonymous|contribs]]) 13:44, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
::You can also do that with the &quot;reject changes&quot; :-) --[[User:Goldenburg111|goldenburg111]] ([[User talk:Goldenburg111|talk]]) 13:50, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

== Please undo page move to [[ Algebra/Factoring polynomials]] ==

I moved this page, not noticing that I had followed a link from Wikiversity, and thus thinking that I was there, where this move would have been SOP. I would create [[Template:Move undo]] as I am doing on Wikiversity, to request uncontroversial undo of a move, and avoid the need for a request here. But I can't find out how to create a Template here. The process I'm accustomed to (Search for the template name and then follow the create page link) doesn't work here as it does elsewhere I'm accustomed to. Thanks. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Abd|contribs]]) 15:10, 1 February 2014 (UTC)

== Grsecurity - Rename or delete old page ==

The Grsecurity book has two appendix pages, [[Grsecurity/Appendix/Sysctl_Options|Sysctl Options]] (old, out-of-date) and [[Grsecurity/Appendix/Sysctl_Options_v2|Sysctl Options v2]] (new and up-to-date). I would like to get rid of the older Sysctl Options page and keep Sysctl Options v2. Also, if possible, I would prefer that the URL for Sysctl_Options_v2 was changed to Sysctl_Options. My understanding is that only an admin can do these changes. What procecure should I follow here?

      <text xml:space="preserve">How to Multiply Matrices

A Matrix is an array of numbers:

A Matrix 
A Matrix
(This one has 2 Rows and 3 Columns)

To multiply a matrix by a single number is easy:

Matrix Multiply Constant

These are the calculations:
2×4=8	2×0=0
2×1=2	2×-9=-18
We call the number (&quot;2&quot; in this case) a scalar, so this is called &quot;scalar multiplication&quot;.

Multiplying a Matrix by Another Matrix
But to multiply a matrix by another matrix you need to do the &quot;dot product&quot; of rows and columns ... what does that mean? Let me show you with an example:

To work out the answer for the 1st row and 1st column:

Matrix Multiply

The &quot;Dot Product&quot; is where you multiply matching members, then sum up:

(1, 2, 3) • (7, 9, 11) = 1×7 + 2×9 + 3×11 = 58

We match the 1st members (1 and 7), multiply them, likewise for the 2nd members (2 and 9) and the 3rd members (3 and 11), and finally sum them up.

Want to see another example? Here it is for the 1st row and 2nd column:

Matrix Multiply

(1, 2, 3) • (8, 10, 12) = 1×8 + 2×10 + 3×12 = 64

We can do the same thing for the 2nd row and 1st column:

(4, 5, 6) • (7, 9, 11) = 4×7 + 5×9 + 6×11 = 139

And for the 2nd row and 2nd column:

(4, 5, 6) • (8, 10, 12) = 4×8 + 5×10 + 6×12 = 154

And we get:

Matrix Multiply

DONE!

Why Do It This Way?
This may seem an odd and complicated way of multiplying, but it is necessary!

I can give you a real-life example to illustrate why we multiply matrices in this way.

Example: The local shop sells 3 types of pies.
Beef pies cost $3 each
Chicken pies cost $4 each
Vegetable pies cost $2 each
And this is how many they sold in 4 days:
Matrix Multiply Constant
Now think about this ... the value of sales for Monday is calculated this way:
Beef pie value + Chicken pie value + Vegetable pie value
$3×13 + $4×8 + $2×6 = $83
So it is, in fact, the &quot;dot product&quot; of prices and how many were sold:
($3, $4, $2) • (13, 8, 6) = $3×13 + $4×8 + $2×6 = $83
We match the price to how many sold, multiply each, then sum the result.
 
In other words:
The sales for Monday were: Beef pies: $3×13=$39, Chicken pies: $4×8=$32, and Vegetable pies: $2×6=$12. Together that is $39 + $32 + $12 = $83
And for Tueday: $3×9 + $4×7 + $2×4 = $63
And for Wednesday: $3×7 + $4×4 + $2×0 = $37
And for Thursday: $3×15 + $4×6 + $2×3 = $75
So it is important to match each price to each quantity.
 
Now you know why we use the &quot;dot product&quot;.
 
And here is the full result in Matrix form:
Matrix Multiply
They sold $83 worth of pies on Monday, $63 on Tuesday, etc.
(You can put those values into the Matrix Calculator to see if they work.)
Rows and Columns
To show how many rows and columns a matrix has we often write rows×columns.

Example: This matrix is 2×3 (2 rows by 3 columns):
A Matrix
When we do multiplication:

The number of columns of the 1st matrix must equal the number of rows of the 2nd matrix.
And the result will have the same number of rows as the 1st matrix, and the same number of columns as the 2nd matrix.
Example:
Matrix Multiply
In that example we multiplied a 1×3 matrix by a 3×4 matrix (note the 3s are the same), and the result was a 1×4 matrix.
In General:

To multiply an m×n matrix by an n×p matrix, the ns must be the same, 
and the result is an m×p matrix.



Order of Multiplication
In arithmetic we are used to:

3 × 5 = 5 × 3
(The Commutative Law of Multiplication)

But this is not generally true for matrices (matrix multiplication is not commutative):

AB ≠ BA

When you change the order of multiplication, the answer is (usually) different.

Example:
See how changing the order affects this multiplication:
Matrix Multiply Order
Identity Matrix
The &quot;Identity Matrix&quot; is the matrix equivalent of the number &quot;1&quot;:

Identity Matrix
A 3x3 Identity Matrix
It is &quot;square&quot; (has same number of rows as columns),
It has 1s on the diagonal and 0s everywhere else.
It's symbol is the capital letter I.
It is a special matrix, because when you multiply by it, the original is unchanged:

A × I = A

I × A = A</text>

A Wikibooks user has queries the above book which you recently created.  It is thought that the page does not appear to be a book or part of a book.  I would suggest making the page more book-like with sub-pages, table of contents, etc.  If you feel that the page should actually be part of a different book then please let me know and we can move it to a more appropriate place.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:45, 23 February 2014 (UTC)

::Hi Goldenburg111, per [[m:User:COIBot/XWiki/lelandstanfordjunior.com]] they are adding the link to many articles, which is kind of link spam. I find very little information on the website, if the wiki books community agrees to keep the link, i have no problem.--[[User:Shanmugamp7|Shanmugamp7]] ([[User talk:Shanmugamp7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shanmugamp7|contribs]]) 18:11, 23 February 2014 (UTC)

HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE WEBSITE?  
What do you mean by &quot;very little information on the website&quot;? 

What I have an issue with is, there are at least 5 other links in the book that purport to do the exact same thing as this link:  provide etch rates for users, free of charge.  
Some of the other links (eg: virginia semiconductor) is a company with something to sell. I personally don't care, but the information provided is quite similar (though not a duplicate), and agruably commercial. 
Other links go to pages with tables, or academic papers, all providing the same kind of information-  Etch rates.  

If I am a user of the book, the first thing I want to know is a little background on the etch that I need to perform, which is provided in the book.  The next thing I need is a way to determine the etch rate.  This pretty fundamental, if you've ever worked in a fabrication facility.  That information is missing, mostly.  I believe that the links provided, most of them, are useful in some way.  But there is no explanation of how the edit I made is any different than the other ones already present.  I also fail to see how it is not useful.  If you actually went to the site, you'd click another link to see a whole page of background on KOH etching, which extends the discussion present in the book.  I don't think it would be appropriate, from a detail level, to include all of that in the book (?), but it seems useful as an externally linked extension of the book.  

As a side note, it is very, very discouraging to try to contribute something useful, and have to deal with this process.  Don't get me wrong, I very much value the work that some people do to sanitize the real &quot;spam&quot; that gets posted, and I have seen it.  That is extremely valued and appreciated.  But splitting hairs like this only drives people away from making contributions.  If you don't like it, try IMPROVING it first, rather than just clicking &quot;undo&quot;.

BTW, &quot;many links&quot;, as you state, is exactly TWO to this external  page, one from this book and one from a general etching page that is related.  And there were two more to another differnt page on the same site, again linked from closely related pages that have been suggested to merge.  Is that considered excessive?  Especially when they are quite relevant?

== Please don't just blindly accept changes ==

You recently approved an edit to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters]] that was, in fact, vandalism. Someone, or to be precise, two someones, were replacing names of book characters with their own names, and a third created himself as a character. You then approved those edits.

It's not enough that an edit be grammatically correct. If a link to a character is altered to call out a different character, or an entirely new link is added, it is quite possible that someone is playing silly buggers, and that should not be approved. Thank you. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:42, 16 April 2014 (UTC)

=Grenham Opening=
This is the '''Grenham Opening''' 1.Nc3 h6, named after the Irish player Sean Grenham. In 2001 a &quot;mystery GM&quot; playing at the I.C.C.(Internet Chess Club) was beating all Grand Masters (GMs) and International Masters (IMs) with this opening for several months. GM Nigel Short lost several games to this mystery player using this opening, and he had a theory from chats he and this player had after their games that this was in fact Bobby Fischer, trying to prove that you can win at the highest levels in chess even with random openings and in this way promoting Fischer Random Chess, otherwise known as Chess 960.

The Grenham, although arguably dubious, works very well as a shock tactic and black will usually enjoy a psychological edge over his opponent.

This move is generally used by the very practical player that has a lack of interest in positional play, in many ways it can be considered an interesting tactic as it eliminates all mainstream theory from the opening.

White's usual response to the Grenham is 2. e4, gaining control over the centre and allowing development of the queen and kingside bishop. Black has several responses to this, 2...g5, the Grenham Dragon being the most popular.

I believe the title &quot;System Identification&quot; of this chapter might be a bit misleading. I came here looking for tools for system parameter identification, but this is just an intro to systems, more like &quot;Systems 101&quot;. Shouldn't this be changed?

== Usability, and reliability ==

I have noticed more often that there are many book that are not completed that are useful to many people.  I wait and think for a few weeks that there will be a user that would complete the book ,but no one completes it and even if there is a change it would be a addition of just a single sentence which is useless.  For this reason I suggest that wikibooks administrators and Wikibook moderators should be involved in the completion of the books since they are the ones who mostly keep this site running.

: Contributing to a book requires understanding of its subject.  Contributing to an ''existing'' book also requires understanding of the book.  Writing a book is actually quite a difficult task; I'm involved, for instance, with the [[Conlang]] book, which was started almost ten years ago and I have been contributing to for about six, and we're still working, slowly and carefully, on how it should be organized.  In the longish term I hope to build interactive tools to help people with the specialized tasks of writing particular books, but that's still a ways off.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:14, 2 February 2014 (UTC)
:And most people who come here are either a school class project working for a fixed period - and then the book is abandoned, or they want to write their own book and lose steam. There's no chance of the handful of administrators completing all the books here. In any case, there's no need to be an admin to contribute to a book.

== [[:Category:Books with print version]] dynamicity ==

Currently it's quite fastidious to create a book printable version page, and even more to maintain it when its pages change. That's why I propose to reduce this time to one minute by using the [[Template:printable]] which uses [[Module:Printable version]], to get the full book in real time without any effort.

Actually something similar is already used [//pt.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Internet/Imprimir&amp;action=edit in the Portuguese version], and I've also proposed my short module [//fr.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Programmation_XML/Version_imprimable&amp;action=edit to the French one] today. 

The difference between these two sites and here is that over there each table of contents is on its book subpage (eg: [[:fr:MySQL/Sommaire]]), in absolute paths ([//en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Git&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=2565249 not relative like here]), and called from the main page, and the printable version, and eventually a [[:fr:MySQL/Introduction|navigation bar on the right]].

== Travel Guides ==

Greetings from [[:voy:|Wikivoyage]]!

I was just having a quick look through Wikibooks' catalogue when I noticed that you have a number of [[Travel_Guides_bookshelf#Travel_guides|travel guides]] and [[:Category:Tourism|tourism topics]] on your shelves; most of which haven't been altered for a little while.

I wondered how you'd feel about merging at least some of these into Wikivoyage - many have direct analogues, whilst others could form starting points for new guides.

Of course, I fully understand if you'd rather these topics remained on Wikibooks - I'm certainly not advocating some sort of Wiki-imperialism, it would just be nice to see them as part of a larger guide where they're more likely to be updated.

Either way, it would be nice to hear from you. Please feel free to call in over on [[:voy:|WV]] and say 'hello'! :)

: Well hi there.

: The page you want is [[Subject:Tourism]]; we use subject pages instead of bookshelves, nowadays.

: I'm not too familiar with your format over at Wikivoyage.  I might have guessed (but wouldn't have bet anything on) that the Wikivoyage format would be different from a full book; but even if that were true, not everything we have here ''is'' a full book, as lots of it is in a fairly early stage of development.

: The procedure to propose moving the content of a book altogether to another sister would, I would think, be a transwiki proposal at [[WB:RFD]].  Naturally, material can be imported from one project to another using Special:Import even if it's to be left intact on the original project; we often import stuff from Wikipedia to here.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 04:55, 5 February 2014 (UTC)

Let us build its soul, let us build its body&lt;br/&gt;
For the Great Indonesia

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Physical Description ===
Tolkien had changed the specifics overtime, but '''Balrogs''' retained many notable characteristics. They are large, muscular humanoids, with black bodies and usually flames coming from bodily parts (Mostly the head). No mention of clothes or armor is mentioned with the Balrogs, but they are noted to wield a variety of weapons, including flaming swords, flaming whips with many thongs, and blackened maces and axes.

Other interpretations are based on comments Tolkien had made throughout his texts, with Durin's Bane considered &quot;a thing of slime&quot; after being quenched in the waters below Moria. The biggest discussion is on whether or not Balrogs had wings (Or were capable of flight.), as Tolkien had used both metaphor and description to describe the wings of Balrogs, and alternating on the same page: 

 &quot;His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings.&quot; 
—The Lord of the Rings, II:5, &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-dûm&quot; 

and 

 &quot;...suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall...&quot; 
—Ibid. 

Like most discussions, the image is mostly up to interpretation of the readers, and either description appears to be correct as the other. Without Tolkien himself to mediate, it is possible that the discussion will continue as long as Tolkien has readers. Visual interpretations tend to follow the Winged argument, and present Balrogs with wings, though often unusable for flight.

=== Notable Balrogs ===
Across Tolkien's ''Legendarium'', there are very few Balrogs of note, and only one was named. (May contain spoilers)

==== Gothmog ====
Gothmog was mentioned in the ''Quenta Silmarillion'', and took part in some of the battles that took place, primarily the Second (Dagor-nuin-Giliath) and Fifth (Nírnaeth Arnoediad) battles. ''Gothmog'' itself is Sindarin for &quot;Dread Oppressor&quot;

==== Durin's Bane ====
During the Third Age, the dwarves in Khazad-Dum had delved to deep in their search for Mithril, and awoke the sleeping Balrog below. Known only by titles given to it by others, such as &quot;Nameless Terror&quot;, &quot;Flame of Udun&quot; and &quot;Durin's Bane&quot;, the Balrog had killed many in Khazad-dum, including Durin VI and giving him the name &quot;Durin's Bane&quot; when he awoke. He was finally finished after a fight with Gandalf beginning at the Bridge of Khazad-dum and ending atop a peak inside Durin's Tower.

== Defining growth and development ==
Development is a multidimensional qualitative concept that refers to an improvement in living standards in an economy encompassing material consumption, education and health, as well as environmental concerns. Development involves poverty reduction, increased employment opportunities for the individual and a more equitable distrubution of income.

Development focuses attention on the individual and on the three dimension of well-being, which are:

* '''&lt;u&gt;health&lt;/u&gt;''': the ability to live a long and healthy life,
* '''&lt;u&gt;education&lt;/u&gt;''': the ability to read, write, and acquire knowledge, and
* '''&lt;u&gt;income&lt;/u&gt;''': command over the income needed for a decent life.

The term sustainable development focuses attention on intergenerational equity along with environmental, social, and economic issues. A widely accepted definition is: &quot;development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability for future generations to meet their own needs.&quot; A development process is typically considered unsustainable when insufficient attention is paid to the environmenetal consequences as well as to the resulting changes in the distribution of income. Ignoring these dimensions threatens to reverse any progress made.

Economic growth, on the other hand, is a purely quantitive concept. Growth refers to increases in the real GDP (total output) of an economy through time. Growth and development are related by at the same time very different. Growth does not necessarily imply development. A country may grow without any development objective being achieved. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has described four types of growth to avoid, defined as:

* jobless, where employmenet opportunities for the poor do not expand,
* ruthless, where income inequality widens,
* futureless, where natural resources are wasted and the impact of the environment is neglected, and
* voiceless, where individual empowerment lags behind.

On the other hand, development typically necessitates growth. Even though some limited improvement in living standards may be achieved without any growth taking place, long-term progress on the development front requires that developing countries grow.

== Sources of long-term growth ==
A useful way of remembering the sources of growth is to realise that output may grow if all of the following conditions apply:

* the amount of available resources increase, 
* the quality of available resources increase, 
* the available technology improves, and
* the framework within which economic activity takes place (referred to as the instutional framework) improves.

Growth may take place as a result of the following factors:

* More or improved natural resources (land) becomes available. This usually implies either the discovery of new mineral or oil deposits or the improvement of existing land. Irrigation, fertilisation and improved land management may all improve the quality of existing land and contribute to growth. An increase in the natural capital may lead to growth. Remember, though, that many poor countries rich in natural resources have grown spectacularly while several rich countries with abundant natural resources have miserably failed to grow.
* There is investment in physical capital. New factories, machinery and equipment increase the physical stock of capital. As a result, labour productivity (defined as output per worker) increases. Also, increased public investments in infrastructure such as roads, ports, communications, power supplies, water, and sanitation facilitate and also lower the cost of economic activity.
* The labour force growth. A larger labour force means more manpower while a larger population increases the demand side of doemstic markeys. However, a larger labour force may not be able to find productive employment. In addition, short-term growth may result frm better utilisation of existing idle human (and other) resources.
* Investment in human resources can be exert a most powerful effect on growth as it has a direct positive effect on labour productivity. Improving health services and increasing the stock of human capital, defined as the experience, skills, and education embodied in the labour force of a country, are considered the best policy choices to achieve growth and development.
* Technological progress is a very influential determinant of growth. If labour is the relatively abundant resource then labour-saving technologies where high output levels are achieved with the same quantity of labour are considered 'inappropriate' as this leads to the UNDP's category of jobless growth. Employing the 'appropriate' technology (which relies on the relatively abundant factor) to accelrate the growth and development process is a highly complex issue, especially if environmental considerations are included.
* AN institutional framework conducive of growth and development is devised. The instiutional framework of a country refers to the set of rules and laws, norms, and conventions within which economic activity is conducted. There is no unique set of institutions that singularly promotes growth. However, some instiutions have worked better than others. Attempts to transplate a template of westernised institutions into developing countries may nit prove fruitful.

== Charactersitics of developing countries ==
Developing countries in our world are many and diverse. Their initial conditions, geography, climate, history, political systems, institutions and available resources vary significantlky. This means that the list of characteristics that follows does not apply to all developing countries, or to the same extent for them all. It is very dangerous to generalise as there are huge differences in these characterstics between developing countries and within each one.

=== Per capital real income levels ===
Extremely low per capita real income levels characterise many developing countries. Low per capita real income levels result in low saving and so low investments. Low invesments in natural, human and physical capital lead to low productivity gains and so low incomes, creating a vicious circle of poverty that extends across generations and which may require some kind of intervention.

The degree of income inequality is generally greater in developing than in developed economies. Income distrubtion is often highly unewual, with the top quintile (20%) of people often receiving 10 to 50 times more than the bottom 40%.

The percentage of people in absolute poverty, defined as the specific minimum income needed to satisfy the basic physical needs to assure 'continued survival,' is also high in developing countries. Interestingly enough, there is recent reserach showing that often an increase in income will not lead to more food purchased. These may be households at or even below poverty line who will instead choose to spend any extra income earned on a television or a cell phone.

In addition, as a result of very low per capital income levels, larger segments of the popuilation suffer frm ill health, malnutrition and debilitation diseases and infant mortality rates are also very high. Remember that there are significant variations both between and within developing countries.

=== Population growth and/or size ===
Many developing economies are still characterised by high population growth rates or, if the population growth rates are not very high, the size of their population may be very high. This may be the result of high birth rates (fertility) coupled with a reduction in death rates (mortality) because of improved health conditions. A major implication of high birth rates is that children under the age of 15 often make up almost one half of the total population. This means that the active labour force has to support almost twice as many children as it typically does in richer countries. In some developing countries a large proportion of the population is attracted to cities (urban centres) where most economic activity takes place in the informal sector (that is, where it is neither officially referested nor regulated).

=== Unemployment and underemployment ===
High unemployment is a common freature of most developing countries. Unemployment, especially in urban areas, may affect 10-20% of the labour force. On the other hand, the underemployed include those working less than they would like to as well as those who have near zero contribution to total output. In rural areas unemployment suffers from large seasonal variations. Unemployment is a much more complex problem in developing countries and the necessary policiy approahces go beyond traditional demand-side or pro-market supply-side prescriptions.

=== Dependence on the primary sector ===
Agriculture in developing countries contributes around 30% of GDP compared to less than 2% in high-income countries. AS per capital income levels rise the structure of demand changes, leading first to a rise in manufacturing and then to a rise in services. The share of services in high-income countries is around 70% of GDP. Of course, there are variations in the sturcture of output within each income group.

=== Dependence on exports of primary commodities ===
Since a significant proportion of output in low-income countries originates frm the primary sector, primary commodities often also form the basis of their exports to other nations. Some countries may even depend on exporting a single non-oil primary commodity.

== The Mellennium Development Goals ==
In 2000, world leaders promised to improve living standards in developing world by achieving eight UN Millennium Development Goals (MGDs) by 2015. These goals encompass education, health, gender and the nevironment and are stated as follows:

* eradicate extreme poverty and huger,
* achieve universal primary education,
* promote gender equality and empower women,
* reduce child mortiality,
* improve meternal heath,
* combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other disease,
* ensure environmental sutainability, and 
* develop a global partnership for development.

Progress has been made on several issues but for very many countries and regions these goals remain out of reach. The best way to monitor up-to-date progress on each of these goals is to visit the [http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/reports.shtml MGD website]. The World Development Report also includes useful information on the MDGs.

Bear in mind that one important drawback of these goals is that they overlook inequality and process freedoms. In addition, according to the World Bank, climate change and conflict may compromise the efforts to improve standards of living and to achieve these goals.</text>

This command does not work on PostGreSQL.

You will either need to provide Movies.Code (PK value) as 9 or in table definition set the column Movies.Code as SERIAL.
This will auto increment the Code column every time any record is added.

This will also mean that you need not provide the code values when entering sample data set for Movies table.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Potopt is [[w:Molecular dynamics|molecular dynamics]] software implemented in [[w:C11 (C standard revision)|ISO C11]] and utilizing [[w:Message Passing Interface|MPI]] for parallel processing.

This manual documents a pre-release version of the software, made available at 2014-02-26.  The details of both the implementation and user interface are still not settled, and are likely to change significantly before the first release.

== Synopsis ==

 $ perl yaml2pob.perl \
       &amp;lt; &lt;var&gt;Initial-state.yaml&lt;/var&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;var&gt;Initial-state.pob&lt;/var&gt; 
 $ mpirun -n &lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt; \
       potopt &lt;var&gt;Split&lt;/var&gt; [&lt;var&gt;Iterations&lt;/var&gt; [&lt;var&gt;Step&lt;/var&gt; [&lt;var&gt;Tau2&lt;/var&gt;]]] \
       &amp;lt; &lt;var&gt;Initial-state.pob&lt;/var&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;var&gt;Output.log&lt;/var&gt; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 

== Summary ==

Potopt is an ISO C11- and MPI-based (tested with GCC 4.8.2 and Open MPI 1.6.5, respectively) code that solves equations of motion for a system of (dimensionless) particles with user-specified masses, initial locations and velocities.  The equations are based on the [[w:Morse potential|Morse potential]], with parameters specified for each interacting pair of particles (which may mean the ones sharing a chemical bond, or otherwise related.)

The &lt;kbd&gt;-n &lt;var&gt;N&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt; parameter given to &lt;cite&gt;mpirun(1)&lt;/cite&gt; specifies the number of processes to run.  Refer to the documentation on the MPI implementation used for more information.

The &lt;var&gt;Split&lt;/var&gt; argument is currently mandatory and is a whitespace-delimited string of positive integer values specifying the number of particles to simulate with each process.  Naturally, these numbers should sum up to a total number of particles in the system considered, such as &lt;kbd&gt;22&lt;/kbd&gt; for modelling the 22-atom [[w:Graphene|graphene]] sample system [[#Availability|below]] within a single process (&lt;kbd&gt;-n 1&lt;/kbd&gt;), &lt;kbd&gt;'11 11'&lt;/kbd&gt; for two processes (&lt;kbd&gt;-n 2&lt;/kbd&gt;), &lt;kbd&gt;'7 8 7'&lt;/kbd&gt; for three (&lt;kbd&gt;-n 3&lt;/kbd&gt;), etc.

&lt;var&gt;Iterations&lt;/var&gt; is the number of iterations to do, and defaults to 64.  A value of 65536 or greater may be more practical.

&lt;var&gt;Step&lt;/var&gt; is the initial time step, in seconds, and defaults to &lt;code&gt;1e-18&lt;/code&gt; (or 1 [[w:Attosecond|as]]), although the values of around &lt;code&gt;2e-19&lt;/code&gt; may be a more suitable choice.  Nevertheless, the software will continuously try to find an optimal time step, based on the constraints set within &lt;code&gt;main_loop ()&lt;/code&gt; (check the &lt;var&gt;redo_p&lt;/var&gt; local variable there.)

&lt;var&gt;Tau2&lt;/var&gt; is the characteristic time the system should lose half of its kinetic energy, and defaults to &lt;code&gt;4e-18&lt;/code&gt; (or 4 as.)

== YAML-based input format ==

The simulation code requires a stream in an ad-hoc (and possibly platform-dependent) binary encoding, which is produced from a [[w:YAML|YAML]] stream with a helper &lt;code&gt;yaml2pob.perl&lt;/code&gt; Perl script.

The input YAML stream may look as follows (for a single six-membered [[w:Aromaticity|carbon ring]], ignoring the [[w:Hydrogen|hydrogen]] atoms.)

&lt;pre
&gt;---
xyz:
  - { a: 0, xyz: [ 0.0, 7.104999999999999e-11, 0 ] }
  - { a: 1, xyz: [ 1.2306220987776874e-10, 0.0, 0 ] }
  - { a: 2, xyz: [ 2.461244197555375e-10, 7.104999999999999e-11, 0 ] }
  - { a: 3, xyz: [ 0.0, 2.1315e-10, 0 ] }
  - { a: 4, xyz: [ 1.2306220987776874e-10, 2.842e-10, 0 ] }
  - { a: 5, xyz: [ 2.461244197555375e-10, 2.1315e-10, 0 ] }
bonds:
  - { a: 0, b: 1 }
  - { a: 0, b: 3 }
  - { a: 1, b: 2 }
  - { a: 2, b: 5 }
  - { a: 3, b: 4 }
  - { a: 4, b: 5 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;xyz&lt;/code&gt; section specifies the particles (atoms), while &lt;code&gt;bonds&lt;/code&gt; specifies the parameters to the [[w:Morse potential]] used to model [[w:Chemical bond|chemical bonds]].

The parameters are as follows.

; Particles
:* &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; – unique particle identifier (may be any string);
:* &lt;code&gt;xyz&lt;/code&gt; – particle’s initial location;
:* &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; – ''(optional)'' particle’s initial velocity; defaults to a zero vector;
:* &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; – ''(optional)'' particle’s mass; defaults to &lt;code&gt;1.660539e-27&lt;/code&gt;, or 1.660539 × 10⁻²⁷ g, which is a possible approximation for the mass of a single [[w:Carbon]] atom.
; Bonds
:* &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; – the identifiers of the particles sharing the bond;
:* &lt;code&gt;aa&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; – ''(optional)'' Morse potential parameters; default to &lt;code&gt;2.625e10&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1.421e-10&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;6.03105e-19&lt;/code&gt;, respectively, which are possible values for the C─C [[w:Single bond|single bond]].&lt;ref name=&quot;multiscale graphene&quot; /&gt;

''Please note'' that apart from the representation conversion, the Perl helper described will ''slightly alter'' both the initial locations and velocities of the particles, as per the &lt;var&gt;$perturb&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;$pert_v&lt;/var&gt; variables (specifying the [[w:Standard deviation|standard deviations]] for the respective changes) within the code.  This is intended as both a testing measure ''and'' a possible way to push the system off a local minimum, should the initial state correspond to one.

== The output ==

The resulting system state is sent to [[w:Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|stdout]], formatted as whitespace-separated values.  The values are ''mass'', ''location'' (3 values), and ''velocity'' (3 values.)

== Building ==

The Potopt executable can be built with a [[w:GNU Compiler Collection|GNU C compiler]], being run under [[w:Make (software)#Modern versions|GNU Make]] as follows.  (No Makefile required.)

 $ cp -- ns8xrqxiojtkiin4drpx4ne19y.c potopt.c 
 $ LC_ALL=C make CC=mpicc CFLAGS='-g -O2 -Wall -std=gnu11' \
       LDFLAGS=-lm   potopt 

Alternatively, the following simplistic &lt;code&gt;GNUmakefile&lt;/code&gt; file can be used, with the GNU Make invocation becoming &lt;code&gt;$ LC_ALL=C make potopt&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
VPATH   = $(srcdir)
CC      = mpicc
CFLAGS  = -g -O2 -Wall -std=gnu11
LDFLAGS = -lm

all: potopt
&lt;/source&gt;

== Bugs ==

The &lt;var&gt;Split&lt;/var&gt; argument should be made optional.

The simulation code reads a binary file in an ad-hoc, and possibly platform-dependent, encoding.  Using encodings specified in [[w:X.690|X.690]] (DER or BER), or perhaps [[w:NetCDF|NetCDF]], may be a better choice.

Worse still, while the simulation code reads the initial system state from a binary file (which, in turn, could be created from a [[w:YAML|YAML]]-based text stream), the resulting state is saved instead in a [[w:AWK|Awk-]] and [[w:Gnuplot|Gnuplot]]-friendly whitespace-separated values form, which requires a separate program (not hereby provided) to convert it into something suitable to continue the simulation.

Some details are reported to [[w:Standard streams#Standard error (stderr)|stderr]] on each iteration in a somewhat verbose and not readily parsable (with, say, Awk or Gnuplot) text format.  For tens of thousands of iterations, the size of the resulting stream may end up being tens of [[w:Mebibyte|mebibytes]].

There’s no proper error reporting.  The code instead relies on a bunch of &lt;code&gt;assert ()&lt;/code&gt; macro invocations.

There’s no proper command line interface, either.

Check also the &lt;code&gt;FIXME:&lt;/code&gt; comments within the code.

&lt;small&gt;''In Syria now, it is a time of division, violence and suffering. When we were there in November 2010 and in August 2011, we recorded many stories of cooperation and development.
''Nowadays, only sad and violent stories are narrated about this wonderful country. What then shall we do with these stories we collected in Syria in what now seems to be a different &quot;age&quot; altogether?''
''Well, we decided to re-edit the videos we had made, include them in the [[Development Cooperation Handbook|Handbook]] we are developing and share them through the Internet. These videos will help us remember what Syria was before the civil war. And we hope that these stories will help restore trust amongst communities in Syria, and build, amongst those who love this country, the motivation to do whatever they can to restore peace and cooperation.''&lt;br /&gt;

The interview was taken on August 2011 in Aleppo, Syria&lt;br /&gt;
We were introduced to him by [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Interviews/Paolo Dall'Oglio|Paolo Dall'Oglio]] who translated in Italian his interview&lt;br /&gt;


The NGOs that deal with
organizing the prayer
the study of Islamic sciences
generally are &quot;official&quot; NGOs

These &quot;official organizations are like cages
that enclose the persons
in roles and activities
that have specific delimitation

instead the action space for the &quot;non official&quot; NGOs
is much wider and tend towards universality

The charity.
It is generosity,
it is altruism
it is capacity to enjoy
the pleasure of sharing my possessions with others.
Charity comes in me when the spirituality increases
and enriches me with sense of responsibility for my neighbor.

When spirituality increases in me
I become generous with those who are poor,
with those who are ill, with those who do not have enough resources to live with dignity.

When spirituality increases
the society becomes more harmonious,
more just,
more beautiful.

When spirituality diminishes
conflicts increase.

Such a stand of solidarity with others
is totally independent to any allegiance to any specific religion.

When my spirituality is solid, is well rooted in me
it expresses itself as solidarity to others
independently to their ethnic or religious identities.

It is very painful to take notice to the fact
that some organizations like
Al Qaida , that have
a violent approach to religion
are well organized international.
while the organizations
that are building what we really need
that promote peace and spiritual
are much less funded
and do not receive international attention

Unfortunately in the majority of the cases
Unfortunately in most the cases
medias are not serving peace but the economical and political interests of those who are in power

What we need to do
is an open accesses to the those media
that work for peace education.

== Per capital income figures ==
Per capita GNI or per capita GDP represent measures of per capita income. The difference between GDP and GNI is that GNI excludes incomes earned domestically by foreign factors (which are paid abroad, for example the profits of multinational corporations) but it includes incomes earned abroad by nationals of the country. Per capita income figures are computed by dividing GNI or GDP of a country by the mid-year total population of the country. Usually, per capita income figures are also called PPP (purchasing power parity) dollars, sometimes referred to as 'international dollars,' which have same purchasing power over GDP as a conversion factor, and not the market exchange rate, is that cost of living may differ substantially between countries and market exchange rates do not necessarily adjust to capture these differences.

The World Bank uses per capita GNI to determine the following income classifications: low income was defined as $975 or less in 2008; middle income was $976 to $11,905; and high income was $11,906 or more. A further at GNI per capita - $3,855 - is made between lower-middle income and upper-middle income economies.

The classification is useful and may provide us with some information on the level of development of a country as there is a positive correlation between per capita income and social welfare. Few would question that Norway is more developed than Zimbabwe. But since growth in per capita income does not necessarily imply improved living standards, classification based on per capita income is also fraught with problems. Using per capita income may mask very significant differences between countries.

These are some issues to be aware of when using per capita income figures to determine the level of development of countries.

* Per capita income fails to incorporate income distribution considerations. Per capita income is just a simple average providing no information on whether income is equitably or very unequally distributed.
* Using per capita income figures does not take into account the value of the environmental degradation often associated with increased production. Te pressure on agriculture to produce more food products is responsible for soil erosion and the burning of forests. Industrialisation is also often accompanied by massive migration from rural to urban areas, leading to heavily polluted and congested cities. Emissions from industry and increased energy requirements also decrease the quality of life.
* Per capita income figures fail to include non-marketed subsistence production which may be relatively significant in some low-income countries. Non-marketed subsistence production refers to foods and other goods and services produced by a family for its own consumption. More generally, per capita income figures fail to include the size of parallel ('black' or shadow) economies in developing countries.
* Relying on per capita income also conceals useful information on the composition of output. Two economies with equal per capita income levels may differ with respect to living standards because of different output mix. A country that spends a large proportion of its GDP on, say, defence, devotes resources there that could have been used to otherwise in the production of pro-development goods. The value of leisure, a very important 'good' an individual may enjoy, is not included in the calculation of GNI or GDP. It makes a big difference to workers if the average working week is over 50 hours and they can seldom take a holiday, or if the working week is only 35 hours and everyone enjoys four weeks' paid leave every year.
* Lastly, per capita income does not include the value of the stream of services flowing from the accumulated social other capital of an economy that individuals enjoy. Living standards at any point in time are not affected just by the current income but also by the stock of accumulated wealth. For example, the existence of a high-quality and free public school system implies that households with children may devote more of their income to goods and services not related to education.

Despite these and other shortcomings, per capita income remains the best single indicator of development available but must be employed with caution in any analysis.

== Other single indicators ==
Single indicators of the level of development of a population include the following:

* Health-related indicators may be used, such as health expenditure per capita; life expectancy at birth (years); infant mortality (per 1,000 live births); mortality of children aged under fie years (per 1,000); malnutrition prevalence, weight, and /or height for age (of children under five years old); births attended by skilled health staff (% of total); maternal mortality ratio(per 100,000 live births); immunisation, DPT, and measles (% of children aged between 12 and 23 months); improved sanitation facilities (% of population with access); prevalence of HIV (% of population aged between 15 and 49 years); physicians (per 10,000 people); hospital beds (per 10,000 people).
* Education-related indicators may be taken into account, such as literacy rate (% of people aged 15 years and older); mean years of schooling (of people aged 25 years and older); expected years of schooling (years); expenditure per student, primary, secondary, and tertiary (% of GDP, per capita); pupil-teacher ratio, primary; ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education (%); school enrolment, primary secondary, and tertiary (%); trained teachers in primary education (% of total teachers).
* Other indicators include newspaper circulation per 1,000 population, energy consumption per capita, percentage of GDP derived from each sector of the economy and urban population.

An excellent source of current data on health, education, and other development-related indicators are the statistical tables at the end of the World Development Report published annually by the [http://www.data.worldbank.org/ World Bank].

== Composite indicators ==
No single indicator is powerful enough to illustrate satisfactorily the complex issue of development. It is therefore preferable to rely on several indicators synthesised into a single variable.

A number of composite indices have been devised. They integrate economic, social, and even political aspects of development. The most widely quoted and used composite indicator is the human development index (HDI). The HDI measures average achievements of a population in terms of health, education, and access to goods and services and was devised as a simple rival to GNP concentrating only on longevity, basic education, and minimal income. The HDI 'succeeded in challenging the hegemony of growth-centric thinking' (that is, it was successful in displacing per capita income as a summary measure of development).

The health dimension of the HDI is captured by life expectancy at birth. In 2010 the indicators used to measure progress in education have been revised and now include the mean years of schooling that a child of school entrance age could expect to receive if prevailing patterns of enrolment were to stay the same (instead of adult literacy and gross enrolment rate). Access to goods and services is measured by per capita income which in 2010 has also been revised and now refers to GNI per capita in PPP dollars, replacing GDP per capita. The reason for this change to GNI is that in a globalised world it is preferable to focus on the income of the residents of a country as this income may significantly differ from domestic production.

Major drawbacks of the HDI include:

* a reliance on national averages which conceals skewed distributions in the variables included within a population, and
* the absence of 'a quantitative measure of human freedom'

Being an average it may conceal important differences within a country. Women and rural populations as well as the very old and the very young often suffer disproportionately but this is not illustrated through the HID. In addition, environmental concerns are not addressed. It is possible for a country to have a high HDI and be 'unsustainable, undemocratic, and unequal.'

Note that three composite indicators were introduced by the UNDP in 2010 capturing multidimensional inequality (the inequality-adjusted HDI, known as the IHDI), gender disparities (the gender inequality index) and extreme deprivation (the multidimensional poverty index).

* The IHDI is a measure of human development that takes into consideration the extent of inequality in the country. Under perfect equality the HDI and the IHDI are equal. Inequality in the distribution of health, education, and income lowers the HDI on an average person in society below the aggregate HDI of the country (based on the UNDP Human Development Report, 2010).
* The gender inequality index attempts to reveal differences in the distribution of achievements between women and men in a country. Often women and girls are discriminated against in health, education, and in the labour market, which negatively affect their freedom.
* The multidimensional poverty index replaces the human poverty index. It complements money-based measures of poverty by considering 'multi deprivations and their overlap.' Low level of income is byt one dimension of the poverty experienced by people in many countries of the world − poverty extends to other dimensions such as poor health and nutrition, low education and skills, inadequate livelihoods, bad housing conditions, social exclusion and lack of participation. The multidimensional poverty index shows the number of people who are poor (suffering a given number of deprivations) and the numbe rof deprivations with which poor households typically struggle.</text>

== Education and health ==
Labour productivity is defined as output per worker, or the quantity of goods and services a worker can produce per hour of work. It critically depends on the education, skills, and training of workers as well as on the type of capital they use in the production process. Growth in productivity is the key to long-term growth which in turn is a prerequisite for development

Investments in human capital formation are necessary to achieve higher labour productivity, faster long-term growth and improved living standards. Better health and education increase labour productivity and allow individuals to have more, better, and higher-paid employment opportunities. Better education and health are also responsible for number external benefits (both are the most important examples of merit goods). Remember too that achieving better health and education are themselves development goals.

== Appropriate technology ==
Growth is necessary for any long-term progress in development but not all types of growth do lead to development. The technology employed determines whether any acceleration in growth will translate into human development gains or not.

In general, technologies can be distinguished into capital intensive or labour-intensive. Capital-intensive production process rely mostly on the use of physical capital (on machines) whereas labour-intensive production processes rely mostly on the use of labour (on workers). Remember that in many production process there is no choice: you cannot construct a labour-intensive oil refinery.

Since in most developing countries labour is the relatively abundant factor of production, it follows that appropriate technologies are labour-intensive. A labour-intensive technology translates to increased employment and income generation for the population of the country and an exit from poverty. On the other hand, capital-intensive technologies lead to what is referred to as jobless growth, which is a type of growth that does not lead to improved living standards.

== Credit and microcredit ==
The importance of credit and micro-credit institutions lies in the simple fact that typically, if you cannot borrow, you cannot make any investment in physical, natural, or human capital. It follows that a functional credit system is vital in breaking the poverty cycle explained earlier.

Credit institutions induce people to save, as they offer not only safety for whatever income people do not spend but also a rate of return. Banks allow people to borrow money that can be used to increase their human capital or to start a small business, which may enable them to break the poverty cycle. Unfortunately, a functional credit system is not enough as very often it is also the absence of well-defined property rights that prevents poor people from borrowing from commercial banks.

Microcredit, on the other hand, focuses on making available very small loans to the very poor, helping them to start a small business or expand an existing one or meet an emergency arising from disease, theft, or bad weather. The pioneer of microfinance is Bangladeshi economist Muhammad Yunus who created the Grameen Bank several decades ago. Yunus won the Nobel Peace prize for his efforts in 2006. The Nobel Committee adopted the view that reducing the gap between the rich and the poor is necessary to crease conflict in the world.

Many microfinance loans have been offered to women who have not only shows that they spend the money carefully and roductively but also that they are more likely to pay the loans back. Lending money to women has helped them in their empowerment. Their participation in such programmes gives them greater bargaining power and enables them to ttake part in family decision making whilst it also increases their mobility.

Microfinance has been considered to paly a significant but rather limited role in the development process of nations. Microcredit has lately come under attack: 

{{quote|...most borrowers do not appear to be climbing out of poverty, and a sizable minitority is getting trapped in a spiral of debt, according to studies and analysts|New York Times, 2011}}

== Women and their empowerment ==
Policies that aim at improving gender equity have been found to improve human development. Not only will deprived girls and women benefit from such policies but also the growth and development process will accelerate: 

{{quote|Human development if not engedered, is endagered.|Mahbub-ul Haq}}

There are numerous routes through which this can be accomplished. Educating girls is considered one of the most is significant investments for a developing  country as it resutls in even greater, gender-specific benefits. An educated mother will enjoy higher earning ability outside the home for each extra year of schooling. She will have fewer children so will create conditions for capital deepening (which means more capital will be available per worker), resulting in even higher long-term productivity and output gains. Her children will be healthier and she will make sure that her children are also educated, creating a virtuious circle. Educating women decreases mortality in children younger than five years old, decreasing the costs of health-care intervention.

Lasty, better and more educated women can lead to higher women's participation in the labour force as well as in politics, allowing them to influence policy.

== The distribution of income ==
High and rising income inequality is considered a major barrier to economic development. It follows that policies aiming at reducining income inequality and making growth inclusive will encourage development. Poverty reduction depends not only on income growth but also on how incoem is distributed: poverty is reduced and development is achieved if there is growth accompanied by narrowing income inequality.

A more equitable distribution of incoem will make it easier to reach a consensus among different population groups. This is a necessary  condition for a government to be willing and able to undertake successfully the required institutional and economic reforms that accelerate growth. Lower income inequality decreases the prevalance of corruption in a coutnry and corruption is considered a major obstacle to the development process as it increases the costs of doing business and it distorys efficiency. Trust between economic agents increase, also decreasing the cost and icnreasing the likelihood of doing business, another necessary condition for growth to accelerate. A more equitable distribution of income will decrease the number of the very poor so that more people will have access to education and health resources and so become more productive members of society. The probability of civil unrest will be lower, decreasing the risks for investors and leading to more domestic and foreign investment spending in the country. Lower income inequality may accelerate savigns and result in more investment and greater demand for locally produced goods and services, which may increase income and further decrease inequality.</text>

== Trade-related barriers ==
=== Barriers to primary export-led growth ===
Overspecialisation on a narrow range of primary exports cannot effectively lead to the way of economic development. Here are some of the reasons for this:

* Demand for most primary exports is income inelastic and, as a result, market for such products in high-income countries do not grow fast enoug to help accelerate growth.
{{IB/HigherLevelOnly|
* The terms of trade of countries exporting primary products will deteriorate exporting primary products will deteriorate in the long run. They wil need to export a greater colume of primary exports to be able to import one unit of manufacturing goods. However, this will only lead to a further decrease in the price of these primary products as most of these markeys are competitive. 
* Export earnings may exhibit significant year-to-year fluctuations as prices of farm products are affected by the weather and other random factors. This may mean that domestic aggregate demand becomes unstable and investment spending is more risky.
* Primary exports may be dominated by a gew multinationals and middlemen so that linages with the rest of the economy may prove inefficient.
}}
* Prices received for many primary products have decreased t hrough time. FOr example, technology and an increase in the number of coffee-producing countries have pushed down the world price for coffee.
* Agricultural exports have to face the trade protection that advanced economies (the USA, the EUropean Union, and Japan) grant their farmers in the form of subsidies. The resulting inability to access these markeys is a more general barrier developing countries face. The statement does not indiscrimantely apply to all developing countries, though, as many falsely believe. It mainly applies to the so called Cairns Group of developing countries, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, and Urugua which are mostly middle-income countries with a strong comparative advantage in agriculture. It follows that the main beneficiaries of liberalising trade in agriculture would be this grup of countries. The last developed countries as defined by the UN (which include all countries in SUb-Saharan Africa; Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao, Maldives, and Nepal in Asia; and Haiti in Central America) will actually be hurt by this liberalisation, the main reason for this being that most of these countries are net food importers and elimination of agricultural subsidies will translate into higher food prices for them.

== Trade-related strategies for growth and development ==
=== The strategy of protection: import-substitution industrilisation (ISI) ===
In the 1950s it was thought that the problem of development was a structural problem in that developing countries relied to heavily on the primary sector and did not have a manufacturing sector. The greation of an industrial base to substitute domestically manufactured goods for imports became known as ISI. The goods targeted were non-durable manufactured goods (for example textiles) that were simple to produce and were for doemstic consumption. Trade barriers were erected to protect the newly established domestic firms. These barriers would stay in place until the firms grew sufficiently in size anad acquired the necessary know-how to lower averagecosts. Trade barriers were reduced when the firms were able to compete with importans and surive within the domestic markets.

Typically, the exchange rate was kept overvalued so that prices of necessary imported materials and intermediate products (machines and other manufactured inputs) used by the infant industries were artifically low.

Several problems are associated with an inward-oriented strategy. Since the domestic industry had its own 'captive' markey to sell its products, it never had the incentive to become efficient. The price and cost disciplines that competitive imposes on firms were totally absent. In some cases, low-quality, high-cost, and high-priced goods were produced.

The overvalued exchange rate acted as a tax on traditional primary exports as f armers earned less omestic currency for each dollar of primary exports. Poverty for large segments of the population therefore increased. In some developing countries the ISI strategy created a priviledge for élite which became more and more powerful as the industrial sector grew. In many cases, the protective trade barriers were never eliminated. In addition, the new established industries were often capital-intensive, employing inappropriate technologies which led to jobless growth as minimal employment opportunities were created. Remember that jobless growth is a type of growth to avoid as development does not follow.

=== Export promotion: outward-oriented strategies ===
In some East Asian countries, including those known as the four East Asian Tigers (Korea, Taiwan, Hong King, and Singapore), the structural change that the ISI strategy represented was follow by an attempt to export the simple, non-durable, manufactured goods these countries had been producing for their markey. These, and later other developing countries, adopted an outward orientation.

In this process, the role of the state varied among countries but, in all of them, it played a sifnificant, complementary role. It provided guidance and assistance to the private firms buy only if they achieved specific performance standards typically associated with export targets. These firms were forced to produce low-price, high-quality goods in order to continue to enjoy any state subsidies or cheaper loans from banks.

Export promotion is not sufficient to promote development and to ensure the sustainability of the process. The state in these countries invested heavily in education, slowly creating a more productive labour force with higher skills. The state also ensured that the fruits of economic growth were enjoyed by all. This meant that these countries avoided the costs associated with rising income inequality.

The first Asian country to intiate such an approach to the growth and development problem was Japan. It was followed by the four East ASian Tigers (and other countries, such as Malaysia, INdonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, have been added to this list). China and India are the current starts of the export-or outward-oriented strategy.
==== Advantages of outward-oriented strategies ====
* Focusing initially on the production and export of simple, manufactured non-durable goods changed the structure of these economies. Employment opportunities increased for the rural migrants, asthese industries were mostly labour intensive.
* The export revenues earned alleviated problems with the balance of payments as they were used to finance the importantion of necessary intermediate and capital goods. There was less danger of the economy running into foreign exchange and foreign debt problems. Rising export revenues also increased aggregate demand (AD), so they can fuel growth in output and incomes.
* Focusing on the larger export markets forced firms to grow in size and acquire economies of scale (EOS). This is especially important for small countries.
* Firms were forced to learn more about manufacturing their products more efficiently. International competition provided the stimulus. The state also invited technical assistance from abroad but it usually limited contracts so that they lasted no more than three years, forcing domestic firms to learn the necessary technology. Operating successfully in world markets enable firms to acquire the markey, financial, managerial and, most importantly, entrpreneurial skills. Exposure to world competition allowed a local entrepreneurial class to evolve and mature.
* Through varing degrees of state guidance these economies slowly shifted their comparative advantage and production to more sophisticated and complex manufactured products and later to knowledge-based and technology-intensive products. Their economies therefore diversified and were more insulated frm industry-specific risks.

==== Possible disadvantages of outward-oriented growth ====
* Since the growth process is driven by exports, it depends on how fast the adcanced economies are growing. If their incomes are rising fast then they will be absorbing more imports which are the exports of the developing countries. A deep recession in the USA or in EUrope, though, will be costly as it will slow down the process, especially if domestic demand is weak and the government is not in a position to adopt expansionary fiscal policiy. In response to the 2008 global crisis, China was not able to adopt a huge fiscal stimulus programme, but not all countries were able to do the same.
* Outward-oriented growth must successfully overcome the barriers created by trade proteciton in developed countries.
* Outward-oriented strategies may lead to worsening income distribution as the rural sectory may be left behind. A larger share of national income will accrue to those involved in the export sector. It follows that only if there are redistributive policies in place will development ensue (using the term 'redistributive policies' in its broad sense here − that is, including spending on better health and education).
* The drive to produce cheaply for export markets may lead policy makers to ignore the costs of environmental degragation. This is very evident in China where export-driven growth is seriously damaging the natural resource base of the country and generating major environmental costs, undermining the sustainability of the country's long-term growth and development prospects.
* Achieving outward-oriented growth forces policy makers to keep the exchange rate artifically undervalued to provide an extra competitive edge to their exports, risking not only rising protectionist sentiment abroad but also inflation at home.
* Focusing on outward-oriented growth may lead policy makers to postpone the creation of a social safety net that would include state pensions and health insurance, as the growth process does not rely on te ability of the population to spend on domestic goods and services.

=== Preferential trading agreements ===
Regional integration among developing countries is often referred to as south-south integration. Originally, in the 1960s and 1970s, developing countries had attempted to create a number of preferential trading agreements as a way of reducing the cost of ISI through opening their markets to other developing countries. A block would increase the size of the potential market for each exporting firm and so it would lead to EOS. Any complementarities in production would also help reduce costs and allow specialisation. The regional agreements since the 1990s are referred to as a 'new regionalism' and are part of a broader trade liberalisation scheme where export promotion is featured as the grow and development strategy of choice.

Expamples of preferential trading agreements among developing countries include the Latin America Free Trade Association (LAFTA), formed in 1961; MERCOSUR, a customs union among Argentina, BRazil, Urugua, and Paragua formed in 1991; the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), a group of 21 nations that border the Pacific Ocean, established in 1989 and promoting freer trade and cooperation among its members; the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), established in 1982 and including Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, COngo, Equatorial Giunea, Gabon, Rwanda, São Tomé, and Principe; and the Economic COmmunity of West African States (ECOWAS), established in 1975, with 16 member countries.

Possible benefits of increased regional cooperation among developing countries include:

* increased trade creation as a result of the resulting expanded market,
* the possiblity of EOS that may lead to more exports outside the bloc,
* greater political and bargaining power in negotiations with developed economies, and
* a decreased level of dependence on developing countries' markets.

Here are some reasons many attempts at regional cooperation among developing countries have faile or have resulted in limited success:

* The structure of production and of trade in developing countries lacks a sufficient complementary nature. The similarity of their economies has result in more trade diversion that trade creation.
* Many attempts have encountered significan organisational and administrative problems.
* Political rivalry both between and within countries and lack of commitment have also prevented problems.
* Transaction costs are often high due to the high share of raw materials and non-duirables in these countries' mututal trade. There are high transport costs, especially since infrastructure is poor (for example, there are few roads).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once you've gotten past [[Japanese_Phrasebook/Greetings_and_farewell|greetings]] and other [[Japanese_Phrasebook/Common_phrases|common phrases]], it's useful to learn how to survive on your own. Conversation with new acquaintances in Japan can be frustratingly [http://japaneseruleof7.com/the-japanese-rule-of-7/ predictable at times], but this is a good thing when you're still learning the language.

Another survival tip:

Downloading Rikaichan for Firefox is highly recommended, all you need is a basic understanding of the backwards sentence structure that Japanese has compared to English and you'll be able to read web pages like the [[wikipedia:ja:%E3%83%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9A%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8|Japanese Wikipedia]]. Slowly, word-by-word, but at least it's possible through the interactive dictionary.

'''Luring a child'''&lt;br&gt;
172.1 (1) Every person commits an offence who, by means of a computer system within the meaning of subsection 342.1(2), communicates with
:(a) a person who is, or who the accused believes is, under the age of eighteen years, for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence under subsection 153(1), section 155 or 163.1, subsection 212(1) or (4) or section 271, 272 or 273 with respect to that person;
:(b) a person who is, or who the accused believes is, under the age of 16 years, for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence under section 151 or 152, subsection 160(3) or 173(2) or section 280 with respect to that person; or
:(c) a person who is, or who the accused believes is, under the age of 14 years, for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence under section 281 with respect to that person.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Punishment'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Every person who commits an offence under subsection (1)
:(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of one year; or
:(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 18 months and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of 90 days.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Presumption re age'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Evidence that the person referred to in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) was represented to the accused as being under the age of eighteen years, sixteen years or fourteen years, as the case may be, is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that the accused believed that the person was under that age.
&lt;p&gt;
'''No defence'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) It is not a defence to a charge under paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) that the accused believed that the person referred to in that paragraph was at least eighteen years of age, sixteen years or fourteen years of age, as the case may be, unless the accused took reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the person.
&lt;P&gt;
2002, c. 13, s. 8; 2007, c. 20, s. 1; 2008, c. 6, s. 14; 2012, c. 1, s. 22.

==Proof of Offence==

'''172.1(1)(a)'''&lt;br&gt;
The crown should prove the following elements:
# accused communicated by means of a [[Canadian Criminal Law/Computer System|computer system]] (see [http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec342.1 s. 342.1(2)])
# the accused communicated to a person who
##is under the age of 18 or
##is believed to be under the age of 18
#accused’s “specific purpose” in communicating is to facilitate the commission of a specified secondary offence with respect to the under-aged person. (specifically section 153(1), 155 or 163.1,  212(1) or (4), 271, 272 or 273)

'''172.1(1)(b)'''&lt;br&gt;
The crown should prove the following elements:
# accused communicated by means of a computer system (see s. 342.1(2)) 
# the accused communicated to a person who
##is under the age of 16 or
##is believed to be under the age of 16
#accused’s “specific purpose” in communicating is to facilitate the commission of a specified secondary offence with respect to the under-aged person. (specifically section 151, 152, 160(3) or 173(2) or 280)

'''172.1(1)(c)'''&lt;br&gt;
The crown should prove the following elements:&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Alicandro [http://canlii.ca/t/22h4d 2009 ONCA 133], R. v. Quinones, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqbvb#par5 2012 BCCA 94] at 5&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Legare, [http://canlii.ca/t/26vbx#par9 2009 SCC 56 at 9]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
# accused communicated by means of a computer system (see s. 342.1(2))
# the accused communicated to a person who
##is under the age of 14 or
##is believed to be under the age of 14
#accused’s “specific purpose” in communicating is to facilitate the commission of a specified secondary offence with respect to the under-aged person. (specifically s. 281)

==Interpretation==
The purpose of s.172.1 is to “shut that door on predatory adults who, generally for a sexual purpose, troll the Internet for vulnerable children and adolescents. Shielded by the anonymity of an assumed online name and profile, they aspire to gain the trust of their targeted victims through computer “chats” — and then to tempt or entice them into sexual activity, over the Internet or, still worse, in person.”&lt;ref&gt;Legare [http://canlii.ca/t/26vbx#par2 at 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an “inchoate” offence that is separate and apart from the sexual offence that it precedes. It does not require the sexual offence to have happened. This includes not requiring that the accused actually go to meet the victim in person.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Legare, [http://canlii.ca/t/26vbx#par25 at 25]&lt;/ref&gt; Nor is it necessary for the accused to be “objectively capable” to commit the secondary offence.&lt;ref&gt;Legare [http://canlii.ca/t/26vbx#par42 at 42]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
===Purpose of Facilitating an Offence===

It is not criminal to engage in sexually explicit chats with an underage person unless the prohibited purpose is established beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;R v Pengelley&lt;/ref&gt;

The intent must be specific to the objective and must be determined subjectively.&lt;Ref&gt;Legare [http://canlii.ca/t/26vbx#par32 at 32]&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilitating can include actions that help “bring about or [make] easier or more probable the commission of such an offence, by grooming or reducing the inhibitions of a young person or by exploiting their curiosity, immaturity or precocious sexuality”.&lt;ref&gt;Legare at 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The contents of the messages can be used but are not determinative of a sexual purpose.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Legare, 2009 SCC 56 at 31&lt;/ref&gt; The issue must be determined on the evidence as a whole. &lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Reflist|2}}

===Reasonable steps to ascertain age===
Under s. 172.1, the accused can only claim to have believed the alleged victim was not of a prohibited age where he took reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the victim. This is to foreclose any any defence based on claims of the accused without any objective evidential basis.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Levigne, 2010 SCC 25 at 31, 35&lt;/ref&gt;


{{Reflist|2}}

==Typical Defences==
* If under s.172.1(1)(a) and the secondary offence is under s. 163.1, the defence of [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Child Pornography|“private use”]] 
* Mistaken belief of age
* [[Canadian Criminal Law/Defences/Entrapment|Entrapment]]

==Related provisions==
* s.486 - the judge may order the ''exclusion of members of the public''

==Cases==
* R v Pengelley, -- acquitted based on the evidence that the child’s account showed a picture of someone in their 20s.

==History==
On August 9, 2012, the section was amended to include a mandatory minimum of 90 days on summary conviction and 1 year on indictable election.

== '''About Edubuntu''' ==

Labdoo project supply laptops with Edubuntu already installed.

Edubuntu, also previously known as Ubuntu Education Edition, is an official derivative of the Ubuntu operating system designed for use in classrooms inside schools, homes and communities.

Edubuntu has been developed in collaboration with teachers and technologists in multiple countries. Edubuntu is built on top of the Ubuntu base, incorporates the LTSP thin client architecture and several education-specific applications, and is aimed at users aged 6 to 18. It is designed for easy installation and ongoing system maintenance.

Included with Edubuntu there is a large number of educational applications including GCompris, KDE Edutainment Suite, Sabayon Profile Manager, Pessulus Lockdown Editor, Edubuntu Menueditor, LibreOffice, Gnome Nanny and iTalc as well as many more. Some of them as enjoyable as Tux Math or Celestia.

In this guide you'll know about especific educational software and other software like Firefox or Rhythmbox. Those other software could seem not educational software but could it be very useful for students and so many people.

== '''Education Software''' ==

'''&lt;u&gt;Blinken&lt;/u&gt;'''

Blinken is based on an electronic game released in 1978, which challenges players to remember sequences of increasing length. On the face of the device, there are 4 different color buttons, each one with their own distinctive sound. These buttons light up randomly, creating the sequence that the player must then recall. If the player is successful in remembering the sequence of lights in the correct order, they advance to the next stage, where an identical sequence with one extra step is presented. If they are incorrect, the game is lost, and the player must start again from the beginning. The goal is to get a high score - each step in the sequence is worth one point, so correct entry of a sequence of 8 lights is worth 8 points on the high score table.

[[Image:Blinken.png|thumb|center|300px]]


'''&lt;u&gt;Celestia&lt;/u&gt;'''

Celestia is a 3D astronomy program created by Chris Laurel. The program is based on the Hipparcos Catalogue (HIP) and allows users to travel through an extensive universe, modeled after reality, at any speed, in any direction, and at any time in history. Celestia displays and interacts with objects ranging in scale from small spacecraft to entire galaxies in three dimensions using OpenGL, from perspectives which would not be possible from a classic planetarium or other ground-based display.

'''&lt;u&gt;Educational suite GCompris&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;GCompris Administration&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;Kanagram&lt;/u&gt;'''

Kanagram is an educational game that creates anagrams, re-assortment of letters in a word, and the user needs to guess what the original word is. It is licensed under the GNU Public License v2, and it is part of the kdeedu package, and the user interface is designed to be approachable even by very young children. There is no time limit or limitations at attempts, and a hint system is built in.

'''&lt;u&gt;KBruch&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;KHangMan&lt;/u&gt;'''

KHangMan is the classical hangman game. The child should guess a word letter by letter. At each miss, the picture of a hangman appears. After 10 tries, if the word is not guessed, the game is over and the answer is displayed.

'''&lt;u&gt;Kig&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;KmPlot&lt;/u&gt;'''

KmPlot is a mathematical function plotter for the KDE-Desktop.

It has built in a powerfull parser. You can plot different functions simultaneously and combine their function terms to build new functions. KmPlot supports functions with parameters and functions in polar coordinates. Several grid modes are possible. Plots may be printed with high precision in correct scale.

'''&lt;u&gt;KTouch&lt;/u&gt;'''

A program that helps you to learn and practise touch typing.

'''&lt;u&gt;KTurtle&lt;/u&gt;'''

KTurtle is an educational programming environment that aims to make learning how to program as easy as possible. To achieve this KTurtle makes all programming tools available from the user interface. The programming language used is TurtleScript which allows its commands to be translated.

'''&lt;u&gt;KWordQuiz&lt;/u&gt;'''

KWordQuiz is a general purpose flash card program. It can be used for vocabulary learning and many other subjects.

KWordQuiz is the KDE (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE) version of the Windows program WordQuiz. If you have just switched to Edubuntu/Linux you can use all files created in WordQuiz with KWordQuiz. Additional information about KWordQuiz is available at [http://peterandlinda.com/kwordquiz/ the author's own website].

'''&lt;u&gt;Lybniz graph Plotter&lt;/u&gt;'''

Function graph Plotter

'''&lt;u&gt;Marble&lt;/u&gt;'''

Versatile, yet easy to use. Use Marble similar to a desktop globe; pan around and measure distances. At closer scale it becomes a world atlas, while OpenStreetMap takes you to street level. Search for places of interest, view Wikipedia articles, create routes by drag and drop and so much more.

Marble is a virtual globe and world atlas. More information here: http://marble.kde.org/

'''&lt;u&gt;Parley&lt;/u&gt;'''

Parley is a program to help you memorize things.
Parley supports many language specific features but can be used for other learning tasks just as well. It uses the spaced repetition learning method, also known as flash cards.

Creating new vocabulary collections with Parley is easy, but of course it is even better if you can use some of our premade files.

'''&lt;u&gt;Step&lt;/u&gt;'''

Step is an interactive physics simulator. It works like this: you place some bodies on the scene, add some forces such as gravity or springs, then click &quot;Simulate&quot; and Step shows you how your scene will evolve according to the laws of physics.

You can change every property of bodies/forces in your experiment (even during simulation) and see how this will change the outcome of the experiment. With Step you can not only learn but feel how physics works !

'''&lt;u&gt;Tux Math&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;Tux Paint&lt;/u&gt;'''

      <comment>Document default values</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Calculating values ===

Define a '''function''' for code readability and re-use.

'''Usage examples:'''

 diameter = 20;
 function r_from_dia(dia) = dia / 2;
 echo(&quot;Diameter &quot;, diameter, &quot; is radius &quot;, r_from_dia(diameter));

Functions can have multiple input variables of different types. The

'''Usage examples:'''

 function f(x, vec) = x * vec[0] + 2 * x * vec[1];
 echo(f(3, [4, 5])); // produces ECHO: 42

=== Default values ===

Starting from the last parameter, it's possible to define default values. Those are assigned in case the function call does not give all the parameters.

'''Usage examples:'''

 function f(p1, p2 = 3, p3 = 0) = 100 * p1 + 10 * p2 + p3;
 echo(f(3, 2, 1)); // produces ECHO: 321
 echo(f(3, 2));    // produces ECHO: 320
 echo(f(3));       // produces ECHO: 330


=== Recursive function calls ===

[[w:recursion (computer science)|Recursive]] function calls are supported. Using the Conditional Operator &quot;... '''?''' ... ''':''' ... &quot; it's possible to ensure the recursion is terminated.

Note: There is a built-in recursion limit to prevent the application to crash. If the limit is hit, the result of the function call is undef.

'''Usage examples:'''

 // recursion - find the sum of the values in a vector (array)
 // from the start (or s'th element) to the i'th element - remember elements are zero based
 
 function sumv(v,i,s=0) = (i==s ? v[i] : v[i] + sumv(v,i-1,s));
 
 vec=[ 10, 20, 30, 40 ];
 echo(&quot;sum vec=&quot;, sumv(vec,2,1)); // is 20+30=50</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The exam questions are very hard to predict and this site is by no means going to give you everything you need for the questions you'll sit.  The most important thing you should do is learn how to program, and learn how to program well!

The exam is split into 4 sections that must be completed on a computer:

===Section A===
&lt;35 minutes&gt;
Theory Questions based on the material you have covered for Unit 1.  For an overview of what this might include see the [http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/subjects/specifications/alevel/AQA-2510-W-SP-14.PDF AQA specification] and this wikibook.

*[[../../|Section A]]

===Section B===
&lt;20 minutes&gt;
Programming solutions to short problems, not based on the preliminary material or skeleton code.
* [[/Section B/]]

===Section C===
&lt;10 minutes&gt;
Theory questions about the preliminary material and skeleton code.
*[[/Section C/]]

===Section D===
&lt;55 minutes&gt;
Program solutions based around the preliminary code.  The guidance below doesn't pretend to offer the actual questions that will be set in the exam, but by doing them you should hopefully get a better grasp of the code and be able to answer any questions thrown at you during the exam.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Section B Introduction=
This section will ask you questions that you will have to find programming solutions to.  The past exams have always provided a strict program specification in the form of variable names and pseudocode. You should be able to interpret pseudocode, structured english, structure charts, stepwise refinement tables and  decision tables. Any of these techniques could be used to communicate an algorithm to be coded.   

==Practice questions==
Obviously all the past papers from AQA have good section B questions that you should attempt. Here are some around this year's theme...

=== At the end of the game the player is asked to enter their name. Currently the player can just enter nothing by pressing Return. Modify the program to disallow empty inputs.===
VB.Net solution
{{CPTAnswerTab}}
Modify the function GetPlayerName() as follows:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Function GetPlayerName() As String
    Dim PlayerName As String
    Console.WriteLine()
    Do
        Console.Write(&quot;Please enter your name: &quot;)
        PlayerName = Console.ReadLine
    Loop Until PlayerName &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;
    Console.WriteLine()
    Return PlayerName
 'Follow @MUFCJT
End Function

an alternative solution

  Function GetPlayerName() As String
        Dim PlayerName As String
        Do
            Console.WriteLine()
            Console.Write(&quot;Please enter your name: &quot;)
            PlayerName = Console.ReadLine
            Console.WriteLine()
            If PlayerName.Length = 0 Then
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;INVALID - Please enter your name.&quot;)
            End If
            If PlayerName.Length &gt; 15 Then
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;INVALID - Please enter a name that is shorter than 15.&quot;)
            End If
        Loop Until PlayerName.Length &gt; 0 And PlayerName.Length &lt;= 15
        'i did this so that they have to enter a name and the length of the name is capped
        Return PlayerName
    End Function



another alternative:

 Function GetPlayerName() As String
        Dim PlayerName As String = &quot;&quot;


        While PlayerName = &quot;&quot; Or PlayerName.Length &gt; 15
            Console.WriteLine()
            Console.Write(&quot;Please enter your name (max 15 characters): &quot;)
            PlayerName = Console.ReadLine
            Console.WriteLine()
        End While

        Return PlayerName
    End Function

=== Replay a shuffled deck. Add a menu option to replay the last &quot;shuffled&quot; game.  ===
As each card is thrown away and moved up the deck this requires changing the deck handling to include a pointer. Is this 
Likely? &lt;br /&gt;
This does not appear to be needed.  You can just replay with Deck as the contents of that are not lost.  There is no need for a copy of the Deck to play again.  
No it doesn't. As the person who produced the Pascal solution has shown - just take a copy of the shuffled deck before you start playing. You can play this copy again and again.&lt;br /&gt;

//The two score save/load procedures can go anywhere amongst your Procedure declarations
//The savegame and loadsavedeck procedures can go anywhere amongst your procedure declarations
//DisplayCorrectGuess Message has been modified to ask the user “Do you want to save?” which then calls savegame
//PlayGame has been modified to make sure that recent scores are saved to file even if they lose
//A new case option has been added to the menu of choices in the main program - '5' load saved game - to call the loadsavegame procedures
//players can now load a game they saved either during the current game, or from a previous session

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section is intended to provide an understanding of how the Kapampangan Language is spoken from the perspective of an English-speaking person who wish to learn Kapampangan. When we speak and write, we use words to express our thoughts and ideas. The Kapampangan language has thousands of words. Following the standard grammatical structure in English of classifying words this grammar text is presented using the eight groups or classes of words known as Parts of Speech.

==The Parts of Speech==
The names of the Parts of Speech are: Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs, Prepositions, Conjunctions, and Interjections. Here are the equivalent names in Kapampangan.

Words are tools of communications. That is why each group has its special work to do. Nouns are the names of persons, places, and things. Pronouns take the place of nouns. Verbs are words that express action. Adjectives and adverbs help express the ideas that give color and more definite meanings to nouns, verbs, and other words. A preposition is a word used before another word to indicate how that word is being used. Conjunctions are joining or connecting words, and interjections are words that come between words that express different ideas. The most important fact to keep in mind when learning a new word is its function or use in a particular sentence. If you keep this in mind, you will easily learn the word and how it is used in relation with other words in sentences.

The first group or class of the Parts of Speech is the Noun - each group has its special work to do.

==Kapampangan Grammar: NOUNS (Lagyu) ==

A '''Noun''' is a word used to name something. It is the word that tells what you are talking about. For example, there are names for persons, animals, places, and objects that can be pointed out and recognized. There are also names for substances, qualities, actions, and measures of time or quantity.

In Kapampangan, like English, nouns and other parts of speech have no gender. 

==Kinds of Nouns==

There are several kinds of nouns depending on how they are used.  Some kinds of nouns are '''common nouns, proper nouns.and collective nouns.'''

A '''common noun''' names any one of a class of persons, places, or things. An example of a common noun is the word 'tau' (person) and the word 'tau' can be used to refer to any person in the world.

However, when we want to refer to a particular person, we must use a special name. The name of a particular person might be 'Juan' or 'Pedro'. These particular names are called proper nouns. A '''proper noun''' is the name of a particular person, place, or thing.

A '''collective noun''' names a class or group: e.g. aguman, pibale-bale, balayan, kumite, at aliwa pa.

The following list includes examples of different kinds of nouns

{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;
|-
|tau (Persons)||talaturu (teacher)||Juan (John)||kaluguran (friend) 
|-
| animal (animals)||asu (dog)||pusa (cat)||kabayu (horse)
|-
| lugal, karinan (Places)||bale (house)||Menila (Manila)||palengke (market)
|-
| bage (Objects)||luklukan (chair)||litratu (picture)||makanilya (typewriter)  
|-
| kaniwan (Qualities)||ganaka (kindness)||tepangan (bravery, courage)||leguan (Beauty)
|-
| pangimut (Actions)||pulai (running)||pamaglutu (cooking)||pamamasa (reading)
|-
| aguman (association)||pibale-bale (family)||balayan (nation)||kumite (committee)
|}
Examples of Nouns used in Sentences (the words in bold letters are the nouns):

#Ing talaturung i Juan mayap yang kaluguran.
#:(The teacher John is a good friend.)   
#Ing asu, ing pusa, ampon ing kabayu mikakaluguran la.
#:(The dog, the cat, and the horse are friends.)
#Ing kakung bale king Menila malapit ya king palengke.
#:(My house in Manila is near the market.)</text>

== Ҷонишинҳои шахсӣ (Personal pronouns) ==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| 1st person || Ман || Мо
|-
| 2nd person || Ту || Шумо
|-
| 3rd person || Вай, ӯ || Онҳо
|}

Now we will create simple phrases with the pronouns and the words '''хона''' - house and '''доштан''' (асоси замони ҳозира: дор) - have.

Ман хона дорам - I have a house

Мо хона дорем - We have a house

Ту хона дорӣ - You have a house

Шумо хона доред - You (pl.) have a house

Вай хона дорад (Ӯ хона дорад) - He has a house

Онҳо хона доранд - They have a house

== Асосҳои феълӣ (Verb stems) ==
=== Масдар (Infinitive) ===
The infinitive in Tajik consists of the past tense stem and the infinitive ending '''-ан'''.

пухтан - to bake

рафтан - to go

кардан - to do

харидан - to buy

омадан - to come

бурдан - to carry

гирифтан - to take

доштан - to have

додан - to give

рақсидан - to dance

гуфтан - to say

хӯрдан - to eat

афтидан - to fall

нӯшидан - to drink

давидан - to run

мондан - to lay (transitive verb)
=== Асоси замони гузашта (Past tense stem) ===
The past tense stem indicates the singular 3rd person past simple verb (he did, etc.). To form the past tense stem, the -ан ending is detached from the infinitive. However, some verbs are irregular.

афтод - he fell
=== Асоси замони ҳозира (Present/future tense stem) ===
The present/future tense stem is mostly irregular. It indicates the imperative.

паз - bake!

рав - go!

кун - do!

хар - buy!

ой - come!

бар - carry!

гир - take!

дор - have!

деҳ - give!

рақс - dance!

гӯй - say!

хӯр - eat!

афт - fall!

нӯш - drink

дав - run!</text>

&lt;div style={{TRS-style}}&gt;

;usage
This template forms an internal link to ''the specified Trainz Books Volume '''Chapter''''' (with parameter &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; i.e. 1= sub-page = CHAPTER) which displays the link by that value (omitting the volume name).
* Reference chapters ''as currently schemed/expected (in late March 2014)'' are : /Appendixes, /Tags, /Containers, Kinds, /Scenery, /Scripting, /Tracks, /Trackside, /Splines, etc. (partial and conjectural)

{{TextBox|1=
: IN ALL Cases, including the below (p=''pretty-name'') forms a over-riding'' 'pretty name' ''for display'' of the desired link-to-page of the '[[Trainz references]] volume' ''of the [[Trainz]] Wikibook projects.}}
{{void|1=
* The template also incorporates options to access a '''Chapter sub-page''' at the next level down heirarchically speaking&amp;mdash; (Sections in Wikibookian, technically a ''sub-sub-page'') given the optional '''''2nd parameter (2= or &lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;)'''''
 
*  and even a 3rd link forming parameter: &lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; (or 'Sections' sub-sub-sub-pages)&lt;/code&gt; 
{{TrainzTip|1=
* Each last level specified will be the resultant short display name of the link, unless the optional pretty-link re-title parameter &lt;code&gt;'p=' is defined which will then display whatever link is formed.
* The '''4=''section-title''''' option MUST NOT include multi-word titles, so replace SPACES with UNDERSCORES (they both display the same, look at wikimedia urls) to form a section link to the page.
}}

==default behaviors==
This allows:
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/references/{{{1}}}{{{{4|}}}               |{{{p|{{{4|{{{1}}}}}}}}} ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 'Chapter' links and/or 
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/references/{{{1}}}/{{{2}}}{{{4|}}}        |{{{p|{{{4|{{{2}}}}}}}}} ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 'sub-sub-page' (Section) links and/or 
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/references/{{{1}}}/{{{2}}}/{{{3}}}{{{4|}}}|{{{p|{{{4|{{{3}}}}}}}}} ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 'sub-sub-sub-page' (Sub-Section) formatted link calls 
... all forming the link and all links in the wikimarkup with the last parameter ('''the actual page title''') as the ''''''DEFAULT display name'''''' (can be overridden by &quot;|p=''some other name''&quot;
&lt;hr&gt;
* Users unfamiliar with wiki-markup parameter parsing, just focus on the last parameter given numerically overriding the text of the whole lengthy link, 
* and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{4}}}  or '|4=Page-section-title' making a 'section-link' &lt;/nowiki&gt; ''generally'' giving a pretty name if and when a short name is desired, such is within a nav template.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
:* NOTE: The parserFunction logic for linking a page section is not exactly as shown above (or the section's title display format would suck), but the simplified code 'guts' is complicated enough without burdening non-coders with the details. (The idea that the template will link sections of pages as well as sub-sub-sub-pages is enough to use it well!)
&amp;nbsp;
'''&lt;u&gt;Example-1, expanded paste down&lt;/u&gt;:'''
:This is because all template default parameters, formally 'numbered parameters' can also be specified like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TR|1=containers
 |2=Thumbnails_container
 |3=Thumbs
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 which wiki-markup language is processed exactly
 the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TR|containers |Thumbnails_container |Thumbs }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
;caution
When using a template such as this which forms a link, it is best to NOT use spaces between the pipe characters &quot;|&quot; as done for clarity above.
{{TrainzTip|Spaces in the 'pretty-text' part are fine in '''TR''' as they are in the related {{tl|TL}} but they will bite you in other link forming typing aids such as {{tl|TG}}, {{tl|TOL}}, {{tl|N3V}} and {{tl|Wp}}! &lt;hr&gt; However,{{indent|7}}When and if there are two or more words in the first parameter term, use underscores to connect into one word sans {{wp|whitespace}} characters.
}}
'''&lt;u&gt;In-line Examples&lt;/u&gt;:'''
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TR|Thumbnails container}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; links as: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz references/Thumbnails container|Thumbnails container]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the other formulation: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Thumbnails container|Thumbnails container]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; both would.
:But... is much easier to edit around on a page when trying to get the best prose presentation.

* Similarly: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TR|containers|Thumbnails container|Thumbnails image handling}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; links as if the constructs: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/references/containers/Thumbnails container|Thumbnails image handling]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and displays only: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;TThumbnails image handling&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 
{{void|
* Sub-subpage links will mainly be needed in the forthcoming Errorfixing series of tutorials and the Programmed Instruction (Trainz A-Z) linked progressive tutorials off their own sub-TOC base page. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:Plan on use of Sub-sub-pages for each task need... '''even given splitting the book down the multiple tracks''' (General operations, Content alteration and fixing, content creation, driving, Surveyor-how-to and trying to keep things straight which page goes where... we're going to make ''a lot of new pages'' in the Trainz_PI tutorials! Whether for beginners or intermediate Trainzers, they'll all end in content creation and other advanced topics like TransDEM map generation anyway.

[[File:NB CSD Logo.png|thumb|Norman Borlaug Community School District Logo]]

== '''Introduction''' ==
=== Overview ===
We are Norman Borlaug Community School District (NBCSD), a school district of 1400 students located in northeastern Iowa. NBCSD is a combination of three surrounding towns, Rice, Hampton, and Turkey. We have four different schools, Oat Elementary, Wheat Elementary, Barley Middle School, and Corn High School. Out of the student enrollment, 92% of them are Caucasian, 1% are Chinese, 2% are African American, and 2% are Hispanic. In addition, over 80% of the students maintain a free and reduced meal status.

[[File:NBCSD 1-1 Program Plan.png|thumb|Norman Borlaug Community School District 1:1 Program Plan]]
=== 1:1 Program ===
In terms of technology, the NBCSD is a fairly sophisticated and technology infused district. The superintendent and school board have consistently supported technology integration and have made a number of upgrades to the network infrastructure, wireless, and servers in advance of the impending 1:1 Program. By next fall, all our students in grades K-6 will have an iPad and in grades 7-12 they will have a MacBook Air.

=== TPACK Assignment ===
This specific assignment will cover specifically the Corn High School, and more specifically grades 11 and 12, as we focus on 21st Century Skills. All of our teachers have an updated computer and depending on their grade level also an iPad so that they can begin planning for the technology rollout.  Students are not expected to have prior knowledge of the topics, themes, and information covered in the lessons, but they do have basic computer skills (including Internet, typing, and core productivity suite applications) that they have learned from their use of the many mobile and stationary computer labs spread throughout Corn High School.  These TPACK lessons were created with the mindset that they will take multiple 55 minute class periods to complete, but if more time is required they can work on the material at home with the district provided LMS/CMS.

Thinking about our school district as a whole and considering a specific subject area to take a look at, as a group we determined that the 21st Century Skills would be the best fit. It is a subject area that all three of us have in common and can easily write about, speak about, and form lesson plans on.  In addition, 21st Century Skills usually gets a bad rap as being &quot;integrated&quot; within a 1:1 Program.  We firmly believe that this skill set is something that we cannot take for granted.  Just because our students grew up in the 21st Century does not mean that they possess these skills.  Instead, 21st Century Skills must be integrated, demonstrated, and focused on in our classes.  In order for this to actually happen more effectively our group decided to look closely at these skills so that they can be outlined, demonstrated, and understood before any other integration of TPACK knowledge in the other subject areas can occur.  We hope that leading by example our group will promote the use of 21st Century Skills and the integration of TPACK throughout the NBCSD.

== '''Standards and Benchmarks''' ==
TPACKing at NBCSD is based on the [https://www.educateiowa.gov/iowacore Iowa Core Curriculum] and in particular the [https://www.educateiowa.gov/documents/iowa-core/2013/12/iowa-core-21st-century-skillspdf 21st Century Skills]. There are many skills present in this section of information, but for this project our group decided to focus on Civic Awareness, Employability Skills, and Technology Literacy.  Having taught or interacted with students in the NBCSD before, we understand that these three areas of 21st Century skills are essential and important. In planning future professional development for our staff, we thought that we would lead by example and create lessons that fit into these key areas.

The framework for our individual lessons is based on the lesson activity types for each of the main benchmarks for our focus areas. Below you will see an outline of each of the main benchmarks for our three focus areas:
:1. The development of civic awareness to effectively add to society - '''Civic Awareness'''
:2. The ability to hopefully at one point be employed - '''Employability Skills'''
:3. The awareness of how technology can help them be successful both today and into the future - '''Technology Literacy'''

=== Civic Awareness ===
I. Understand the rights and responsibilities of each citizen and demonstrate the value of lifelong civic action.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''The class will break apart the rights and responsibilities of each citizen and then produce a video based on Jay Leno’s Jaywalking segment where they interview people about those characteristics. This will provide students with the ability to interact with digital media, real people, and all the challenges that go along with interviewing and editing a video with a team. They will share their final product and process work at a selected movie day in the future. The most creative and highest rated entries from the students will appear at an evening short film festival in the spring.''
:B. Activity / Technology: ''Students will spend some time in a creative and artistic venture of their choice (typical responses will be photography, comics, short stories, etc.) where they will describe the value of lifelong civic action by reflecting and planning what they hope to accomplish in the future. This activity will allow students to be reflective on exactly what they want to accomplish later in life, while at the same time being creative with exactly what type of media they would like to produce. There will be a rubric provided that allows for breath of the expression and depth of the answer, but does not limit on the specific format.''

II. Understand how the government established Constitution embodies the enduring values and principles of democracy and republicanism.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''In small groups students will spend a very short and frantic time researching and then producing a two minute presentation of any kind or format - as long as it covers how the government established the Constitution and everyone in the group must say at least four sentences. This activity will provide students with the real life experience of working in a group and under a significantly tight deadline. In addition, groups have free reign to produce their final product in whatever format that they desire so grading may be difficult for the instructor, but it will provide a great foundation for the discussion later on in the class.''
:B. Activity / Technology: ''Individually students will spend the evening reflecting on the activities in class today in two specific formats. One, they must write a short reflection of their experience and what they learned from it and post it to the instructor’s online dropbox. Second, they must participate (post three new comments and add three comments to others’ postings) in an online class discussion in the CMS/LMS where they are to discuss the values and principles of democracy and republicanism.  This activity will force students to be reflective of their class activities in addition to furthering the discussion and collaboration among each other as they factor in what they know, want to know, and have learned about these two concepts.''

III. Understand the purpose and function of each of the three branches of government established by the Constitution.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''The entire class will be broken into three different groups, one for each branch of the government. Then the entire class will be put through a simulation of passing a law, hearing a supreme court case, and providing aid to a foreign country. As soon as the activity is complete students will be asked to discuss with a partner their thoughts, feelings, and reflections of the three branches of government. This discussion will be documented through a cell phone camera, camera on a computer, or an audio recording - all of which will be submitted to the instructor through the CMS/LMS before the class period is over.  This activity will allow students to actively participate in the three branches of government, see how they interact with one another, and then reflect on the process with one individual.  This activity as a whole will provide a good idea of the students’ understanding of the Constitution and their use of either video or audio recording will allow the instructor to document that information.''

IV. Understand the differences among the complex levels of local, state and national government and their inherent, expressed, and implied powers.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students will form a group of three and then document through a mind mapping or creative mapping software of their choice (Keynote or PowerPoint being the default choice if they can’t decide in two minutes) the multiple levels of local, state, and national government. Then in their short, three minute (one minute per person) they are to describe their map as well as the inherent, expressed, and implied powers of each section. Through this activity students will work together, collaborate using a software of their choice, and ultimately be provided with the option to dive deep into the material and enhance their own presentation skills. The specific media and presentation type are up to the students, but a rubric will be provided for the content.''

V. Understand strategies for effective political action that impact local, state, and national governance.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students will craft either a poem, rap, or short political speech for a cause that impacts either a local, state, or national cause. They are forbidden from using technology of any kind for this project. This should focus them on their content and not the expression of that content. In addition, providing multiple ways of producing and then presenting this material will allow students to express their information in a broad and explanative way. This activity should force the students to think critically about the message they want to portray, the way they want to do that, and the process to which they arrive at that decision. This activity will be recorded so that students can produce a self critique as part of the overall assessment.''

VI. Understand how law and public policy are established at the local, state, and national levels of government.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students will individually research one law that has been presented and voted upon by either the local, state, or national bodies. They will then work by themselves to improve the law to make it better in hopes of obtaining more votes or in hopes of passing it through. They must then represent this law to the class as an individual would at each level of government. This activity will allow students to research a number of laws that impact them - either indirectly or directly.  Students will then have the ability to work through the law and understanding the jargon and information that goes along with it. They will have to dig deep into the information and determine what to change or modify in order to represent it to the class. This activity also will improve upon their presentation skills in addition to their research and writing skills.''

VII. Understand how various political systems throughout the world define the rights and responsibilities of the individual.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students in groups of two will complete a templated activity where they will research a developed and then an undeveloped country and determine the rights and responsibilities of the individuals in those two countries.  Then at the time of submission the CMS/LMS the students must also post a short entry outlining some of the most stark differences between the two countries they researched.  Students will be provided with a base set of websites for the research, the template they are to use, and the group member they will be assigned to work with. Outside of that, time and direction will be given and the rest will be up to the students. This activity will encourage them to work with a partner, determine through research the differences and similarities, and then produce a short, collaborative writing piece.  A rubric will be provided before the activity begins and the submission of the final work will be on the CMS/LMS.''

VIII. Understand the role of the United States in current world affairs.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students will individually research the role of the US State Department and the World Affairs Councils of America. They will then prepare a set of questions and a short reflection on the role of each organization. Then the best questions will be provided an opportunity to ask their question live via Skype to a member from each organization.  The rest of the class will be live blogging the event and discussing the information that is being discussed.  After class is over a short reflection will be required to be posted to the instructor at his or her LMS/CMS page.  This activity will promote the critical thinking and role of the United States in a variety of world affairs.  In addition, it will bring the idea of civic action to the forefront of what they have been working on and learning about.  Discussion points, reflection points, and question points will be awarded to the students throughout and after the activity is complete.''

=== Employability Skills  ===
I. Communicate and work productively with others, incorporating different perspectives and cross-cultural understanding, to increase innovation and the quality of work.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students in the 9-12 classrooms will participate in class presentations using presentation software such as Haiku Deck, Google Presentation, or Prezi. They will also hold meetings with a community college class via videoconferencing such as Tandberg. Students will work in both small and large groups, research topics, hold informal debates, and work collaboratively to create informational videos about various communication and teamwork topics. Technology that may be used includes presentation software, video conferencing, word processor, discussion forum such as blog or wiki, digital camera, and video creation software such as iMovie.'' 

II. Adapt to various roles and responsibilities and work flexibly in climates of ambiguity and changing priorities.
:A. Activity / Technology:  ''In groups, students will be given a specified task to complete. As the students work through the tasks, the teacher will change the rules. This continues for a length of time with frequent rule changes. Afterwards, students will discuss how they adapted to the change of rules, how their roles within the group changed as the rules changed, and how priorities changed and why. Working in pairs or small groups, students will create various work-related scenarios using Google Docs or other collaborative tools. Students will role-play the various scenarios and focus on the different roles and responsibilities and how circumstances change often, many times with little or no warning.  As a culminating activity, students will create digital storybooks (e.g. Storybird) describing how they could effectively deal with changes in the workplace.'' 
 
III. Demonstrate leadership skills, integrity, ethical behavior, and social responsibility while collaborating to achieve common goals.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students will participate in a teacher-led class presentation (presentation software, video clips) about leadership skills, integrity, ethical behavior, and social responsibilities in the workplace. Students will research ethical issues in the workplace and share links on a class wiki. Students will work in small groups to come up with their own definition of “workplace ethics.” Each group will share their final definition on the class wiki. Students will be presented with various workplace ethics case studies. Breaking into small groups, students will work through each case study using the four step process introduced earlier in the lesson. For each different scenario, a different student will act as group leader. At the conclusion of the lesson, each student will create a blog discussing the decision-making process as well as his/her role as group leader.'' 

IV. Demonstrate initiative and self-direction through high achievement and lifelong learning while exploring the ways individual talents and skills can be used for productive outcomes in personal and professional life.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students will complete an online career assessment tool to explore possible career choices. Once they have chosen a career path of interest to them, the students will conduct an online search of various businesses/companies that fall into their area of interest. Using a notetaking app such as Evernote, students will compile information about their chosen career and the company websites they examined. Information will be used in a future assignment.'' 
:B. Activity / Technology: ''Students will explore social media and its use in business. The teacher leads a Prezi presentation and discussion on social media in the workplace. This lesson ties in nicely with other lessons involving business ethics. Students brainstorm a list of advantages and of risks associated with social media. Students explore and complete Cyber Smart! online activities (Common Sense Media).'' 

V. Demonstrate productivity and accountability by meeting high expectations.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''In small groups, students discuss what accountability means to them personally and for on the job. Students brainstorm possible consequences from lack of accountability. After compiling a list of accountability issues and possible consequences on the Smartboard, each group chooses one topic to research and create a short presentation presenting the accountability issue, possible consequences, and its overall cost to the economy (e.g. absenteeism).''

=== Technology Literacy Skills  ===
I. Demonstrate creative thinking, construct knowledge, and develop innovative products and processes using technology.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students develop an eportfolio individually to showcase their professional growth in learning. They use image editing tools, computer, iMovie, google apps for education, and web 2.0 tools to host and showcase their portfolio.''

II. Use digital media and environments to communicate and work collaboratively, including at a distance, to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students in classes work together in small groups to collaborate and explore different web 2.0 tools for creating an eportfolio. This portfolio will showcase to a larger audience for the students to show their professional growth in learning.'' 

III. Apply digital tools to gather, evaluate, and use information.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students use web 2.0 tools to collect and choose the documentation that will provide their professional growth of learning for the senior capstone project. There senior capstone project will be evaluated by using a rubric.''

IV. Demonstrate critical thinking skills, using appropriate tools and resources, to plan and conduct research, manage projects, solve problems, and make informed decisions.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students gather and collect documentation to showcase within the eportfolio. In the design of an eportfolio students will troubleshoot different areas to figure out how images, videos, and documentation can be embedded into the hosting site.''  

V. Understand human, cultural, and societal issues related to technology and practice legal and ethical behavior.
:A. Activity / Technology: ''Students learn how to paraphrase information for creating research documents to avoid plagiarism. Students will develop proper note-taking, appropriate paraphrasing of information, and how and when to cite sources for their eportfolio. Students who are researching may need additional help to avoid plagiarism while using web resources.''

== '''Conclusion''' ==
=== Decision Process ===
In order to TPACK out our lessons for this assignment the group members really needed to think critically about the three very different, but related, areas of TPACK: Technological Knowledge, Pedagogical Knowledge, and Content Knowledge. Each of these three areas presented its own unique, but challenging aspect when trying to come up with out lesson plans. The first thing that we all did with this assignment was to determine which of the many content areas we were going to focus on as a group.  We quickly determined that the 21st Century Skills area would be the best fit for our group composition. After this hard decision was made we began to look a bit more critically at the specific areas of this subject area on the Iowa Core Curriculum website.  After determining and looking through each of the five framework areas we thought it would be best to pair up individuals with their strengths and teaching background.  It was natural to pair Amy up with Employability Skills, based on her teaching background and the same went for Heather as well and the Technology Literacy area.  The tough one was Randon and his background in English/Literature, but after looking a bit more at the standards and benchmarks we determined that civic literacy would be a nice fit for him as he had done a lot of co-teaching with that framework area in the past.

=== Standards and Benchmarks ===
Once the specific framework areas of the 21st Century Skills subject area were determined we decided to begin work on a Google Document that would keep all our thoughts and ideas as a group contained and in one place.  Then we decided the next course of action was to put in all the essential concept or skills for our framework area, basing this knowledge on the information that we noted from previous example groups.  This included a lot of copying, pasting, and then finally re-formatting.  However, this was only putting in the information from the Iowa Core Curriculum, at this stage of the game we had no overall integration with TPACK and the activity types based on the Harris/Hofer article and the William and Mary School of Education Wiki.  Then collaboratively we were able to take a look at these, and with the assistance of other group members really narrow down and determine, using the previously noted information as a guide, the activity / technology for each of the standards and benchmarks in our framework area.  We understand that this was a lot of work and something that may or may not have been necessary, but in order to really prepare us for our own individual lessons we really wanted to address all the essential concept or skills.  This decision, we believe, would pay off when we went to complete our own individual lessons as we would have a more holistic view of TPACK and 21st Century Skills, but more specifically the relationship of these two to our individual framework area.

=== Individual Lessons ===
Then we moved on to our individual lessons and creating those to the best of our ability.  This involved us really taking a closer look at the Harris/Hofer article in addition to the William and Mary School of Education wiki to help us guide our lesson planning.  We were able to pair that knowledge with our own previous teaching experiences and lesson plans.  This allowed us to align our lessons to the content (CK) and pedagogy (PK) that we already knew and then pair it easily with the integration of technology (TK) so that all three sides of TPACK were brought together.  We firmly believe that we have put together three quality lessons.  Furthermore, we hope that these lesson plans that can be used for our colleagues at NBCSD so that they can contextualize TPACK and 21st Century Skills effectively as part of our future our 1:1 Program.

=== Final Thoughts ===
There were a number of challenges that we faced when completing this assignment.  First, we had to overcome the obstacles of not teaching in the classroom on a regular basis, as our individual jobs focus on different portions of the teaching profession or do not find us in front of students on a daily basis in a high school classroom.  Second, we were working with a specific portion of the Iowa Core Curriculum, 21st Century Skills at the high school grade level, that we each did not have any individual experience with. This proved difficult at times to overcome, but in the end we pushed through.  Third, our group had to think critically about the specific activity types that were necessary for this assignment, because this specific content area is not listed on the William and Mary School of Education wiki.  Finally, as a group we wanted to think a bit outside of the box for this assignment.  After deliberate thinking and lots of percolating, we determined that the best course of action was to complete the assignment as written.  This was frustrating and for a short time did prove to be a challenge as we did not know how best to complete this project.  However, once we were set on the right track we were off and running! 

In addition to the challenges, there were a number of realizations that happened throughout this project.  Probably the biggest one for us as a group, one that we all had individually at some point in this project, is that we do this stuff all the time.  The planning of our lessons, pairing activity types, looking at the eight corresponding continua, and then integrating that with TPACK all at once seemed normal to us.  That is not to say that we are experts at this, but we typically integrate these activity types and continua selections without thinking or even considering them.  The structure that was imposed upon us for this project at moments seemed unnatural and a bit too structured for our liking.  Part of this realization may have been the number of years that we each have been teaching or maybe our holistic/district/higher education view of teaching and learning.  Either way, we believe that “we do this stuff without thinking.”  That is a good thing!  Our other realization for this project is that students need to have options when completing the format for submitting a project.  Providing an open format for submission has its benefits, but also its drawbacks.  The same conversation can be had, though, for restricting the submission to one individual format.  This realization was partly compounded by the fact that submitting our material onto the Wiki Book was a bit like learning a second language.  It took time, effort, and research to produce a product that appeared presentable to the whole world and specifically our instructor.  We strive, individually, on providing our students with relevant and limitless ways of completing projects in the format that works best for them.  At some points it is helpful to restrict this, but for this individual project we spent significantly more time working on the submission than the creation of the content.  We all struggle with this balance in our own classrooms, but we saw it here firsthand.  In the end, we love that we learned a new way of submitting work and are excited to see that everything is together and posted on one page in a Wiki Book for the world to see - and more specifically for our staff at NBCSD to learn from in the future.

Thanks!

== '''Introduction''' ==

=== 1:1 Program ===



=== Overview Of TPACK ===
Lee Schulman(1987), an educational psychologist, believed that the teacher preparatory programs of the time were treating subject knowledge and pedagogy as one in the same. He argued that developing general pedagogical skills was not enough for preparing content teachers. Schulman believed the key to distinguishing the knowledge base of teaching rested at the intersection of content and pedagogy--PCK. Schulman introduced this as Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK). That intersection is the overlap of information about subject knowledge, which is the knowledge of the subject being taught, and pedagogic knowledge, that is the knowledge of how to teach, which is the strategy, planning, assessment, etc. A teacher may have deep understanding of their subject area, but there must also be an understanding of how to teach those concepts to the learner.


Piggybacking on this PCK model, technology was added into the formula. &quot;Whatever technology you select, it is the intersection of Pedagogy, Content Knowledge and Technology within a Context that will carry the message for the learner. It will determine the topic's relevance to the learner and ultimately learners' interest in remembering and using the new information.” [http://coordtech.blogspot.com/2012/02/module-4-tpackin-for-wild-learning-trip.html Dr. Z RWLD]

TPACK is this framework that was developed for understanding the complexity of teaching with technology. Mishra &amp; Koehler (2006)introduced the first and somewhat definitive presentation of the TPCK framework. Effective technology integration is successful when it meets our curricular goals. It needs to support some of the key components of learning: sound pedagogical knowledge, rich content knowledge, and technology awareness.

=== TPACK Assignment- Reflection ===
As a group of elementary educators, one kindergarten teacher, third grade teacher, and fourth grade teacher, our task was to create and design learning scenarios by integrating the TPACK model.  Our vision is to implement a 1:1 Ipad elementary school providing rich, meaningful learning for our student. We strive to create lessons incorporating technology through the TPACK framework. However, adding technology for technology sake is not our objective. We feel that technology should allow the learner to do something they couldn’t do without that technology, and transform the learning experience. A pencil and paper may be the best technology for the job.
In the design process, we didn’t start with the tools, but rather think about all three domains of our teaching: content knowledge, pedagogy, and technology and where they intersect. Creating the learning experiences is the end result of several instructional decisions.
  1. Choosing learning goals (Content Knowledge- Iowa Core)
  2. Making practical pedagogical decisions about the learning experience and student needs (Pedagogy)
  3. Selecting and sequencing activities that meet the learning goals
  4  Select formative and summative assessments
  5. Select tools and resources that will best help students benefit from the learning experiences  (Technology)
 
First, as a team we decided on the content in which this design would be implemented. All three of us are currently working on implementing the ELA Common Core in our classrooms. We each chose the ELA standards that we are currently planning for our students. After understanding the standards to be taught, each group member identified the appropriate activity types to best teach those standards, using the resources provided for us.

Once the standards were in place we worked to choose activity types that would be most appropriate and best fit our standards and grade level.  We wanted to enhance our activities with technology that would help meet our students learning goals while keeping the content at the core of the lessons.  This proved to be a challenge.  Making the sure that the technology aspect of our lessons provided students with enriched content focused learning.

After designing lessons that focused on content, pedagogy, and technology, our group realized the importance of carefully selecting particular teaching strategies that will best communicate the benchmark being taught and then using the correct technologies to enhance the lesson. When teachers are able to combine the benchmark they’re teaching with a research-based teaching strategy that will most effectively help students learn, and then add a piece of technology perfect for the lesson they’re teaching, then students are provided with a learning opportunity that will shape them into 21st century learners capable of working in a global society.

=== Key Ideas and Details  ===
CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RI.K.2 With prompting and support, identify the main topic and retell key details of a text. 

Technology Activity #1: Students will use Starfall to listen to stories for details.

Technology Activity #2:  Using the mimio the teacher will be able to work with students to highlight key details from the story.

Technology Activity #3: Students will share details that they recall from a story by drawing pictures.  These will then be digitally photographed with the iPad and students will explain their picture.

CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RI.K.3 With prompting and support, describe the connection between two individuals, events, ideas, or pieces of information in a text.

Technology Activity #1: Using Bookflix the students will listen/read books to activate proir knowledge.

Technology Activity #2:  Students will have support in looking back into the text.  The teacher will project the book using a document camera to model how to go back into the text to find information.

Technology Activity #3: Using ReQuest (Reciprocal Questioning) students and teacher will work together to make connections between information in the text.  You may want to use a concept map application to make this connection more visual for the student.

CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RI.3.3 describe the relationship between a series of historical events, scientific ideas or concepts, or steps in technical procedures in a text, using language that pertains to time, sequence, and cause/effect.

Technology Activity #1: Compare/contrast different time periods or people using Mindmesiter  then share findings with different groups.

Technology Activity #2: Identify how an action or event will produce a certain response to the action in the form of another event. Thinglink--annotate a current image, making connections to the past; written reflections via Edmodo.      

Technology Activity #3: Create a timeline of a historical event using Dippity and students can add to it collaboratively.    

CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RI.4.2 Determine the main idea of a text and explain how it is supported by key details; summarize the text.

Technology Activity #1: Students will practice finding the main idea and key details of an online text using the highlighting feature of a .pdf reader. Students will then use a word processor to summarize their findings.

=== The problem of sources in Tor guides and directories: Why Wikipedia bans Tor URLs ===
::A Tor directory cannot be encyclopedic content
::''Why this is a Wikibook (and no longer a Wikipedia article)''

==== Use of primary sources ====
&lt;p&gt;[[Wikipedia:Secondary source | Secondary sources]] generally don't index or guide people to Tor websites, ''and avoid making any definitive statements about what happens on Tor'' because

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{status|0%}}{{DISPLAYTITLE:Computational Thinking, Problem-Solving, and Programming}}
Computer science is sometimes defined as the study of algorithms and their efficient implementation in a computer. The focus now is their role in problem solving, strategies for developing the, techniques for following and testing them. Because algorithms operate on data, we examine ways to structure data so that it can be more efficiently processed. 
== General principles ==
=== Thinking procedurally ===
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.1|Identify the procedure appropriate to solving a problem.}}
Generally speaking, all problems begin with an idea. Finding the connection between this information and the solution lies at the heart of problem solving. To do this, the following strategies can be utilised.

==== Ask questions ====
When given a problem or task verbally, one typically asks questions until what is needed is known fully and clear. Generally, when, why, and where are asked until the task is completely specified. If the instructions are written, one might put question marks in the margin; underline a word, a group of words, or a sentence; or in some other way indicate the parts of the task that are not clear. Perhaps the questions might be answered in a later paragraph, or one might have to discus them with the person giving the task. If the task is one that it self-set, this sort of questioning might not be verbal, but instead takes place on the subconscious level.

In this case, some typical questions that one should consider are:

* What should I know about the problem?
* What does the solution look like?
* What sort of special cases exist?
* How will I recognise that I have found the solution?

==== Look for familiar things ====
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.2|Evaluate whether the order in which activities are undertaken will result in the required outcome.}}
We constantly break up a large problem into smaller units that we can handle. The task of cleaning the house or apartment may seem over-whelming. The task composed of cleaning the living room, the dining room, the kitchen, the bedrooms, and the bathroom seems more manageable. This principle is especially relevant to computing.

{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.3|Explain the role of sub-procedures in solving a problem.}}

Do not reinvent the wheel. If a solution exists, use it. If you have solved the same or a similar problem before, just repeat the successful solution. We usually do not consciously think, &quot;I have seen this before, and I know what to do&quot; - we just do it. Humans are good at recognising similar situations. We do not have to learn how to go to the store and buy milk, then to buy eggs, then to buy candy. We know that going to the store is always the same and only what we buy is different.

Recognising familiar situations is particularly useful in computing. In computing, you see certain problems again and again in different guises. A good programmer sees a task, or perhaps part of a task (a subtask), that has been solved before and plugs in the solution. For example, finding daily high and low temperatures in a list of temperatures is exactly the same problem as finding the highest and lowest grades in a list of test scores. You want to the largest and smallest values in a set of numbers.

{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.7|Explain the relationship between the decisions and conditions of a system.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.8|Deduce logical rules for real-world situations.}}

{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.12|Outline the pre- and post-conditions to a specified problem.}}
{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.13|Identify exceptions that need to be considered in a specified problem solution.}}

{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.15|Describe how concurrent processing can be used to solve a problem.}}

{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.1.20|Distinguish between a real-world entity and its abstraction.}}

== Connecting computational thinking and program design ==
=== Searching algorithms ===
==== Sequential search ====

﻿{{IB_Computer_Science/Statement|4.2.1|Describe the characteristics of standard algorithms on linear arrays.}}
There are numerous algorithms that exist in the realm of computer science, however, sorting and searching are two of the most important types. 

Sequential, or linear, search is the simplest search algorithm; it is a special case of brute-force search. Its worst case cost is proportional to the number of elements in the list; and so is its expected cost, if all list elements are equally likely to be searched for. Therefore, if the list has more than a few elements, other methods (such as binary search or hashing) will be faster, but they also impose additional requirements.

'''Binary Search'''

This relies upon the linear array being sorted into order. Assume we want to find X.
# Start at the middle element.
# Is X greater than or equal to that element?
# If yes, remove all lower than that from the population.
# Move to the middle of the new population and repeat.
Note the 'middle' is always the larger element when you have an even set.

'''Bubble Sort'''

Assuming we are sorting a list of numbers from lowest to highest.
# Starting from the left, compare that number X to the one on its right Y.
# Ix X&gt;Y then swap X and Y around.
# Repeat through the entire list.
# Repeat whole process until nothing needs to switch on a full pass through.

'''Selection Sort'''

The simplest way to sort from low to high.
# Go through entire population and find the lowest.
# Shift the lowest to the farthest left.
# Ignore the sorted element(s), go through the remainder of the population in the same manner.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{status|0%}}{{DISPLAYTITLE:Abstract Data Structures}}
&lt;!-- A data type is a set of values and the basic operations that can be applied to values of that type. An abstract data type, therefore, is a data type whose properties (data and operations) are specified independently of any particular implementation. Remember that the goal in design is to reduce complexity through abstraction. If one can define useful struyctures and the operations that manipulate them at the logical level, one can use them as if they exist when needed in their designs. --&gt;

{{IB/Group_4/Computer_Science/Object-Oriented_Programming_Languages}}
Object-oriented design is another way of looking at the design process, which views a program from the standpoint of data rather than tasks. Because the functionality associated with this design process is often incorporated into high-level programming languages, we need to understand this design process before looking at specific high-level languages.

&lt;div style=&quot;background:#aadadf; border: 2px solid blue;&quot;&gt;
;usage
This template (Mnemonically'' 'Trainz Error' Fixing'') forms an internal link to the [[Trainz]] wikibook, [[Trainz Error Fixing]] volume with parameter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and incorporates an option to access a sub-sub-page given the optional 3rd default parameter: &lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as well allowing for as an optional pretty-link re-title parameter &lt;code&gt;'2' allowing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} and/or '|3=sub-page/' &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; formatted link calls ... all forming the link and all links in the wikimarkup as:&lt;br/&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/{{{3|}}}{{{1}}}|{{{2|{{{1}}}}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/code&gt;
* Users unfamiliar with wiki-markup parameter parsing, just focus on &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} or '|2=text' &lt;/nowiki&gt; overriding the presented text of the link, 
* and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}/  or '|3=sub-sub-linktext/' &lt;/nowiki&gt; giving a prefix to a sub-sub-page, so &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
: if and when given, &lt;u&gt;MUST HAVE&lt;/u&gt; a trailing '/' to form a proper link.
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;Application and operation behavior will be as from the examples below from the related {{tl|TL}} templates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
'''&lt;u&gt;Example-1, expanded paste down&lt;/u&gt;:'''
:This is because all template default parameters, formally 'numbered parameters' can also be specified like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL
 |1=Tips And Tricks
 |2=Tips
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 which wiki-markup language is processed exactly
 the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL |Tips And Tricks |Tips }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
;caution
When using a template such as this which forms a link, it is best to NOT use spaces between the pipe characters &quot;|&quot; as done for clarity above.
{{TrainzTip|Spaces in the 'pretty-text' part are fine!
}}
'''&lt;u&gt;In-line Examples&lt;/u&gt;:'''
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL|Tips And Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; links as: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the other formulation: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; both would.
:But... is much easier to edit around on a page when trying to get the best prose presentation.

* Similarly: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL|Tips And Tricks|Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; links as if the constructs: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is perhaps part of the phrase you want.

* Sub-subpage links will mainly be needed in the forthcoming Errorfixing series of tutorials and the Programmed Instruction (Trainz A-Z) linked progressive tutorials off their own sub-TOC base page. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:Planned use of Sub-sub-pages... '''Better than splitting the book down the multiple tracks'''... we're going to make ''a lot of new pages'' in the PI tutorials! Whether for beginners or intermediate Trainzers, they'll all end in content creation and other advanced topics like TransDEM map generation anyway.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

== Pywikibot wikibook ==

Hello all,

As far as I can see, [[Pywikibot]] seems to basically be an outdated copy of the official docs, and not an actual wikibook. I would like to suggest to remove the pages on wikibooks, as this might cause users to try outdated instructions, and therefore fail. I am not a wikibookean (?), however, and I'm unsure where to suggest this (other than here).

[[User:Valhallasw|Valhallasw]] ([[User talk:Valhallasw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Valhallasw|contribs]]) 14:00, 9 February 2014 (UTC)
:Do you really want to propose [[:Category:Pywikibot|all these 48 pages]] to [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]]?
:On the one hand it could be relevant to avoid doubles between the projects (because it's too long to read, someone often wants to merge, and awful to maintain), but on the other hand we could also propose to download an old Pywikipedia version, compatible with the current sites and our book (without any fork or a small dead end to adjust).
:I don't have a favorite choice, but the second option to keep an old version would have made me saved a few times when I migrated my own scripts on my Windows and my Linux. [[User:JackPotte|JackPotte]] ([[User talk:JackPotte|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JackPotte|contribs]]) 23:17, 9 February 2014 (UTC)

::I think 'removing' was not the word I should have used --- I'd like to make the pages redirects/links to mediawiki.org (if they are copies) or moving them to mw.o (if they do not exist yet). I'm also OK with just adding a banner 'This page may be out of date -- see mw.o for the most up-to-date documentation'.
::Unfortunately, there is no 'old version' that is compatible with the current sites -- the recent HTTPS switch made that impossible. [[User:Valhallasw|Valhallasw]] ([[User talk:Valhallasw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Valhallasw|contribs]]) 09:12, 10 February 2014 (UTC)

== wikiapps: a revised wiki project proposal ==

{{mbox-side|type=notice|image=Smiley green alien mmm.svg|msg=What are [[m:WikiApps|wikiapps]]?}}
Hi, this is a bit off-topic (but very much related to the wikibook [[Canvas 2D Web Apps]]): I've revised the proposal for a new wiki project called [[m:WikiApps|WikiApps]] on Meta-Wiki to cover a repository of editable, downloadable, open source HTML5 web apps in JavaScript. If you are interested, see the [[m:WikiApps|full description of WikiApps]] on Meta-Wiki for details. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 11:50, 23 February 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>Sex as a verb</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The opening paragraph claims that ''sex'' is a noun and a verb.  This is true but the example of the verb is not.  In the phrase ''to have sex'', sex is not a verb.  The only use of sex as a verb would be ''he sexed the puppies shortly after they were born'' or ''the minister was accused of sexing up the document'' (British English).--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:34, 3 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

I posted the [[Stuttering]] wikibook in 2007 as a draft of my book &quot;No Miracle Cures.&quot; The book is downloadable for free from my website (http://casafuturatech.com/free-stuttering-e-books), as well as available on Amazon. I've updated the book several times so the 2007 draft is out of date. I put the draft on Wikibooks with the hope that other people would contribute but I can't find any contributions that anyone else has made. Duplicate content confuses Google. I don't see any reason to keep it on Wikibooks.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] ([[User talk:Tdkehoe|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tdkehoe|contribs]]) 17:18, 22 July 2013 (UTC)
:{{keep}} Too much usable content to be discarded, note that your contributions here will probably have a freer licensing in regards to reuse and that in general we do not delete stubs (exceptions regarding editors/author requests mostly apply to these). As the main author/contributor you could simply add some information to the book, pointing to the free version or both.
:I also note that access your free version is limited as it requires registering.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:23, 6 August 2013 (UTC)

:::If you are the sole contributor I have no problem with that wording but since Wikibooks is a mutable copy of the original a better wording would be that a stable version maintained only by yourself is available and the location.

Cut down version of a Wikipedia article. Not a textbook and unclear how it ever would become one. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 12:36, 20 August 2013 (UTC)

* [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px|alt=|link=]] '''Delete''' Unfortunately, this page isn't a nascent book.  If undertaking to write a book about the Titanic, one would better start from scratch rather than attempt to evolve from this.  The only thing in it of interest is its note that there's material on Wikivoyage.

: (Aside:  This seems to me to further highlight the core difficulty that some sort of ''assistance'' (of a highly flexible and readily community-customizable sort) is needed for most specialized tasks in the wikimedian sisterhood.  Creating a book is one such task; it really ought to be aided by a good interactive wizard, with of course further, customized assistants for all matter of later tasks in book development and maintenance.  The core difficulty is that the wiki software is designed for writing documents on the assumption that all stylistic decisions will be sorted out by iterative revision by many editors, which tends to discourage expertise rather than helping users to apply and acquire it.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 13:26, 20 August 2013 (UTC)

* [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px|alt=|link=]] '''Delete'''. It would make an excellent subject for a book but in this case I very much doubt that this will be the result. Too many books are started and then left in the hope that they will attract further editors. Writing a book of any sort takes times and constant attention over a long period of time. The reward is a more comprehensive tract about a subject than would be found in an encyclopedia entry. If the editor who started this book was intending to encourage such an endeavor than that is to be commended. In this case I doubt the interest is there and therefore it should be deleted after an appropriate time.

[[File:Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.png|right|thumb|[[w:Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], a popular Linux-based operating system.]]
A computer generally has one operating system that becomes active and takes control when the system is turned on. Computer hardware is wired to initially load a small set of system instructions that is stored in [[IB/Group 4/Computer Science/Computer Organisation#RAM_and_ROM|permanent memory]]. You've likely used at least one operating system before. The various versions of Microsoft Windows (from NT, to XP, and Vista to 8) are popular choices for personal computers. UNIX has been a favourite of serious programmers for years, and a version of UNIX called [[w:Linux|Linux]] is popular for personal computer systems. 
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.1|Identify the resources that need to be managed within a computer system.}}
The various roles of an operating system generally revolve around the idea of &quot;sharing nicely.&quot; An operating system manages resources, and these resources are often shared in one way or another among the various programs that want to use them: multiple programs executing concurrently share the use of main memory; they take turns using the CPU; and they compete for an opportunity to use input and output devices.  The operating system acts as the playground monitor, making sure that everyone cooperates and gets a chance to play.

There various aspects or resources that require management in a computer system, including: primary memory and secondary memory, processor, bandwidth, graphics and sound, networks, and cache.

== System resources ==
=== Memory management ===
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.7|Outline OS resource management techniques: scheduling, policies, '''multitasking''', virtual memory, paging, interrupt, polling.}}
[[File:The Fetch-Execute Cycle.svg|thumb|[[IB/Group 4/Computer Science/Computer Organisation#The_Fetch-Execute_Cycle|The Fetch-Execute Cycle]]]] An executing program resides in main memory and its instructions are processed one after another in the [[IB/Group 4/Computer Science/Computer Organisation#The_Fetch-Execute_Cycle|fetch-decode-execute cycle]]. Multiprogramming is the technique of keeping multiple programs in main memory at the same time; these programs compete for access to the CPU so that they can do their work. All modern operating systems employ multiprogramming to one degree or another. An operating system must therefore perform memory management to keep track of what programs are in memory and where in memory they reside.

			Memory is a continuous set of bits referenced by specific addresses.
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

All programs are stored in main memory when they are executed. All data referenced by those programs programs are also stored in main memory so that they can be accessed. Main memory can be thought of as a big continuous chuck of space divided into groups of 8, 16, and 32 bits. Each bye or word of memory has a corresponding address, which is simply an integer that uniquely identifies that particular part of memory. To the right there is a representation of memory, where the first memory address is 0.
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.5|Explain the role of the operating system in terms of managing memory, peripherals and hardware interfaces.}}
Earlier it was stated that in a multiprogramming environment, multiple programs (and their data) are stored in main memory at the same time. Thus, operating systems must employ techniques to:

* track where and how a program resides in memory, and
* convert logical program addresses into actual memory addresses.

A program is filled with references to variables and to other parts of the program code. When the program is compiled, these references are changed into the addresses in memory where the data and code resides. But since one doesn't know exactly where a program will be loaded into main memory, how can one know what address to use for anything?

The solution is to use two kinds of addresses: logical addresses and physical addresses. A logical address (sometimes called a virtual or relative address) is a value that specifies a generic location, relative to the program but not to the reality of main memory. A physical address is an actual address in the main memory device − again shown in the figure.

When a program is compiled, a reference to an identifier (such as a variable name) is changed to a logical address. When the program is eventually loaded into memory, each logical address finally corresponds to a specific physical address. The mapping of a logical address to a physical address is called address binding. Logical addresses allow a program to be moved around in memory or loaded in different places at different times. As long as one keeps track of where the program is stored, one is always able to determine the physical address that corresponds to any given logical address.
{{IB/Extension|
The following sections examine the underlying principles of there main memory management techniques. To simplify examples, all address-binding calculations are performed in base 10.

===== Partition memory management =====
{{info|Section entitled &quot;'''Partition memory management'''&quot; is planned.}}
===== Paged memory management =====
{{info|Section entitled &quot;'''Paged memory management'''&quot; is planned.}}
}}

==== Virtual memory ====
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.7|Outline OS resource management techniques: scheduling, policies, multitasking, '''virtual memory''', paging, interrupt, polling.}}

The demand paging approach gives rise to the idea of virtual memory, the illusion that there are no restrictions on the size of a program (because the entire program is not necessarily in memory at the same time). In all of the memory management techniques examined earlier, the entire process had to be brought into memory as a continuous whole. Therefore there is always an  upper bound on process size. Demand paging removes that restriction.

However, virtual memory comes with lots of overhead during the execution of a program. With other memory management techniques, once a program was loaded into memory, it was all there and ready to go. With the virtual memory approach, one constantly has to swap pages between main and secondary memory. This overhead is usually acceptable - while one program is waiting for a page to be swapped, another process can take control of the CPU and make progress. Excessive page swapping is called thrashing and can seriously degrade system performance.

{{info|Section entitled &quot;'''Consequences'''&quot; is planned.}}

==== Secondary memory ====
The most widely used [[IB/Group_4/Computer_Science/Computer_Organisation#Secondary_Storage_Devices|secondary storage]] device is the magnetic disk drive. It includes both the hard drives that are found in the computer's main casing and disks that are portable and can be moved easily between computers. Storing data onto secondary storage requires a mechanism of organising the electron medium. As such, the use of individual files are used, and from the user's point of view, the smallest amount of data that can bet written to secondary memory. A file system is the natural solution to managing these files, and is the logical view that an operating system provides so that users can manage data as a collection of files. A file system is often organized by grouping files into directories. Additionally, a file is a generic concept. Different types of files are managed in different ways. A file, in general, contains a program (in some form) or data (of one type or another). Some files have a very rigid format; others are more flexible.

The most important hardware device used as secondary memory is the magnetic disk drive. File systems stored on these drives must be accessed in an efficient manner. It turns out that transferring data to and from secondary memory is the worst bottleneck in a general computer system.

The speed of the CPU and the speed of main memory are much faster than the speed of data transfer to and from secondary memory such as a magnetic disk. That's why a process that must perform I/O to disk is made to wait while that  data is transferred, to give another process a chance to use the CPU.

Because secondary I/O is the slowest aspect of a general computer system, the techniques for accessing data on a disk drive are of crucial importance to file systems. As computer deals with multiple processes over a period of time, requests to access the disk accumulate. The technique that the operating system uses to determine which requests to satisfy is called disk scheduling.
{{IB/Extension|
A magnetic disk drive is organized as a stack of platters, where each platter is divided into tracks, and each tracks is divided into sectors. The set of corresponding tracks on all platters is called a cylinder.

=== Process management ===
&lt;!-- Another key operating system concept is the idea of a process, which can be defined as a program in execution. A program is a static set of instructions. A process is the dynamic entity that represents the program while it is being executed. Through multiprogramming, a computer system might have many active processes at once. The operating system must manage these processes carefully. At any point in time a specific instruction may be the next to be executed. Intermediate values have been calculated. A process might be interrupted during its execution, so the operating system performs process management to carefully track the progress of a process and all of its intermediate states. --&gt;
Another important resource that an operating system must manage is the use of the CPU by individual processes. TO understand how an operating system manages processes, one must recognise the stages that a process goes through during its computational life and understand the information that must be managed to keep a process working correctly in a computer system.
=== The process states ===
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.5|Explain the role of the operating system in terms of managing memory, peripherals and hardware interfaces.}}
Processes move through specific stages as they are managed in a computer system. That is, a process enters the system, is ready to be executed, is executing, is waiting for a resource, or is finished. Below is flow chart that represents these process states.
&lt;center&gt;[[File:Process Life Cycle.svg|The process life cycle]]&lt;/center&gt;
In the figure, each box represents a state a process might be in, and the arrows indicate how and why a process might move from one state to another.

Examining what's happening to a process in each state:
* In the ''new state'', a process is being created. It may, for instance, be a login process created by a user logging onto a timesharing system, an application process created when a user submits a program for execution, or a system process created by the operating system to accomplish a specific system task.
* A process that has no barriers to its execution is in the ''ready state''. A process in the ready state is not waiting for an event to occur or for data to be brought in from secondary memory. Instead, it is waiting for its chance to use the CPU.
* A process in the ''running state'' is currently being executed by the CPU. Its instructions are being processed in the fetch-execute cycle.
* A process in the ''waiting state'' is currently waiting for resources (other than the CPU). For example, a process in the waiting state may be waiting for a page of its memory to be brought in from secondary memory or for another process to send it a signal that it may continue.
* A process in the ''terminate state'' has completed its execution and is no longer active. At this point the operating system no longer needs to maintain the information regarding the process.

Note that many processes may be in the ready state or the waiting state at the same time, but only one process can be in the running state.

After the process is created, the operating system admits it to the ready state. When the CPU scheduling algorithm dictates, a process is dispatched to the running state.

While running, the process might be interrupted by the operating system to allow another process to have its chance on the CPU. In that case, the process simply returns to the ready state. Alternatively, a running process might request a resource that is not available or requires I/O to retrieve a newly referenced part of the process, in which case it is moved to the waiting state. A running process may finally get enough CPU time to complete its processing and terminate normally; otherwise, it may generate an unrecoverable error and terminate abnormally.

When a waiting process gets the resources it is waiting for, it moves to the ready state again.

==== The process control block ====
The operating system must manage a large amount of data for each active process. Usually those data are stored in a data structured called a process control block (PCB). Generally, each state is represented by a list of PCBs, one for each process in that state. When a process moves from one state to another, its corresponding PCB moves from one state list to another in the operating system. A new PCB is created when a process is first created (the new state) and persists until the process terminates.

=== CPU scheduling ===
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.7|Outline OS resource management techniques: '''scheduling''', policies, multitasking, virtual memory, paging, interrupt, polling.}}
Related to the ideas of memory management and process management is the need for CPU scheduling, which determines which process in memory is executed by the CPU at any given point. The problem of how to capitalise on computers' greater capabilities and speed has led to the concept of timesharing. A timesharing system allows multiple users to interact with a computer at the same time. Multiprogramming allowed multiple processes to be active at once, which gave rise to the ability for programmers to interact with the computer system directly, while still sharing it resources, whereas timesharing systems create the illusion that each user has exclusive access to the computer. That is, each user does not have to actively compete for resources, though that is exactly what is happening behind the scenes. One user may actually know they are sharing the machine with other users, but does not have to do anything special to allow for it. The operating system manages the sharing of the resources, including the CPU, behind the scenes.

CPU scheduling is the act of determining which process in the ready state should be moved to the running state. That is, CPU scheduling algorithms decide which process should be given over the CPU so that it can make computational progress.

CPU scheduling decisions are made when a process switches from the running state to the waiting state, or when a program terminates. This type of CPU scheduling is called nonpreemptive scheduling, because the need for a new CPU process is the result of the activity of the current executing process.

CPU scheduling decisions may also be made when a process moves from the running state to the ready state or when a process moves from the waiting state to the ready state. These are examples of preemptive scheduling, because the currently running process (through not fault of its own) is preempted by the operating system.

Scheduling algorithms are often evaluated using particular metrics, such as the turnaround time for a process. This is the amount of time between the time a process arrives in the ready state to the time it exits the running state for the last time. One would like, on average, for the turnaround time for a processes to be as small as possible.

There are various approaches that can be used to determine which process gets chosen first to move from the ready state to the running state. Here there is an examination of three:

==== First-come, first-served ====
In first-come, first-served (FCFS) scheduling approach, processes are moved to the CPU in the order in which they arrive in the running state. FCFS scheduling is nonpreemptive. Once a process is given access to the CPU, it keeps it unless it makes a request that forces it to wait, such as request that forces it to wait, such as a request for a device in use by another process.
{{IB/Extension|
{{info|Section entitled &quot;'''First-come, first-served'''&quot; is planned.}}
}}

==== Shortest job next ====
The shortest-job-next {SJN} CPU scheduling algorithm looks at all processes in the ready state and dispatches the one with the smallest service time. Like FCFS, it is generally implemented as a nonpreemptive algorithm. 
{{IB/Extension|
{{info|Section entitled &quot;'''Shortest job next'''&quot; is planned.}}
}}

==== Round Robin ====
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.5|Explain the role of the operating system in terms of managing memory, peripherals and hardware interfaces.}}
Round-robin CPU scheduling distributes the processing time equitably among all ready processes. The algorithm establishes a particular time slice (or time quantum), which is the amount of time each process receives before being preempted and return to the ready state to allow another process its turn. Eventually the preempted process will be given another time slice on the CPU. This procedure continues until the process eventually gets all the time it needs and terminates.
{{IB/Extension|
Note that the round-robin algorithm is preemptive. The expiration of a time slice is an arbitrary reason to move a process from the CPU. This action is presented by the transition from the running state to the ready state.

[[File:Network_card.jpg|left|thumb|A network card. Click the image for specific details relating to the card itself.]]
Operating systems must also take into account the fact that computers are usually connected to networks. Today with the World Wide Web one would take network communication for granted, however, the vastly connected and interactive world requires management on the data level. Operating systems will be able to process the inputs and outputs to and fro the physical computer - usually through a network card of sorts. This communication between the network card and the computer is usually managed through a Network Interface Controller (NIC), a small component that handles two of the [[IB/Group_4/Computer_Science/Networks#Open_Systems|OSI layers]]; the physical and data link layer.

=== Sound and graphic management ===
Along with other peripherals, the most fundamental aspect which operating systems must deal with is that of graphics and graphic management. Computer graphics can be very generally described as the setting of pixel values on the computer screen. As such, computer graphics play a role in many aspects in computer science, the most common application being the graphical user interface (GUI) of the modern operating systems. Files and folders are represented as icons on the screen, with the icon indicating the file type, for instance. The operating system must account for the whereabouts and calculation of computer graphics, and is typically done using its own individual Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).

=== Miscellaneous ===
==== Cache management ====
&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tright&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
		[[File:Crystal Project cookie.png|110px]]
		[[File:HTTP-Cookie-Google.svg|220px]]
		&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot;&gt;
			A [[w:HTTP Cookie|HTTP Cookie]] is a type of cache.
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Aside from the obvious, there are various other miscellaneous system concepts that require management, which may not be entirely obvious. One is that of cache. Cache is a component that transparently stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data that is stored within a cache might be values that have been computed earlier or duplicates of original values that are stored elsewhere. If requested data is contained in the cache, this request can be served by simply reading the cache, which is comparatively faster. Otherwise, the data has to be recomputed or fetched from its original storage location, which is comparatively slower. Hence, the greater the number of requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the overall system performance becomes.

== The role of the operating system ==
=== Operating system types ===
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.2|Evaluate the resources available in a variety of computer systems.}}

=== Physical systems ===
[[File:Personal_computer,_exploded_5.svg|thumb|left|Standard hardware components.]]
An operating system is responsible for communicating with a variety of devices. Usually that communication is accomplished with the help of a device driver, a small program that &quot;knows&quot; the way a particular device expects to receive and deliver information. With device drivers, every operating system no longer needs to know about every device with which it might possible be expected to communicate in te fuure. It's another beautiful example of abstraction. An appropriate device driver often comes with new hardware, and the most up-to-date drivers can often be downloaded for free from the manufacturing company's website.

==== Dedicated operating systems ====
{{IB/Criterion|6.1.8|Discuss the advantages of producing a dedicated operating system for a device.}}
Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablet computers, run operating systems that are tailored to their needs. The memory constraints and the smaller set of peripherals involved, for example, are different than those of a typical desktop or laptop computer. [[w:Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad all run the iOS mobile operating system which is derived from Mac OS.
The Android operating system, developed by Google, is an open source project as part of the Open Handset Alliance. It has become the most popular OS for a variety of mobile devices. Android and iOS dominate the current market for mobile operating systems, though there are other competitors.

Number greater than 9 can be formed with help of these first ten. For example—
*1 is written as &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;१&lt;/font&gt;
*2 is written as &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;२&lt;/font&gt;
*3 is written as &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;३&lt;/font&gt;

So 123 can be written as &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;१२३&lt;/font&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thoughts are complex things. In AI, logic is a way to simplify thoughts to their essences in a formal manner so that they can be reasoned about by machines. Like any representation, logical representations ignore some details and make a big deal out of others. 

We will discuss propositional logic, and then predicate logic. But here we'll just give you a taste of what they are like. 

Let's suppose you have a thought: &quot;Ocelots are endangered.&quot; Propositional logic would represent this with a single letter, for example, &quot;P.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
P
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Note that it ignores the fact that Ocelots are animals, that there is more than one, etc. In predicate logic, we might represent this fact like this:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
Endangered(Ocelots)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Notice that in predicate logic we have more structure. This is more powerful, and in AI, this makes it slightly less efficient. In AI, there is often a tradeoff between representational power and complexity and computational efficiency.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Knowledge representation (KR) is the name we give to how we encode knowledge, beliefs, actions, feelings, goals, desires, preferences, and all other mental states in artificial systems. As nearly all of AI research is done by programming computers, these representations often end up being some kind of character set in software. However, we can discuss them at a higher level than that of code: the information level. 

Suppose, for example, we have a list of countries in North America in the year 2000. The knowledge we encode would be the three countries: The United States, Canada, and Mexico. This is an unordered list. We can then represent this knowledge in different ways in different computer programming languages. For example:

Python: 
&lt;code&gt;
NorthAmericanCountries = (&quot;The United States&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;

LISP:
&lt;code&gt;
(setq north-american-countries '(the-united-states canada mexico))
&lt;/code&gt;

...and so on. The world is a complex place, and the job of the AI programmer is to decide which details to encode in the KR and which to ignore. Sometimes this is simple. For example, if you were programming a computer to decide on chess moves, it's not necessary to encode exactly where on the square each piece is. It's irrelevant to what move will be made. Other decisions are more difficult. 

In general, though, you want to have as much complexity as you need and no more. The reason for this is that added representational complexity results in more complicated programming and computational processes when you run the AI program.

Having &quot;as much complexity as you need&quot; is a call for &quot;representational adequacy,&quot; which basically means that your representation has the information it needs to do what it needs to do. Three ways to evaluate a KR are in terms of clarity, precision, and naturalness.

'''Clarity'''

A KR that has clarity is one that is not ambiguous. One of the reasons we use programming languages at all is that the languages we use naturally, such as English, are ambiguous. Programming languages are designed to have no ambiguity.

'''Precision'''

A KR with precision gets to the level of detail necessary. In chess, it's not enough to know that a piece is on the board--the agent needs to know which square it's on, what kind of piece it is, and what color it is. Whether or not a piece has a scratch on it is not necessary for playing chess, so details like this can be left out of the representation.

'''Naturalness'''

A third criterion is naturalness, which is how easily the KR can be interpreted by people, or, perhaps, how easily it can be translated into something a person can understand. This is important because people in many instances don't want to simply trust what an AI tells them--they want an explanation. Being able to see what reasons the AI used to generate its output is only useful if the KR has a degree of naturalness.

Naturalness is also important for the programmers. It's good to have a natural KR so that future programmers (perhaps even you!) will be able to make sense of what was written at a later date. For this reason, it's important that your KR have explicit semantics and syntax.

For example, look at this representation:

&lt;code&gt;
red(car)
&lt;/code&gt;

What does this mean? &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;car&lt;/code&gt; are just symbols; they can mean whatever we want them to mean. Let's assume that the KR was designed to be natural, and they mean what they appear to man in English. There's still ambiguity. Does it mean that all cars are red? That a particular car is red? Is it a function that returns true if the car is red? Or is it a command to paint a car red? 

What looks obvious at programming time might be confusing later. 

Let's return to our example above, representing North American countries. There's no reason why the three countries in the list need to be ordered. However, in LISP and in Python the list data structures are ordered. In the language Smalltalk, for example, there is a data structure called &quot;bag&quot; which can hold an unordered collection of items. The programming language we choose often puts constraints on the KR.

How many countries are in North America? There are three, but is this explicitly represented in the code above? No. Lists are represented. If we wanted to encode the list lengths explicitly, we could do something like this:

&lt;code&gt;
NorthAmericanCountries = (3, &quot;The United States&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;

However, it's so easy to count the things in a list that most programmers would just recalculate the list length with a function when needed. This also keeps the system from needing to change the explicitly represented number every time the list length changes. 

This gets at the '''inferential adequacy''' of the KR, which is how well the system can use the KR to infer what it needs to. '''Representational efficiency''' refers to how efficiently the AI can use the KR to do its reasoning--in terms of time or computational resources, as appropriate.

Although any programmer can make up any KR he or she wants to, there are many already created, and their properties are well understood. It's often advisable to use a a well-known KR than to make up your own. In this book we'll show you many different KRs. In the next parts, we'll talk about two: semantic networks and frames.

I have reverted your recent edits to this page because you removed a large quantity of text without explaining your reasons in the Edit Summary.  If this was a genuine edit you can change it back again but please leave an Edit Summary so other Wikibooks users know what you are doing.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:59, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

: I note your further edits to this book and the accompanying edit summary.  It does look rather ambitious and suspicious for Wikibooks content.  Looks like you made the right call.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 02:15, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

:Thanks for your message on my talk page.  If you feel that text has been taken from copyrighted sources then feel free to remove it.  If it turns out that we're wrong then things can get reverted later.  Do you just suspect this or do you know of any particular sources where this material has come from (online or offline)?  With regards to stuff that is copied from other Wikibooks books I'd say don't worry about that.  I'll try to take a closer look at the World History book when I have some free time.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 02:19, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

:Having done a random search for a piece of text (''most probably to surmount the Maginot Line of defenses on the Franco-German border'') it seems that much of content just removed comes from the Wikipedia article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The storage of glassware is an important aspect of any bar, be it commercial or in the home. Proper storage of glassware helps reduce breakage, keeps things readily accessible, and encourages good hygiene.

==General Principles==
Glassware, regardless of the material of construction, should be stored face-down, either hung from appropriate supports (such as glass rails), or on anti-slip mats somewhere within easy reach of the bartender. This prevents both potentially dangerous chipping of the rim of the glass as well as the ingress of dust, dead insects and other detritus found in most every room. Glasses which do not nest should not be stacked, as the stack may collapse when unstable. Moreover, even if glasses are designed to stack they should not be stacked if they have just come out of the washer, as the warmer glasses may contract and shatter glasses they sit atop. 

Glasses should be periodically inspected for chips or scratches, and those damaged glasses discarded immediately -- sudden heat from washers or sudden cold from bar ice or chilled drinks can cause structurally weakened glass to shatter, and chipped glass may cut drinkers. 

Delicate stemware should be stored away from heavy-bottomed glasses, and more frequently-stored glasses (depending on the establishment) stored nearer the bartender and in greater quantity. Finally, glassware should be stored away from edges, elbows and other moving hazards.

Oops! I created this page without making it a proper section of the [IB Mathematics SL] WikiBook. I have created the section properly, and all that is left to be done in cleaning up my mistake is to delete this page.

The International Baccalaureate expects Mathematics Standard Level students to know these formulae and related concepts.

==Area of a parallelogram:==

&lt;math&gt; A = b \times h &lt;/math&gt;

==Area of a triangle:==

&lt;math&gt; A = \frac {b \times h} {2} &lt;/math&gt;

==Area of a trapezium==

&lt;math&gt; A = \frac {1} {2} (a + b) h &lt;/math&gt;

==Area of a circle==

&lt;math&gt; A = \pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt;

==Circumference of a circle==

&lt;math&gt; C = 2 \pi r &lt;/math&gt;

==Volume of a Pyramid==

&lt;math&gt; V = \frac {1} {3} (Area _ {base} \times height) &lt;/math&gt;

==Volume of a Cuboid (rectangular prism)==

&lt;math&gt; V = l \times w \times h &lt;/math&gt;

==Volume of a Cylinder==

&lt;math&gt; V = \pi r^2 h &lt;/math&gt;

==Area of the curved surface of a cylinder==

&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \pi r h &lt;/math&gt;

==Volume of a Sphere==

&lt;math&gt; A = \frac {4} {3} \pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt;

==Volume of a cone==

&lt;math&gt; V = \frac {1} {3} \pi r^2 h &lt;/math&gt;

==Distance between two points &lt;math&gt; ( x_1, y_1, z_1 ) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; ( x_2, y_2, z_2 ) &lt;/math&gt;==

&lt;math&gt; d = \sqrt {(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 + (z_1 - z_2)^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

==Coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (&lt;math&gt; x_1, y_1, z_1 &lt;/math&gt;) and (&lt;math&gt; x_2, y_2, z_2 &lt;/math&gt;)==

&lt;math&gt; \left ( \frac {x_1 + x_2} {2} , \frac {y_1 + y_2} {2} , \frac {z_1 + z_2} {2} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;</text>

Thanks for correcting mistakes in Wikibooks' pages.  Please be careful as it appears, one two occasions, that you corrected words which didn't need correcting (the word ''comments'').--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:00, 5 March 2014 (UTC)

I somehow mistyped 'constants' into 'contants'. Maybe this is the cause of the revert? If you believe it should be 'comments' instead of 'constants', please read the paragraph again. It talks about constants, not comments. Thanks!</text>

      <comment>Added some initial content about MPLS</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">MPLS stands for Multi-Protocol Label Switching, and is a protocol that was originally developed out of work by Cisco but was formalised into an IEEE standard. It’s a protocol that is used to provide transparent access over a backbone network to data that uses other protocols.

MPLS is sometimes characterised as “layer 2.5”. This is most obvious in the way the packets are wrapped (the MPLS data goes between the Ethernet frame header and the IP packet in IP-over-Ethernet, for example), but it’s also a description of the bigger picture of the protocol. MPLS doesn’t provide routing, and makes use of another interior routing protocol (iBGP, IS-IS, OSPF or others) to route packets. But neither is it fully a layer-2 protocol, since it relies on existing layer 2 to do the framing of the data and provide communication between nodes. MPLS can deterministically control where data goes in a way that layer 2 switching can’t.

== Switching performance ==

One of the factors driving MPLS early on was that the switching of packets under MPLS could be implemented efficiently in hardware, which IP routing couldn’t (at the time). This is no longer true. In this sense, MPLS is just a way of “baking down” the routing tables into a high-performance switching infrastructure. Though this played a part in driving the development of MPLS initially, it’s no longer relevant.

== Actual advantages of MPLS ==

=== Backbone infrastructure for heterogeneous networks ===
MPLS can switch any layer 3 protocol over any layer 2 protocol. It’s thus useful for providing the backbone on a network where many different protocols (including future protocols yet to be specified) may want to travel over the backbone. Previously this kind of thing was only possible with Frame Relay or ATM.

MPLS can also carry layer 2 packets over the backbone, since the contents are ignored. This means that any layer 2 protocol can be carried over MPLS, known as AToM (any transport over MPLS)

=== IP over ATM ===

ATM was originally viewed as a potential replacement for IP as an end-to-end network, but it never happened. However, ATM is still widely used as a WAN network. Now that IP dominates the internet, it’s necessary to transport IP over these existing ATM networks. There are several specific solutions for implementing IP over ATM, but they’re all complicated to implement and MPLS can replace all of these.

=== Traffic management ===

BGP (for example) provides ways to customise which way data goes by using route maps and communities and such. But this is fiddly and opaque to implement. MPLS can allow different streams of data to be switched in different routes through the network very flexibly and with very direct control.

=== Tunnels and VPNs ===

MPLS has a layered structure that allows packets to be wrapped up in an unlimited number of additional containers. Only the outer label plays any role in routing the packet through the network at any time, so you can use this to tunnel traffic through parts of the network while ignoring what’s inside the packet.

The contents of the packet inside the label are ignored entirely by MPLS. This means you can encapsulate a full ethernet frame inside an MPLS label (with a further layer 2 frame outside of that) and pass the entire ethernet frame around the network unchanged, simulating a wire in a layer 2 broadcast domain that spans long distances and many routing hops.

== Types of VPNs ==

There are two types of VPNs:

* overlay
* peer-to-peer

In the overlay model, the service provider sets up links between customer’s routers across the network. The customer’s routers peer with each other directly across these links, and don’t peer with the service provider’s routers.

In the peer-to-peer model, the service provider’s routers peer with the customer’s routers. This requires more work on the part of the service provider, since the provider edge routers need to be updated in response to changes in the customer network.

The overlay model used to be the most common way of providing VPNs, but MPLS made it simpler to provide peer-to-peer VPNs.

== LDP ==
LDP is the protocol used to distribute labels in an MPLS network (RSVP and MP-BGP can also distribute labels). It’s based on TDP, a Cisco proprietary protocol. LDP is similar enough that it has entirely superseded TDP.

LDP doesn’t choose the routes, it merely distributes labels for routes that have been determined some other way. For the case of IP over MPLS, the routes that are labelled using LDP will have been determined using a standard IP routing protocol. This most simple form is mostly an anachronism (though a surprisingly young one); at a time when routers couldn’t do wire-speed IP routing, replacing a route with a label improved performance.
Nowadays, the more interesting cases are where “routes” other than standard IP routes are being switched using MPLS, e.g. VPNs or traffic engineering. This will involve another protocol making the decisions and then using LDP to coordinate labels.

=== Label distribution modes ===

There are two major modes for distributing the labels: Downstream Unsolicited and Downstream on Demand. The on-demand form saves memory on the routers because only the labels that are needed are transferred. However, the DU form converges faster. The DU form is more common now that routers tend to have more than enough memory (Cisco uses DoD for LC-ATM, but DU for everything else).

=== Label Retention modes ===

In Conservative Label Retention mode, the router stores only those bindings that are associated with the next-hop for a particular FEC. That is, for each FEC there is only one label held at a time (the label that’s programmed in the LFIB).
In Liberal Label Retention mode, the router stores any bindings that it receives.

=== LSP control modes ===

There are two control modes: ordered, and independent. In independent control mode the LSRs exchange labels for any routes that are in their routing table. This is simple to understand and reason about, but it has the disadvantage that it means that different parts of the LSP will come up at different times. It may be that traffic can make it part way across the network to a router that doesn’t have a label binding set up, at which point the router can’t take the right action with the packets. This may cause the router to fall back to slower IPv4 routing (e.g. in software).
Ordered control mode causes labels only to be assigned for routes that are directly connected or that already have labels established with the next hop router.

=== FECs ===

LDP is based on the idea of a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC). A FEC is defined by a class of traffic that will all be treated in the same way. An obvious example would be all IP packets with a destination address in a certain prefix, but it could be anything else that can be defined in a way that both LDP speakers agree on. A pseudowire between two LSRs would act as a FEC.

=== LDP peerings ===

LDP routers discover each other by sending HELLO messages as UDP multicast packets to the “all routers on the subnet” multicast address, so it isn’t necessary to explicitly set up the addresses of peer routers. When a HELLO message is received, the receiving router retains the address the packet came from. The HELLO packet contains a hold time, which is the length of time between HELLO messages. If this is exceeded, the peering is regarded as having failed.

Each LSR has an LDP ID, which is 4 bytes identifying the router and 2 bytes for the label space in use. The 4 byte router ID is in practice an IPv4 address, though it isn’t used for messaging; the only requirement is that it’s unique. Zero for the label space indicates the platform-wide label space, while a non-zero value indicates a per-interface label space. 

In Cisco IOS, the router ID is actually treated as an IP address and the router checks that the address is in the routing table.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Switzerland=

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first meter was installed in 1923.
* All franks contain “HELVETIA”.
* Frank dies are designed and furnished by postal authorities rather than meter manufacturers. Although these designs are changed periodically, within each design period all stamps closely resemble each other, and this often makes accurate identification a challenge.
* Native meter manufacturers in Switzerland: Frama, Franco, Francopost, Hasler, and Safag.
* Swiss meter stamps were applied to gummed labels as well as directly to the mail piece. Early labels had the name of the mailer or his logo pre-printed, and it often included a frame and the meter number. Stamps applied to such personalized labels are usually worth a premium.
* The stamps are grouped according to appearance and purpose as follows:
:: A - Oval frank
:: B - Horizontal frank with incomplete outer frame
:: C - Horizontal frank with complete frame, inscribed &quot;HELVETIA&quot; in top panel and an outline “P” in each side panel
:: D - Horizontal frank with complete frame, inscribed “CH” in top panel and “HELVETIA” in left panel
:: E - Digital frank without frame, with 2D barcode data code field
:: PO - Stamps generated only at Post Office counters
:: PD - Stamps used for collecting Postage Due
:: PS - Stamps used to frank Postal Stationery
:: PV - Stamps from public self-service vending machines
:: OO - Stamps used only for Official government mail

* For specialized information about the meter stamps of Switzerland, see ''Die Freistempel der Schweiz'', Band I and Band II, by Heiner Dürst and ''Repertorio Catalogo delle affrancature meccaniche svizzere nel terzo millennio'', by Roberto Di Casola. The listings in the present catalog were heavily influenced by both works.

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3&gt;
* Starting in 1946 meter numbers were assigned without regard to meter manufacturer or model and are no longer useful for identification.
* Because the Swiss postal service furnishes all stamp dies, the stamps are quite similar and are difficult to tell apart. Although there are exceptions, the stamps usually can be identified by the size of the &quot;P&quot; at the sides of the frank and by differences in the corner ornaments.


[[File: Switzerland stamp group BB P ornaments.jpg|center|500px]]


* Three “P” sizes were used: Medium (6+ mm tall by 3+ mm wide), Narrow (6+ mm tall by 3- mm wide), and Tall (7- mm tall by 3+ mm wide).


[[File: Switzerland stamp group BB corner ornaments.jpg|center|750px]]


* Three variations of the corner ornaments exist, Closed, Open, and Dashed. Looking at the lower left ornament examine the ends of the third and fourth lines from the top. With &quot;Closed&quot; the two lines are bridged. With &quot;Open&quot; they are unconnected. With &quot;Dashed&quot; they are also unconnected but a small dash is present in the opening.

* Proper identification requires care as the size of the &quot;P&quot; is not easily identified without a millimeter gauge. The corner ornaments are not always reliable. Occasionally one finds different ones on the same stamp!  Thus the following table is not foolproof.

'''TPACK Group Report:'''

The group started the TPACKing process by identifying the Iowa Core Economics standards for grades nine through twelve.  Each group member chose a standard to base their individual lesson on.  Each of the group members use TPACK to break down their individual lesson into Technology Knowledge, Content Knowledge, Pedagogical areas in order to develop activities.  To guide the TPACK lesson creating process, the group used resources found in the RWLD and focused on the article written by Harris and Hofer titled Grounded Tech Integration.  As a supplement to the article, the group used the shared Google Doc that details the five steps to TPACK lesson planning.  The links we used as references are listed below.

Overall, the group didn’t encounter many challenges.  We realized that we could only go so far as a group before we really needed to focus on our individual lesson plans.  As we completed our individual lesson plans, we were better able to understand and communicate the learning activity types and technologies involved.

      <text xml:space="preserve">

=== Overview ===
William Heights Elementary School opened in August of 1958. In addition to general education students, William Heights also serves students throughout the district with mental and physical disabilities. Special Education, Title I and ELL (English Language Learners) students are integrated in the general education classrooms through the inclusion program. The current organizational plan consists of a grant preschool class, two sections of Head Start (preschool), and four sections of K-5 classrooms. William Heights has a population of over 500 students comprised of diverse racial, religious, cultural and socio-economic back grounds. William Heights Elementary is part of the district William Heights Community Schools. Our schools comprise the largest district in the state of Iowa.

=== Technology: ===
At William Heights we offer two full mac computer labs (32 computers/lab).  Each classroom is also equipped with two student laptops, a teacher laptop, and a hub set up to the smart board.  Each school in our district has a school librarian that also acts as our technology coach. We have one technology coordinator for the entire district.  We also have a district help desk that assists with technology problems.

=== Group Report ===
'''Curriculum: Literacy''' 

We decided on literacy due to our belief in the importance of this subject matter.  We also felt we each had a varied perspective, and use of literacy in the classroom that would make this an interesting subject choice.  

=== '''Grades: 3rd - 5th''' ===

Making the choice of grades proved to be more challenging than we originally thought.  Originally we thought we would do an overarching view of grades K-5, but on further review of the assignment we realized we needed to identify specific grades.  In this case majority was the decider, as two of our group members are upper elementary.  

=== '''Standards:''' ===

When choosing our standards we took a collaborative approach. We chose to meet in a google hangout and look at the 3rd-5th grade literacy standards together.  We then each identified standards of interest that would also support each other, and   decided from there.  
We decided on the following standards:

Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers. (RL.3.1)
Refer to details and examples in a text when explaining what the text says explicitly and when drawing inferences from the text. (RL.4.1)
Quote accurately from a text when explaining what the text says explicitly and when drawing inferences from the text. (RL.5.1)
Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson,
or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text. (RL.3.2)
Determine a theme of a story, drama, or poem from details in the text; summarize the text. (RL.4.2)
Respond to challenges or how the speaker in a poem reflects upon a topic; summarize the text. (RL.5.2)
Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events. (RL.3.3)
Describe in depth a character, setting, or event in a story or drama, drawing on specific details in the text (e.g., a   character’s thoughts, words, or actions). (RL.4.3)
Compare and contrast two or more characters, settings, or events in a story or drama, drawing on specific details in the text (e.g., how characters interact). (RL.5.3)

=== '''Activities/Technologies:''' ===

When determining our activities we decided to do this individually by dividing the work.  Each group member was asked to pick 3 standards, and then for each standard choose three activities and three technologies to align with each standard.  This was beneficial because we were each allotted the freedom to select and create our own activities, while still building upon each others work due to the standards supporting one another.  When creating these activities and determining the technologies each group member was expected to have reviewed the RWLD, and have read the articles so that each activity aligned with the conceptual ideas of TPACK.

1.  Ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text, referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers. (RL.3.1) 
      Activity/Technology #1 - Login to newsela.com and choose an article with “Anchor 1” (located at the top near the article title). Read the article and take the quiz, using the text as a    reference to answer the questions.

     Activity/Technology #2 - Write a friendly letter to an author of your choice (may be teacher chosen)  using readwritethink letter generator, asking questions about a given story.  You must include  the 5 W’s and an H in your letter, and you should refer to the text in your letters to create your questions.

     Activity/Technology #3 - Work with your group to become ‘text detectives’.    Create a bubbl.us mind map of the story using the 5 W’s and and H as your guide.  Be sure to  include bubbles referring to the problem and solution in your story.  Use the text while creating your map.

2.  Refer to details and examples in a text when explaining what the text says explicitly and when drawing inferences from the text. (RL.4.1)

     Activity/Technology #1 - Work with your group.  Create a commercial for your novel using imovie.  You will need to use the storyboard app on your ipad to create your detailed plan of how you will present your book and it’s main theme.  Your commercial needs to include the 5 w’s and an h, and should also refer directly to the text.  Your commercial should be no more than 3 minutes long.

     Activity/Technology #2 -Create a voicethread ‘quiz’ for your classmates with your partner about the book your group is reading..  Use the text to help you create your quiz.  Try to ‘stump’ your classmates by writing questions that make them think about what the author is trying to tell you.  These questions might start with, ‘Why do you think...’ or ‘When the author says...’.

     Activity/Technology #3 - Pretend you are one of the characters in the story.  Using blabberize or voki, tell the story from your point of view.  Use google docs to plan your 2 minute audio clip.  Use details from the story in your summary, and be sure to include how ‘you’ are feeling in the story.

3.  Quote accurately from a text when explaining what the text says explicitly and when drawing inferences from the text. (RL.5.1)

     Activity/Technology #1 - Work with your group.  Pretend you are  characters in a fictional story of your choice (may be teacher chosen).  Create a dialogue between the characters that refers to the central theme of the story, and create a comic strip using toonlet.com.  Your comic strip needs to quote directly from the text, and must convey the theme through the character dialogue.

     Activity/Technology #2 -  Write a review of the story using your google docs account.  Your job is to convince your classmates why you would or would not recommend this book.  You must use the text directly in your argument, and quote directly from the text.

     Activity/Technology #3 - Work with your partner to create a powtoon or moovly presentation that will challenge your classmates to answer questions about the story.  Use the text to write your questions, and you must quote the text directly when writing your questions. For example, you might start a question by saying ‘On page 45 of the story Charlotte’s Web,  Wilbur refuses to eat...’  Use the 5 W’s and and H to be sure you are hitting all parts of the story in your questions.

4.  Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message, lesson,
or moral and explain how it is conveyed through key details in the text. (RL.3.2)

     Activity/Technology #1 - Read one of the three texts offerings provided by the teacher.  Once you have finished the text create a concept map using mindmeister that at it’s central location discusses the central message/lesson/moral, then support this with key details and ideas from the text.  

     Activity/Technology #2 - To complete this activity you must first have completed the mindmeister activity.  Once your concept map is completed meet with your assigned groups to compare your Maps.  Then create a group concept map using Inspiration that joins your ideas and thoughts into one centralized location.  

     Activity/Technology #3 - Now that you have created your individual concept map and group map it is time to teach the class.  Using animoto create a presentation that tells the class what the lesson of your story was and how you came to this conclusion.  Use your Maps to guide this process. 

5.  Determine a theme of a story, drama, or poem from details in the text; summarize the text. (RL.4.2) 

     Activity/Technology #1 - First access your poem of choice (from pre-approved teacher list) on adobe reader.   First go through and read the poem a few times getting an idea of its rhythm and expression.  Once you have read the text a few times use adobe reader to highlight and take notes on the main ideas.  

     Activity/Technology #2 - Now that you are familiar with your poem share what you think the theme of the text is and why.  To share your thoughts I want you to use voicethread, beyond that it is up to you.  

     Activity/Technology #3 - Once you have completed your voicethread go through and listen to all of your peers.  Once you have completed this pick five threads to comment on.  Get a discussion going, respond to questions and ask them.  This process should be meaningful and reflective.  

6.  Respond to challenges or how the speaker in a poem reflects upon a topic; summarize the text. (RL.5.2)

     Activity/Technology #1 -  Using the same poem you chose for your voicethread activity I want you to reflect on the idea of where the author’s voice came from.  Put yourself in the writer’s chair for a moment and create an idea of what the author’s idea or history behind the poem was, and what their emotions were when writing this poem.  Once you feel like you have a good idea, create an outline using freemind to guide your discussion.  

     Activity/Technology #2 - Using the outline you just created, write a blogpost that goes in depth into the ideas posted in your outline.  

     Activity/Technology #3 - Review 3 of your classmates poems and blogs.  Once you have completed this, choose 1.  After you have chosen a blog, determine whether you agree or disagree with your classmates view.  Create a podcast using podomatic that discusses why.  

7.  Describe characters in a story (e.g., their traits, motivations, or feelings) and explain how their actions contribute to the sequence of events. (RL.3.3)

     Activity/Technology #1 - Choose a fictional story (may be teacher’s choice) and create a video diary of the main character. Using Voki, create your character’s avatar and be sure to included the character’s feelings about events and other characters.

     Activity/Technology #2 - Create a Character Scrapbook for at least two characters from a fictional story (may be teacher’s choice). On one side create a visual image of the characters and on the other side include important character traits.

     Activity/Technology #3 - Create a character map using bubbl for at least two characters from a fictional story (may be teacher’s choice). The following elements must be included: Character’s name; What the character says and does; How the character looks and feels; What others think about the character; Also, include a place to give your feelings about the character.

8.  Describe in depth a character, setting, or event in a story or drama, drawing on specific details in the text (e.g., a   character’s thoughts, words, or actions). (RL.4.3) 

     Activity/Technology #1 - Using a Google Doc, you and a classmate should collaborative create an alternate ending to a story. Be sure to use base your choices on changes to the ending on details from the story and inferences and/or predictions you made as you read.

     Activity/Technology #2 - Create a series of at least 4 comic scenes using Pixton to illustrate the climaxing moment from your story. Be sure to draw details about setting from the text, as well as character’s feelings. Also include direct character quotes from the text.

     Activity/Technology #3 - Create a 3D popup book using ZooBurst to highlight the main character from your book. Be sure to include important character traits, events involving your character, your character’s feelings and relationships with other characters.

9.  Compare and contrast two or more characters, settings, or events in a story or drama, drawing on specific details in the text (e.g., how characters interact). (RL.5.3) 

     Activity/Technology #1 - You and a classmate should collaborate to produce a VoiceThread that both compares and contrasts two characters from your story. One partner should contribute by voicing the comparisons, the other should voice the contrasts.

     Activity/Technology #2 - Compare and Contrast two different versions of the same fairy tale.  You may choose to compare/contrast characters, setting, or events. You do not have to do all three. Create two Blabberize photos to illustrate your comparisons and contrasts. The photos you chose should be relevant to your story.

     Activity/Technology #3 - Use the online Venn Diagram tool from ReadWriteThink to compare and contrast the character, settings, or events from two of the stories we have read in class. You should indicate in your title which element you are comparing/contrasting. When you finish, email your diagram to your teacher.

__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;

One of the basic steps during database development cycles is the fixing of decisions about the table structure. To do so there is the CREATE TABLE statement with which developers define tables together with their columns and constraints.

Because a lot of features may be activated by the command, its syntax is a little bit complex. This page shows the most important parts. The syntax is not straight forward. At some points it is possible to use alternative formulations to express the same purpose, e.g. the Primary Key may be defined within the column definition as a column constraint, at the end of the command as a table constraint or as a separate stand-alone command 'ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT ...;' .

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE &lt;tablename&gt; (
  &lt;column_name&gt; &lt;data_type&gt; &lt;default_value&gt; &lt;identity_specification&gt; &lt;column_constraint&gt;,
  &lt;column_name&gt; &lt;data_type&gt; &lt;default_value&gt;                          &lt;column_constraint&gt;,
  ...,
  &lt;table_constraint&gt;,
  &lt;table_constraint&gt;,
  ...
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== General Description ==
After the introductory key words CREATE TABLE the tablename is specified. Within a pair of parentheses a list of column definitions follows. Each column is defined by its name, data type, an optional default value and optional constraints for this individual column.

After the list of column definitions developers can specifiy table constraints like Primary and Foreign Keys, Unique conditions and general column conditions.

An first example was shown at the page [[../Create a simple Table#Fasten_Decisions|Create a simple Table]] and a second one here:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE test_table (
  -- define columns (name / type / default value / column constraint
  id             DECIMAL                           PRIMARY KEY,
  part_number    CHAR(10)          DEFAULT 'n/a'   NOT NULL,
  part_name      VARCHAR(500),
  state          DECIMAL           DEFAULT -1,
  -- define table constraints (eg: 'n/a' shall correlate with NULL)
  CONSTRAINT test_check CHECK ((part_number  = 'n/a' AND part_name IS     NULL) OR
                               (part_number != 'n/a' AND part_name IS NOT NULL))
);
&lt;/source&gt;

The table consists of 4 columns. All of them have a data type and some a default value. The column ''id'' acts as the Primary Key. The table constraint ''test_check'' garanties that ''part_name'' is mandatory if ''part_number'' is recorded.

== Column Definition ==
=== Data Type ===
The standard defines a lot of predefined data types: character strings of fixed and variable size, character large objects (CLOB), binary strings of fixed and variable size, binary large objects (BLOB), numeric, boolean, datetime, interval, xml. Beyond there are complex types like: ROW, REF(erence), ARRAY, MULTISET and user-definded types (UDT). The predefined data types are explained on the [[../Data Types|next page]]. To keep things simple we use on this page only CHAR, VARCHAR and DECIMAL.

=== Default Value ===
A column can have a default value. Its data type corresponds to the type of the column. It may be a constant value like the number -1 or the string 'n/a', or it is a system variable or a function call to determine dynamic values like the username or the actual timestamp.

The default clause affects those INSERT and MERGE commands, which do not specify the column. In our example database the ''person'' table has the column ''weight'' with the default value 0. If we omit this column in an INSERT command, the DBMS will store the value 0.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- This INSERT command omits the 'weight' column. Therefore the value '0' (which is different from
-- the NULL value) is stored in the weight column.
INSERT INTO person (id, firstname, lastname,    date_of_birth,     place_of_birth, ssn)
VALUES             (11, 'Larry',   'Goldstein', date'1970-11-20', 'Dallas',        '078-05-1120');
COMMIT;

-- This SELECT retrieves the row ...
SELECT * 
FROM   person
WHERE  id = 11
AND    weight = 0;

-- ... but not this one:
SELECT * 
FROM   person
WHERE  id = 11
AND    weight IS NULL;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Identity Specification ===
The ''identity specification'' serves for the generation of a series of unique values which acts as the Primary Key to the tables rows. The standard defines the syntax as: &quot;GENERATED { ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT } AS IDENTITY&quot;. Unfortunatelly most DBMS vendors do not support this formulation. Instead they offer different syntaxes and even different concepts to generate primary key values. Some use a combination of generators/sequences and triggers, others a special data type or different key words.

An overview about the wide spread of implementations is available in the wikibook [[SQL_Dialects_Reference/Data_structure_definition/Auto-increment_column|SQL Dialects Reference: Auto-increment_column]].

=== Column Constraint ===
The column constraint clause specifies conditions which all values must meet. There are different column constraint types:
:NOT NULL
:Primary Key
:Unique
:Foreign Key
:Check values

&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;u&gt;NOT NULL&lt;/u&gt; phrase defines, that it is not allowed to store the NULL value in the column.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- The column col_1 is per definition not allowed to hold the NULL value
CREATE TABLE t1 (col_1 DECIMAL NOT NULL);

-- This INSERT command will fail
INSERT INTO t1(col_1) values(NULL);

-- The same applies to the following UPDATE command
INSERT INTO t1(col_1) values(5);
UPDATE t1 SET col_1 = NULL;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;u&gt;PRIMARY KEY&lt;/u&gt; phrase defines that the column acts as the Primary Key of the table. This implies that the column is not allowed to store a NULL value and that the values of all rows are distinct from each other.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t2 (col_1 DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY);

-- This INSERT will fail because a primary key column is not allowed to store the NULL value.
INSERT INTO t2(col_1) VALUES(NULL);

-- This INSERT works
INSERT INTO t2(col_1) VALUES(5);

-- But the next INSERT will fail, because only one row with the value '5' is allowed.
INSERT INTO t2(col_1) VALUES(5);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;u&gt;UNIQUE&lt;/u&gt; constraint has a similar meaning as the PRIMARY KEY phrase. But there are two slightly differences. 

First, the values of different rows of a UNIQUE column are not allowed to be equal, which is the same as with PK. But they are allowed to hold the NULL value, which is different from PK. The existence of NULL values has an implication. As the term ''null = null'' never evaluates to ''true'' (it evaluates to ''unknown'') there may exist multiple rows with the NULL value in a column which is defined to be UNIQUE.

Second, only one PK definition per table is allowed. In contrast, there may be many UNIQUE constraints (on different columns).
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t3 (col_1 DECIMAL UNIQUE);

-- works well
INSERT INTO t3(col_1) VALUES(5);
-- fails because there is another row with value 5
INSERT INTO t3(col_1) VALUES(5);

-- works well
INSERT INTO t3(col_1) VALUES(null);
-- works also
INSERT INTO t3(col_1) VALUES(null);

-- check the results
SELECT * FROM t3;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;u&gt;FOREIGN KEY&lt;/u&gt; condition defines that the column can hold only those values, which are also stored in a different column of (the same or) another table. This different column has to be UNIQUE or a Primary Key, whereas the values of the foreign key column itself may hold identical values for multiple rows. The consequence is that one cannot create a row with a certain value in this column before there isn't a row with exactly this certain value in the referred table. In our example database we have a ''contact'' table whose column ''person_id'' referes to the id of persons. It makes sense that one cannot store contact values before storing the appropriate person.

Foreign Keys are the technic to realise 1:m relationships.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table with a column which referes to the 'id' column of table 'person'
CREATE TABLE t4 (col_1 DECIMAL REFERENCES person(id));

-- This INSERT works as in table 'person' of our example database there is a row with id = 3.
INSERT INTO t4(col_1) VALUES(3);

-- This statement will fail as in 'person' there is no row with id = 99.
INSERT INTO t4(col_1) VALUES(99);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Column checks&lt;/u&gt; inspect the values of the column whether they meet the defined criterion. Within such column checks only the actual column is visible. If a condition covers two or more colums (eg.: col_1 &gt; col_2) a table check must be used.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- 'col_1' shall contain only values from 1 to 10.
-- A hint to MySQL users: MySQL accepts the syntax of column checks - but it ignores them silently.
CREATE TABLE t5 (col_1 DECIMAL CHECK (col_1 BETWEEN 1 AND 10));

-- This INSERT works:
INSERT INTO t5(col_1) VALUES(3);

-- This statement will fail:
INSERT INTO t5(col_1) VALUES(99);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Table Constraint ==
Table constraints defines rules which are mandatory for the table as a whole. Their sematic and syntax overlaps partially with the previous shown [[../Create_Table_Syntax#Column_Constraint|column constraints]].

Table constraints are defined after the definition of all columns. The syntax starts with the key word CONSTRAINT and includes the possibility to denominate them with a meaningful name, ''t6_pk'', ''t6_uk'' and ''t6_fk'' in the next example. In the case of any exception most DBMS shows this name as part of the error message - and if you havn't defined one it uses its internal naming conventions which may be very cryptic.

=== Primary Key, UNIQUE and Foreign Key ===
In the same manner as shown in the [[../Create_Table#Column_Constraint|column constraints part]] Primary Key, UNIQUE and Foreign Key conditions can be expressed as table constraints. The syntax differs slightly from the column constraint syntax, the semantic is identical.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table with a PK column, one UNIQUE column and a FK column.
CREATE TABLE t6 (
  col_1 DECIMAL,
  col_2 CHAR(10),
  col_3 DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT t6_pk PRIMARY KEY (col_1), -- 't6_pk' is the name of the constraint
  CONSTRAINT t6_uk UNIQUE      (col_2),
  CONSTRAINT t6_fk FOREIGN KEY (col_3) REFERENCES person(id)
);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== NOT NULL and Simple Column Checks ===
In a similar way as shown in the [[../Create_Table#Column_Constraint|column constraints part]] NOT NULL conditions and simple column checks can be expressed as table expressions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t7 (
  col_1 DECIMAL,
  col_2 DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT t7_col_1_nn    CHECK (col_1 IS NOT NULL),
  CONSTRAINT t7_col_2_check CHECK (col_2 BETWEEN 1 and 10)
);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== General Column Checks ===
If a condition affects more than one column it must be expressed as a table constraint.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t8 (
  col_1 DECIMAL,
  col_2 DECIMAL,
  col_3 DECIMAL,
  col_4 DECIMAL,
  -- col_1 can hold only those values which are greater than col_2 
  CONSTRAINT t8_check_1 CHECK (col_1 &gt; col_2),
  -- If col_3 is NULL, col_4 must be NULL also
  CONSTRAINT t8_check_2 CHECK ((col_3 IS     NULL AND col_4 IS     NULL) OR
                               (col_3 IS NOT NULL AND col_4 IS NOT NULL))
);

-- This two INSERTs work as they meet all conditions
INSERT INTO t8 VALUES(1, 0, null, null);
INSERT INTO t8 VALUES(2, 0, 5, 5);

-- Again: MySQL ignores check conditions silently

-- This INSERT fails because col_1 is not greater than col_2
INSERT INTO t8 VALUES(3, 6, null, null);

-- This INSERT fails because col_3 is not null and col_4 is null
INSERT INTO t8 VALUES(4, 0, 5, null);

&lt;/source&gt;

== Column Constraints vs. Table Constraints ==
As you have seen some constraints may be defined as part of the column definition, which is called a ''column constraint'', or as a separate ''table constraint''. Table constraints have two advantages. First, they are a little bit more powerfull.

Second, they do have their own name! This helps to understand system messages. Furthermore it opens the possibility to manage constraints after the table exists and contains data. The ALTER TABLE statement can deactivate, activate or delete constraints. To do so, you have to know their name.

== Clean Up ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
DROP TABLE t1;
DROP TABLE t2;
DROP TABLE t3;
DROP TABLE t4;
DROP TABLE t5;
DROP TABLE t6;
DROP TABLE t7;
DROP TABLE t8;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exercises ==
&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Create a table 'company' with columns 'id' (numeric, primary key), 'name' (strings of variable size up to 200), 'isin' (strings of length 12, not nullable, unique values).&lt;br /&gt;Create a solution with column constraints only and another one with table constraints only.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- column constraints only
CREATE TABLE company_1 (
  id   DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(200),
  isin CHAR(12) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
-- table constraints only
CREATE TABLE company_2 (
  id   DECIMAL,
  name VARCHAR(200),
  isin CHAR(5),
  CONSTRAINT company_2_pk PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT company_2_uk UNIQUE      (isin),
  CONSTRAINT company_2_check_isin CHECK (isin IS NOT NULL)
);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Create a table 'accessory' with columns 'id' (numeric, primary key), 'name' (strings of variable size up to 200, unique), 'hobby_id' (decimal, not nullable, foreing key to column 'id' of table 'hobby').&lt;br /&gt;Create a solution with column constraints only and another one with table constraints only.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- column constraints only
CREATE TABLE accessory_1 (
  id       DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name     VARCHAR(200) UNIQUE,
  hobby_id DECIMAL NOT NULL REFERENCES hobby(id)
);
-- table constraints only
CREATE TABLE accessory_2 (
  id       DECIMAL,
  name     VARCHAR(200),
  hobby_id DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT accessory_2_pk PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT accessory_2_uk UNIQUE      (name),
  CONSTRAINT accessory_2_check_1  CHECK (hobby_id IS NOT NULL),
  CONSTRAINT accessory_2_fk FOREIGN KEY (hobby_id) REFERENCES hobby(id)
);

-- Test some legal and illegal values
INSERT INTO accessory_1 VALUES (1, 'Fishing-rod', 2);
COMMIT;
-- ...

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{BookCat}}In a general sense to empower is  &quot;to give authority or power&quot; but in the development field to empower is &quot;to enable&quot;, &quot;to promote the self-actualization&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;

The World Bank defines empowerment as 
::&quot;''the process of enhancing the capacity of individuals or groups to make choices and to transform those choices into desired actions and outcomes.''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTEMPOWERMENT/0,,contentMDK:20272299~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:486411~isCURL:Y,00.html| title = What is Empowerment? | publisher = World Bank}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In the UN Guidelines on Women's Empowerment empowerment is defined in terms of the faculties achieved once empowered.
::''&quot; Women's empowerment has five components:  women's sense of self-worth; their right to have and to determine choices; their right to have access to opportunities and resources; their right to have the power to control their own lives, both within and outside the home; and their ability to influence the direction of social change to create a more just social and economic order, nationally and internationally.''&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.un.org/popin/unfpa/taskforce/guide/iatfwemp.gdl.htm | title = UN Guidelines on Women's Empowerment | publisher = United Nations}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Empowerment cannot be &quot;given&quot; in the same way that education cannot be delivered and [[Development Cooperation Handbook/The participatory approach|participation]] cannot be bought. It is a process that requires [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication|communication]] and [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Defining Cooperation|cooperation]]  and that it is possible only as far as the counterparts are acting in a reciprocally empowering manner, because they recognize that, in order to fully realize themselves, they need the self realization of the others. &lt;br /&gt;

It is possible to act in a reciprocally empowering modality only if there is [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Communication Skills/Building a Climate of Trust|reciprocal trust]] and all counterparts believe that they would benefit much more acting in a [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication/The relational content of communication/the social games|positive sum game]] modality rather then in conflictual manner.  Persons, communities and institutions act in reciprocally empowering manner when they believe that their authority is reinforced  by the authority of the others. A typical form of institutional empowerment is the practice of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Definitions/Subsidiarity|subsidiarity]]. &lt;br /&gt;

Like [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication|communication]] produces new knowledge that none of the communicators had beforehand, so &quot;empowerment&quot;  is a process that establishes a new authority in the partners of the process of empowerment. Through successful [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Cooperation and Communication|communication]] and [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Defining Cooperation|cooperation]] the partners actualize a new potentiality of their being, a dimension of themselves that they could not realize in mutual isolation. Their respective potentialities are in fact actualized by understanding where there is equality and where there is difference amongst them. By valuing these differences in a spirit of equal dignity, they act , reciprocally and simultaneously,  as the &quot;empowerer&quot; and the &quot;empowered&quot;.

&lt;br /&gt;

'''Group Reflection:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Our group found the TPACK process pretty smooth. As a group we selected social studies as we wanted a subject that would easily lend itself to incorporating technology. One of the group members suggested doing something a long the lines of inventors and how they changed society. We felt that this fit well with the Iowa Core Standards for social studies. Once we had our idea of inventors and how they changed society we read through the standards for 6-8 social studies and selected the ones that we thought may fit with this idea.  We listed the ones we felt may fit and starting selecting our activities. We used the Taxonomies to help us come up with 10 different activities that we felt would fit into social studies lessons. Once we had 10 activities selected we allowed each member to select the ones they felt they wanted to work on. Each member created their lesson based on those activities and posted it back to the original Google Doc. We used Google Docs and Gmail/Chat as our main means of communicating during this process. Our philosophy was that we could accomplish more if we divided and conquered. We did set a few meeting times to collaborate as a team and discuss difficulties or clarifications.&lt;br /&gt;</text>

'''Chair Yoga is a simple path of yoga practice. It is suitable for beginners. With Chair Yoga, you can quickly relax at home or at work and recharge with good energy.'''  

[[w:Chair Yoga|Wikipedia:]] ''Chair yoga is the term generally used to describe a gentle form of yoga that is practiced sitting in a chair, or standing using a chair for support. It is not recognized formally as a type of yoga distinct from other types, such as Iyengar Yoga or Ashtanga yoga. However the poses, or Asanas, are often adaptations of Hatha yoga poses. Chair yoga has helped people with the symptoms of many health issues including: hypertension (high blood pressure), anxiety, chronic fatigue syndrome, arthritis, vertigo (medical), multiple sclerosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, clinical depression, and chronic pain.
Chair Yoga is one of the gentlest forms of yoga available.''

== Tips ==
*Yoga can be easy. Beginners need simple yoga exercises. The presented exercises involve two levels. First, they are a simple gymnastics, well suited for quick relaxation and for stress relief. Second, they activate all the major chakras and help people to get good energy.
*Chair Yoga is a new development in yoga. Chair Yoga can be done in the office or in a simple way in front of the computer. Most people do not need difficult and complicated exercises, but yoga techniques that are easy to practice and can be made in a short time. The most important thing for most people is to do every day something for their health. This series of exercises is very helpful for this.
*Do yoga as it is good for you. If you cannot do something, don't do it.  Many people exercise wrong. They practice yoga only formally (as an external form) without inner feeling. They do not resolve tensions. It is important that we practice effective and with endurance.

== Stress at Work ==
[[File:Team work.jpg|thumb|400px]]
Too much stress is one of the main problems of today's professional life. Who is constantly under great stress harms the long run his health and his inner happiness. He becomes mentally negative, weak and often plagued the rest of his life from various diseases. Those who do not learn clever to deal with stress consume quickly their life energy.

The root cause of job stress lies in our current economic system. It creates profit for a small number of people and the majority of the world population suffers from  increasing poverty and destitution. It produces on the one hand a lot of unemployment and on the other side many working people having an extreme pressure in their job. In the long term we need to make the inner happiness to the center of a new economic world order. The economy must be organized so that it provides everyone with sufficient food and labor, that the health of the working people is protected, that there is no destruction of the environment, and that the inner happiness grows. Not the profit (the money), but the love must be the engine of world economy. In the short term we will have to live with the unwisdom of the ruling politicians. The more important it is that all people care good for themselves and secondly, that we work as powerful as possible for a better world.

Every working person has to do enough exercises every day for his body and his soul. With a lot of stress at work for everyone a daily health and relaxation program is absolutely necessary. The law of life is relentless. Who does not care for his body has not very long something from it. A well maintained car lasts twice as long as a badly treated car. A human body can live 20 to 30 years longer if he is properly fed, sufficiently relaxed and moved well. Who wants to live healthy, must first take a clear decision. Only this gives him the self-discipline for a healthy life. He must clearly define his health goals and create a strong will to do the necessary things. Just then man has the strength to live a long healthy and positive life.

Second, one must look closely at his life situation. One has to recognize what his body and his mind exactly needs. One must consider how to organize his life so that long-term he maintains his health and increases his happiness. One must create a clear daily schedule of sport, relaxation and a healthy diet.

Third, you have to implement your health care plan at least two months every day consistently. Then your mind gets used to it. The daily health practices are then part of your life.

Incorporate the necessary health exercises creativity in your life. At least you should go for a walk on the weekend for an hour. You can meditate on the train or during breaks at work. You can use any contact with your fellow human beings to practice love and full of positive thinking. The big secret for more energy while working is to sensitively put many small breaks in the workday. Anyone who takes a break five minutes every hour, doubles his work force.

Chronic stress we must avoid. If we cannot work long term in our profession relaxed enough, we are not suited for the job. Then we have to change something in our life. We should always think long term. Our job should feed us, and he should contribute to the happiness of all beings. He should not destroy us in our health and inner well-being. If our work over calls us, we must reorganize something, work less, or if necessary, change our profession.

The most important thing in life is to live in the essence. The essence of life is health and happiness. We should take good care of us. Who cares good for himself, sometimes must say &quot;no&quot;. He must say &quot;no&quot; to self-defeating thoughts and self-injurious behavior. We alone are responsible for our life. We should organize our lifes so that we at the end are happy with us. Not our job is the center of our life, but the spirituality. If you look at things this way, you can live much more relaxed. You can work relaxed. And you can let go your profession, if it needs to be. You set the priorities in your life right. Those who live by the right goals, know when and how they have to act.

==The Ten Points of Happiness==
[[File:Face-smile.svg|thumb|300px|Smile and be happy.]]

The most important results of today’s [[w:Happiness economics|happiness research]] can be summed up in ten points.

1. '''A Proactive Life is a Happy One'''

Happy people have positive goals and positive tasks. Proactive people are 15% more satisfied with their lives than more passive people. Happiness researcher Ed Diener explains, “happy people set goals for themselves again and again.” 

2. '''An Active Life is a Happy One'''

Regular physical activity keeps the body healthy and makes the spirit happy. Daily walks raise the level of happiness 12%. David Niven says, “people who stay fit via sports are healthier, more positive, and more successful.”

3. '''Doing Good for the World is a Source of Happiness'''

Those who regularly do good things for others are 24% happier than those who only live for themselves. John A. Schindler wrote, “live as a giving person. Those who give are happier than those who only take. Those who give to others discover the beauty in the world.” 

4. '''Rest and Relaxation Bring Happiness'''

The central point of a healthy and happy life is to find the balance between rest and activity. Besides, work, physical activity, and time spent with others, we need time to rest and relax. We need to get enough sleep. Scientific research shows that relaxed people think more positively and are happier. Every hour of sleep missed lowers the positivity one can experience during the day. 

Where that point of balance between rest and activity lies, must be decided for oneself. Everyone needs to experiment a little to find this correct balance. We have to figure out who much sleep we need and how much relaxation time we need and at what speed we function at our best. We in the western world of „go, go, go“ who wish to stay happy and healthy, must also live extra clever. We need to organize our lives in an intelligent way to facilitate inner happiness and find one’s personal way to inner balance. 

5. '''Positive Thinking'''

Those who think positively double their chance to realize happiness. Those who wish to be happy should think positively. The positive characteristics of wisdom, love, peace, inner power and joy in life should be set as the central point of one’s life. One should exercise a conscious decision to be positive. Fo example, we can ask ourselves, “ how can I go through the day in a positive way?”

6. '''Too Much Television Makes You Unhappy'''

Scientific research states, „ every hour of television lowers the general quality of life by 5%“. TV orients people around superficial things, and the concept of superficial happiness. It raises desire, increases aggression, and creates sorros. Those who would like to grow in terms of happiness, should stop watching TV. (David Niven: Die 100 Geheimnisse glücklicher Menschen. München 2000, Seite 32 f.)

The way to positive TV viewing consists of : a) choose your programs carefully. Avoid negative films. B) Find the correct amount of TV. Children should watch a maximum of one hour per day of television. C) After watching TV, one should practice some form of spiritual exercise (such as yoga, meditation, walking, reading, contemplating the meaning of life). 
 
7. '''Foster Friendship'''

Build on your positive circle of friends. Women who talk to others reduce their worries by 55%. Cancer stricken women who met with a group once a week raised their survival chances to twice as high as those who didn’t meet with a group. In the western world, there is a strong tendency towards isolation. There are many single and lonely people. People who have a good circle of friends are happier and not isolated. We should take care of our friendships and practice positive activities with them. 
 
8. '''Facilitate Joy'''
 
Those who can find little elements of joy in their lives can raise their overall happiness by 20%. Nils once felt bad and in order to raise his spirits, he ate a lot of sweets. His spirit brightened more and more. Then he visualized the sweets in his stomach and awakened his kundalini energy. He awakened a strong energy which quickly brought him back into the light. Nils learned to thus connect outer enjoyment with spiritual exercises. One then needs less sweets. Just a bit of outer enjoyment is enough for inner happiness. 

9. '''Humor''' 

Those with a good sense of humor raise their positivity by 33%. We should foster our sense of humor and learn to not take things so seriously. We should learn to laugh at our selves. Those who are able to do so, can live lighter and brighter. It is good to see cheerful films, read funny books, and to visit joyful people. 

10. '''Self-Confidence'''

Happy people believe in themselves. They believe in their goals, their wisdom, and their power. They see themselves as winners. They know they will prevail in the long term. In a world of doubt, all followers of the way of bliss need inner strength in order to go about their way successfully. The followers of inner happiness need a clear anchor in terms of wisdom, self-discipline, and self-confidence to avoid being brought back by materialism and doubt.

== The Path of Inner Happiness ==

'''Basically, the path of inner happiness consists of health practices and of mental work.''' Health exercises are sports (walking, jogging, biking - if necessary on the exercise bike), yoga and meditation. Add to this a healthy diet. Mental work means to avoid negative thoughts and to encourage positive thoughts. Negative thoughts lead to internal tensions, the destruction of the health and to bad social relationships. They are often associated with feelings such as fear, anger and addiction. 

'''Positive thoughts create positive feelings and a constructive external behavior. Positive thoughts we get by self-reflection, positive intentions and reading in positive books.''' Importante is a constant attention to the inner thoughts, feelings and positive life principles (love, peace, truth, strength, happiness). Recommendable are the philosophy of happiness (Epicurus), Buddhism, Christianity and Yoga. '''The positive psychology found many good ways to live a happy life.''' It is important that we are always in touch with ourselves, our inner truth and love. A spiritual teaching gives us an orientation. For proper application in our concrete situation we are responsible for ourselves. What is good for us? What brings us forward on the path of happiness? What is usefull to build up a happy world?

'''The easiest way of spiritual centering is the daily reading in a spiritual book. We can also read something positive in the internet. We must not read much. A small text, a meditation a day is enough to keep us on the path to lasting happiness. For many people a daily oracle card is helpful to get a positive outlook on life.''' For this we need each day just a minute. That time has everyone. The gain is long term immeasurable. 

Think about your daily happiness practice. '''How can you integrate [[The Five Principles of Health]] into your life? What is your main way of spiritual centering (Yoga, Buddhism, Christianity, Philosophy, Positive Psychology)? Which spiritual role-model inspires you and gives you energy for a positive life (Buddha, Jesus, Epicurus)?''' What exercises do you want to practice regularly?

=== Second Declension ===
Second declension nouns and adjectives end in -ο, and their declination follows the pattern
given below. To decline a second-declension noun, we take the ending in the table and add it to the 
stem (which always ends in -ο). If a vowel is underlined, then we replace the ο in the stem with that vowel.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || ς || ι
|-
| Genitive || υ || &lt;u&gt;ω&lt;/u&gt;ν
|-
| Dative || &lt;u&gt;ῳ&lt;/u&gt; || ις
|-
| Accusative || ν || υσ
|-
| Vocative || &lt;u&gt;ε&lt;/u&gt; || ι
|}

When we give a noun, we typically give the singular nominative form of the noun, as well as the ending
for the singular genitive case.

Example:
Here is the declension chart for the noun κύριος, -υ, which means &quot;lord&quot;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || κύριος || κύριοι
|-
| Genitive || κύριου || κύριων
|-
| Dative || κύριῳ || κύριοις
|-
| Accusative || κύριον || κύριους
|-
| Vocative || κύριε || κύριοι
|}

Here is the declension chart for second declension neuter nouns:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || ν || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;
|-
| Genitive || υ || &lt;u&gt;ω&lt;/u&gt;ν
|-
| Dative || &lt;u&gt;ῳ&lt;/u&gt; || ις
|-
| Accusative || ν || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;
|-
| Vocative || ν || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;
|}

Example:
Here is the declension chart for the noun τέκνον, -υ, which means &quot;child&quot;.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || τέκνον || τέκνα
|-
| Genitive || τέκνου || τέκνων
|-
| Dative || τέκνῳ || τέκνοι
|-
| Accusative || τέκνον || τέκνα
|-
| Vocative || τέκνον || τέκνα
|}

Most second declension nouns are either masculine or neuter, although there are feminine second declension nouns as well.

===First Declension===

First declension nouns end with α or η, and are typically feminine (although there are masculine ones as well).
They fall under two slightly different patterns that differ only in the singular genitive and dative. 

'''Pattern 1''' (at *, we add an ι-improper diaphtong to the vowel: α -&gt; ᾳ, η -&gt; ῃ)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || - || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ι
|-
| Genitive || ς || &lt;u&gt;ω&lt;/u&gt;ν
|-
| Dative || * || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ις
|-
| Accusative || ν || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ς
|-
| Vocative || - || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ι
|}

Example: καρδία, -ας (Heart)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || καρδία || καρδίαι
|-
| Genitive || καρδίας || καρδίων
|-
| Dative || καρδίᾳ || καρδίαις
|-
| Accusative || καρδίαν || καρδίας
|-
| Vocative || καρδία || καρδία
|}

Example: φωνή, -ής (Voice)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || φωνή || φωναί
|-
| Genitive || φωνήσ || φωνών
|-
| Dative || φωνῄ || φωναίς
|-
| Accusative || φωνήν || φωνάς
|-
| Vocative || φωνή || φωνά
|}

'''Pattern 2''': Virtually identical, except we change α to η in the singular genitive and dative cases.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || - || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ι
|-
| Genitive || &lt;u&gt;η&lt;/u&gt;ς || &lt;u&gt;ω&lt;/u&gt;ν
|-
| Dative || &lt;u&gt;ῃ&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ις
|-
| Accusative || ν || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ς
|-
| Vocative || - || &lt;u&gt;α&lt;/u&gt;ι
|}

Example: δόξα, -ης (Glory)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || δόξα || δόξαι
|-
| Genitive || δόξης || δόξων
|-
| Dative || δόξῃ || δόξαις
|-
| Accusative || δόξαν || δόξας
|-
| Vocative || δόξα || δόξα
|}


===Grand patterns===
# The genitive plural of all declensions in Greek (all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verb participles, basically anything that can decline) end in ων.
# The accusative and nominative of all neuter declensions in Greek are the same.
# In all declensions, the dative case contains an ι, perhaps as an improper diaphtong.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nouns in Greek are declined (have ending changes) based on ''case'', ''number'' (singular or plural), and ''gender'' (masculine, feminine, neuter).

The ''case'' of a noun indicates the function of the noun in the sentence. There are five different cases:
# The '''nominative''' case marks the subject of a phrase as well as the predicate nominative (i.e., the object of a linking verb (or copulative verb), such as to be). Examples: In the sentence &quot;The dog bit the man&quot;, dog would be in the nominative case. Also, in the sentence &quot;The man is a soldier&quot;, both &quot;man&quot; and &quot;soldier&quot; are in the nominative case.
# The '''genitive''' case denotes source or origin (this function is also called the ablative), or kind or possession. It is also often used for an object of a preposition. It is frequently translated as &quot;of ...&quot;. Examples: In the phrase &quot;The man's wife&quot;, or equivalently, &quot;the wife of the man&quot;, man would be in the genitive case.
# The '''dative''' case denotes an indirect object (translated as &quot;to ...&quot; or &quot;for ...&quot;); means or agency, especially impersonal means (translated as &quot;by ...&quot;); or a location. It is also frequently used as an object of a preposition, and often, a preposition can take a noun in either the genitive or dative case with different meanings. Examples: In the sentence &quot;I spoke to John&quot;, John would be in the dative case. Also, in the sentence &quot;By grace, you have been saved&quot;, grace would be in the dative case.
# The '''accusative''' case denotes a direct object. Example: In the sentence, &quot;I saw the cat&quot;, cat would be in the accusative case.

In Greek, nouns fall under three different patterns for case endings, called declensions.
The first declension contains nouns whose stems end in α or η. They are mostly feminine nouns.
The second declension contains nouns whose stems end in ο. They are mostly masculine or neuter.
The third declension contains all other nouns (mostly, nouns whose stems end in a consonant). There are 
broad patterns in third declension endings, but much more special cases than for first and second declension nouns.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Watchdog Timer ==

In an embedded environment, far away from the lab, and far away from the programmers, engineers, and technicians, all sorts of things can go wrong, and the embedded system needs to be able to fix itself. Remember, once you close the box, and shrink-wrap your product, it's hard to get back in there and fix your mistakes.

In a typical computer systems, cosmic rays flip a bit of RAM about once a month{{fact}}.
If that happens to the wrong bit, the program can &quot;hang&quot;, stuck in a short infinite loop.

Turning the power off then on again gets it unstuck.
But how do you jiggle the power switch when you are on Earth and your embedded system is near Neptune?
Or you are in Paris, and your embedded system is in Antarctica?

One of the most important tools of an embedded systems engineer is the '''Watch-Dog Timer''' (WDT). A WDT is a timer with a very long fuse (several seconds, usually).

The WDT counts down toward zero(*), like the big red numbers counting down on the bombs in the movies.
Left to itself, eventually the counter will reach zero.
When the counter reaches zero, the WDT resets the microcontroller (as if the power were turned off, then turned back on).

When the system is running normally, you don't want it to randomly reset itself, so you need to make sure that your program always &quot;feeds the watch-dog&quot; long before time runs out.
Good practice is to reset the WDT less than halfway-through its countdown.
For instance, if the WDT has a timer of 20 seconds, then you will want to feed the WDT at least once every 10 seconds.

Unlike when our hero deals with bombs in the movies, feeding the watch-dog doesn't stop the countdown.
When the code uses a &quot;reset&quot; or &quot;clear&quot; command to feed the watchdog, it merely sets the WDT back to some large number -- and then the watchdog timer immediately starts counting down from there.

If the programmer fails to feed the watchdog in time -- or if the program hangs for any reason -- then sooner or later WDT will time out, and the program will reset, hopefully getting your system unstuck.

Some &quot;multi-stage&quot; watchdogs have a first stage that interrupts the CPU.
The corresponding interrupt handler logs debug information about the current state information (crash dump) and attempts a &quot;soft&quot; recovery.
If some fault causes the soft recovery to timeout, the the final stage of the watchdog will reset the entire system.

&lt;/ref&gt;

(*) Some watchdogs count up. With this kind of watchdog, &quot;feeding the watchdog&quot; resets it to zero. If it ever reaches some high limit, it resets the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Timber for woodworking can be bought either 'dressed' (when it has already been sawn or 'broken down' to the desired width and thickness, and planed smooth) or 'rough' (when it is in the same state as when it left the sawmill, and either green or seasoned). It is quicker to begin woodworking projects with the former, but the latter is cheaper.

This chapter deals with the processes of taking rough, seasoned timber and sawing it to the required dimensions (width and thickness only), and then planing it smooth enough to begin the main woodworking tasks (cutting joints etc.).

== Breaking down ==

Purchasing timber in its rough-sawn state can be more confusing for a beginner, because the nature of the grain and quality of the wood can be somewhat concealed.

[TBA]

== Dressing ==

The next stage is to dress the ripped pieces. This is done with a [[../Scrub planes|scrub plane]].

:''Die Bourgeoisie kann nicht existieren, ohne die Produktionsinstrumente, also die Produktionsverhältnisse, also sämtliche gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse fortwährend zu revolutionieren. Unveränderte Beibehaltung der alten Produktionsweise war dagegen die erste Existenzbedingung aller früheren industriellen Klassen. Die fortwährende Umwälzung der Produktion, die ununterbrochene Erschütterung aller gesellschaftlichen Zustände, die ewige Unsicherheit und Bewegung zeichnet die Bourgeoisepoche vor allen früheren aus. Alle festen eingerosteten Verhältnisse mit ihrem Gefolge von altehrwürdigen Vorstellungen und Anschauungen werden aufgelöst, alle neugebildeten veralten, ehe sie verknöchern können. Alles Ständische und Stehende verdampft, alles Heilige wird entweiht, und die Menschen sind endlich gezwungen, ihre Lebensstellung, ihre gegenseitigen Beziehungen mit nüchternen Augen anzusehen.''&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:::The bourgeoisie cannot exist without continually revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, by contrast, the first condition of existence for all previous industrial classes. Perpetual revolution in production, ceaseless disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeoise epoch from all that have come before. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable beliefs and opinions, are dissolved; all new-formed ones grow obsolete before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is sacred is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his position in life and his relations with his kind.

:What did it mean to be a slave? It is hard to imagine it today. We think of oppression beyond all conception: cruelty, degradation, whipping and starvation, the absolute negation of human rights; or on the contrary, we may think of the ordinary worker the world over today, slaving ten, twelve, or fourteen hours a day, with not enough to eat, compelled by his physical necessities to do this and not to do that, curtailed in his movements and his possibilities; and we say, here, too, is a slave called a &quot;free worker,&quot; and slavery is merely a matter of name. 

:But there was in 1863 a real meaning to slavery different from that we may apply to the laborer today. It was in part psychological, the enforced personal feeling of inferiority, the calling of another Master; the standing with hat in hand. It was the helplessness. It was the defenselessness of family life. It was the submergence below the arbitrary will of any sort of individual. It was without doubt worse in these vital respects than that which exists today in Europe or America....

:The slavery of Negroes in the South was not usually a deliberately cruel and oppressive system. It did not mean systematic starvation or murder. On the other hand, it is just as difficult to conceive as quite true the idyllic picture of a patriarchal state with cultured and humane masters under whom slaves were as children, guided and trained in work and play, given even such mental training as was for their good, and for the well-being of the surrounding world. 

:The victims of Southern slavery were often happy; had usually adequate food for their health, and shelter sufficient for a mild climate. The Southerners could say with some justification that when the mass of their field hands were compared with the worst class of laborers in the slums of New York and Philadelphia, and the factory towns of New England, the black slaves were as well off and in some particulars better off. Slaves lived largely in the country where health conditions were better; they worked in the open air, and their hours were about the current hours for peasants throughout Europe. They received no formal education, and neither did the Irish peasant, the English factory-laborer, nor the German Bauer; and in contrast with these free white laborers, the Negroes were protected by a certain primitive sort of old-age pension, job insurance, and sickness insurance; that is, they must be supported in some fashion, when they were too old to work; they must have attention in sickness, for they represented invested capital; and they could never be among the unemployed. 

:On the other hand, it is just as true that Negro slaves in America represented the worst and lowest conditions among modern laborers....  They represented in a very real sense the ultimate degradation of man. Indeed, the system was so reactionary, so utterly inconsistent with modern progress, that we simply cannot grasp it today. No matter how degraded the factory hand, he is not real estate. The tragedy of the black slave's position was precisely this; his absolute subjection to the individual will of an owner and to &quot;the cruelty and injustice which are the invariable consequences of the exercise of irresponsible power, especially where authority must be sometimes delegated by the planter to agents of inferior education and coarser feelings.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. DuBois here quotes Charles Lyell, [http://books.google.com/books?id=cMTmD5ubYQkC&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;ots=vDoI5SdXDY&amp;dq=%22the%20cruelty%20and%20injustice%20which%20are%20the%20invariable%20consequences%20of%20the%20exercise%20of%20irresponsible%20power%22&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20cruelty%20and%20injustice%20which%20are%20the%20invariable%20consequences%20of%20the%20exercise%20of%20irresponsible%20power%22&amp;f=false Travels in North America, in the years 1841-2: with geological observations on the United States, Canada, and Nova Scotia] (New York: Wiley &amp; Putnam 1845), Vol. I, p. 145:

::''If due exertions be made to cultivate the minds, and protect the rights and privileges of the negroes, and it nevertheless be found that they cannot contend, when free, with white competitors, but are superseded by them, still the cause of humanity will have gained. The coloured people, though their numbers remain stationary, or even diminish, may in the mean time be happier than now, and attain to a higher moral rank. They would, moreover, escape the cruelty and injustice which are the invariable consequences of the exercise of irresponsible power, especially where authority must be sometimes delegated by the planter to agents of inferior education and coarser feelings.''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A schizophrenic man who is undiagnosed begins to blog, and begins to remember the first voices he ever heard and what they said. A furious story unwinds from his mind and takes him, and us, to strange places.

The author sends us on a journey into his mind. Started from events he knows to be true and continuing on to things that no one has ever thought of before. He follows religions as far as he can go. Writes to new religions that don't yet exist. Crosses space and time, twice. Takes our souls and turns them into answers. All through science fiction.

As a writer I was first noticed in Elementary School when a poem I had written about driving to my grandmothers house won a contest. Again in High School my English teacher expressed interest in my writing. Again in College my Literary Class Professor noted my ability to write. Once full of material and in my late twenties I exploded into the book The Crayola: Tome if Infinite Will.

The book was converted to Adobe PDF years ago and the original was lost.

Feel free to use my dropbox download. But for whatever reason Wikibooks blocks dropbox. So I'll have to get back to you. Feel free to ask for it.

Thanks!</text>

Hi, I am Goldenburg111. I may pop here out of nowhere from time to time because I am a SWMT member, who patrols small wikis, like en.wikibooks, for vandalism or spam. As you can see, I currently have reviewer rights to help me in counter vandalism here, and I am also part of the Counter Vandalism unit here at en.wikibooks. I look forward to also creating wikitext books here, and have done so. I am the creator of [[Wikijunior:Extinct Birds]], I am usually contributing to Wikijunior Books.

&lt;center&gt;Userpages: [[wikiquote:User:Goldenburg111|My Wikiquote]], [[meta:User:Goldenburg111|my Meta]] and [[wikiversity:User:Goldenburg111|my Wikiversity]].&lt;br&gt; 

'''These are the wikis I am usually active in counter-vandalism and content work.'''&lt;/center&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">When we look at the world, it appears to be a seamless whole. This makes it difficult to understand, and sometimes even difficult to believe, that our visual perceptual experience is created through a series of smaller perceptions of simpler things. But that's how it happens. 

Vision is turning light into something useful. In our retinas we have photosensitive neurons. They increase their firing rate when photons (particles of light) hit them.  At a first approximation, you can think of the first layer of neurons as a bunch of pixels, encoding some color at some location. But this is just the first layer. After that, they start to detect higher level patterns. 

One of the first discoveries was that there were certain neurons that detected lines at particular angles. That is, there would be a neuron that would increase its firing rate in the presence of line at, say, 90 degrees, but not at other angles. As a shorthand, we'll say that the neuron &quot;detects&quot; lines at 90 degrees. David Hubel and Torsten Weisel discovered this in 1958, studying the dog's visual system. They were exposing the dogs to images, and recording the activity of single cells in the visual pathway from the eye to the brain. The images weren't doing much, but when they moved the slides sometimes the neuron would go crazy. It finally dawned on them that the neuron was responding to the edge of the slide, not the picture in it! This is one of many stories in science of accidental discovery (Martinez-Conde &amp; Macknik, 2014). 

So what happens? Does the neuron increase firing only in the presence of lines at ''exactly'' 90 degrees? No. If the line is slightly off 90 degrees, the neuron will increase its firing rate to a lesser extent. The closer the line is to 90 degrees, the higher the firing rate. There are neurons for detecting angles of all orientations: some for 180 degrees, some for 30 degrees, etc. Each one has a particular &quot;receptive field.&quot; With the information from all of these neurons firing, an cognitive system can tell with some good degree of accuracy the orientation of a line. Hubel and Weisel found that the further &quot;upstream&quot; you go, away from the retina and toward the rest of the brain, the more complex are the detections. That is, lines are fairly simple, but those lines are used by higher neurons to detect even more complex patterns.

Black has a clear advantage. White will attempt to mate the black king with a series of checks, but with proper play black will come out ahead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">='''Preamble'''=



This is the opening page to the Digital Media and Culture Yearbook 2014.

As the title suggests, this is a book which seeks to record contributions to the understanding of a specific set of topics, loosely grouped under the title &quot;Digital Media and Culture&quot;, of particular salience to 2014. 

It is put together through the combined talents and efforts of a cohort of students taking the FMS9A4 module during the Spring of 2014. The aim is, firstly, for students to record the content of their learning and their contributions to this book will reflect their studies on one of the featured themes. However, secondly and most importantly, the hope is that students will learn the values associated with working at different levels as individual researchers, as research teams, and as research communities. That is to say: producing knowledge; collaboration and sharing; and peer-reviewing the work of others for the good of the community. Students will thus gain hands-on experience of a wiki environment, within the auspices of one of Wikimendia's large projects (i.e. Wikibooks) and make something that adds to currents in the academic field of digital media.

This wikibook is being put together as an on-going a collaborative project by the following wikipedian contributors. Together, they form a cohort of students studying Digital Media and Culture as part of their degree programme in the Division of Communications, Media and Culture, The University of Stirling, Scotland, UK. Doubtless, there are other contributors within the Wikibooks and Wikipedia community who have contributed advice, support, suggestions and content in collaboration with these students. Your help and advice is most appreciated. Thank you!

:: &lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;| inhibit=34565}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* Such pages need to be listed and linked in the Table of Contents of the [[Trainz references]] Volume.
* Place in the top of a Trainz Wikibook reference page&amp;mdash;NOT IN How-to or Project organization pages but appendices and list pages of some sort. See {{TL|Trainz templates}} for other Trainz project templates easing editing chores.

=Putting it all Together:  A Dragon!=
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}}

I downloaded Blender without knowing much about how to use it, probably like you.  I hunted around for a good tutorial and found this one.  It is teaching me wonderful things!  I have diligently followed every lesson from the beginning, as I hope you have.  Every lesson seems to contain some valuable technique.  So now it is time to put it all together into a single project.

Hopefully, you now know
*  How to add objects, move and rotate them, scale them in various dimensions, and change their shape.
*  How to use proportional editing to change them even more.
*  How to parent, join and separate objects.
*  How to use materials and textures.
*  How to use images in materials.
*  How to use basic lights.
*  How to use modifiers including subsurf and array.
*  Basic use of curves
*  It will help if you know how to use a photo editor such as GIMP to produce seamless textures

This project will build on all that background. Since all those things have been covered before, this will not be a key-by-key tutorial but rather a description of the general steps to take to make the finished scene. 
__TOC__
==Modeling from the Image==

[[File:Komodo Dragon (2007).jpg|thumb|300 px|left|Komodo Dragon]]
[[File:Dragon 003.png|thumb|300px|right|Using cubes to model the dragon]]
[[File:Dragon 008.png|thumb|200 px|left|The basic body smoothed.]]
It happens that the Komodo Dragon is one of my favorite creatures.  Let us start with that and let our imagination run wild.  In the lesson on '''[[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Modeling_a_Fox_from_Guide_Images|Modeling a Fox from Guide Images]]'''  we learned how to make a beautiful 3 dimensional wolf from an image.  (Yes, I know.  The fox turned into a wolf.  If you did that lesson you understand.)   Here is a nice picture of a Komodo Dragon by wallygrom from [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Creative Commons] with a proper license.   We can then set that picture as a background image and apply the technique of starting with a cube and scaling it, extruding it, scaling again and so on.  We only have one view, so our imagination and application of other pictures has to help with the top and end views, and we have to add a nice long tail.  As you build your cubes keep in mind that you will have to create faces and extrude the legs so place a well sized face at the proper spot.

We will use the techniques we learned to split faces and add the legs.  Be sure to provide a nice mouth to put teeth in later, and pay particular attention to modeling the claws. I modeled one entire foot and then duplicated it three times to have them all, and joined each one to the body at the appropriate spot.

Once you have outlined the dragon with the cubes, remember what we learned in '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Detailing Your Simple Person 1|Smoothing Your Simple Person]]''' and apply subsurf modifier and smooth the entire thing.  You can then push and pull on vertices to help make it look as good as possible.  I wanted to try to maintain the look of an ordinary creature and stay close to my Komodo Dragon, rather than a huge fierce beast to take on St. George.




==Setting the Body Materials and Textures==

Use what we learned in '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Image Textures|Image Textures]]''' to give the dragon his scales.  The most used technique in this tutorial is:
*  Search [http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/by-sa-2.0/ Flicker  Creative Commons] for a properly licensed picture that has a good material in it.  If you use Google or some other search, be sure that the picture you get is properly licensed if you plan to share the image.
*  If your image is NOT a single seamless texture, use photo editing software (such as GIMP) to produce a usable seamless file. 
**  Load the image into GIMP. Crop it to a reasonable size showing a relatively uniform texture.
**  Choose ''Filters &gt; Map &gt; Make Seamless''.  Other photo editors will usually have a similar operation.
**  Save the image with a suitable file name.
*  Add a material and a texture using the image.  Adjust the settings as needed to look good.
*  If you are following my steps, I have put all the textures in this article for you to copy if you wish.  Click on the thumbnail image and go to the Wiki page from which you can download.

[[File:Flickr 2.0 lic Komodo Dragon SKIN.png|left|thumb|266 px|Fantasy Dragon Skin seamless texture]]You can just select a rectangular swatch of skin from the picture and use GIMP to make it seamless.  But Komodo Dragons are a depressing color.  For a fantasy creature we need a brighter skin!  So you can play with GIMP Colorizer until you have a suitably colored swatch.  I used red and gold, but use your imagination!  This becomes the first material and texture for the dragon's body.  It will probably be necessary to repeat the image several times in both the X and Y directions.  I used X:6 and Y:2 in this particular case.






==Adding the Eyes==
[[image:Dragon 009.png|thumb|300 px|left|The first rendering.]]The dragon needs suitably scary eyes.  Hopefully you have already modeled eyes for the '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Procedural Eyeball|Procedural Eyeball]]''' tutorial. I chose the cat's eye.  In '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Simple Vehicle: Some Assembly Required|Some Assembly Required]]''' we learned how to append a file.  Append the Cat's Eye, and then work on the color textures until you have a suitably scary dragon eye.  Then duplicate it and put one eye on each side of the dragon's head.  I joined the eyes to the body, but you can also just parent them if you are careful.  You will notice in later renderings that I kept playing with the eye color and position.






==A Dragon Needs Teeth and Claws==
[[image:Dragon 025.png|thumb|300 px|left|Assigning texture to the claws]][[image:Dragon 026.png|thumb|100 px|right|Four rows of Teeth]]
Using the technique from '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Multiple Materials Per Object|Multiple Materials per Object]]''' , isolate the claws and give them a nice shiny black material.  Too much Specularity will make the claws look like plastic, too little will make them dull and uninteresting.  I added just a little bit of Mirror also.  It will be something to experiment with until you get the look you like. Click on the picture to enlarge it and see the setting I settled on.  Remember that you have to select the area of the mesh and ASSIGN it to the material or you will wind up with a dragon that is black all over!  (That is the voice of sad experience speaking).

A dragon needs teeth.  A lot of teeth!  Modeling all those teeth would be a big job.  Fortunately we learned how to use array modifiers in '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Building a House|Building a House]]'''.   Add a cone, scale it down very small, and extrude some more parts so you can shape it into a nice curve.  When you have a beautifully sharp tooth, add the Array modifier and make it into a whole row of sharp teeth.  Then duplicate the whole thing three times, rotate it around as needed, and you will have four rows of teeth, enough for both jaws. This is why we left the mouth open when we made the original model.  

==Horns, a Crest, and Nostrils==

[[image: Dragon 013.png|thumb|left|300 px|Using the Curve Modifier]][[image: Dragon 015.png|thumb|right|200 px|The color settings for the horns]][[image:  Dragon 029.png|thumb|left|100 px|Nostrils]]Lets give the beast some horns.  Here we can use what we learned in '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Deforming Meshes using the Curve Modifier|Deforming Meshes using the Curve Modifier]]''' to make some gracefully curved horns.  Just as in that lesson, add a cone and extrude segments to give a lot of vertices.  Then create your Bezier Curve and set it as a modifier to the horn mesh.  Properly done your horn will mold itself to the shape of the curve.  Duplicate it and rotate it to fit the other side of the head and put them in place.

Animal horns are some of the most beautiful structures in nature.  We should make a particularly pretty material for them.  We can use the blending colorband as in the tutorial '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Basic Carpet Texture|Basic Carpet Texture]]''', updating it a bit for 2.69, to give the horns a nice color appearance. Then add '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Subsurface scattering|Subsurface Scattering]]''' as taught in that tutorial, with a lot of experimenting, until you get a really beautiful appearance.  The settings I used are in the picture but it is fun to try different things.  

An impressive crest should dominate the dragon's back.  I found a picture of a basilisk lizard and used it as a background model for the crest. The Crest texture was produced in GIMP exactly the same way as the dragon skin texture.

Reptile nostrils are sort of nondescript, so lets make some nice nostrils like a snorting bull might have.  You can use the technique from '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Spin a goblet|Spin a goblet]]''' to model one nostril, then duplicate it, rotate the pair until they look fierce, and give them a nice color like the dark red brown I picked.  Then put them in place and parent them to the body. 





Now you can render your dragon and see the basic body shape, but something is missing.  What is it?[[Image:  Dragon 016.png.jpg|thumb|center|400 px|Teeth, Claws, Crest and Horns]]

==Giving the Dragon Wings==

[[Image:  Dragon 027.png|thumb|left|200 px|An attempt at wings.]]

The wings were the hardest part, because we have not had many tutorials in this series that dealt with the problems involved.  I started with a cylinder object and went from there, joining other cylinders to it, and then selecting edges and using{{B3D:N2P/Do|FKEY}} to create faces.  There may be other better ways to do it.  I wanted the wing sail parts to be semi transparent and give an appearance of shimmering colors.  Experimenting with the transparency and the materials as seen in the screenshot gave me some I liked pretty well.  I am not completely satisfied with it but perhaps it is the best that can be done with the tools we have so far learned.  Joining the wings to the body seemed to produce some distortions so I just parented both of them to the body object.

Now there is just one more thing that a perfect dragon needs.








==FIRE!==
[[image: Dragon 023.png|thumb|right|300 px|Settings for flames]][[File:Flickr 2.0 lic flames.png|thumb|left|273 px|Seamless flame material]][[image: Dragon 017.png|thumb|left|100 px|Scaling the cylinders]]
[[image: Dragon 017a.png|thumb|left|100 px|Distorting the cylinders]]
Everybody knows that dragons breathe fire.  It seems that there are many different ways to do flames in Blender. However, I am attempting to use methods covered so far in this tutorial series, so I wanted to experiment and see what could be done with just what we have learned.  I came up with something reasonably close to flame breath using basic techniques.  I started with a series of cylinder objects, scaled at one end until they are almost cones, and then stacking them inside each other.  I used the proportional editing that we learned about in '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Mountains Out Of Molehills|Mountains Out Of Molehills]]''' to pull and stretch into some more or less random shapes.  I found the flame picture and turned it into a seamless material swatch.  Then I wrapped it around my cones and began playing with the settings for transparency, and added an Emit setting just to see how it looked.  (If you want to jump ahead refer to [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Making Fire|Making Fire]] in the next section of this series.)















==Ground to Stand on==

[[image: Lava seamless texture.png|thumb|left|273 px|seamless lava texture]][[image:  Seamless grass.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|seamless grass texture]]Now it is time to complete the scene by giving him something to stand on.  Since his front feet are raised, put in a sort of lava flow for him.  That seems appropriate for a dragon.  Try Adding a series of cubes. Stack them up and pull them out of shape with proportional editing. Add a subsurf modifier, and then the set the lava rock as an image texture. Again I made a seamless material out of a photo. 

Then create a plane and again use the proportional editor to make some nice hills.  A seamless green grass texture repeated multiple times completed the ground.  



==Lighting==

[[Image:Dragon 031.png|thumb|left|100 px|The No Shadow setting]]So far the lighting has just been the default point light.  I think it is a bit more dramatic to use the Sun style of lamp.  As we learned in '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Light a Silver Goblet|Light a Silver Goblet]]''' go to ''Add&gt;Lamp&gt;Sun'' and place a sun type lamp rather high in the sky.  You will notice that now you get two overlapping shadows, one from the Sun and one from the default point lamp. You could just delete the point lamp, but, to advance beyond what has already been covered, it is useful as fill lighting. You can select the point lamp, go to the properties panel and click on the light icon[[File:Blender-2.5 lamp radio button.png]].  Scroll down to Shadow and click No Shadow and the point light becomes a fill light.  Setting the horizon color in the world panel [[File:Blender268TextureIconWorld.png]] is the last step to produce this scene.

















=THE FINAL RESULT=

[[image:Dragon 028.jpg|thumb|center|700 px|The Final Result]]

I think it nicely combines pretty much all I have learned about Blender so far in the tutorial! If you want to try your hand at a project, it is not as hard as you might think.  You and I have really learned a lot by going through the first two sections of''' Blender 3D:Noob to Pro'''.  I thank all the authors who have worked hard to bring us to this point.

I challenge you to show off what you can do with your newly acquired knowledge and put your finished work up here.  It will probably be a lot better than mine.

      <comment>Some brief notes.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Side note|side=right|{{Java Swings/Content}}}}
This chapter explains how to separate Swing applications into a more maintainable triad of components: the domain model, the view of the user interface, and the controller that oversees these. A minimal class structure is shown below.

[[File:Java Swings Wikibook, MVC class diagram.svg|center|600px]]

The main application class is the controller: it creates a model object (which is Observable), and a view object (which is an Observer of the model). The controller adds the view as an observer of the model.

When the model changes, it calls &lt;code&gt;setChanged()&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;notifyObservers()&lt;/code&gt;. This means that the model can react to user input.

The controller doesn't touch the view (apart from instantiating it and giving it the model).

The view has access to the model, including to change it.</text>

== About the Me and the Book == 

I am the Director of the Texas Conference Adventurer Ministry. The Adventurer Club is my passion. Since I can remember I have been involved with the clubs in one way or another. I was introduced to the Adventurer Club when my oldest daughter was of adventurer's age, and just felt in love with the adventurers, and the adventurer's activities. I had so much trouble finding information and appropriate activities for Adventurers that I started collecting information. Years later, I felt the necessity to share this information with our staff in the Texas Conference. This book is the result of years of searching and collecting information. Please feel free to add more information or links to make this a great book to share with all of our Adventurers Friends.

The author says &quot;MOS are symmetrical devices, so we could replace the drain with the source without affecting the behavior of the device.&quot; but this is an over generalization.  Many discrete mosfets have a body source-drain diode.  They are definitely not symetrical.

      <text xml:space="preserve">LCR stands for Load Compliment Register. The use of this instruction results in loading of the value in two's complement format from the second operand register into the first. Basically, the value (number) loaded is the opposite sign of what was in the second operand register. That is, a negative 3, for example. will be made positive when loaded into the first operand register; and again for example, a positive 3, will become negative 3 when loaded into the first operand register.</text>

[[Category:Trainz typing-aid templates|{{PAGENAME}}]]
[[Category:Self-documenting templates|{{PAGENAME}}]]
&lt;div style={{TRS-style}}&gt;
;usage
This template forms an internal link to the [[Trainz]] wikibook with parameter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and incorporates an option to access a sub-sub-page given the optional 3rd default parameter: &lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as well allowing for as an optional pretty-link re-title parameter &lt;code&gt;'2' allowing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} and/or '|3=sub-page/' &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; formatted link calls ... all forming the link and all links in the wikimarkup as:&lt;br/&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/AM&amp;C/{{{3|}}}{{{1}}} | {{{2|{{{1}}}}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/code&gt;
* Users unfamiliar with wiki-markup parameter parsing, just focus on &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} or '|2=text' &lt;/nowiki&gt; overriding the presented text of the link, 
* and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}/  or '|3=sub-sub-linktext/' &lt;/nowiki&gt; giving a prefix to a sub-sub-page, so the subject page is:
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/AM&amp;C/{{{3}}}/{{{1}}} | {{{2}}}]], pipe-linked as {{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: if and when given, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}/&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;u&gt;MUST HAVE&lt;/u&gt; a trailing '/' to form a proper link.
&amp;nbsp;
'''&lt;u&gt;Example-1, expanded paste down&lt;/u&gt;:'''
:This is because all template default parameters, formally 'numbered parameters' can also be specified like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL
 |1=Tips And Tricks
 |2=Tips
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 which wiki-markup language is processed exactly
 the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL |Tips And Tricks |Tips }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
;caution
When using a template such as this which forms a link, it is best to NOT use spaces between the pipe characters &quot;|&quot; as done for clarity above.
{{TrainzTip|Spaces in the 'pretty-text' part are fine!
}}
'''&lt;u&gt;In-line Examples&lt;/u&gt;:'''
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL|Tips And Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; links as: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the other formulation: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; both would.
:But... is much easier to edit around on a page when trying to get the best prose presentation.

* Similarly: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL|Tips And Tricks|Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; links as if the constructs: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is perhaps part of the phrase you want.

* Sub-subpage links will mainly be needed in the forthcoming Errorfixing series of tutorials and the Programmed Instruction (Trainz A-Z) linked progressive tutorials off their own sub-TOC base page. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:Planned use of Sub-sub-pages... '''Better than splitting the book down the multiple tracks'''... we're going to make ''a lot of new pages'' in the PI tutorials! Whether for beginners or intermediate Trainzers, they'll all end in content creation and other advanced topics like TransDEM map generation anyway.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

{{recipe}}

== Ingredients ==
* 1/2 loaf dry bread
* 750 ml tomato paste
* 1-2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves, crushed and finely chopped, more if you like it
* Oil
* handful of well ripped [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] leaves
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], to taste

== Procedure ==
# Soak the bread in water for a short time, so that you can crush it with your hands. It should not be soaked. Fry the garlic in a large frying pan with oil until it begins to change color.
#Add the tomato puree and salt and cook over medium heat until it gets to a boil.
#Add pieces of bread in, none smaller than a walnut, after wringing and continue to mix it with the tomato, until it has become completely red.
#At this point the tomato should still have a fresh aroma.
#Remove from heat and serve hot in a bowl, seasoned with a drizzle of olive oil, pepper and a basil leaf.

== Scarcity ==
Economics as a discipline would not exist without scarcity.

This is the fundamental problem that all societies face. It refers to the escess of human wants over what can actually be produced to fulfill these wants. Human wants are unlimited. On the other hand, the means of fulfilling these human wants are limited becacuse the resources available are limited. As a result, choices have to be made.

For example, society cannot enjoy all the books and all tables if wants because the number of trees required to produce these goods is limited. It somehow has to decide how many books and how many tables it wants to produce. If mroe tables are produced then fewer books will be enjoyed and vice versa. We define as the opportunity cost of a choice, the value of the enxt best alternative sacrificed . If, for example, by giving (or more correctly, &quot;allocating&quot;) a tree to table produciton, one extra table is produced but 25 books need to be sacrificed, we say that the opportunity cost of producing one more table is 25 books.

=== Resources (factors of production) ===
Resources are also referred to as factors of production. They includje all inputs used in the production of a good or service. They are typically separated into the following categories.
==== Land and raw materials (natural resources) ====
These are inputs into produciton that are provided by nature, for example agricultural and non-agricultural land, forests, pastures, mineral deposits, oil, natural gas, lakes, and rivers. The world's land area and raw materials are limited. SOme resources, such as oil and coal deposits, are non-renrewable: if they are used now, they will not be available in the future. Other resources, for example forests (timber) and the stock of fish, are renrewable.

==== Labour (human resources) ====
Labour includejs all forms of human inputi, both physical and mental, into current production. The labour force is, at any point in time, limited both in number and in skills. The total number of people avilable for work is referred to as the labour force or working population.

==== Capital ====
Physical capital includejs manufactured resources; in other words, goods used to produce other goods. The world has a limited stock of capital (limited supply of factories, machines, tools, and other equipment). Note that the meainng of capital in economics is different from that used in ordeinary speech where people refer to money as capital.

==== Entrepreneurship ====
Entrepreneurship is related but not identical to management. When a new venture is being considered, risks exist. They involve the unknwon future. Someone must assess these risk and make judgements about whether or not to undertake them. The people who do so are called entrepreneurs. Entrpreneurship refers to the willingness and ability of certain individuals to take risks and to mobilise the remaining factors of production.

=== Related concepts ===
In addition to the ide,a of physical capital already mentioned, it is usef to includej natural capital and human capital.
==== Natural capital ====
Natural capital can be thought of as natural resources which may be improved upon or may be depleted. Thinking in terms of natural capital can easily accommodate another related concewpt, sustainability, which refers to the idea of preserving and even inccreasing or improving upon the avilable stock of natural resources.

==== Human capital ====
Labour may also be improved upon, in that the labour force may become mroe productive. The term human capital refers to the education, training and skills embodied in the labour force of a country. Even if the size of the labour force of an economy is constant over time, the stock of human capital may increase.

=== Other useful introductory terms ===
==== Social sciences ====
Disciplines that symentically study human behaviour form different perspectives. Economics, pyschology, anthropoligy, political science, sociology, and history we all considered social sciences.

==== Models ====
==== Normative economic statements ====
==== Positive economic statements ====
==== Economic goods ====
==== Free goods ====
==== Competitive market ====
==== Ceteris paribus ====
==== Rationality ====

'''Status: This class project is in its initial stage.'''

This book is the result of the course 'Introduction to Programming with Unity', taught in the [http://www.th-nuernberg.de/ohm/mediaengineering/ media engineering] program at Technische Hochschule Nuremberg.  It  is a [[Wikibooks:List_of_class_projects|class project]], hopefully turning into a real wikibook at some later point in time.

= Preface =
This book/class is supposed to give a hands-on experience related to programming with the Unity Game Engine.  Different aspects will be looked at.  Most likely this book will be outdated as soon as it is finished, but for a little while it may serve as an entrance to the world of game programming.

The idea behind this class project came from a colleague who suggested that most class projects produce really nice results, but usually disappear in some instructors' drawers.  After reading on the possibility of using Wikibooks for class projects, we just had to give it a try.  


== Getting Started ==
If you are new to Wikibooks, you might first want to look at [[Using Wikibooks]].  Details for creating a class project can be found at [[Using_Wikibooks/Class_Project_Guidelines|Class_Project_Guidelines]].  If you are completely new to Wikipedia, the [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial Wikipedia tutorial] maybe helpful to you.  If you like to upload images to wikipedia, use the 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard File Upload Wizard].  However, only upload images if you created them and you own the copyright!


== Other Wikibooks ==
There are also other wikibooks on subjects related that are quite useful:
*[[Game_Creation_with_XNA]]
*[[Cg_Programming]]
*[[C_Sharp_Programming]]


== Other Class Projects ==
Inspiration from successful class projects can be drawn here, which by themselves are also quite interesting and maybe helpful for this project:
*[[Basic Writing]]
*[[Handbook for Doctoral Students in Education]]


== Experience from the First Iteration ==
No experience yet.

= Introduction =
This class will be a tour of the Unity Game Engine.  It will cover many topics, mostly just touching the surface.  But there will be plenty of opportunity to dig deeper and learn more by doing. 

This class is an introduction into the Unity Game Engine. Before we can get started creating games, we need to install the necessary software and get our environment set up.

== Overview ==
There are two reasons for this class:
* create cool 3D and 2D games
* learn how to use the Unity Game Engine

For me the second aspect is actually the more important one.  .
 
=== Subchapter ===
If you want a subchapter, this is how it is done...

 
== Installation ==
How to install Unity, supported platforms, etc...
 
 
== Links ==
If you find a cool tutorial or a neat link, post it here for now:

Example of a www link: (http://www.ethority.de/weblog/social-media-prisma/)

 
== How to do referencing? == 
An example usage of a reference is 
:&quot;The Social Web is a set of social relations that link people through the World Wide Web.&quot; 
&lt;ref name=&quot;SocialWeb&quot;&gt;Social web, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_web&lt;/ref&gt;

It has to be distinguished from what is called the Web 2.0 &lt;ref name=&quot;Web20&quot;&gt;Web 2.0, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0&lt;/ref&gt;, a phrase termed by Tim O’Reilly &lt;ref name=&quot;OReilly&quot;&gt;Tim O’Reilly (2005-09-30). &quot;What Is Web 2.0&quot;. O’Reilly Network&lt;/ref&gt;.  Whereas Web 2.0 is about technology, the social web is about people. 

So for instance, the map of the Internet, maps machines: 

[[File:Internet_map_1024.jpg|200px|Machines]]

Whereas, a maps of friends on Facebook (a social network) maps people: 

[[File:Kencf0618FacebookNetwork.jpg|200px|People]]

= Audio and Sound =
Every game needs audio and sounds. Good sound is a crucial part in a successful game.  For this you need to learn to create sound and audio. Also finding free sounds is an important topic.  Some of that information  can be found in the wikibook &lt;ref name=&quot;Game_Creation_with_XNA&quot;&gt;Game Creation with XNA, https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Game_Creation_with_XNA&lt;/ref&gt;.

This is an auto-categorizing template with no other purpose than to save user typing and memory efforts to add a page in up to four Trainz categories. It's primary use is to  list the tagged sub-sub-page into a maintenance category. 
&lt;br&gt;
This template should be used to categorize all sub-sub-Pages of the Trainz wikis; In some contexts (Trainz references for example) it will be conditionally automatically included.
* To suppress the auto-category define the 'inhibit' parameter. 

: It is used by adding the template '''&lt;code&gt;{{tlx|TRS-SubSubPg|[[m:pipetrick|sorting-pipetrick]]}}&lt;/code&gt;''' &lt;br/&gt;to auto-categorize pages to '''&lt;code&gt;[[:category:Trainz Sub-Sub-pages]]&lt;/code&gt;''' adding it alphanumerically sorted (by the pipetrick) to the list of sub-sub-pages located from other such declarations.

: This schema is an administrative aid to making sure pages don't go orphaned, but creates a navigable list sectioned by page titles for the users to navigate.

* Parameters 1, 2, or 3 may be given and will &lt;code&gt;auto:prefix&lt;/code&gt; the word &lt;/code&gt;category: and colon&lt;/code&gt; to auto-form up to three other category links, letting one cut and paste line define up to four categories.

My name's Greg, I live in Stirling (Scotland, UK) where I seem to spend a lot of my time sitting in front of screens jabbing at an array of plastic buttons. When not jabbing, I occasionally field the odd enquiry from clients, colleagues and general ne'er-do-wells. I enjoy my job, my family and my weekends.
 
I encourage students to post messages on my talk page.--[[User:GregXenon01|GregXenon01]] ([[User talk:GregXenon01|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GregXenon01|contribs]]) 15:28, 12 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the discussion/talk page for the Digital Media and Culture Yearbook 2014 [[User:GregXenon01|GregXenon01]] ([[User talk:GregXenon01|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GregXenon01|contribs]]) 16:55, 12 March 2014 (UTC)

== Numbers in the page names? ==

Somehow, I doubt the necessity of explicitly numbering the subpages.  What’s the reason of naming the page [[{{SUBJECTPAGENAME}}/Chapter 1: Technological Determinism|Chapter 1: Technological Determinism]] when it could be named simply ''Technological Determinism''?

In general, a wikibook is intended to be updated over the years, and at times, it may become necessary to shuffle the chapters.  Naturally, when the page is named ''Example'', the link to it could be moved around the “Contents” freely.  However, when the pages are named ''Chapter 3: Rat that ate the malt, Chapter 4: Cat that chased the rat,'' etc., inserting a new “Chapter 3” means that all the chapters down the line ''are to be renamed'' (old “Chapter 3” to “Chapter 4”, old “Chapter 4” to “Chapter 5”, and so on.)

Even if it’s not an issue for this particular wikibook, I’d rather stick to this particular convention, just in case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{status|00%}}{{DISPLAYTITLE:The Java Programming Language}}
{{IB/Group_4/Computer_Science/Object-Oriented_Programming_Languages}}
Java is an object-oriented language with some imperative features. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

== Anatomy of a Java program ==
There are two basic parts to a Java program: (1) instructions to the Java compiler and (2) instructions that describe the processing to be done. However, before we can describe these instructions, we must describe how Java names things; that is, how Java defines identifiers. An identifier is made up of letters, numbers, underscores, and dollar signs, but must begin with a letter or an underscore. Beware: Java is case sensitive. This means that &lt;code&gt;Value&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VALUE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;vaLue&lt;/code&gt; are four seperate identifiers. In fact, we can construct 32 distinct identifiers from these five letters by vary the capitalisation.

Java programmers use certain conventions to provide visual cues about what an identifier is naming. The language does not require that these conventions be followed, but good programming practice dictates that we should. It is far easier for programmers to understand each other's code when we all follow the same naming conventions. Class identifiers begin with an uppercase letter, object and action (method) identifiers begin with a lowercase letter, and constant identifiers are all uppercase.

=== Program structure ===
Let's examine the following Java program. As we go through this program, the the syntax and semantics of the statements will be pointed out.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
// Program Rhyme prints out a nursery rhyme
public class Rhyme
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		final char SEMI_COLON	= ';';
		final String VERB1	= &quot;went up &quot;;
		final String VERB2	= &quot;down came &quot;;
		final String VERB3	= &quot;washed &quot;;
		final String VERB4	= &quot;out came &quot;;
		final String VERB5	= &quot;dried up &quot;;

		String firstLine;
		String secondLine;
		String thirdLine;
		String fourthLine;

		firstLine		= &quot;The itsy bitsy spider &quot; + VERB1 + &quot;the water spout&quot;;
		secondLine		= VERB2 + &quot;the rain and &quot; + VERB3 + &quot;the spider out&quot;;
		thirdLine		= VERB4 + &quot;the sun and &quot; + VERB5 + &quot;all the rain&quot;;
		fourthLine		= &quot;and the itsy bitsy spider &quot; + VERB1 + &quot;the spout again&quot;;

		System.out.println(firstLine + SEMI_COLON);
		System.out.println(secondLine + SEMI_COLON);
		System.out.println(thirdLine + SEMI_COLON);
		System.out.println();
		System.out.println(fourthLine + &quot;.&quot;);
	}
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Line 1 begins with a double slash (&lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;) and is ignored by the translation system because it is a comment. Comments begin with &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; and extend to the end of the line. Another way of entering comments into the program is to insert them between &lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*/&lt;/code&gt;. Comments that begin with &lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*/&lt;/code&gt; can extend across any number of lines.

Line 2 names the program or application class. In Java programs are called applications or application classes. Many Java systems require that the file name in which the application is stored be the same as the class name with an extension attached. Line 3 is the beginning brace that encloses the class.

Java calls subprograms ''methods''. Every Java application must have a method named &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;. Its heading must look exactly like line 4. For now, do not worry about the details of that line, just copy it exactly when you write programs. Line 5 contains only one character: the left brace (&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;). Like C++, Java uses this character to begin a block and the right brace (&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;) on line 28 to close the block. The ''body of the method'' contains the statements that are translated by the compiler and executed when the program is run.

Line 6 through 11 instruct the compiler to assign the ''named constant'' on the left of the equal sign a place in memory and to store the value on the right of the equal sign in that place. In Java, a named constant is made up of the reserved word &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; followed by a data type identifier or a class. In this case &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the value to be stored in the constant is one alphanumeric character. &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the value to be stored in the constant is a string of characters. The data type identifier or class name is followed by the name to be given to the constant. An equal sign and the value to be stored there follow the constant name. In line 6, a semicolon is stored in constant &lt;code&gt;SEMI_COLON&lt;/code&gt;. In line 7, the string made up of characters '&lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;', '&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;', '&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;', '&lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;', '&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;' (space), '&lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;', '&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;', and '&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;' (space) is stored in &lt;code&gt;VERB1&lt;/code&gt;. Line 8 through 11 define for more String constants. By convention, most programmers use all uppercase for constant identifiers.

Output of the application Rhyme:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;
The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout;
down came the rain and washed the spider out;
out came the sun and dried up all the rain;

and the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Error: Could not load texture==

Sometimes a committed asset will report a missing texture file with a file path referenced in the cache, the cab (database {{TG|J|*.JA file}}) resulting in no texture file in the ''open-for-edit asset folder''. This particular example suggests there are three possible fixes for this particular missing texture, so I'm going to cover them in order from the most difficult (cursorary mention) to possibly the easiest.

== Replace the missing texture by making one==
{{TrainzTip|
: ''It is likely this example is after some early processing using PEV tools on the date of installation. I recollect that but also reason because most TRS2006 assets will not contain texture.txt files if they haven't been massaged to comply with later data standards. This evolution in data types and configurations is the cause of many errors, and we the user community demanding more and better graphics from Trainz are at fault in that!
}}
The first one way this asset might be repaired is to create an appropriate {{TG|T|*.tga (texture file)}} as is referenced in a {{Tref}}.texture.txt Trainz {{TG|I|INI file}}, which are listed in directory folders when opened for edit as {{Tref}}.texture.txt files. This option can range from the trivial (create 'black.tga', often for a shadow texture, a handle, step, or under body) to the very difficult (the texture is the multi-view wrap texture that creates the detailed surface appearance of an 3D asset, meaning it's the most complicated part of any set of textures. In the easy or simple case, one makes a small image file in Microsoft Paint, GIMP, or other such graphics drawing program using a power of two squared size such as 8x8px, 16x16px, 32x32px or the like, keeping in mind Trainz will complain if a texture is monotone, to create a solid color, use the 32x32px size and change a few pixels inside to give it a little imperfection texturing, as if it showed dirt or rust, etc. For a solid black handle, try a dark grey/charcoal for a few pixels 'deliberate imperfection'. Creating a more complicated texture is beyond 'Intermediate Trainz' so the best thing to figure out is when to put things on hold and look into the asset creation pages and consult those with experience before tackling such.

But there is often another recourse, stealing the author's own texture from the author. 
[[File:Trainz error fixes (Error= Could not load texture ') kuid 523 23233 XING 2 US boom-01.png|thumb|center|800px|TRS2006-SP1 content manager and Notepad++ editor showing (Left) both the errors list and asset line, (right) The key portion of the modified confix.txt file with it's new description block, (2nd error, already repaired)]]
Asset creators are human beings and like the rest of us take the shortest way to doing multiple tasks given two or three choices. In the case of the two road crossing assets ('Xing' often in Trainz) here with issues, they are part of a set downloaded not from the DLS (leaving Auran and N3V off the hook, at least from the point of view of not sourcing corrupted data) but sourced from a famous Trainzer community, TrainzProRoutes.com, with an equally good reputation. They were, as might be deduced looking at the install times, ''part of a kit or set of assets bundled together'' in one {{TG|Z|*.zip}} or {{TG|C|*.cdp) file as a group configured (type+region+kind+era+category-region) with the same look and feel, so naturally they tend to share textures. These I have because they were used in a number of period routes set in the early 20th century gotten from the DLS recently authored (sic) by gfisher, again a famed route builder&amp;mdash;which is why they were recommended to me to study and steal from for my projects in the same sort of mileau. Of the four, the entity with the worst reputation is N3V/Auran! 
 
# Step one in reading this error message was to examine a similar asset by the same author. The explicit file was found in 'XING_2_US_315', &lt;kuid:523:23235&gt; which assuming they are a direct copy, makes the fix a matter of opening both for edit, then copying the missing file into the sub-folder where the ini file

==About Category-region codes==
{{Parent|{{TR|R|TBS}}|{{TR|R|config.txt files|p=config}}}}
'''Category-region codes''' are a single (&quot;UK&quot;) or multiple codes (&quot;AU;DE;UK;US&quot;) in a quoted string that is included in the {{TL|config.txt file}} for user defined filters.
* Assets with narrow single country scope would contain a single code after the tagname. 
* Assets which were widely found in many regions (e.g. ''''Caterpillar D7 bulldozer'''', will list the series of country codes of the region.)
** The codes have only a minor importance in Trainz and are primarily used in Trainz as a sort and selection criteria in user defined filters.
** Some {{TR|K|p=Kind specifications}} will generate an error if the tag is undefined
** These codes do show up under the region column in {{TA|Content Manager}} where they can be included in defining filters one can also use in {{TL|Surveyor}}. This eliminates looking at undesired assets when focuses on developing your routes. 
* For content that exists in multiple areas, when creating new assets, select appropriate codes in {{TA|Content Creator Plus}} (CCP) or hand edit them into the config.txt ini files.
; For example: a locomotive that was available in the United States and Canada would be specified as follows:

 category-region &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &quot;US;CA&quot;
: One that was available in Australia, Canada, the United States and in the United Kingdom would be specified as follows:

 category-region &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &quot;AU;CA;UK;US&quot;

==Tables of codes==
&lt;big&gt;'''The category-region codes below are in alphabetical order by sort criteria.

Legal codes that are recognized by Trainz are as follows:'''&lt;/big&gt;

===by region code order===

= Game 1: Vegan Island =

A castaway on a lonely Island needs to survive til he will be found from Search and Rescue Partys. There are no animals on that Island, so he needs to gather Food, create a campfire, build a shelter and create Tools to hold out until he is found.

== Coding and Design Tipps ==

* Terrain &lt;br&gt;
There is an option to create a massive amount of trees through out the whole terrain, there are some problems coming with it. The tree prefab collision only works with Sphere, Box or Cube collision. When you use Mesh collisions it will not work with the mass trees. That is a bug known.
&lt;br&gt;
* Random GameObject Placement &lt;br&gt;
Easy way to place a random amount of GameObject on the Terrain is to use a invisible object (Cube). That object will then be moved random around the map and with the function &quot;Terrain.activeTerrain.SampleHeight(transform.position);&quot; its possible to get the height of the terrain. Then you just Instantiate the new object on the position of the invisible object with the height you got with the function mentioned above.

= Game 2: Cube Wars =
Cubes vs spheres, its a cruel world out there.
* Game-Idea:
The general idea was to create a towerdefense-like game in which the enemies follow predefined paths from the spawnpoint to the players base. To defend its base the player needs to build towers along the path. The towers have an AI which allows them to automatically aim the first enemy in their range and attack it. By killing an enemy the player earns money which he can invest in new towers. The enemies appear in waves and over time the enemies are getting stronger and the waves larger. The game has no real end, u just have to reach a new highscore.
* Design:
Because of time issues, we decided to build the world only out of geomatric primitives. To create visual difference between enemies and the players models we created the world in a round look and mainly toon-colored in black and white with just some little colorpriorities. The enemies are all colored in blue and have angular geometry. To support the clean look we relinquished the use of any textures and complex lightsimulation.
* Game-Mechanics:
To create the enemypath we used the free asset iTween from the unity assetsstore which is a very simple pathanimationtool. To calculate if an enemy is inside the range of a tower we used some vector3-mathmatics that says which enemy should get attacked. Then the tower creates a new bullet instance to which he adds the current targetobject. Now the bullet follows the enemy until it gets out of towerrange or hits its target. In both cases the bullet gets destroyed and if applicable the enemy receives damage. If the enemies lives reaches zero the enemy dies and the loot gets added to players account.
If an enemy reaches the playerbase it gets destroyed and the player loses one life. If the lifenumber is zero a gameoverscreen appears and you have to restart.
To build a new tower the player needs to enter the buildmode in which the towerbubble that is most centered in screen gets selected(highlighted). By pressing the right button one of the two implemented towers gets build but only if the player has enough money.
The player also can remove the tower in the same way. The towers as well as the enemies differ for example by speed, damage, lives, costs ,loot ... .

= Game 3 : Loui Roui 's Xtreme Curling Championship Simulator 2K14 =
As part of the elective subject &quot; Xbox programming &quot; was the based on the XNA Xtreme simulator game &quot; Loui Roui 's Xtreme Curling Championship Simulator 2K14 &quot; which can be controlled using the QWERTY keyboard as well as with the Xbox controller.

== The idea for the game ==
The basic idea was based on programming a realistic simulation of a curling competition. Intended to increase the fun factor will be deposited with different sounds the game , which should underline the mood.
Furthermore, it was important for us to use a realistic physics. These calculations have been worked out in advance to the collision behavior of two curling stones around this to use in later steps. Both speed and impact angle were being key factors.

To further enhance the game we already agreed we start to incorporate multiple camera angles on the curling field.

[ [File: Ideenfindung.png | thumb | ideas using a mind map ] ]

== Programming ==
As a programming platform, we opt for the XNA Framework 3.1. The required 3D model are modeled in Blender 2.69 , and then incorporated in . Fbx format in the XNA Framework . Since all team members work at different places in the code , the code was using organized by GitHub . The Git Extension program enabled the versioning of the different program versions and organizes the assembly of code changes .

Right at the beginning , a 3D model of a curling stone was created in Blender which is an important part of the game later . Already on the second day of the first week course could progress to the governance of the stone as well as the integration of 3D elements can be achieved.

As the week has been continuously working on the scope of the game and on the actual gameplay . The current program version includes the following features :


=== Realistic behavior of the stone : ===
In order to obtain a realistic behavior of the stone had different criteria are taken into account :

* Speed ​​loss of curling stone
* Collision detection
* Physically correct propagation of two stones in collision
* Power transmission / transfer speed to hit stone

=== Control ===
The stone can be influenced before throwing in three different parameters. Operation is possible both a QWERTY keyboard as well as the Xbox gamepad.

*'' ' Throw - strength ''' , which is controlled using a Powerbar . This may , at the right moment to stop using the spacebar or the &quot;A&quot; button on the Xbox controller . The stone is then cast at this speed.
*'' ' Orientation ''' , the direction in which the stone will be thrown . The direction is controlled by an arrow which may vary by 40 degrees.
*'' ' Stone - position ''' , at the beginning of the match. This can be changed using the Control Pad to right and left .


=== 3D Models ===
To make the game environment act as possible plastically various three-dimensional elements were installed. The following elements were modeled in Blender:
* Curling rock
* ice
* Guidance Arrow
* Curling Arena


=== Gaming experience : ===
In order to improve the game experience for both graphical , acoustic and physical elements was installed .

The player is represented by two home screens welcomes the game studio , so our development team , and the game imagine . On the second , the two said the player has the option either to start the game as well as look up the controller operation.

During the game, the match is accompanied by different sounds depending on the situation . Furthermore, the Xbox gamepad vibrate when a collision between two curling stones.

==== Generating . Fbx files with Blender ====

===== What's .fbx =====
The format . Fbx is actually a format of Autodesk, 3D objects can be saved with the . It is also the format that XNA uses to implentieren to 3D Models . They are stored in binary or ASCII data. In the second case, the objects can be edited in retrospect, even by text editor. Textures are not stored in . Fbx files and must always accompany with the model.

===== How do I create .fbx ======
The create of . Fbx files with Blender is (in itself ) is quite simple. It creates a 3D model and exports it via '' ' File&gt; Export &gt; Autodesk FBX ( . Fbx ) &quot; '' . It is true but some things to consider :

====== Modeling ======
One should note the Modeling as few polygons to produce , since this can lead to performance problems later. Also, one must note that each face has a normal . For example, if one of a cube Deletes an area , the insides are not shown, since this does not offer means normal. Now you can either manually add subsequently normal or passed by &quot; Solidify Modifer &quot; the faces of a certain thickness. This has a second advantage : do you recognize faces from the side , otherwise they sometimes are too narrow and can not be shown .
When texturing you should always use rectangular textures whose height / width (in pixels ) are always powers of 2 . In addition, UV maps should always be used. Since the automatic Texuturier possibilities of Blender are not applied appropriately. The format of the Texutren can use JPGs , PNGs or BMPs , and it often leads to problems with PNGs . You also have to pay attention to the Kompremierverfahren , especially in JPGs , as these can cause problems later. Best to let the standard procedure of Bildbearbeitungsprogammes set .


====== Export ====== 
Before exporting, you should consider some things . You should see where the center of the object is located . This is also the point of reference will be used later for the position. In addition, the dimension in Blender also be used later. However, one must first &quot; use &quot; all translations . For example, if the object is scaled and rotated , these values ​​are indeed changing in Blender , but can cause problems later and confusions in the Positonierung . Therefore you should all translations ( Loc , Rot , Scale) by pressing &quot;Ctrl + A&quot; to apply , so its value is 1.0 .

===== Import =====
In the project you have to take the final . Fbx and the corresponding textures in the content part of the project . Often the path of the texture in the . Fbx must be changed. For this you open the . Fbx with a text editor and change the path to fit in the &quot;Relative File Name&quot; .

===== Use it in the project ===== 
Need to use the model the following steps are executed.

1. Create Variable for the model
 
   Model myModel ;

2. Loading the model ( in the LoadContet ()). In this case, the file is located in Content.Models and is called &quot; theFBX &quot;.

   myModel = new Floor ( Content.Load &lt;Model&gt; ( &quot;Models \ \ theFBX &quot; ) , 0, 0 , 0);

3. Draw the Model.

            // Copy any parent transforms.
            Matrix[] transforms = new Matrix[myModel.Bones.Count];
           myModel.CopyAbsoluteBoneTransformsTo(transforms);

            // Draw the model. A model can have multiple meshes, so loop.
            foreach (ModelMesh mesh in myModel.Meshes)
            {
                // This is where the mesh orientation is set, as well 
                // as our camera and projection.
                foreach (BasicEffect effect in mesh.Effects)
                {
                    effect.EnableDefaultLighting();
                    effect.DirectionalLight0.DiffuseColor = new Vector3(3.0f, 3.0f, 3.0f); //Bright Light
                    effect.DirectionalLight0.SpecularColor = new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f); //Blue Specular Light
                    effect.World = transforms[mesh.ParentBone.Index] *
                        Matrix.CreateRotationY(myModelRotation) //Sets the Rotation
                        * Matrix.CreateTranslation(myModelPos)  //Sets the Position
                        * Matrix.CreateScale(myModelScale);     //Sets a Scalation
                    effect.View = Matrix.CreateLookAt(cameraPosition, //Sets the Position of the Camera and the Point where it is look
                        cameraLookAt, Vector3.Up);
                    effect.Projection = Matrix.CreatePerspectiveFieldOfView(
                        MathHelper.ToRadians(45.0f), m_aspectRatio,
                        1.0f, 10000.0f);
                }
                // Draw the mesh, using the effects set above.
                mesh.Draw();

==== Input ====
===== Keyboard =====

The class '' Keyboard '' represents in XNA the keyboard. This keyboard enables queries .
By '' '' GetState method of the current status can be queried.

            KeyboardState keyboard state ;
            keyboard state = Keyboard.GetState ();

Often only simple'' if '' loops are needed to perform a certain action by a keyboard shortcut .
For example , an object can be moved by these queries :

            if ( keyboardState.IsKeyDown ( Keys.Left ) )
                        { X.moveLeft (); }

            if ( keyboardState.IsKeyDown ( Keys.Right ) )
                        { X.moveRight );}



===== Gamepad =====
Alternatively, the control on a gamepad is possible (Xbox 360 controller). This is represented by the class '' GamePadState '' .

            GamePadState gamepad state ;

Since up to four controllers can be connected simultaneously, it is necessary to select '' about '' PlayerIndex the respective controller. In this case we choose controller '' One '' .

            gamepad state = GamePad.GetState ( PlayerIndex.One );

For checking the connection, the '' IsConnected '' feature is available .

            gamePadState.IsConnected

If a connection is successfully established , the controller buttons and knobs can be controlled as keystrokes. In the example, the key '' A '' is selected.

            gamePadState.Buttons.A

Was pressed to check if a key is still a comparison necessary. This is indicated by '' '' ButtonState.Pressed possible.

            gamePadState.Buttons.A == ButtonState.Pressed

Since not only keys but also triggers etc. available on the Xbox controller , there are a few other features . To select , for example, the '' dPad '' (left ), the following call is necessary :

            gamePadState.DPad.Left

In parallel, calling the shoulders or other keys is possible. For example:

            gamePadState.Buttons.LeftShoulder
            gamePadState.Buttons.Back

At the Thumbsticks the behavior is a little different. These are bewegungsempflindlich . Depending on which is moved with the intensity and direction of a joystick , different values ​​will be in the form of a vector is returned (value range 0-1 ) .

In addition, a vibration of the controller is possible, in contrast to the keyboard controller. By setting two float values, the two motors can be controlled in the controller , while the intensity can be adjusted. ( Values ​​between 0 and 1). To the vibration of the controller again To be issued is merely setting the values ​​to'' 0.0f , 0.0f '' necessary.

            GamePad.SetVibration ( PlayerIndex.One , 0.3f , 0.3f );




==== Audio effects ====

===== Play audio files =====
To use audio effects in the program, the following using directive is necessary :

            using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media ;

All sound effects are represented by the class '' Sound Effect '' . To add a sound, a new object of the class is created. In this example, a &quot;hit&quot; for a hit of a curling stone is needed.

            Sound Effect soundHit ;


In the '' '' LoadContent method, all sound effects are loaded. In this case, the sound file in XNA Explorer is located in the Sounds folder of the directory content . '' &quot; 01_Hit &quot; '' here is the file name without the extension (preferably the data format. Wav formats ) .

            soundHit = Content.Load &lt;SoundEffect&gt; ( &quot;Sounds \ \ 01_Hit &quot;);

To be able to play the audio file soundHit now , only the following command is required :

            soundHit.Play ();

===== Play audio files in a loop =====
To play an audio file in a loop is an object of class '' '' SoundEffectInstance necessary.
After setting the boolean value '' True '' at soundHitLoop the file after calling the '' Play'' method is played in a continuous loop .

            SoundEffectInstance soundHitLoop ;
            soundHitLoop = soundHitLoop.CreateInstance ();
            soundHitLoop.IsLooped = true;
            soundHitLoop.Play ();




==== Start Screen / Endscreen ====

Scene Management ===== =====
Normally, a scene management is essential . Due to the already complex code management was, however, no need for a special scene. To provide , however, a start and a Endscreen the players at his disposal , all the necessary multimedia data have been loaded into the game and controlled by keyboard or gamepad input. The fact that the order of objects in C # are crucial in the Draw method , the start screen of all other objects could be placed so as to be directly at the start of the game visible.

===== Start Screen - Animation =====
The animation at the beginning of the game was an original high-resolution GIF animation . Since only during the development of the problem occurred which is not supported by this file format has been resorted to the embedding of a video. After a few failed attempts (problems after the import due to an incorrect video format , a compression wrong or missing audio tracks ) the issue was resolved ultimately by the import into Windows Movie Maker and a subsequent . Wmv export.

For video formats, the class video and video player, as well as the media using directive is necessary.

            using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media ;

            Video vid ;
            Video Player vidplayer ;

Here is the video a texture assigned , as well as a '' Rectangle '' generated to fit to the screen :

            Texture2D vidTexture ;
            Rectangle vidRectangle ;

Then the vidplayer is initialized :

            vidplayer = new VideoPlayer ();

And then in the'' '' LoadContent method will be loaded (the file name of the video: &quot;Start Screen&quot; ) . This video can then be modified in '' Rectangle '' (X, Y coordinates of the pixel at the top left , width , height).

            vid = Content.Load &lt;Video&gt; ( &quot;Start Screen&quot; );
            vidRectangle = new Rectangle ( GraphicsDevice.Viewport.X , GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Y , GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Width , GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Height );

The following function is the start of the video is now available:

            vidplayer.Play ( vid );

But not only starting, but also other functions such as stopping are possible:
vidplayer.Stop ();

The project my task was to make it all the graphical elements of the game . All graphics were created in Photoshop and then built using the XNA framework to the respective right place in the code. The Start screen includes an animation which was also created in Photoshop , then saved in Premiere Pro with sound and has been incorporated into the game.

The design should thereby be created , especially among modern frame points. Nevertheless, it should not be left to the Extreme - factor except eight . The logo of our development studios should be kept simplicity as possible , so that it can impress as easily as possible . This simplicity was the motto which is why I have created a largely monochrome logo.

A completely different approach to design , I went in the actual design of the game. Here the focus was clearly on an extreme and eye-catching design . The logo should jump directly to the start screen appear Des eye . The reason for this design was that we want to enhance the relatively inconspicuous sport of curling through the design extreme . The Splatterbrushes in the background of the logo are more eye-catching .

Furthermore, I have been looking after the team entry listed above, which will summarize the project in a few words .

The following is an excerpt of the work :

{ | Class = &quot; wikitable &quot;

My part in the team was related to programming/design/graphics/audio/project mangement/...  What I did was very easy/difficult.  Basically I followed these steps:
* Step 1

For me the second aspect is actually the more important one.  .

Give some more explanation of what you did/learned in step 1... with references to tutorials

==Introduction==

Technological determinism in its most basic form is the idea that technology has a significant effect on society. The theory presents the idea that technology is the reason for developments in our society, influencing our lives at a number of levels. Determinists believe that technology influences society on different levels; impacting on industry, the way we communicate and even shapes individuals. 

===Overview===

The definition of technological determinism can be regarded as the cultural implications of new media, by bringing into concern the history behind media theory and production and the way these frameworks develop social and cultural structures. With media technologies constantly developing and allowing for instant and convenient communication, theorists have argued that this has influenced social progressions. New media technologies have revolutionized everyday life to an extent where humans are able to create identity through social networking, consume media productions through television, computers and other means and also communicate from a local to a global scale.

By assessing theorists work such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan Marshall McLuhan], who poses the idea that reforming media affects how humans distinguish and value the world around them and the differences between ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ media, we can establish how technology is determined through the shaping and changes of cultural and social formations.

Technological determinism comes in two main variations, best described as hard and soft determinism.

• Hard or strong determinism argues that technology is the foremost or sole reason for the way society is structured and any development in our culture. Technology is seen as the “prime mover in history” (Chandler, 2000).

• Soft or weak determinism is a less extreme argument, more approved of by scholars. It sees technology as more of an enabler for societal change. Rather than viewing technology as the sole or primary reason for anything that happens in society, it takes into account other factors and argues that technology gives us opportunities for development but does not necessarily cause it.

==Context and Origin==

In history, technology is recognised as the ‘prime mover’ and according to technological determinists; it is the sole cause of change within society. With this, technology becomes seen as the most contributing factor when assessing the pattern of social organisation. Continuing from a technological determinist perspective, the argument remains that as technology has grown (from writing and print, to the television and the computer), society has changed alongside it. The most extremist technological determinists see the entire form of society as being determined by technology.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen Thorstein Veblen] (1857-1929), an American sociologist and economist was believed to have originally coined the term Technical Determinism. His founding views led to a number of theorists expanding on the subject.  

===Karl Marx===
The first elaboration on technological determinism came from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx Karl Marx], who believed that technology and its changes are the main influence on social relations and social order, and that technology forms the base of society (Chandler 2000). His association with determinism comes from statements such as &quot;The Handmill gives you society with the feudal lord: the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist&quot;, although some argue that he was not, in fact, an advocate of technological determinism. Marx focusses on theories surrounding economic activity and its role as a productive force. The forces of production are 'technological processes once begun, require forms of organisation or commitments of political resources, regardless of their social desirability or previous social practices…Cultural and social change follows from technology’(Bimber, 1990:7).

===Non Marxist Theorists===
A number of Non-Marxist theorists have adopted a technological determinism stance including [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigfried_Giedion Sigfried Giedion], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Townsend_White,_Jr. Lynn White Jr], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_White Leslie White], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Innis Harold Innis] and most notably, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan Marshall McLuhan]. McLuhan (1911-1980) was the first theorist to recognise the changes related to technological determinism and how it would bring about a brand new society that was defined by networking and a greater connectivity.

==Main Concepts==

===Technological Imperative===


Technological imperative, also known as the inevitability thesis,  is the assumption that technology cannot be stopped in its development, and that technological progress is irreversible, unavoidable, and inevitable. Essentially, this theory assumes that because we are able to do something because of a particular technology, we ought to, must, or will do it. It is the theory that what can be done, will be done, whether or not it is moral, good, or productive for mankind. 

This is important to technological determinism as it recognizes the influence of technology on action. It drives society to act on not only what they are able to do, but also push the boundaries and test limits because, as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann John von Neumann] observed, man cannot resist the technological possibilities as they arise (Mumford 1971: 186). Progress must continue wherever progress is possible. With this, the theory acknowledges the shift from technology as a means to technology as an end. Critics of the theory, including [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Ellul Jacques Ellul] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Illich Ivan Illich], argue that the theory of technological imperative cannot be fully accurate, as not all areas of available progress are being exploited. The main argument stems from the lack of drive to create renewable energy sources.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Arnold Pacey suggests that the technological imperative is commonly taken to be 'the lure of always pushing toward the greatest feat of technical performance or complexity which is currently available' (Pacey 1983, p. 79). The mathematician John von Neumann wrote with some alarm that 'technological possibilities are irresistible to man.' (in Mumford 1971, p. 186). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Soustelle Jacques Soustelle] declared of the atomic bomb that 'Since it was possible, it was necessary' (in Ellul 1964, p. 99). And fatalists might add that since we can now destroy the planet, in time we will. The technological imperative is a common assumption amongst commentators on 'new technologies'. They tell us, for instance, that the 'information technology revolution' is inevitably on its way and our task as users is to learn to cope with it&quot; (Chandler 2000).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to McLuhan, the media dictates the message - an argument that becomes extremely relevant when according to technological imperative, society is unable to resist the development of technology and so also the continual development of media platforms.

===Social Media Influence===
====Always-On====
The concept of Always-On stems from the idea that society is now &quot;tethered&quot; to technology, and that humans are always networked and connected in some way, even if they are not physically on any devices. This relates to technological determinism as the theory proposes that society and social relations are determined by technology, and thus also our on-line relationships and cultural tendencies.

Technological determinism underpins the theory of an ‘Always-on Culture’, arguing that social networking platforms have revolutionised the way society communicates.  It creates a new platform of communication, exclusive of face to face interaction. It can be a means to strengthen real life relationships or make solely online ones. It allows for communication in different social circles at the same time and with people across the globe. This, according to technological determinism has shaped the way people communicate within society. 

[[../Chapter 3: Always-on Culture/]].

===On-Line Identity===

Technological determinists would also argue that technology has an impact on our on-line identity, as the specifications of the medium help to dictate what kind of identity we are able to create. In a sense, technology creates parameters into which we must fit our identity - be it through profile pictures, privacy settings, status updates and even friends lists. With the development and increased popularity of social networking platforms, 'online identity' has become an increasingly prevalent area of discussion. These social media sites have created a new online community with sometimes different cultural tendencies to the 'real world'. People are given the opportunity to present an image of themselves to society via the 'virtual world' which may or may not align with their 'real world' identity. According to technological determinism, social media has created a platform for society to create separate identities in the 'virtual world' and thus give people multiple personas who could not have without the aid of this technology. 

[[../Chapter 2: Online Identity/]].

===Science, History and Technology===

Technology has revolutionised throughout history with the adaptation of science. There is a distinct view that technology is applied to science; science creates new explanations, models and predictions about the world which is then applied to practice with technological innovation. Throughout history science has reflected its theories into technology thus forming an in sync correspondence between changes within technology and changes within the world. 

New science comes from old science; new technology from old, from recent developments in media technologies such as mobile phones, the internet, wireless computers such as iPads and laptops and special effects these have resulted in the modification of older technology by improving electronic devices and battery power (Collins &amp; Evans, 2006:10). 

====Gutenberg's Printing Press====
According to McLuhan's theory, the printing press is an example of how technology can change society. The printing press increased the speed of production for the written word, which in turn allowed the reproduction of the written word. This lead to the standardisation of vernacular languages and universal literacy. Thus, the experience of the world is transformed by the standardization of a common language, through the development of a new technology.

==Notable Determinists==
===Marshall McLuhan===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan Marshall McLuhan]'s work is often viewed as a founding part of the study of media theory, and is often seen as a key component in technological determinism.

=====Extensions of the Human Body=====
This is the assertion by McLuhan that technology are tools that extend the human body and more accurately, extend or amplify the abilities of the visual and aural senses. Examples of this would be the television extending the visual senses or the telephone extending the aural (Brey,2000). McLuhan goes on to say that technology in fact changes the way we act in society and that nowadays people “wears its brain outside its skull and its nerves outside its hide” (McLuhan, 1966 p.64). Although at first this may seem an obscure and nonsensical view, it can be comprehended in that much of the technology we use for interacting and viewing the world start at our fingertips and with the technology that we consume.

McLuhan’s assertion that the medium is the message is perhaps now becoming a more likely theory than was first thought. He asserted that technology is like a bodily extension just like the  “wheel is an extension of the foot” and “a hammer is an extension of the arm” (Lister et al, 2003: p.78) and the recent announcements by Google, Intel, and Facebook that they were all investing heavily in wearable technology is testimony to McLuhan’s theory (BBC, 2014a). Facebook recently bought virtual reality technology firm Oculus VR for £1.2bn and Mark Zuckerberg claimed that “virtual reality will be the next social communications platform” (The Guardian, 2014). Furthermore, his statement that this wearable technology could “change the way we work, play and communicate” (BBC, 2014b) directly supports McLuhan’s stance.

=====The Global Village=====
This is a term coined by McLuhan in reference to what he calls the Electronic culture that arises with the increased use of televisions and computers. A way of understanding this is that the improvement in technology has allowed for much quicker communication. In theory this allows for the entire world to be compressed into a Global Village where everyone can quickly communicate with each other, whereas in practice this has manifested itself through the internet allowing for an individual to have a much larger number of  near constant social connections. A very recent example of this would be the case of popular social media site Facebook in which an average adult user is said to have 338 friends, which clearly shows the breaking down of distance and ease of communication that McLuhan conveys in his idea of the global village(Singha, 2014). This can be also be further established by looking at the number of people that use the most common social networking sites, 1.23 billion monthly active users on Facebook and over 1 billion unique YouTube user visits per month. This puts people in potential contact with more people than they could meet or speak to in their lifetime and again strengthens the idea of the global village. Another idea of this is that through the quick access and speed of response that comes with this type of technology we are able to react to global issues far faster than previously. Therefore, issues that may have once not have been of concern can be addressed by a much bigger crowd. This follows the same underlying concept of increasing technology reducing distances and effectively making the world a smaller more accessible place. McLuhan also suggests that the people who live in this electronic culture, or global village gain all the benefits and downfalls of new technologies and so whereas distances are no longer a problem for communication, technology barriers and development or lack of it can still provide issues (Smith,M and Marx,L. 1994).

=====Hot and Cool Media=====
A way in which Mcluhan categorises different forms of media is through a temperature type scale in which there are both hot and cool types of media. As with much of McLuhan's writings this is not an initially intuitive process. A media type is considered hot if it heavily utilises and immerses one sense in particular. An example of this may be the comparison of a photograph which gives a large and detailed amount of visual information and hence a hot media form, to a sketched cartoon which gives a minimal amount of information visually (Van Koten, 2009). Furthermore McLuhan suggests that it is cool media that involves a higher amount of interpretation from the consumer than hotter forms of media. This can again be thought of as a photo presenting visual information more clearly where as a drawing may need to be interpreted in terms of shapes and colours and a have a meaning which may be more contentious drawn less easily from this information. Below is a table which contrast various types of hot media with their cooler media counterparts (Van Koten, 2009). There is a large amount of contention about the usefulness of the hot and cool media scale due a number of issues that are described in the [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/Chapter_1:_Technological_Determinism&amp;stable=0#Problems_with_Hot_and_Cool_Media Criticism] section below.

Similar to McLuhan’s idea of hot and cool media is the notion of 'light on' and 'light through' media. ‘Light on’ media is where the light source bounces off a surface or object before hitting the viewers’ eyes. Therefore the light is projected onto a screen (Van Koten, 2009). ‘Light through’ media is where the light source is positioned in front of audience; therefore making the audience the screen by projecting light onto them (Van Koten, 2009). In likeness to hot and cool media, ‘light on’ would be described as hot because it is “all revealing” where ‘light through’ is less revealing, more “mysterious” so therefore cool (Van Koten, 2009, p.91). An example of ‘light on’ media is cinema, where the light comes from behind the audience onto the screen, with no chance of participation; where an example of ‘light through’ media is television with the light projecting from the TV onto the viewers, giving more room for interpretation and interaction.

===Ray Kurzweil===


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil Ray Kurzweil], a futurist specified in speech recognition technology and the future of technology such as robotics and biotechnology, is notable as a technological determinist with his assessment of the history of technology and its rate of progress. 

By establishing technology as a determinist force he states that ‘once life takes hold on a planet, we can consider the emergence of technology is inevitable' (Kurzweil, 1999:30). Kurzweil assumes that the rate of progress of technology is at such a high speed that technological intelligence will surpass human intelligence within a few decades (Kurzweil, 2004:382). He argues that the future holds technological change so fast human nature will take longer to adapt to these changes and the rapid pace of innovation.

Kurzweil explains that technology is a means of evolution, in that ‘technology picks right up with the exponentially quickening pace of evolution’(Kurzweil, 1999:30). Technology has a positive effect on human individuals and society as it allows them to change themselves by bettering their cognitive abilities and health by adapting to technological advancements. For Kurzweil, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth exponential growth] is the leading factor in technology where [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law Moore’s Law] is of strong importance.

==Criticism and Debate==

Technology through significant media forces has reshaped the way in which humans behave, the structure of human societies and even language. Media even has the power to change governments (Collins &amp; Evans, 2006:50). Theorists have formed contradictory ideas that raise debates over the development of technology as being a direct source of social change.

===Cultural Determinism===

Cultural determinism is the idea that the society and culture surrounding us helps determine who we are. Essentially, the environment has more of an influence on something than inherited traits. This opposes the idea of technological determinism as it then assumes that society is not influenced by technology, but rather that society influences technology to fulfill its needs and social tendencies that already exist. The main cultural determinist is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Williams Raymond Williams].

====Raymond Williams====

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Williams Raymond Williams] ‘insists that the future of our media will depend on our capacity to make informed judgements and decisions about that future.’ Our world, society and history are continually altered by whatever new technology comes along: the steam engine, the automobile, the atomic bomb. (Williams, 2003:1). Technology such as television is often argued that it has effects on social behaviour and cultural and psychological conditions. However these effects are the result of the technology being the cause. The notions of a cause and effect between a technology and society, a technology and a culture and a technology and a psychology are quite complex to apply answers and theories to. Williams, however goes on to analyse specifically television as a technology that results in cultural pattern shifts. Williams states that television has altered our world. In this sense it has been created ‘as a result of scientific and technical research’ yet television has been used in many other forms, these are simply the effects of its creation:


• As a tool for social communication to construct social relationships.

• It provides us with certain perceptions of reality within the world

• It provides a strong mode of communication through news and entertainment

• Through television advertising is made possible to promote goods to society

• It follows a set of systems to what society wants from television by attending to opinions and styles of behaviour from what is produced.


Arguably the development of television and overall technology cannot be assumed to purposefully direct society into conforming to change. Technology should be considered as a typical invention of which is accidental in its proceedings (Williams, 2003:5). Television is therefore a technology which without it humans would still have been influenced or entertained by other means. 

Technological Determinism is only one force among others; 'social forces shape technology and technology shapes society, and societies can, and frequently do, make rules that determine which technologies are used and what use can be made of them' (Collins &amp; Evans, 2007:51).

There is an argument concerning whether determinism is in-fact too determined. This theory suggests that determinism that is seen to focus on technology to recognise how we act or think can ignore how we in-fact reach this point. Ong (1982) understands that writing has transformed us, however we are gradually holding less and less control over this. Ong (1982:77) presents ideas about writing and how writing has transformed human consciousness. Ong (1982) takes this further and states that as a result this gives this form of technology a sense of autonomy. This leads to the belief that it is difficult to understand the possible social changes that have to occur in technology as it acts on its own to decipher which caused or resulted in the other to occur. 
 
Further criticism of Technological Determinism is found in the idea that the theory is written in a broad sense. McLuhan also fails to mention how technologies are constructed yet implicitly speaks of the way in which humans interact with technology. McLuhan also fails to acknowledge the idea of ‘technological innovation’ this is despite the fact that this technologies are created through the human interplay with various technologies that McLuhan holds in high regard (Cana 2003).

===Problems with McLuhan's &quot;the medium is the message&quot;===
It could be argued that it is more beneficial to state that &quot;the medium is also the message&quot; as opposed to &quot;the medium is the message&quot;. This is believed because the nature of the medium in itself is informative and it is hard to claim that the content is independent of the medium. It is difficult to suggest that the content is not shaped by the medium. Also, content that is generated by technology such as language, print, TV and internet justify it's usability and this content can also work to fuel new technological innovations (Cana 2003).

===Problems with Hot and Cool Media===
As McLuhan has the tendency of doing in his writing, the Hot and Cool media temperature scale comes with a number of criticisms due to the somewhat vague nature in which it is described. Firstly, there is no actual way of measuring the temperature of a media form and so no way of being able to determine if one type of media is hotter or cooler than another. This means that it is a subjective scale and that any consensus comes down to the opinions of the people using it, therefore leaving it prone to bias and making it somewhat less useful. To add to this, the scale can only be used when comparing two media forms that have somewhat similar aims or place emphasis on the same senses such as the radio and telephone(Van Koten, 2009). As much of McLuhan's work is not particularly recent it also does not include or take into consideration many recent updates in technology. Examples of this would be the improvement of televisions with high definition capabilities and video calling technology available commonly on smart phones. Therefore it can in many cases be discarded as a flawed method of gauging media.

==Glossary==

'''Cool Media''': is known to be of low definition, this is so because the level of information being given to the reader is small. In comparison to hot media, cool media requires greater levels of participation from audiences. Examples of cool media include: telephones, cartoons, television. 

'''Culture''': the totality of socially transmitted behavior patterns, arts, beliefs, institutions, and all other products of human work and thought.

'''Hot Media''': is described as something that is of ‘high definition’ and are low in participation as they do not require much assistance from audiences to be filled or completed. The idea of high definition photographs can be used to this extent. Other examples of hot media include: radio, print and movies.

'''non-Marxist''': a non-Marxist can be defined as a socialist who disagrees with the idea of communism and works towards and wishes for a society to exist where the workers within society have the over-riding say in their lives.

'''Social Media''': is the various websites and applications that allow for users to communicate and share experiences to the public and in private, allowing for them to participate in social networking.

'''Technology''': in broad terms, technology is an entity used to solve real-world problems

'''Technological Innovation''': has been described as the innovation of a new product that provides substanstial improvements on previous products. Technological innovation is crucial to the success of products and they can be protected by Intellectual Property.

'''The medium is in the message''': this is an idea of Marshall McLuhan and he suggests that the medium form in a way embeds itself into the message. The result is that messages are influenced through the medium.

==Introduction==

The internet was not originally built as a “personal communication medium, let alone a way for fans to connect around their objects of pleasure, for people to find potential romantic partners, for employers to find or investigate potential hires, or any such social process. It was developed to safeguard military knowledge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Baym, N. (2010). ''Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digital Media and Society Series'', (pp.13). Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term online identity has obvious connotations of the profiles people hold on social networking sites such as Facebook. However, the realms of online identity are not isolated to and focused purely on social networking sites, and include a plethora of online sites that provide an outlet for expression and representation of identity online.

Thinking about online identity and how we use it, and how it consequently uses us, allows for thought on a range of topics including: how social media technologies help mobilize our identities; the way we communicate with each other; how the narratives we construct through our online identities relate to our culture; how we present ourselves to others in the social media world; and the nature of production and consumption of digital representations. 

Online identity is argued by many theorists and critics as being another outlet for the expression of identity, and a fair amount of focus is granted to the modification process that accompanies it. It is a contentious issue as to whether our actual identities align with our online identities or whether it is more complicated than this, and this too is explored by theorists in order to try and obtain a greater understanding of the broad spectrum that is online identity.

==Main Concepts==

==Forms of Digital Representation==
===Narrative===

Understanding narrative is vital in understanding the impact online identity can and does have on the individual and the 21st century.  Narrative in this context needs to be described in a much more critical sense than just 'narrative has something to do with stories'. Whilst it does involve the process of storytelling and description, narrative is a very old form of communication that is powerful; it can work in simple forms or on a sophisticated level. It is not the same sort of storytelling found in literature as it is independent from fiction. It exists in the real world and is how we make sense of our lives and the world around us. Putting and displaying our narratives online preserves it, makes it more real and helps us feel more human by providing us with proof. Facebook statuses, pictures and albums are a prime example of this. Narrative is independent of ‘tellability’: you can tell a story, but narrative has a psychological component as it involves the listener’s or observer’s participation in ‘filling in the gaps’ of the story.  These gaps can be the back story, intertextual references, characterisation and even generic familiarity. Narrative and realism are dominant in the production of digital representations.

Van Koten argues that narrative and realism are dominant forms of digital representation in terms of production.&lt;ref&gt;Van Koten, H. (2009). The Digital Image and the Pleasure Principle: The Consumption of Realism in the Age of Simulation. In Bentkowska-Kafel (Eds.), ''Digital Visual Culture: theory and practice'', (pp.89). Bristol: Intellect&lt;/ref&gt; Online identity is so closely linked to (and in essence is) a form of self expression. Essentially, creating an identity for oneself online and presenting ones narrative to the world is one of the ways in which we create platforms for ourselves. This platform has allowed for self-expression of the identity we want to have and want to present to the world.


===Behaviours and Narrative on Facebook===

Facebook is something that might be used by almost the entire world, but how we use our individual page is a different matter. Facebook is a place where narrative exists as people post about their lives through photographs, status updates and events. In fact, Facebook has even evolved to give people their own timelines, and one can look back over their story to see how their existence has developed and how it has been documented and shared on Facebook. 

A book my Gemini Adams looks at the idea of how people view Facebook posts in different ways &lt;ref&gt;Adams, G. (2013) “Facebook Diet, The : 50 Funny Signs of Facebook Addiction and Ways to Unplug With a Digital Detox (The Unplug Series)'', (pp.1-146). London: Live Consciously&lt;/ref&gt;  Adams suggests that there are two forms of Facebook narrators; the ones who put everything on, and the ones who are more selective about their posts:
For example some people use Facebook to talk about everything such as:
What they eat
What film they are watching
If they’re happy or sad
If they’re enjoying a lecture or falling asleep
Who they are angry with 
The fact they are frustrated walking in the rain or waiting for a bus
All the photos from nights out whether they are of quality or not
This may not seem like an issue and Adams notes that these, “superficial,” details are not very harmful. However, it is believed that some people have a very different approach to Facebook and see it as an almost sacred space to be used only for important or useful updates such as:
I’m getting married
What is the best way to cook a chicken?
I passed my exams
Can anybody suggest the best taxi firm in the area?
I’m buying a house
I went on holiday, here are my pictures
I’m getting a new job

Therefore, Adams shows that the subjects of narration on Facebook differ depending on the school or “sharing levels,” that a person belongs to. 

However, the book also points out that the detail of the given narration is also dependent on how people view Facebook as a forum for publicising information. For example, some people may announce on Facebook that they are pregnant without telling friends or family first. Some argue that this is natural as Facebook is now a normal and common form of communication. However, others are concerned that Facebook has forced a loss in the intimacy of communication and eradicated the need for making the effort to contact people. It is also suggested that some events in a person’s life are personal and it is inappropriate to share it with the large group of, “random acquaintances,” that make up a large percentage of people’s Facebook friend group.

Overall the book raises the idea that Facebook is a site of narration, but users adopt it in different ways and choose to share their stories in a mixture of styles which raises controversial questions and theories on communicative behaviour.

===Narratives and Online Chat Rooms===



Online chat rooms are a place where people can open up and develop their true character due to the freedom of anonymity. However, because in a chat room one speaks to a stranger who one may never meet or come across again, there is an extreme temptation to create a false narrative for the sake of: fun, experiment, emotional liberation or exploitation.

A book by Dr Monica T. Whitty and Dr Adiran N. Carr which looks at romances online explains that people are restricted in real life by the baggage of reality that they find oppressing or problematic. &lt;ref&gt;Whitty, T and Carr, A (2006) “Cyberspace Romance: The Psychology of Online Relationships '', (pp.45-53). England: Palgrave Macmillian&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, using teenage subjects in a chat room setting, Lynn Schofield Clark observed the way they acted towards strangers online and concluded that chat rooms are often used only for &quot;fun&quot; and not the pursuit of serious relationships; the attraction of this being the lack of consequences within their cyberspace narrative. &lt;ref&gt;Jones, S G (ed) (1998) &quot;Cybersociety 2.0: Revisiting Computer-Mediated Communication and Community&quot;, (pp.159-182). London: SAGE Publications, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Internet chat rooms offer an escape from this as users have the opportunity to invent new lives, new back stories and to rid themselves of unwelcome details which they wish they could remove in reality. 

It is questionable as to whether this is a positive or negative ability as there are both advantages and disadvantages to it. One could say that having the freedom to have an invented narrative could allow one to express themselves and explore emotions or ideas that seem impossible in ordinary life. It may reduce the likelihood of mental illness as a person has a forum to be experimental and play out confusing issues. However, it is also arguable that this stops people living in reality and dealing with their lives in an active and healthy manner. False narratives encourage deception and also allow for people to exploit and harm vulnerable others through the use of abusive manipulation and emotive stories.

Regardless of the ethical arguments, it is evidential through exploring studies on online chat rooms, or even through personal use, that they do provide users with the chance to either voice their own genuine narratives without fear of being known. But chat rooms also let people invent new or fabricated narratives which can potentially be beneficial to their own development, or indeed harmful to themselves and to others.

==Impression Management==

Online presentation of the self is an expression of identity, but also a careful management process, through visual representation, that seeks to modify the impression that others have about our personalities

The World Wide Web gives users the ability to present various forms of the self to others at a distance. With the presence of an online identity that has the potential to be distributed and viewed across the globe, how you are presented and judged can become a major issue for many people. This can affect self-confidence and may lead to some people manipulating real-life events prior to making a record of them available online (through editing of photos, posts, etc), but also the ability to keep elements of your life separate; e.g. professional and social life, how you present yourself to family and how you present yourself to friends, and the expectations that come with the aforementioned. Thus, impression management could be said to be the act of selectively presenting and hiding sides of one’s own identity.

Due to the increasing likelihood of one's online identity affecting real-life events and circumstances, Impression Management is arguably more important now than it has ever been. The vast majority of executive companies have been using search engines to perform background checks on applicants and potential employees since 2006.&lt;ref&gt; Cristian Lupsa (November 29, 2006). &quot;Do you need a Web publicist?&quot;. The Christian Science Monitor.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later, not only has that percentage risen, but employers are twice as likely to eliminate a potential candidate for a position due to negative information found online. Additionally, over one quarter of executives placed into positions by search firms in 2012 were initially contacted or identified on a social network, meaning not only must potential applicants remain increasingly vigilant, for possible negative aspects of their online identity, but must also proactively work toward presenting oneself as being employable. &lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Robyn. 2013 Executive Job Market Intelligence Report. Rep. Execunet, 2013. http://www.execunet.com/promo/pdf/ExecuNet_Executive_Job_Market_Intelligence_Report_2013.pdf. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Anonymity===

=====Disembodiment effect=====

The disembodiment effect regards the agency of online users, able to interact and communicate online, exceeding the limitations of their physical bodies. The digital environment seems to disregard the idea of a connection between one’s self and one’s body. Users are able to use make use of language, avatars, pictures, amongst other social cues, and use SNS’s to manipulate their various social cues and affordances to create disembodied online entities which can operate in ways perhaps different from how they would act socially in person. Where anonymity is an affordance of a particular SNS, users are capable of behaving either in accordance or against the norms of their social behaviour. Some can behave maliciously and deviate from their usual civilised, socialised behaviour under the allowance of anonymity.

====Disinhibition Effect====

The disinhibition effect, where online users shed their real time social inhibitions in their anonymous, invisible online identity, is thought to be broken down into 6 explanatory factors: dissociative anonymity, invisibility, asynchronicity, solipsistic introjection dissociative, and minimization of authority. Disinhibition is usually categorised as either Benign or Toxic, the former referring to the way in which people can often act nicer than they do in face-to-face situations and the latter describing the way in which people can rally against socially-accepted moral norms and explore darker domains.  

======'''Dissociative anonymity'''======
Where usernames and email addresses are the main information we have of one another as users, people can remain relatively anonymous online: some having fake names, and others having no names. In representing such a limited amount of data about one’s self we are able to operate without accountability. By dissociating one’s online actions from one’s self and real identity, people are less hesitant to vocalize any thoughts or opinions they have, and self-disclose freely. One can avoid assuming ownership of their online actions, and can even convince themselves that such behavior is separate from them and “not me at all.” &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J., The Online Disinhibition Effect, Vol 7, no. 3, Mary Ann Liebert, Available at: http://www.samblackman.org/Articles/Suler.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

======'''Invisibility'''======
Being not physically present or seen when interacting online can add to the disinhibition effect in that one has the ability, and capacity, to roam through and view data in various different online areas; chat rooms and online interactions. Although we can understand a lot about a user’s identity through our online interaction with them and their self-disclosure, we still cannot physically see them. &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J., The Online Disinhibition Effect, Vol 7, no. 3, Mary Ann Liebert, Available at: http://www.samblackman.org/Articles/Suler.pdf
 &lt;/ref&gt; By eradicating the physical social cues present in physical interaction, such as facial expressions and reactions to an unsettling statement, or how one looks when uttering a controversial aside, this ultimately can eradicate one’s regard for how such a statement makes them look or how it is received by others. &lt;ref&gt; Baym, N. (2010). Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digital Media and Society Series. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately this invisibility can effect how we portray ourselves, and how we interact with others in such a disinhibited mode of behavior.

======'''Asynchronicity'''======
Interacting online, we do not have to communicate in real time – we can wait hours, days or even weeks before responding to one another – whereas in real time interactions we need to deal with others’ immediate reactions to what we say and do. Having to consider others in our real time actions inhibits us to conform to social norms and respond with social regard for the other person. When these social cues are lifted in the anonymous, invisible online realm, we can bide our time and allow ourselves to develop our thought processes and opinions, giving rise to structured and articulate responses benign and toxic disinhibition that avert social norms.
 
======'''Solipsistic introjection''' ======
Through not interacting face to face, online interactivity between users can blur boundaries of the self. People can feel connected psychically with the thought processes and messages of the user they are speaking to, as they are devising a voice and image of that user speaking inside their own mind, and introducing the other’s thought process and ‘voice’ into their own psyche. The online user then becomes one’s companion inside one’s inner psychological world, where one can entertain continuations of online conversations and say things they perhaps would not say in person. In reading a companion’s messages online listening to the voice constructed for them inside one’s head, one may hear one’s own voice and take what their companion is saying as their own voice speaking to their self. In hearing one’s own voice when interacting with another user online, as if having a conversation with one’s self, one is likely to be disinhibited and say whatever comes to mind - as speaking to one’s self inside one’s own head feels perfectly safe. &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J., The Online Disinhibition Effect, Vol 7, no. 3, Mary Ann Liebert, Available at: http://www.samblackman.org/Articles/Suler.pdf
 &lt;/ref&gt;

======'''Dissociative imagination'''======
One may come to believe that the characters created for other online users inside their own head, along with their idea of their own online self, live in a different spatial dimension; an online dimension. In supposing that these online components live in a separate space, one may separate online activity and behavior from offline accountability. It can be argued that some treat the Internet and the online realm as a game in which the usual rules of social interaction do not apply, and another set of governing maxims of acceptable behavior reign. &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J., The Online Disinhibition Effect, Vol 7, no. 3, Mary Ann Liebert, Available at: http://www.samblackman.org/Articles/Suler.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in something of a legal grey area, evident in the fact that sentences and articles that would be considered libellous if published in a newspaper or magazine can be delivered to international readers through websites and blogs with little controversy most of the time. In South Korea forty per cent of the population play the game ''Lineage'', and the city of Seoul even has its own ‘cyber crime unit’ which reports at least one hundred real life attacks a month that result from game world interactions alone.&lt;ref&gt;Lister ''et al''. ''New Media: A cultural Introduction'', (2009), (pp.211). Oxen: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

======'''Minimization of authority'''======
One’s offline authority is coded and communicated through various social cues such as modes of dress, body language and position within society in everyday society. Without these social cues of the physical world, one’s authority can be dramatically diminished online in the realm where users feel equally capable and entitled to express their views. Anonymity enables a type of freedom, and this freedom can have obvious personal benefits if the material being generated, shown or shared is transgressive.&lt;ref&gt; Davidson, P. ''The Social Media Reader'', (2012). (pp.132). New York: New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Where fear of punishment may govern someone’s decision to speak their mind in person, these limitations can disappear online where people feel free to disclose the beliefs of their elevated, entitled online identity. As the online realm depends on articulation of text, not necessarily immediately in response to a user but whenever one feels to do so, those who can manipulate language in a sophisticated manner can elevate their own status and authority online by seeming of superior intellect. In this the lines of authority can be blurred online. &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J., The Online Disinhibition Effect, Vol 7, no. 3, Mary Ann Liebert, Available at: http://www.samblackman.org/Articles/Suler.pdf
 &lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyberbullying====

Since the beginning of Social Media, there have been issues with cyberbullying or ‘trolling’ as its also known. The severity of this form of bullying can range from flippant remarks to organised acts of violence and invasion of privacy. Whereas most bullying targets people based on gender, sexuality, race, or class, the ease with which comments can be sent has led to people of all types being subject to online intimidation. Most often, people create new online identities just for the purpose of cyberbullying.  Cyberbullying means sending or posting harmful material or engaging in other forms of social aggression using the Internet or other digital technologies &lt;ref&gt;Willard, Nancy. (2007). ''Cyberbullying and Cyberthreats'' (Champaign: Research Press). &lt;/ref&gt; . This can be done by a single bully or multiple ones, and primarily takes place on social networking sites. It’s also common for people to create fake profiles on online dating sites and to pretend to be someone they’re not, which is referred to as ‘catfishing’. 

Cyberbullying can sometimes be worse than real life bullying, since the bullies usually hide behind the mask of anonymity offered by false online identities. The ability for individuals to cover up their digital trail by using alternate accounts under different guises, often with other IP addresses or personal information other than their own, makes it hard to estimate exactly how much a person can be held accountable for. Furthermore, because of the lack of face-to-face contact, the bully might not know the effects their bullying might have on the victim and thus are unable to realise the gravity of their actions &lt;ref&gt; Storm, Paris &amp; Storm, Robert (2006) ''Adolescents: A Preliminary Assessment'' in ''The Educational Forum'' vol. 70 no. 1 pp. 21-36&lt;/ref&gt;.  Anonymous bulling might have serious consequences. There have been numerous cases in which the victim has even committed suicide as a result of the torment they have faced from an anonymous source. Especially with teenagers, cyberbullying is hard to prevent since the victims usually don’t alert family to the fact that they’re being bullied out of fear that their parents might take extreme precautions to prevent further incidents, such as confiscating their computers and mobile phones &lt;ref&gt; Storm, Paris &amp; Storm, Robert (2006) ''Adolescents: A
Preliminary Assessment'' in ''The Educational Forum'' vol. 70 no. 1 pp. 21-36&lt;/ref&gt;.

One of the most tragic examples of cyberbullying was the case of 13-year old Megan Meier from Missouri. In 2006, Megan started talking to a teenage boy who introduced himself as “Josh Evans“ on the social networking site MySpace. After a few weeks of being in an online relationship the nature of their communication abruptly changed with Josh starting to make insulting comments. Eventually, their correspondence resulted in Megan’s suicide. Months later the true identity of Josh was revealed as being set up by a friend of Megan’s as well as her mother Lori Drew and her colleague Ashley Grills. The federal district court convicting Drew of a misdemeanor violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). The case of Megan Meier pushed forward legislation for the criminalization of cyberbullying. &lt;ref&gt; Ruedy, Matthew C. (2008) &quot;Repercussions of a myspace teen suicide: Should anti-cyberbullying laws be created.&quot;' North Carolina Journal of Law &amp; Technology vol. 9 no. 2 pp. 323&lt;/ref&gt;. The recording of conversations and comments made through social media has been deemed draconian, yet a positive aspect of it is that it can be utilised in cyberbullying investigations to find out the perpetrators of online harassment.

====Online Presence of Catfish====

The term &lt;I&gt;Catfish&lt;/I&gt; has been used to describe someone who is not truthful about their real identity and acts behind an online masquerade, typically in a quest for romance or deception. Identity is hidden by concealing personal details such as appearance, for example through the use of photographs of a different person to represent the self. The popularity of the term was due to the success of &quot;reality thriller&quot; and documentary film [[w:Catfish_(film)|Catfish]], which charted the search for one man's online lover in reality. Fundamentally the show highlighted how easy it is to lie about your true identity via social networking sites, although Catfish mainly focused on the presence of Catfish on Facebook.

====Multiplicity====

Just as one has various roles and identities in everyday life – mother, employer, daughter, sister – so too, one has the flexibility to create multiple roles for themselves online. As social beings adapt their approach to suit whom and what they are interacting with in life, this is also true for the identities we construct of ourselves online, depending on the context in which we are interacting.  We can take our overall self and extract various attributes of ourselves to exaggerate and base an entire identity around – and since we are all more than one attribute we can fashion various versions of ourselves across various outlets within the digital environment.
One can create multiple identities online depending on the medium they are using i.e. a ‘fun loving, youthful and inspired’ blogger discussing music and travel, a sophisticated and insightful Twitter account posing political and moral questions, an informal and honest Facebook account tailoring to a specific, familiar audience of ‘real-life- friends whilst maintaining a perhaps academic website. Many people consciously alter their sentence syntax and way of typing depending on the website and the situation, much in the same way that we tend to speak formally or informally depending on who it is we’re conversing with. Separating these characteristics of one’s self, much like one does with the self and the body in the disembodiment effect, allows one to construct various identity out with the realm of the&quot; one body one self&quot; idea held by in real, mortal society. &lt;ref&gt;NBaym, N. (2010). Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digital Media and Society Series. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Multiplicity has serious implications for the responsibility of users online as some can use their fluid and multiple identities online to behave inappropriately without accountability.&lt;ref&gt;''Online Identity and Kids'', Common Sense Videos, YouTube. Available at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE0B82EwwNc&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Vanasco''' expands on the idea of multiple identities in his work on '''&quot;Meta-identites and identity facets&quot;'''. Vanasco asks the question that if we act differently around separate social circles within our life then shouldn't we be able to do so online? When people talk about internet activity, they generally think about their life online, - not their lives online. People tend to tailor their online identity to the given personality that each SNS tends to give off. As mentioned before Twitter is seen to be sophisticated, while blogs such as Tumbler/Instagram are seen to be more creative and youthful, whereas Facebook which started off with a more preppy personality has since evolved into a more casual all-round site for social media. So, in the end the world of our multiple identities becomes quite complicated, as we are:

 •Sharing different facets of our lives with our friends, our family and our colleagues.
 •Tailoring these facets to the personalities of certain networks.
 •Experiencing '''overlap''' between the facets (And this is where multiple online identities encounters problems)

With the ever-evolving nature of SNS's they are becoming more and more linked with one another. Many social media companies now contain the option to update all of your online profiles all at once and allows people viewing your profile with links to your other social media accounts. This is making things harder than ever before to keep multiple online personalities separate from one another as social networks continue to push for realism in people's accounts.

====The Ubiquity of Identity====

Jonathan Vanasco believes that our online identity is becoming increasingly more omnipresent in everything that we do. Today people have multiple social networking accounts, emails, online gaming profiles, education sites, workplace profiles, music streaming profiles, social calendars like Renkoo and even retailers are now going social like Amazon, eBay etc. People continue to create and accumulate multiple identity facets again and again. It is synonymous with the idea of ''ubiquity'' that our online identity is part of our new found Always-On Culture. People stay constantly connected to social media in order to keep up their image and representation of themselves to the people they allow to see it. This has increased dramatically over the past few years with the integration of smart phones and wireless internet all over the world.

See [[Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/Chapter_3:_Always-on_Culture|Always-On Culture]]'s section on Danah Boyd and Ubiquity for more on this.

===Symbolic Interactionism===

Goffman argues that performers can form their audience’s impression of them consciously, for instance by learning their speech or coordinating their movements in certain ways, however sometimes they might make unconscious moves, such as tripping or forgetting their lines, which are still part of the overall impression of the performer.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1959) The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, New York: Anchor Books&lt;/ref&gt; Goffman’s theory about consciously and unconsciusly given signs can be applied to the online representation of people. Facebook users, for example can manage their friend’s impression of them by selecting the images they upload or the personal data they share. However some information of them can be still given away unintentionally, for instance when they are tagged in pictures or statuses they did not wish to, and it also shapes their self-performance and therefore this is also part of their persona. 

===Chat Rooms and Anonymity===

Statistics show that there are over 1,200 chat rooms on the internet that are easy to enter and are not regulated by a censoring body. &lt;ref&gt;Davidson, W (2012) “Tears and Fears; Help, Advice and Discussion for Victims of Child Sexual Abuse, Sex Trafficking, Date Rape, Internet Predators, Chat Rooms and Paedophiles '', (pp.34-93). London: emp3books&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, people of all ages, genders, races and backgrounds can have access to chat rooms where they can potentially speak to anybody in the world. There are concerns about whether this is safe and healthy and Davidson’s book focuses on the harm and abuse that comes from unprotected communications. The film, [[w:Trust_(2010_film)|“Trust,”]] by David Schwimmer looks into this idea as it focuses on the concern of many parents have that their child will become involved with a dangerous adult who emotionally manipulates them and abuses their trust.    &lt;ref&gt;Schwimmer, D. (2010) “Trust'', USA: Millennium Films &lt;/ref&gt; 

However, writer Rolf McEwan argues that chat rooms actually allow people to be more confident and natural as they don’t feel afraid of rejection from people they don’t know. &lt;ref&gt;McEwan, R (2013) “Chat Room: A Book of Blogs '', (p.23). New York: Create Space Independent Publishing Platform&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst friend groups people can have concerns about rejection if they say or do anything that the others won’t approve of. This theme is explored in the recent television series, [[w:My_Mad_Fat_Diary|My Mad Fat Diary]], which looks at how a girl with mental health issues struggles to be herself in a group of new friends who expect her to behave in a conventional manner. &lt;ref&gt;Kirby, Tim. (2013 and 2014) &quot;My Mad Fat Diary'',. UK: Tiger Aspect Productions&lt;/ref&gt;

McEwan’s argument is that although chat rooms might encourage anti-social behaviour or even false identities due to no accountability, it also gives people the freedom to explore their natural personalities through talking to another person whose opinion or reaction will not have such a problematic consequence to life, and therefore encourages self-conscious people to relax. Because users have the ability to engage in conversations without the other person having preconceptions about them or directly viewing them, they may feel as if there is none of the baggage that is tied to interaction elsewhere. For many, typing can be an easier way for them to get things off their chest, eliminating the unease of speech and giving an opportunity to thoroughly think through a statement or topic before bringing it up.

===Social Networking Sites===

====Promotion of Identity====

The digital domain is increasingly involved in the social dynamics of our lives. Emails, chat rooms and blogging all contribute to new ways of building social networks and provide creative platforms for self-expression. &lt;ref&gt;Van Koten, H. (2009). The Digital Image and the Pleasure Principle: The Consumption of Realism in the Age of Simulation. In Bentkowska-Kafel (Eds.), ''Digital Visual Culture: theory and practice'', (pp.92). Bristol: Intellect&lt;/ref&gt; Social Networking Sites (SNSs) are platforms for socially orientated activity that allow for an introduction of the self via public displays of connection. These public displays of connection are used to authenticate identity and introduce the self through the process of association with social circles. Individual and collective identities are simultaneously presented and promoted. SNSs are sites of self-presentation and identity negotiation. &lt;ref&gt;Papacharissi, Z. (2011) ''A Networked Self: Identity, Community and Culture on Social Network Sites'', (pp.304). Abingdon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook is a prime example of how an SNS can help create and project an online identity. Each Facebook user has a profile page where they can describe themselves, their likes and their hobbies, and narrate their lives. Most users also have a profile picture to help identify themselves. SNSs are unique in combining multiple modes of communication and thus breadth of control over social cues.

Social media use within businesses is growing as a main focus of advertising campaigns. Around 80% of all businesses use, or are planning initiatives to use it &lt;ref&gt;Social Media: What Most Companies Don't Know, by Harvard Business Review, 2011 (http://hbr.org/web/slideshows/social-media-what-most-companies-dont-know/6-slide)&lt;/ref&gt;. Businesses use social media as a marketing tool – not only is it inexpensive, but effective in communicating with your market. Recent studies have shown that one third of adults under 30 now use social media instead of traditional media outlets such as newspapers or television, which means that social media use within a business is important to keep up to date with how people find information. Social media, for a business, can create an identity which is similar to that of the demographic that uses them – with certain demographics generally tending towards a certain social network&lt;ref&gt;Just Who Uses Social Media? A Demographic Breakdown, by Adam Popescu, 2013 (http://mashable.com/2013/04/12/social-media-demographic-breakdown)&lt;/ref&gt;, a business can strengthen their existing market, or create relations with areas outside of it. Social networks also give a platform for businesses to stray away from professionalism – becoming more 'human like', and giving a company a personal feel to it's structure.

We consciously and unconsciously work to define the way we are perceived, hoping to engender a positive impression of ourselves. Impression management entails putting effort into emphasising certain characteristics whilst diminishing or hiding others, and we are able to post information which presents a desired image. It is about presenting a highly selective version of the self. Even the choice of name on your email is an important marker of who we are. As Papacharissi words it, “The process of self-presentation becomes an ever-evolving cycle through which individual identity is presented, compared, adjusted, or defended against a constellation of social, cultural, economic, or political realities.”&lt;ref&gt;Papacharissi, Z. (2011) ''A Networked Self: Identity, Community and Culture on Social Network Sites'', (pp.304). Abingdon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flexibility of the Self====

Many people create multiple SNS pages in order to aid their task of impression management. This multiplicity allows only select audiences to see a certain version of that person, or limits the wider world from being able to make the connection between the two as they wish to keep different parts of their lives and personalities separate. Creating multiple pages has a parallel to how we present different versions of ourselves in face-to-face contexts. Identity scholar Goffman argues that the self plays multiple roles in everyday life and cannot be understood adequately as a single unified entity. The self is flexible and multiple, taking different incarnations in different situations.&lt;ref&gt;Baym, N. (2010) ''Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digital Media and Society Series'', (pp.106). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; Impression management is about the balance of sharing, withholding and distorting information.

Online identity through textual media additionally offers different ways to get noticed compared to the real world and its social constructs. Physically attractive people will get noticed at a party, but articulate, insightful and witty people who know how to spell will get noticed online. Many use their online identity to achieve and satisfy needs they find difficult in the real world. Online identities allow the opportunity to be yourself or to be whoever you want to be. Liu (2007) examined over 127,000 MySpace profiles and revealed that on average user tended to differentiate themselves from friends rather than identifying with friends.&lt;ref&gt;Baym, N. (2010) ''Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digital Media and Society Series'', (pp.111). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-expression and self-promotion on SNSs====

Looking at social networking sites it can be seen that they all work on a similar basis: they connect their users and let them present themselves to one an other in a way they wish. The number of SNS have increased and therefore various sites for various purposes can be found. José Van Dijck argues that users have a need to differentiate between their online personas, for most of them there is a significant difference between what they communicate to their friends and their professional persona that they share with their employers and colleagues. &lt;ref&gt;Van Dijck, J. (2013). ''You have one identity’: performing the self on Facebook and LinkedIn'' in ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'',35(2), 199-215, Doi:{10.1177/0163443712468605}.&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance while Facebook is used mostly for personal interactions, until LinkedIn is for professional networking. According to Jeff Weiner- CEO of LinkedIn- &quot;The key distinction is that as a professional you want people to want to know who you are. People are searching for you or people like you whether you like it or not.” &lt;ref&gt;Lapin, N. (2011.) ''CEO LinkedIn: the forgotten interview''. CBC NetNet, 23 October. Retrieved 04/02, 2014, from http://www.cnbc.com/id/43135238/LinkedIn_CEO_The_Forgotten_Interview&lt;/ref&gt;
Comparing Facebook and LinkedIn it can be seen that impression management –even though in a different way, but- implies to both sites. The users try to develop an ideal image of themselves. However, while Facebook was primarly created for self-expression, rather than self-promotion, LinkedIn mainly concentrates on self-advertising and showing off one’s skills. It has been referred as &quot;Facebook in a suit”. 
By having both Facebook and LinkedIn profiles users can present both their social and professional personas. According to Van Dijck &quot;Many users will try to synchronize their profiles on both sites, even if the interfaces on Facebook and LinkedIn force them to perform different strategies.” &lt;ref&gt;Van Dijck, J. (2013). ''You have one identity’: performing the self on Facebook and LinkedIn'' in ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'',35(2), 199-215, Doi:{10.1177/0163443712468605}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Professional Online Identity====

Professional online identity refers to a persons ideals, experiences, attitudes and beliefs in their professional career when they present themselves on an internet platform. 
The management of professional online identity is taking on a bigger role at the workplace, as employees are increasingly interacting with their professional contacts in online social networks that are personal in nature, such as Twitter or Facebook. This can lead to the collision of professional and personal identities.  
&quot;Online social networks present employees with boundary management and identity negotiation opportunities and challenges. Recent data point to a blurring of the professional and personal domains in online networks, which exacerbates the need for active boundary management.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ollier-Malaterre, A., Rothbard, N.P. and Berg, J.T. 2013 &quot;When Worlds Collide In Cyberspace: How Boundary Work In Online Social Networks Impacts Professional Relationships.&quot; Academy Of Management Review 38.4: 645-669.  &lt;/ref&gt; 
A key feature that differentiates the contact online is that the information available is much less tailored to a particular conversation. In face-to-face and other individualized interactions (e.g. phone calls, emails, text messages) employees can manage the boundary between their professional and personal identities by restricting what and how much of personal information they present to their work contacts over time. And by adapting this disclosure to their particular dyadic relationships in a constant manner. &lt;ref&gt;Collins, R. 1981. On the microfoundations of macrosociology. American Journal of Sociology, 86: 984-1014&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although SMSs limit the flexibility of self-representational behavior, they also &quot;create[s] new opportunity structures to display identity cues and select interaction partners&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Swann, W.B., Jr. 1987. Identity negotiation: Where two roads meet. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53: 1038-1051.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Authenticity====

The development of social networking sites changed the way online identities are formed and presented. The first online identities in social media were in the form of emails and instant messengers where only thing that was required was a nickname. In 2002 Friendster was launched, which pioneered the online connection of real-life friends and was followed by MySpace and other Social Networking Sites, like Facebook in 2004, which promoted Clay Shirky (2003) to come up with the term ‘YASNS’: Yet Another Social Networking Service.&lt;ref&gt;boyd, danah, Ellison, Nicole (2008) ''Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scolarship'' in ''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication&quot;, pp.214-216&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that online identities had to be more authentic, which is why creating a totally new online identity is more difficult. Authentic online identities mean that it has to have the user’s real name, real connections and, increasingly, their actions across cyberspace e.g. posting a Facebook picture via Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;Krotoski, Aleks (2012)&quot;Online identity: is authenticity or anonymity more important?&quot; in theguardian.com&lt;/ref&gt;

 
Yet, with the emergence of Twitter in 2006 and Tumblr in 2007 it is easier to create an online identity that is not real. But most users seem to have their Twitter account in their real name, with the people they know in real life following them. This shows how the emergence of authentic online identities makes people want to keep their online identities connected with their real life ones. Furthermore, with the authentic identities available, users have become more untrusting to non-authentic online identities. Despite this, Social Media like Tinder are popular, which shows that the need for authenticity is not a big enough concern.

====Complications====

The process of self-presentation through SNSs is complicated however. With the combination of a variety of audiences, of variable publicity and privacy settings, the individual must engage in multiple mini performances in order to produce a presentation of the self that makes sense to multiple audiences. In day-to-day life many people have the opinion that others should ‘take them as they are’. However, impression management is very contradictory to this stance as it raises questions concerning whether we genuinely think people should accept us as who we are. If this were the case, then privacy settings and account management would not nearly be as popular as they are.

The internet holds a utopian potential for our relationships and our self expression as it has the potential to bridge divides and create meaningful new connections. However, more often than not, the internet and SNSs are accused of leading people to lie about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Baym, N. (2010) ''Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digital Media and Society Series'', (pp.100). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, just how much of an individual we really are on SNSs is contentious as SNSs engineer self-presentation by providing predetermined sets of categories through which to build identities. It limits the extent to which anyone can call themselves an individual and fully express their identity.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier Jaron Lanier] &lt;ref&gt; Lanier, J.(2011). You Are Not A Gadget. Penguin: London &lt;/ref&gt; said that the most important thing about a technology was how it changed people and warns of the restrictions of being ‘Locked-in’ to a particular technology. There is support for this concern in terms of online identity within social networks from Geert Lovink .&lt;ref&gt;Lovink, G. (2011). “Networks Without A Cause: A Critique of Social Networks”, (p.41). Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that there is little freedom to present yourself in different ways online and social networking sites only offer users a limited choice of presenting their personal and professional information to the world. He goes on to quote critic Zadie Smith who challenges this narrow choice forced on users by Facebook in saying, “What kind of living is this? Step back from your Facebook Wall for a moment:  doesn’t it, suddenly, look a little ridiculous? Your life in this format”. This seems to crystallise Lanier’s point about the problems with being Locked-in to a particular technology:  our online identities, which are a presentation of our lives, are “force-fitted” into a format to enable social networking sites to neatly package users’ information to monetise the content.

====Profile Pictures====

In their book ‘A Networked Self’ &lt;ref&gt;Papacharissi, Z. (2011). A Networked Self: Identity, Community and Culture on Social Network Sites. Oxon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:Zizi_Papacharissi|Papcharissi]] and Mendelson investigate Facebook photo galleries and the connection this has with online identity. The study concludes that individuals knowingly and unknowingly seek to define a positive impression of themselves through the use of SNS, and in particular, using profile pictures. Profile pictures are important as it is the only picture that can be viewed by the majority of users online. It is chosen to covey something about themselves which is generally positive, to the rest of the world. 

The digital age allows for the creation of virtual communities, where social groups interact with one another and observer individual profiles to gain a sense of their personality. Pictures on Facebook express particular values of the person portraying them. Wells &lt;ref&gt; Wells, L. (2000). ''Photography: A critical introduction''. Routledge, London.&lt;/ref&gt; argues , states that photography was previously known for capturing a moment in absolute accuracy, maintaining a faithful and true image of an event. However, as the digital age has intensified with SNS, the use of digital photography allows Impression Management. Therefore, profile pictures are not necessarily a true representation of that person. Individuals can communicate their values, relationships and sociability, in the way they wish the rest of SNS users to perceive them. This entails emphasising and diminishing characteristics of character through editing, creating a perceived persona that may not be accurate. Papacharissi and Mendelson &lt;ref&gt;Papacharissi, Z. (2011). A Networked Self: Identity, Community and Culture on Social Network Sites. Oxon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that the use of profile pictures allows for narcissism, creating a culture of self-absorbed individuals. Although profile pictures are understood as being a representation of individuals to the rest of the SNS community, the use of Impression Management risks people creating a persona of themselves, inferring qualities and perpetuating a deceptive performance to their online audience.

====Security and Privacy in Social Media====

With the reveals in 2013 of the NSA's vast monitoring of international internet traffic including social media&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian (2013): http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files&lt;/ref&gt;, online privacy and security have been highlighted. Having said that, according to Cisco's 2012 Connected World Technology Report, 91% of all those aged 18-30 believe that &quot;the age of privacy is over&quot;. 
Further more, they found that: &quot;...one third of the respondents are[sic] not worried about all the data that is stored and captured about them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;CISCO Connected World Technology Report (2012): http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/enterprise/connected-world-technology-report/ASR_CCWTR_Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These numbers are backed up by similar surveys done by CIFAS, the UK's Fraud Prevention Service, which state:

 - '88% of people who use social networking sites having shared information that could be used to commit identity fraud'
They further back CISCO's numbers by stating: &quot;Furthermore, only 18% of those interviewed said they were concerned about sharing information on or the security risk of social networking sites, 
with 10% sharing information about others that could then be used to assume their identities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;CIFAS:(2014) http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/Identity_fraud_continues_to_rise_with_4_million_victims_in_UK_alone&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems then that, especially with younger generations, we do not worry about our data online. There is almost an attitude of &quot;Who cares? How can it affect me?&quot; amongst those who do not believe that we have any real privacy online. On the one hand, this could be true. In the context of social media, and in this case Facebook, there are over 1 billion users&lt;ref&gt;Statisticbrain (2014): http://www.statisticbrain.com/facebook-statistics/&lt;/ref&gt; and it could at least hypothetically be argued that with that many people's data floating around in that sphere, the chances of you particular data's security and privacy being broken are relatively small merely due to numbers alone. This, however, is only a very small part of the debate around data's privacy as it completely ignores the inherent value of said data - to both you its owner and to Facebook or any company that they may &quot;share&quot; your data with. The current situation regarding social media is akin to a mixture of the concerns raised in both Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and George Orwell’s 1984, as rather pessimistically it could be said that through social media while our attention is often driven away from pressing matters to leisure and unimportant banter we are having a considerable chunk of our online data observed and collated by it at the same time. 

In his book 'Social Media a Critical Introduction' &lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, C. (2014). Social media a critical introduction [California] Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Fuchs argues that Facebook is:
&quot;...a typical manifestation of a stage of capitalism in which the relation of public and private, and labour and play, collapses, and in which this collapse is exploited by capital.&quot;, exploitation being a very apt term for the current policies adopted by Facebook and similar networking sites. Social media agencies have stated that to advertisers, the monetary value of a Facebook member exhibiting loyalty to their brand has ranged from around $118 to $174. The issue of privacy aside, the practice of selling account information to others is arguably dehumanising, as rather than further an individual’s own unique identity it facilitates the ability of businesses to reduce people to mere statistics.

This idea is backed up by Hannah Arendt in her book The Human Condition&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, H. (1958). The human condition. [Chicago]: University Of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, where she states that: &quot;The distinction between the private and the public realms [...] equals the distinction between things that should be shown and things that should not be hidden.&quot;  In the context of Facebook this can be taken multiple ways. Fuchs argues that the main issue of public vs private for Facebook lies in the fact that Facebook has access to and essentially owns all of its users data whereas the users do not have nearly as much access to Facebook's internal workings and its own data. In this context it becomes very much about the equality of privacy measures, where the passage of information from user to supplier is of a much higher volume than that of the supplier to the individual user. When looked at through the prism of Marxist theory, as stated before, it raises issues of exploitation as it is the very data that users are generating that companies like Facebook are making money from. Just as in a factory where the workers are selling their time to create commodities for the factory, the users' are creating data for the company. The major and very important difference lies in the reimbursement of the individual users for their &quot;labour&quot;; which is to say that there is effectively very little of it. The concept of &quot;Free Labour&quot; is one that has risen to the surface in recent years in discussions of online data mining and commodification of users to describe the idea that users are essentially creating the commodity that these companies make their money on (data and information) but are not being paid or reimbursed for it. 

Indeed, the exploitation exhibited by social media providers and especially Facebook have drawn harsh criticism from those who are involved in studying social media. Rory O'Connor, author of &quot;Friends, followers and the future.&quot; stated in an article for Huffington post: &quot;[Social networking services] profit primarily by using heretofore private information it has collected about you to target advertising. And Zuckerberg has repeatedly made sudden, sometimes ill conceived and often poorly communicated policy changes that resulted in once-private personal information becoming instantly and publicly accessible. As a result, once-latent concerns over privacy, power and profit have bubbled up and led both domestic and international regulatory agencies to scrutinize the company more closely ... The high-handed manner in which members' personal information has been treated, the lack of consultation or even communication with them beforehand, Facebook's growing domination of the entire social networking sphere, Zuckerberg's constant and very public declarations of the death of privacy and his seeming imposition of new social norms all feed growing fears that he and Facebook itself simply can not be trusted.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rory O'Connor (2012): http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rory-oconnor/facebook-privacy_b_1426807.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem, then, becomes one of trust. Not only in the media companies, but in your fellow Facebook or social network users. It is not uncommon to hear the phrase &quot;If you didn't want anyone else to see it, you shouldn't have put it online.&quot; in relation to any data that users put online for what is their assumed own private use. The obvious implication being that on the internet, we cannot trust anyone enough to not &quot;leak&quot; our private data provided there is enough incentive. The most extreme example of this are the so called &quot;Revenge porn&quot; sites, but in more day-to-day matters it is all too common to have to ask friends to untag or delete a photo of you that is particularly unflattering on social media. It again raises questions over how much control we actually have over our own data, where it goes and who sees it. After all, a very common chain of events can be a friend posts a picture of you on their timeline, that picture and perhaps the location that it was taken becomes associated with all the other data about you currently held online by the social media provider and is used to target ads at you. All of this happens nearly instantaneously and the only way to really stop it is to stop your friend from posting the picture in the first place.

What this points to is the need for a more active user than the traditionally passive archetype that social media suppliers like Facebook have become used to exploiting for commercial gain - the so called &quot;Prosumer&quot; idea that was first posited by Alvin Toffler in 1980 in his book The Third Wave and then expanded by Bruns to be a &quot;produser&quot; in 2009. Clarke defines a prosumer or produser as: &quot;A prosumer is a consumer who is proactive (e.g. is demanding, and expects interactivity with the producer) and/or a producer as well as a consumer (e.g. one who expects to be able to exploit digital content for mashups).&quot; This proactive consumer is one who is much more likely to demand privacy and security for their data than a passive consumer and this, Clarke says, is likely to push forward a trend of distrust for social media sites and force them to change their privacy and data security policies.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Clarke(2013): http://www.rogerclarke.com/DV/SMTD.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social Networks and advertising====

The terms ''Social network advertising'' or ''Social media targeting'' refer to forms of online advertisement that specifically focus on their presence on social networking sites. Social network advertising involves adverts being tailored to user information gathered from social media profiles. Given the enormous audience size and amount of time regularly spent on social networking sites, companies are increasingly becoming aware of the vast potential lying in SNSs. Consequently, online advertising is experiencing a shift from simply being distributed through websites to efficiently tracking and gathering user behaviour and personal information on SNSs. This enables brands to identify and address their target audience and people that their product might appeal to based on their interests. The fact that this information originates from the customers themselves is very beneficial to companies as personal data can be analysed in detail without having to rely on their own statistical projections. Two strategies used in social network advertising are ''targeted advertising''' and ''customised advertising''.

With ''targeted advertising'', brands aim to shape their product display according to website relevant content or their target group’s interests. While content-targeted advertising is adapted to the particular purpose and content of a website the advert banner is displayed on, targeted advertising tracks the users’ surfing behaviour on the internet. Several websites require users to register with their Facebook accounts in order to later display similar advertising content on the social network site. Through the use of cookies, people can be tracked back to recently visited websites and are therefore likely to be exposed to similar content on other websites. Companies are also able to track whether one of their adverts has been encountered by a particular customer before and are consequently able to avoid exposing the same user to the same advertising multiple times and thus display their advertising with appropriate intervals &lt;ref&gt;Braun, M. (2011). ''Measuring Online Advertising Effectiveness''. Retrieved From: http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/wcai/files/WCAI_Case_Study_Ad_Effectiveness_Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. A look-a-like function enables the detection of Facebook users with similar interests as the one recently accessing a particular website. 

Moving away from simply tracking people’s surfing behaviour via cookies, online advertising has experienced an important shift to placing greater emphasis on using profile information on SNSs to create ''customised advertisements'' &lt;ref&gt;Spyer, N. (2013). ''Taking advantage of targeted advertisements on social media''. Retrieved From: http://www.theguardian.com/salesforce-partner-zone/taking-advantage-of-targeted-advertisements-on-social-media&lt;/ref&gt;. Social network accounts sell valuable information about users’ location, interests and social circles to advertising agencies and companies themselves. Likes and links to external websites further give an idea of potential customers that might be targeted in future. Users receive pre-selected adverts that are believed to be most compatible with their demands and interests (as determined through their account details) and therefore should be more appealing to them. 

However the massive amount of data generated by “real identities“ via social networks is also centre of the growing debate on the implications of the web 3.0&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, R. (2012). ''The dark side of the personalised internet''. Retrieved From: http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2012/02/the-dark-side-to-personalised-internet.html&lt;/ref&gt;. As Joseph Turow suggests “the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your world“ &lt;ref&gt;Turow, J. (2012). ''The daily you: How the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your worth''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; through displaying user customised advertisements on social networks. In this way commodification, capitalist social relations and market forces increasingly engage in and detemine people’s social life by exploiting the fact that to a large extent social interactions are taking place online &lt;ref&gt;Cohen, N. S. (2008). The Valorization of Surveillance: Towards a Political Economy of Facebook. Democratic Communiqué, 22(1).&lt;/ref&gt;. Consequently social networks have to be considered a double-edged sword &lt;ref&gt;van Dijck, J. (2013). The culture of connectivity: A critical history of social media. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. While on the one hand being intensely empowering for its users, the fact that their data is under constant surveillance by data mining and analytics companies such as Daily Me, Medicx Media and Rapleaf can also lead to consumers restisting &lt;ref&gt;White, T., Zahay, D., Thorbjornsen, H. &amp; Shavitt, S. (2008). &quot;Getting too personal: Reactance to highly personalized email solicitations&quot;. Marketing Letters 19(1), 39–50&lt;/ref&gt;. Thereby, the root of the problem is the fact that boundaries between advertising and content shaping the 20th-century media are being blurred through networking sites &lt;ref&gt;Turow, J. (2012). ''The daily you: How the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your worth''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; . However, the significance of personalised advertising does not only make user data a valuable criteria to shape brands after but goes even further. Through “social sorting“ social networks even impact structures of society in allocating people to “target“ or “waste“ &lt;ref&gt;Turow, J. (2012). ''The daily you: How the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your worth''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; groups based on information published on their profiles. Brands can explicitly filter out the users that are most valuable to them in terms of a responsiveness to their product based on their interests, income or other characteristics.  In this way the advertisement that is presented to each individual user is indicating their social position in the eyes of companies, making advertisement become status signals &lt;ref&gt;Turow, J. (2012). ''The daily you: How the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your worth''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Nevertheless, companies have to consider the discrepancy between online and offline identity as so far social sorting processes are simply based on personal information generated on SNSs. Therefore customer profiles only limitedly reflect the “real“ person behind the profile, including their demands of a product. While social media’s functionality provide the tools for people to construct an online identity they are also heavily shaped after the economic purpose of the site. Cohen suggests that due to their design and the normalisation of the sharing culture SNSs can be considered part of an increasing commodification of identity through the influence of corporate interests &lt;ref&gt;Cohen, N. S. (2008). The Valorization of Surveillance: Towards a Political Economy of Facebook. Democratic Communiqué, 22(1).&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Reputation Systems and SNS====

Reputation systems rank the users of a website based on criteria such as number of posts or trustworthiness regarding online monetary transactions. They are often utilized on places of online commerce such as Amazon or eBay, however they are becoming an increased presence on social media where the more Facebook likes or re-tweets a post gets, the more people see it. This is a new communicative concept since human beings do not usually quantify popularity in their day to day lives and it establishes a sort of hierarchy of thought where originality, creativity, and wit are some of the more valuable traits. And while it's arguably a better use of cognitive surplus than mindless consumption, rarely do these reputation systems seem to carry any real purpose or meaning.

====Location-based Real-time Dating====

Other than the popular online social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter which can be used for dating interface, there are now a series of mobile applications that act as not only a social media platform but combine that with online dating. These apps are known as location-based real-time dating (LBRTD) apps and are massively popular within current society. An example of these is [[w:Grindr|Grindr]], a dating app that allows homosexuals to find other single people within a close proximity to themselves. However, Jeremy Birnholtz has described Grindr as being a virtual place for singles that &quot;creates tension in users’ strategies for self-presentation as they craft positive identities in an environment where identifiability by outsiders may be perceived negatively.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Birnholtz, &quot;Seeing and being seen: Co-situation and impression formation using Grindr, a location-aware gay dating app&quot; 2014, http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/02/06/1461444814521595.full&lt;/ref&gt; The two big players in this field are the popular mobile applications Grindr and Tinder.

=====Grindr=====
As previously mentioned, Grindr is a mobile LBRTD app which is aimed specifically at gay men. There is, like with most social media, a problem with identity theft. There is a limited number of photos that you can have on your profile and therefore, since it requires less information to look as legitimate as Facebook, for example. Due to this, it would seem easier to lie about you identity via the app. However, Grindr are aware of this and have set up a complaint policy with regards to imposters and fake profile. 

{{Quote box|width=700px|align=left|
 |quote  = Users must follow these steps to lodge a complaint:

1. Report the impostor. Tap the gray flag in his profile to report him.

2. Send us your Grindr Account Email Address (or BlackBerry support code). This will help us find your profile.

3. Write your email address on a piece of paper. Send us a clear photo of yourself holding the piece of paper.

4. Send a random photo of yourself. We need to make sure you're the 'real' you.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Report an Impostor or Fake Profile&quot;, 2013 (http://help.grindr.com/hc/en-us/articles/200302264-Report-an-Impostor-or-Fake-Profile)&lt;/ref&gt;}}














Also, due to the fact that there is little room for users to expand their personality beyond their very limiting profile, many people argue that this limits identity. &quot;The design of Grindr provides men little room in their profiles to elucidate upon their personality or interests. This tranching of their identities to just physicality has the effect of reducing them to objects, like the models in advertisements.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Woo, 2013 &quot;Meet Grindr: How One App Changed the Way We Connect&quot; p.133&lt;/ref&gt; This objectification is what has created the stereotype that Grindr is only for gay hook-ups. This lack of real identity within the app has transformed itself to being looked as being purely sexually charged and therefore, Grindr can be described as being an online social network that almost encourages online identities to be separate from offline ones.

=====Tinder=====
[[w:Tinder_(application_software)|Tinder]] is much the same as Grindr, but is aimed at both homosexuals and heterosexuals. It's set up is very similar to that of Grindr, however there are some differences. Tinder's slogan is &quot;Tinder is how people meet. It's like real life, but better.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tinder, 2014 (http://www.gotinder.com/)&lt;/ref&gt; This slogan denotes a few things - firstly, it openly suggests that it is a completely online community as it overtly claims to not be real life, but that it is better. Therefore, this could be actively encouraging users to think of their online selves as being different to their offline selves, and to lose their inhibitions because Tinder and the real world are two separate locations and that the two may never collide. However, this would seem to completely contradict the idea of Tinder, in that it is a dating app that is fundamentally about people meeting and beginning a relationship. 
Another thing about Tinder is that it needs to have access to your Facebook account to allow you to become a user. Therefore it relies on previously available information to function. Using Tinder also means handing over large  amounts of information about your identity to them, and although &quot;Tinder says that they won’t share your private info or activity on Tinder with Facebook or other users, but they’re totally fine with selling it to third-parties and vendors they were work with.  Just know they could be shipping off your sexual preference, desired age in a mate, and conversations had via Tinder’s chat feature, to advertisers and third-parties.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;5 Privacy Tips for Tinder&quot;, by Olivia Campbell, 2013 (http://www.abine.com/blog/2013/5-privacy-tips-for-tinder/)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore Tinder is not as identity friendly as they would have you believe, and users' privacy is not completely contained to the owners of Tinder.

====YouTube and Vlogging====

YouTube is a public video sharing site created in 2005. People of all ages, races and genders use YouTube as a way of forming an online identity. Among entertaining home video clips, and amateur short films, Video Blogging (Vlogging) is one of YouTube’s most popular trends, as it provides a medium to create a publically accessible performance of “the real me”. Hobsbawn sees the current age as defined by a “hunger for a secure identity” (Strangelove,2010). This then highlights the obvious attraction of Vlogging, as a way for any person with a video camera and an internet connection to document their identity and present it for the world to see. Vlogging is one of the rawest forms of media as it is simply people sharing their feelings and experiences with the world, and as Van Koten states while discussing McLuhan’s theories concerning hot and cold media “…when we peel away the layers of media we ultimately end up with human experience”. (Van Koten, 2009) This closeness to human experience and supposed honesty that people put across in Video Blogs (Vlogs) encourages others to use this medium and share their own feeling and experiences in order to feel like an individual within a community. Mendelson and Papacharissi discuss how Carey (1975) “emphasised a ritual view of communication which helps foster community integration through the sharing of common experiences and values” (Mendelson &amp; Papacharissi, 2011). It is true that YouTube is seen as a community and safe place to share these feelings and experiences and the users of YouTube are regularly referred to as the “YouTube Community”. But why do people use this public video forum to share these inner most confessions rather than keeping a physical diary or having real life conversations. Sherry Turkle states in her TED Talks “Connected, but alone?” that “the feeling that ‘no one is listening to me’ makes us want to send time with machines that seem to care about us” (Turkle, 2012). YouTube provides an instant audience of listeners for any user, millions of people can access a Vlog at any one time, the community of an instant audience must surely play a key factor in why people choose to share their life experiences via Vlogs as opposed though real life social interaction. However, Turkle also states that through her research she has discovered that many feel that a feeling or experience is not valid until it is shared through the internet, usually via some form of SNS “I share therefore I am” (Turkle,2012). So, by sharing these personal/confessional videos on YouTube, not only do users receive and instant audience to listen to their feelings as they try to work out their own identity, but they also gain validations of those feelings through the process of sharing. The idea of being part of a community which also validates ones inner most feelings must surely be an appealing one for many, hence the popularity of Vlogs on YouTube. However, the identities presented on YouTube are not necessarily exact representations of how those users behave in their real world lives. Michael Strangelove in his book “Watching YouTube: extraordinary videos by ordinary people” discusses how “There are hundreds of videos online title ‘the real me’ that explore the difference between videographers on-screen persona and their ‘real’ self.” He goes on to give an example of a video made by college student Kevin Wu with the above title, Kevin explains how he is a different person from his videos, “You don’t know me…you don’t really know someone through the internet” (Strangelove, 2010). The construction of an ideal persona on SNS is seen across all mediums; YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr etc. When discussing the formulation of college students photos galleries on Facebook Mendelson and Papacharissi state that we “consciously and unconsciously transform ourselves before the camera, portraying a version of ourselves we wish to be” (Mendelson &amp; Papacharissi,2011). So, while people wish to feel that their feeling are validated and they as themselves are accepted as part of a community, the common case is still that they present an ideal version of themselves and push that forward to be accepted as their true identity, whether is accurately reflects their real world persona or not.

===The Self Discrepancy Theory===

Edward Tory Higgins (1987)  introduced the concept of 'Self-Discrepancy Theory', which can be linked to the idea of the development of and the need for online identities in general. The theory suggests that one's personality is constructed through several different domains. Other than one's actual personality there is a wide range of other 'selfs' that might influence the behavior of this individual, such as the ideal or ought self. &quot;One domain of the self (actual; ideal; ought) and one standpoint on the self (own; significant other) constitute each type of self-state representation. &quot; Any discrepancies between the actual self-concept and the ideal-self states (what the individual hopes to become or aspires to be like) may lead to negative outcomes, such as feelings of disappointment or dissatisfaction with the self and lead to a vulnerable state in which an individual's self-esteem is significantly lowered. On the other hand discrepancies between a self-concept and ought-self states (that is representations of an individual's beliefs about his or her own or a significant other's beliefs about the individual's duties, responsibilities, or obligations) may lead to agitation-related emotions, such as fear or feelings of threat. 
In order to avoid these discrepancies impression management may be used to control how one sees themselves and is seen by others. After all, online identities are manageable representations of the self that can in fact be manipulated to extents, that largely influence impressions. It does not only allow the impression of outsiders to be altered, but also can function in order to clarify one's ideal self image for themselves. Therefore if online identities are managed this way, not only discrepancies may be avoided that may lead to emotional discomfort or agitation-related feelings, however it may also improve one's idea of their ideal self and may encourage them to alter their behaviors in order to change accordingly.

==Belonging==

Many use the opportunity and possibility of an online identity in order to gain or experience a sense of belonging. Every year more people write blogs, participate in online discussions, share information, music and photos, and upload videos. Making things and sharing them online is a process that creates networks, emotional support and significant social bonds.

In an online community one can get a sense of a shared space, experience rituals of shared practices, exchange social support, and the shared identities all contribute to a feeling of community.&lt;ref&gt;Baym, N. (2010). ''Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digial Media and Society Series'', (pp.86). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; Many join groups as already share a social identity such as race, ethnicity or profession.

===Blogging===

Blogging is one way in which a sense of belonging can be and is achieved. Blogging connects people with others who share similar ideas, feelings and topical associations. Research carried out by David Brake revealed that seventy per cent of all blogs are personal blogs.&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011) ''Making is Connecting: The Social Meaning of Creativity'', (pp.104). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; Writing a blog allows you to pursue desires to communicate.

Blogs are not just webpages in the traditional sense; blogging also covers the contemporary social network statuses seen on sites such as Facebook and Twitter. David Gauntlett asked and completed a survey in his book ''Making is Connecting'' on why people use Twitter. The main reasons were so that others can learn and be entertained; in a desire to share thoughts and creative endeavours; to chronicle their existence; self-promotion; contributing to and being part of a community; and for a sense of being heard.&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011) ''Making is Connecting: The Social Meaning of Creativity'', (pp.100). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; This research highlighted the importance of warm social connections, recognition and appreciation. These are aspects that are vital in a community and for a sense of belonging. On blogs where response is desired and encouraged, such as on SNSs, the importance in commenting and discussion is focused around warm social  connections, recognition and appreciation for those who invest significant amounts of time in the creation of online content.&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011) ''Making is Connecting: The Social Meaning of Creativity'', (pp.104). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; A study was also carried out about why people use Facebook. This research revealed that the combination of low effort and social rewards and connections made it worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011) ''Making is Connecting: The Social Meaning of Creativity'', (pp.96). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook only requires simple and momentary inputs, and in return you get to be part of an active social network. This all can lead to a sense of mutual engagement and community, and importantly a sense of belonging via online identity.

The concept of wanting to share one’s ideas has been existent for a very long time. However, it is a difficult thing to get your thoughts and opinions published for the wider world to see. Whether it is a factual informative book or a fictional piece, it is challenging to find a publisher who is willing to accept your work amongst the thousands, if not millions of other submissions. However, the evolution of online blogging has changed this and now people are free to promote and publicise their own writing online and on a very big scale. The online space is so vast, endless and accessible that blogging has opened up the chance for endless publications, which do not require the grueling process of being accepted and selected.

===Citizen Journalism===

This is essentially a form of activity which has stemmed from blogging. The ability to participate in media, particularly news, brings a great sense of importance and belonging. There used to be a 'structured break' between news production and consumption and these lines are now becoming blurred. &lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Henry (2006). Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide. New York: New York University Press. p. 308,&lt;/ref&gt; It has created a new variation of web user, the prosumer. If an individual feels they are contributing, it will undoubtedly confirm that their online presence is of value. The monumental shift from audience consumption to participation or even production means that there is a sense of community within the title of 'citizen journalist'.

Technology has contributed to the rising popularity of gathering and producing news online. Wireless internet and smartphones have allowed individuals in the 'right place at the right time' to become an active participant in journalism. By extension, social media has become a platform for news to travel. The content is read, shared, discussed and debated which would suggest users of networking sites can deliver their news on their own terms. As citizen journalism is not bound by conventional journalistic codes, therein lies opportunity for opinion and discussion. Comments are not only optional, they are encouraged by online news organisations to convey that public opinion is of any importance to issue at hand.

Joy Rosen describes the phenomenon as &quot;the people formerly known as the audience employ the press tools they have in their possession to inform one another&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Jay Rosen (14 July 2008). &quot;A Most Useful Definition of Citizen Journalism&quot;. PressThink &lt;/ref&gt; This user generated content has influenced some historical political movements, such as the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street and many others. This is a form of power that people can seize and use as they see fit, to benefit what is important to the individual and society.

===Performance and Ownership on Facebook===

Our online identity as well as our online presence is a constant performance and battle for ownership. If one studies Facebook, then it is apparent that the content of a person’s profile is heavily manipulated and edited in order to create a certain persona.

Every Facebook page may seem like a boring repeated formula that has no individuality in comparison to the millions of others. However, Facebook does allow people to note what: music, films, t/v programmes, shops, books and concepts they like. A person can also share personal information about their lives, photographs and links to show that they are unique and different from everybody else. 

But, because of technological manipulation, social networks allow people to not show their true, holistic, authentic self-warts and all. Facebook insists that people see a warped and superficial image of identities after they have been carefully manufactured and approved. This behaviour is a result of needing to feel that one’s performance is in line with social conventions and rules of character groups. As a result one’s Facebook page is not entirely owned by them as their submissions are psychologically stimulated by the wider community and what one posts is dictated by the socially accepted principles of one’s given social circle.

In a book by Richard Jenkins about social identities he mentions that social sites on the internet have created a new art of performance relationships and stages for social ideologies. &lt;ref&gt; Jenkins, R (2008) &quot;Social Identities&quot;, (pp.1-64). Oxford: Routledge Publishers &lt;/ref&gt; He argues that people feel conditioned by those who view their online presence and participation and their interactions are based on a need to conform due to the pressures of being witnessed by a large and critical audience.

===Welcome and Unwelcome Responses to Facebook Posts===

Facebook is a forum where people can voice their individuality by posting on their own page and editing their profiles. Because each page belongs to a single person then in a sense the content belongs to them and they have a right to share it regardless of other people’s reactions. However, people on Facebook often get responses to their posts which challenge and cause controversy. This is done by Facebook friends being able to, “like,” a post, commenting on it or uploading entirely new material. Some feel that negative responses are unwelcome because the page is representative of them alone, rendering it a safe, respected and personal space for their online identity. On the other hand, others feel that if you post something on Facebook then you are allowing your Facebook friends to see and subsequently you are inviting their contributions and permitting debate.

===Fan Culture===

Online fan communities have grown rapidly with the development of digital technology and social media websites. Originating from the ‘real life’ social groups that congregated together to share in their common interest, fan groups have only developed a stronger presence online that ever before.

Cultural analyst Myc Wiatrowski, studied online fan communities and observed that; “Fandoms, in the information age, have become a well-connected global village capable of coordinated and immediate worldwide contact”.&lt;ref&gt;Wiatrowski, M. (2011) ''The Dynamics of Fandom: Exploring Fan Communities in Online Spaces'', (pp.1-2) . Paper, Ohio State University&lt;/ref&gt; Highlighting how new technology and media has enabled these ‘fandoms’ to develop and also created a stronger sense of belonging.

That sense of belonging is a large factor in fan participation. Without the implications of face to face interactions users are able to freely interact and bond with other like-minded people and can develop an online identity that they choose. There are many different types of online fan communities; however the fastest growing have surrounded popular texts, films and celebrities. Popular young adult novels such at Twilight are excellent examples of online ‘fandom’, in which the texts are re-interpreted and re-written by fans. The monetisation incentives offered by video hosting sites like YouTube, in addition to ad revenue on fan sites, also appear to be actively encouraging the creation of new fan-made product, which in turn acts as free advertising for the media that are the focus of them. The protection of having an online identity and belonging to a large online group allows the fans to share dramatic adaptations they would not normally share in everyday life. Similarly celebrity fans such as ‘The Directioners’ fans of boy band One Direction use their online presence as a ‘protected’ way of contacting the band, with total disinhibition.

===The Need for Online Evidence===

With online culture there is a need to feel like one’s online existence sends a strong message of the self.  Theorist Ainslie McDermott who specialises in the reasoning behind online behaviour suggests that in various arenas people choose to post certain material because they feel it will present a positive or specific image of their lives. &lt;ref&gt; McDermott, A (2012) Clones: How technology has made us all the same, (pp.5-35). &lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, when blogging, some people find it important to show that they are culturally aware whether that is through sharing their awareness of: the news, politics, celebrity culture, science, technology or indeed any subject. McDermott argues that the content of a blog is not just about sharing information, or doing an activity because one enjoys it, but more because there is a need to evidence a certain type of character.
Likewise, with Facebook, McDermott notes that profile pictures and cover photos are chosen to make a statement about what type of person you are. Uploaded photos usually reveal a great deal. Pictures from a night out might suggest that you are fun and outgoing. Pictures of couples suggest that you are lovable and able to sustain a positive relationship. Pictures of somebody on holiday suggest that you are cultured and even possibly rich enough to spend time away. Also the chosen location often says a lot about the person and what they choose to take photos of. Pictures of somebody doing charity work suggests that they are giving and almost implies that they have no time for superficial fun but concentrate on, “what really matters in life,” as McDermott says.

Lastly, who a person follows on Twitter reflects the type of role model they admire or are interested in. People often feel a need to show a connection to the most socially conventional celebrities rather than those who suggest a more independent character that allows a person to branch out of a social clique.   
McDermott’s study deems that behind all the reasoning for online activity, the manner in which people participate and the content in which they link themselves with is an attempt to evidence a strong social belonging.

===Online Gaming===

The gaming world allows the creation of personas through the development of virtual identities. In a multitude of games, online avatars can be customised, from their looks, clothing to their personalities. Players can therefore surpass offline identities, such as gender race and political beliefs; they become someone else, in a virtual world where their real character is hidden. Cultural habits can be expressed online, such as class, as well as a sense of cultural community and belonging. Online gaming has been used by some youth as a means for relieving stress, and can be viewed as a positive outlet for pent-up frustration. Conversely, studies have shown that those with pre-existing conditions play more frequently than others, gaming itself does little to solve the existent problems which have led to the escapism, and these more frequent gamers may be inclined to devote their time to gaming rather than tackle any problems head-on. This can lead to further stress, even more attempts to evade stressful situations, and lead to a vicious circle. &lt;ref&gt;Kuss, D.J. &amp; Griffiths, M.D. (2012). Online gaming addiction in adolescence: A literature review of empirical research. Journal of Behavioural Addiction, 1(1) pp.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the use on online identities is harmless to many users, there is the risk of addiction to online identities in the virtual, gaming world. The online identity of those in the gaming world is uniquely experimental &lt;ref&gt;Marwick, A. (2005). ‘Selling yourself:online identity in the age of a commodified Internet.’&lt;/ref&gt;, with people playing with their personas and personality to become someone they aspire to be, or lead the life they've always dreamed of within the realms of websites and gaming communities.

Online gaming can therefore become an addiction as a direct result of people maintaining the power to control the plot and story of their virtual life for themselves &lt;ref&gt;Clark, N. (2009). ‘Game addiction: the experience and the effect.’ McFarland &amp; Company Inc., North Caroline&lt;/ref&gt;. People step inside a world where they can create situations that wouldn’t happen in the nature of real life&lt;ref&gt;Clark, N. (2009). ‘Game addiction: the experience and the effect.’ McFarland &amp; Company Inc., North Caroline&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, one may feel a sense of disinhibition within their virtual life’s, contradicting their real life social being. One may adopt a life secondary to their reality, enabling them to roleplay as a virtual and highly idealised version of themselves. &lt;ref&gt;Marwick, A. (2005). ‘Selling yourself:online identity in the age of a commodified Internet.’&lt;/ref&gt;. This can be taken a step further, with users encompassing a dissociative imagination.

The rise of Player vs Player (PvP) gaming has led to many gamers, especially within the game itself, having their identity of playing the game above many offline identities, such as race, gender, political or economic viewpoints becoming irrelevant. This use of anonymity within PvP gaming can reduce or challenge the pre-existing concepts of certain offline identities.

===Fashion Industry===
Similarly, the concept of constant technology has further branched out into other major industries across the world influencing fashion as well as culture and social aspects of everyday living. Zeki (2014) describes - in an interview with designer Tuba Ergin - of how the fashion world and technological world are becoming forever more 'harmonised' with each other, as well as how each compliment one another. Designer Ergin, showcased his designs at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Istanbul in 2014, which all included the new addition of circuit cards into each of his fashion garments including dresses and tops, and furthermore onto shoes and bags. Ergin (2014) mentions how each and every one of us now, as members of society, are fully under the influence of the sheer absorption of technology and this then further allows us to create an online identity. He even goes as far to state that &quot;I believe there is almost no difference between drug abuse and technology addiction&quot; [93] Such a statement allows us to see how we have fully established an online identity with our devices and the extent to which can be compared to such a heavily addictive substance such as drugs due to our online presence. In his interview, Ergin then goes on to discuss the developments of our devices that we are forever always using in our everyday lives such as technological glasses as well as watches. Such advances will allow us to grow our identities online even further. However, he then states that technology in the future will lead into clothes that can react to body temperature and the human pulse, such advancements will allow fitness merchandise to rocket, presumably.

===Marketing Industry===
Technological identity has had a massive influence over the business-orientated world. With people constantly being visible and in-corporated in their online world allows large businesses to make thousands of pounds from these users. The more people make themselves aware of being on their phones and technology devices, the more money companies make. Such large organisations such as Facebook allow their adverts to become more expensive and make great amounts of money on their customers simply through their use online being forever dominant in their world. Cookies and other internet bugs allow marketers to track every move we make online and more importantly, how long we are on a certain webpage for and where our mouse is hovering. Most importantly, our traits and how our personalities can be translated onto our online web activity.  Such details allow them to store great information on the everyday user and can show the extent to how intense the everyday person is identified and present online. Therefore, it is clear that marketers are cashing in on ourselves having a constant online visibility.

==Blended Identities==

Although the concept of blended identity has its roots in the field of social psychology, it has been appropriated by media theorists in recent years to describe a specific two-part process of identity creation which has been observed online everywhere from fan forums to dating websites &lt;ref&gt;Nolan, M. &amp; Rubenstein, K. (2009). ''Blended identification and its psychological consequences''. Retrieved 02/04/2014, from http://press.anu.edu.au/hrj/2009_01/mobile_devices/ch03s02.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Firstly, a user will create an online persona which blends various elements of their offline identity together with aspects of the online group or environment they have chosen to join. Secondly, when the user meets a person they originally met online in an offline setting; aspects of their online persona will filter back into their offline identity&lt;ref&gt;Baker, A. J. (2009). Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans. ''Identity In The Information Society'', 2(1), 7-21. Doi: 10.1007/s12394-009-0015-5&lt;/ref&gt;.  

For many people, there are both positive and negative implications of blending their online and offline identities. On the positive front, blended identities can provide certain people with opportunities to express themselves in ways which they could not do in the offline world. For example, Natilene Bowker and Keith Tuffin believe that the amount of control that an individual can exert over their online identity can allow people with disabilities to cultivate a sense of identity, free from the constraints of the social stigmas that they face in the offline world. So, by taking certain aspects of their offline identities and blending them with an online world which “removes the ocularcentrism governing the way people interpret and evaluate others”, they can be judged in terms of their character rather than in terms of their particular disability&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, N. &amp; Tuffin, K. (2002). Disability Discourses for Online Identities, ''Disability &amp; Society'', 17(3), 327-344, Doi: 10.1080/09687590220139883&lt;/ref&gt;. 

However, on the negative front, the temptation for people to create idealised personas online means that the blending of identities can cause delusional behaviour to spill back over into their offline identities. As a person becomes more absorbed in their online identity and accustomed to the control that they have over it in terms of impression management, it can become more preferable for them to believe that it more accurately reflects who they are than their offline identity does. This can potentially cause tension and distress when they are forced to interact with people – friends and family members, for example - in an offline environment who are unaware of their online identities. 

===Blended Identities In Fan Communities===

Andrea J. Baker explores these ideas in relation to online fan culture her journal article: Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans. Over a two year period, Baker studied members of various online fan forums for The Rolling Stones in both online and offline situations, in order to see how their online identities were constructed and how this influenced their offline identities. She found that the presentation of an online persona has three aspects: the username, the avatar and the manner in which the individual identifies with the object of their fandom&lt;ref&gt;Baker, A. J. (2009). Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans. ''Identity In The Information Society'', 2(1), 7-21. Doi: 10.1007/s12394-009-0015-5&lt;/ref&gt;. 

====Study Findings====

Usernames typically reflected a users need to closely identify with the object of their fandom. Many users chose to name themselves after a song, a lyric or a nickname of one of the band members. Aside from this, users seemed to appreciate creativity in regards to username selection. While avatars can perform the same general purpose as a username, their primary function tended to be as pictorial indicators of status within the forum, as those who posted regularly often became identified by their avatar rather than the content of their usernames. Finally, all users were identified according to which member of the band they aligned themselves with. This was perhaps the most important factor, as it heavily influenced both username and avatar selection, as well as providing a limited insight into users’ character preferences. For example, users who identified with Mick Jagger tended to view him as being responsible and concerned. On the other hand, fans of Keith Richards saw Mick Jagger as being cold and controlling&lt;ref&gt;Baker, A. J. (2009). Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans. ''Identity In The Information Society'', 2(1), 7-21. Doi: 10.1007/s12394-009-0015-5&lt;/ref&gt;.  

When Baker met the users she had been studying in an offline environment, she found that their online identities had profoundly influenced their offline identities; particularly in regards to behaviour.  It was noted that both online and offline, men generally try to identify with the band members by showing a deep interest in the music. For example, many male fans obsessively collected obscure recordings from live shows or old demo tapes and spend a large amount of time discussing the guitar playing of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood online. Conversely, women were generally more focused on trying to bond with the band members. Baker gives one example of a female fan who insisted that she was the wife of guitarist, Ronnie Wood, both online and offline&lt;ref&gt;Baker, A. J. (2009). Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans. ''Identity In The Information Society'', 2(1), 7-21. Doi: 10.1007/s12394-009-0015-5&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Secondly, those with particularly memorable usernames were often referred to by their online username in offline environments. Additionally, the online forum of which a fan was a member appeared to influence the way they dressed. Members of the Shattered forum dressed in bright green t-shirts that they made themselves, whereas fans from other groups tried to avoid wearing any clothes that would obviously mark them as fans of the group. Interestingly, those who had actually met the band before tended to fall into the latter group rather than the former. However, the most divisive issue was the extent to which users chose to embrace their role as fans in an offline environment. While some users were happy to display overtly ‘fan-like’ behaviour in public, others were embarrassed to admit to people – especially family – that they were members of an online fan forum&lt;ref&gt;Baker, A. J. (2009). Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans. ''Identity In The Information Society'', 2(1), 7-21. Doi: 10.1007/s12394-009-0015-5&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Concerns====

Although Baker eventually concluded that more research into the effects of online identities on offline behaviour was needed, her study raises some interesting and concerning points about blended identities. It seems to be the case that the online aspects of a blended identity come to overshadow the offline ones. In the context of Baker’s study, this can be seen by the fact that forum users almost always came to be recognised by their usernames and avatars rather than by any particular aspect of their offline identities. Also, the forum community seemed more likely to judge a user’s character based upon the pre-existing stereotypes surrounding their favourite member of The Rolling Stones than by actually getting to know them.  Consequently, many users - especially those who did not post frequently - could find themselves being characterised by mass generalisations and the superficial features of their online identities.

The impact of becoming immersed in this type environment was apparent in the behaviour that filtered back into users’ offline identities. Many seemed to feel that it was necessary for them to act out their online identities in the offline world in order to feel like they were still part of the fan community.  People such as the woman who believed she was Ronnie Woods’ wife seemed to have had their offline identities subsumed by the sometimes bizarre online personas they had made for themselves. Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, some people felt the need to hide any trace of their online identities and emphasize their offline identities for fear of being ridiculed by those outside the fan community. Therefore, it seems that although blending identities is a seemingly necessary part of being in an online community, people run the risk of losing their sense of self as they struggle to find the right balance between online and offline identities.

===Blended Identities in Online Dating===

Online dating is a good example of blending identity as often it involves both online and offline interaction. The idea is that the online and offline identities are to be similarly constructed, if not appear the same. One user is effectively judging another based on their profile page (which usually includes at least one photograph of themselves plus listed personality traits) contained on the dating website they are both using. Should one person find that they admire another's page, they may wish to contact them via a messaging service within the website or through an e-mail address or phone number visible on their profile page.

The intention of online dating is to seek out a potential partner, so should two users think that each other has potential they may wish to meet in a different social context i.e. offline (in the 'real world'). What the user generally hopes for is that the offline identity of their 'date' matches that of the online; for example, not to turn out to be older than they had represented themselves online, or of a different gender. This differs from fan communities as it is often preferred on dating websites that users display their real name and use a photograph of themselves as their profile picture so as not to mislead potential 'dates'.

===Multiple Identities===

The concept of multiple identities started with the first internet generation itself, looking back as far as the Cold War. In early internet culture there was a great desire to create a new self, whether it was simply create a unique username or creating a whole new persona. Forums and bulletin boards were popular outlets for people choosing to adopt a new persona in the early years of cyber culture.  Despite the adoption of nicknames and personas, there was still a strong personal connection and arguably a greater responsibility tied to the posts made. Services such as Usenet often had more in common with our modern SNSs, in the sense that many users went by their full name in addition to listing rather personal details such as their alma mater or even their home address (this being well before the advent of satnav and Google Maps, of course). 

People began to see computers as an escape from “official reality” says Proffesor of Media Geert Lovink in his critique of social media. He observes people realised they could “design futures, enhance bodies and extend minds.” &lt;ref&gt;Lovink, G. (2011) ''Networks Without a Cause: A Critique of Social Media'', (pp.39). Cambridge: Polity Press &lt;/ref&gt; In the late 80s and early 90s, when what we know today as the internet was still in a relatively embryonic state, many theorists took this idea of bodily enhancement and extension of the mind rather literally; with some raising the possibility of Virtual Reality forming a useful tool in future online communications. Despite perhaps not taking place in the way they had anticipated, their central idea was prescient, namely that the internet would form a means with which to collectively share, compile, edit, expand, and distribute information.

In contrast to popular opinion that social media has only further enforced the notion of multiple identities Lovink suggest Facebook emphasizes a commitment to the “real self”. &lt;ref&gt;Lovink, G. (2011) ''Networks Without a Cause: A Critique of Social Media'', Cambridge: Polity Press (pp.40). &lt;/ref&gt; He observes that this may be due to the feeling of being among friends on Facebook, it seems that Lovink believes the real has prevailed over the fake but also acknowledges this may have restricted our freedom online.  

Surrounding this subject founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg, controversially said: “Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity”. This entirely contradicts the influential beliefs of sociologist Erving Goffman who introduced the idea Dramaturgy, which argues that the elements of human interactions are dependent upon time, place, and audience.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1959) ''The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life'', New York: Anchor Books&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is still widely used in sociology and media studies today.

===Online Identities and Personality Disorders===

In 2002 Dr Adam Joinson put forward the theory that online participation allows people to pursue various forms of characterisation in order to gratify a range of audiences without causing conflict. &lt;ref&gt;Joinson, A. (2002) “Understanding the Psychology of Internet Behaviours: Virtual Worlds, Real Lives'', (pp.145-203). Oxford: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person might have a Facebook page that is suitable for their family and shows them behaving in a responsible and mature way. By on the other hand they may have another closed and private page which reveals a more wild personality which can be accessed by friends. This is done so that the person can explore their multiple personas with freedom, far from the fear of complaint and question.

Dr Joinson also speaks (on page 147) about a blogger called Rae-Rae Darron who has seven different blog sites. The person uses these different blogs to write about: celebrity culture, the concept of popular actors and singers versus talented actors and singers, fashion trends, local politics, the environment, natural science and evolution theories versus religion. Rae-Rae Darron did an interview with the magazine, “Wired,” in 2001 and explained that she had tried to have a blog page which explored all her areas of interest but was told that viewers were bored and unhappy about seeing such a mix and would rather have a page that was dedicated to one subject. Rae-Rae Darron then explained that she felt she could no longer express her holistic and broad personality, but had to box her interests in order to appeal to viewers with different interests and ideals.

In 2010 the incident of Rae-Rae Darron was revisited by psychologist James. F Masterson in a follow on book from his 1990 edition on personality disorders. &lt;ref&gt;Masterson, J.F. (1990 and 2011) “The Search for the Real Self: Unmasking the Personality Disorders of Our Age '', (pp.23-39). London: The Free Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Masterson argues that people have become so intent on making separate zones of performance on the internet that there is a danger of losing the reality of self. If a person spends so much energy into wearing different social masks, then they begin to forget which one is sincere and which one is most dominant or important. By turning away from the right to hold a natural and genuine personality which is constant in its strengths, weaknesses and individuality, then realism no longer exists and honest identities are no longer known resulting in confused personality disorders transferring from the internet into real life.

==Cultural Theories applied to Online Identity==

===Technological Determinism===

Although much of Marshall McLuhan's pioneering research into the subject of media theory was conducted during the early 1960's - a media landscape vastly different from today's - his ideas surrounding Technological Determinism have shaped how we understand media and are still drawn upon by contemporary theorists, such as Hamid van Koten, who applies McLuhan's theoretical frameworks to the subject of Online Identity in his book 'Digital Visual Culture: Theory and Practice'. In ’Understanding the Media: The Extensions of a Man’ McLuhan highlights the unidentified and almost unnoticeable power of technologies to transform and manipulate how one identifies ’the self’. Applying this idea to the subject of Online Identity, one might say that the main issue raised by the idea of a person having a distinct online persona and its importance to how people interact with each other and reflect on themselves is that it isn't fully – or maybe at all – in one’s control. McLuhan raises the question of whether computers extend to the human nervous system, gaining a control over how people perceive and use media without their notice.

===Cultural Determinism===

At the opposite end of the cultural theory spectrum is Raymond Williams, whose ideas on ’Cultural Determinism’, outlined in his book ''Television, Technology and Cultural Form'' have been critical to the formulation of the theory that it is not the medium itself that directly influences the behaviour of individuals, but the pre-existing social and cultural phenomena that were the catalysts for the medium's production. With this in mind, the idea of Online Identities being an integral part of many people's everyday lives can be linked to a user's pre-existing desire for it to exist; perhaps to increase chances of social interactions with others or for individuals to be able to experience life in a way that would be impossible while using their offline identity.

==Theorists==

==== Hamid Van Koten ====
 - ‘The Digital Image and the Pleasure Principle: The Consumption of Realism in the Age of Simulation’ 
Van Koten's main research questions illustrated in this paper come under:

'''·''' What are the forces at work in the production and consumption of digital representations? For example what makes digital gaming so popular?

'''·''' What are the narrative and representational issues involved, and what do these tell us about our culture and ourselves?

Specifically the paper seeks to uncover two themes: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative Narrative] and Realism as the dominant form of digital representations in terms of production, and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan Lacanian] shift from the real to the imaginary as the dominant drive towards the consumption of these representations.

In his paper Von Koten argues that video games act as an outlet for forces within the collective subconscious, allowing what Jung called the animus and anima breathing space. Quite simply put, it provides an outlet for desires that we may be unable to realise or satisfy within the confines of “real life”. It could be said that the same is applicable to the internet and social media as a whole. In many cases this can be beneficial, as seen in the benevolence with which people help out or donate to causes that may be hundreds of miles away from them. On the other hand, some may use their online ability and the relative anonymity often comes with it for less-than-positive purposes, such as committing crimes or harassing other users.

Additionally, van Koten cites the work of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gerbner George Gerbner].

==== George Gerbner ====
Van Koten refers to a longitudinal study of television conducted by [[w:George_Gerbner|George Gerbner]] over the space of almost 30 years. Through his research he found that people's perceptions of their world are affected by their television viewing habits. e.g. those who were found to watch a large amount to television each week tended to view the world as a more violent place than it really was.

Gerbner supports the theory that film and television representations of gender, ethnic minority and power relationships are important factors for the construction and maintenance of a social identity in real life, and the same could be said about our construction of online identity. Hence, to a certain extent people model their personal and online personae on what they see portrayed to them through the media. However the counter argument to this is that what is portrayed in the media is constructed from pre-existent social values, attitudes and beliefs.

==== Jonathan Vanasco ====
 - 'Meta-Identities and Identity Facets'
Jonathan Vanasco delves into the idea of how within life people display different personas within separate social circles of their lives, whether it be with  their friends, family or colleagues. Vanasco argues that this is then reflected through our multiple online identities that we create e.g. using separate email addresses for different content (private, work, education etc). The same can be applicable when people use different SMSs in different ways while conforming to the conventions of that particular site (Facebook - professional, Instagram - creative, Snapchat - quirky). A detailed explanation of Vanasco's work can be found here -[http://www.destructuring.net/IdentityResearch/Essays/2007_11/01/2007-11-01--II_theory.html#id2 Vanasco's Theory]

===Jaron Lanier===

[[w:Jaron_Lanier|Jaron Lanier]] is important when looking at online identity. He was one of the original digital pioneers, however he is not a “leading-edge techno-enthusiast.”&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011). ''Making Is Connecting: The Social Meaning of Creativity'', (pp.194). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''You Are Not A Gadget'' he discusses his worry about the particular ways in which the Web, in particular focusing on Facebook, has developed and what this means for online creativity and self-expression.

He argues that the HTML messy homepages of the 1990s were better than the ‘improvement’ of Facebook (where the result is nice neat sets of boxes of pictures and information.) He puts individual creativity and self-expression above all else, and therefore concludes that the diverse, handcrafted personal pages were much more preferable than “formulaic, template-driven expressions of identity pushed by Facebook.”&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011). ''Making Is Connecting: The Social Meaning of Creativity'', (pp.195). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt;  It did not matter that they were messy, had unexpected tones or lacked uniformity - it was their idiosyncratic nature that lent them a distinctly human touch, in strong contrast to the inflexible and sterile pages preferred by major modern SNSs.

Lanier argues that we should always be willing to spend a bit of time making personal representations of our identity and that we cannot allow ourselves to be reduced to a template. One of his key concerns is that digital systems reduce everything to simple bits of information so that they can be processed.&lt;ref&gt;Lanier, J. (2011). ''You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto'', (pp.68). London: Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; He warns that when we reduce our humanity to fit the requirements of a machine we lose something of ourselves. He argues that whilst the uniform nature of Facebook profiles keep things simple and predictable, human beings are worth cherishing because of their distinctive and individual natures- not because they are simple and predictable.&lt;ref&gt;Lanier, J. (2011). ''You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto'', (pp.5). London: Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; He further argues that Web 2.0 reduces individual creativity to general ‘mush’, causing a dilution and silence of individual voice in the name of collaboration.

===Marshall McLuhan===

[[w:Marshall_McLuhan|Marshall McLuhan]] is a key theorist in the subject of digital media and his main ideas derive from technological determinism. He once said that “the medium is the message”, a phrase which epitomises his approach towards technologies and their influence on society. McLuhan believed that all media is an extension of the human body that cause deep and lasting changes to his environment, describing this extension as being an &quot;amplification of an organ&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Marshall McLuhan Playboy Interview, 1969&quot; by Phillip Rogaway http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/188/spring07/mcluhan.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; This can be applied to online identity as our online selves can be seen as an extension of our current identities. Therefore, McLuhan's theory of technological determinism can be argued as being applicable to the concept of online identity. McLuhan also introduced the idea of Hot and Cold Media, with Hot media referring to that which involves a low level of participation (such as radio and cinema) and Cool media involving high participation (daily conversations, TV, phone services). However, due to continuous media convergence this becomes harder to apply to the internet and its related services.

===Zizi Papacharissi===

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizi_Papacharissi Zizi Papacharissi] is an academic whose work on online identity covers areas including communication technology and communication theory. Papacharissi is currently a Professor and Head of the Department of Communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Her work focuses on 'the social and political consequences of new media technologies'. 

Her work on the book 'A Networked Self' saw an investigation into the comparititive links between Facebook photo galleries and the user's online identities. The findings show that participants both knowingly and unknowingly seek to define and refine a positive view of themselves through impression management, done through the constant updating of SNS and profile pictures. '''See Profile Pictures Below for more information.'''

===JJ Wright===

JJ Wright, interested in the effects that online activity can have on a person’s identity, asks whether “the field of cyberspace/online activity is complicating or simplifying identity and communications&quot;? He of course answers “both” as online presence has both a complicating and simplifying effect on human identity.
He argues that back in the day, before the global village, in a time without modern technology and without the web which holds our precious social networking sites, identity was easily defined via the physical traits that a person held. 
•	Gender
•	Race
•	Ethnicity
•	Age
•	Weight. These traits which individuals had in common with one another collectively came together to create shared identities. Now however, people are more concentred with individual identity and with complete access to an online world, which offers an endless amount of possibilities when it comes to changing one’s self, it is much easier for people to control their individual identity’s and keep on top of them as they filter what others may see about them online. 

While it is very common for individuals to often dabble a little in altering or changing ones online identity, like those of whom gender swap when using online realities such as Second Life or playing online games such World of Warcraft (WOW), on the whole it is thought that individuals tend to rather be more open about themselves, in a sense becoming public online, than they would be offline. 
The reason for this is that there is a lower risk of negative reaction when socialising or sharing things about yourself online. Individuals may also experience less judgment online of their real characteristics such as race, religion or age, and so in turn be more inclined to share things about their identity which have no relevance to their physical characteristics and thus improving or building on their ''“project of self”.''

A persons ''“project of self”'' is essentially ones on going and changing identity. JJ Wright argues that we take our offline identities to online and our online ones to offline which of course all add to our ''&quot;project of self&quot;''. For JJ Wright, all the internet does is offers us the chance to break down the barriers which may prevent us from interaction in the real world and become the internet makes this possible it means that people can play with their identities in a way which may have no real negative impact on their offline life’s. The internet then offers a sphere for interaction without judgment of physical characteristics which may have prevented face to face communication. &lt;ref&gt; http://g.virbcdn.com/_f/files/46/FileItem-266593-EvolutionTrendsPresentPaper.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of an 'always-on' culture is that we are constantly connected and networked, even when we are not physically using our phones or computers. We are &quot;tethered&quot; to the technology we consume; technology has become a part of us that we cannot escape from.

In an 'always-on' culture, we think of the implied blurring of the lines between our public and private lives. There can be an inability to escape the need to check social media platforms or the internet in general, even in situations when it could be considered rude or inappropriate. Some people have developed a need to incessantly, and compulsively, be contactable due to this culture. Snapping that connection can result in anxiety among other negative side effects consistent with an addict going through withdrawal. Other negative effects can come from our growing connection including online dis-inhibition, reduced social context cues, privacy issues, and other factors. However, we can't always turn ourselves 'off'. Everyday life is saturated with technology and media and the benefits it brings. The value of instant communication and the wealth of information are just two of many reasons that our culture's direction isn't necessarily a wrong one. 

Voices from theorists including danah boyd, Sherry Turkle, Leslie Perlow, and Naomi Baron become significant when discussing 'always-on' culture. Their ideas provide a foundation for analysing technology and media's place in our culture and how our daily lives have changed living in an 'always-on' culture.

==Main Concepts==
=== 'Always-On' ===



The term 'always-on' is used to refer to the way modern technology (mobile phones, computers, etc.) continuously keeps people connected to each other through the Internet, and therefore always accessible. Sherry Turkle, a prominent theorist who's work analyzes our relationship with technology, suggests that people have become so tethered with their 'always-on' communication devices that the self has become attached to the devices so much that life can be represented by the digital screens we keep in our pockets&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. E. (2008). Handbook of mobile communication studies. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press. Sherry Turkle, 'Always-on/Always-on-you: The tethered Self'&lt;/ref&gt;.

Others theorists, such as danah boyd, have a more positive perspective. They claim that the online world is always just around the corner, and that the online world does not necessarily have to be a bad thing. boyd says that most people are 'always-on' without technology being the center of the activity and that &quot;there is no longer about on or off. It's about living in a world where being networked to people and information wherever and whenever you need it is just assumed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mandiberg, M. (2012). The social media reader. New York: New York University Press. danah boyd, pp.71--76&lt;/ref&gt;. If people in some way are connected to the network, through a mobile phone, a computer, gaming console etc., they are considered to be 'always-on.' However, this constant connection does not mean that users must always pay attention to that connection.

While boyd makes a valid point to say that our online lives are as ‘real’ as our offline lives, more could be said about the significant difference between these two aspects of our lives, in particular how we behave online versus how we behave offline. Suler makes the point that when we communicate online, our input comes after some delay, perhaps minutes, hours or even days, and this affects what we say, in text form, and how we say it&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), pp. 184--188&lt;/ref&gt;. Importantly, he asserts that when we communicate face-to-face with others, “moment-by-moment responses between people powerfully shapes the ongoing flow of self-disclosure, usually in the direction of conforming to social norms”&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;. If this is the case and an increasing amount of our time is spent online, this could perhaps leave some people struggling with the face-to-face social skills necessary to fit in to a particular environment. Such as that of an organisation with a clear expectation of cultural behaviour, or to succeed in particular roles where face-to-face interaction with people is necessary.

==='Always-On': The Different Means of Getting Connected===


Being ‘always-on’, according to danah boyd, means taking into account both technical networks and social networks. When we cannot connect to the technical network we can often feel frustrated, angry, or worried that we can’t get access to a particular piece of information, or that our productivity will fall, or we can’t make a particular social connection at that precise point in time &lt;ref&gt; boyd, d. (2012). 'Participating Always-On Lifestyle' from Michael Mandiberg (ed.) The Social Media Reader, New York University Press,p.71-76 &lt;/ref&gt;. This section looks briefly at the how the internet developed and the legacy issues from that development, the technical network today and how each part has advantages and disadvantages.

===The Mobile Device===

Recent advancements in general technology have affronted media in such a way that it is now more accessible to people than ever. The developments in the mobile phone as a device have been testament to this, as within the past 10 years more and more technology has been added to the mobile device itself allowing more functions to be used. The mobile phone is no longer just a phone - cameras to film and photograph, games, app storage, social media, email, GPS capabilities, information storage etc, and quite importantly, mobile internet access - creating a handheld computer. The concept of being able to connect to the Internet wirelessly on such a portable level is an important and pivotal factor in regards to this 'always-on' culture.

'''The Smart Phone'''

The invention of the smartphone has been quite possibly the most important development in terms of thinking about this 'always-on' culture. It is these devices to which theorists refer to when discussing how we are connected and 'tethered' and are responsible for the ability to stay connected to various medias as mobile phones have been developed to do more than just facilitate calls. 

'''The Tablet'''

Recently, tablet devices have been growing in popularity, combining the portability of the smartphone and the larger screen of a laptop.

====Origins of the Internet and its Legacy====

The Internet’s origin began in the 1960s with a network created by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency Advanced Research Projects Agency] which was part of the US Defense department. It was called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET ARPANET] and was originally designed to connect universities and laboratories &lt;ref&gt; IEEE. (2014). The Fathers of the Internet Retrieved 03/27 2014, from http://theinstitute.ieee.org/people/achievements/the-fathers-of-the-internet &lt;/ref&gt;. Many other networks were subsequently created in different organizations and  countries, but the networks themselves could not effectively interconnect (BBC, 2012).

====Future Direction====
The advance towards true 'always-on' connectivity globally, and in particular wireless connectivity, has recently been the subject of intent from two of the world's largest technology companies: Google and Facebook. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg], CEO of Facebook, announced that he has plans to expand the boundaries of the Internet to ensure every person in the globe has affordable, basic access to internet services. He expects to do so through the use of wireless drones, satellites, and lasers, thus creating a fully 'always-on' world &lt;ref&gt; Pimentel, B. (2014).

===Participants in an 'Always-On' Culture===

====Youth: Unplugged====

[[File:Japanese teenager with her mobile phone.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese teenager with her mobile phone|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=A]]

One of the most obvious and commonly considered victims of an 'always-on' culture are the younger generations, always on their phone or with multiple social media profiles online that need constant attention. This links back to the idea of their [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/Chapter_2:_Online_Identity#Social_Networking_Sites Online Identity].

Retrieved from http://vimeo.com/86023743 &lt;/ref&gt; Ten years ago, a twelve-year-old would never have had a mobile phone, let alone using several social media platforms such as Facebook or YouTube. Now, twelve-year-olds have the latest mobile phone and can likely work it better than their parents. Unplugging a young adult evokes feelings similar to an addict going through withdrawal and depression. &lt;ref&gt; Alleyne, R. (2011) The young generation are addicted to mobile phones. Retrieved from http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/8458786/The-young-generation-are-addicted-to-mobile-phones.html &lt;/ref&gt; Unplugging oneself is not as easy as turning off a phone.

=====Unplugged: The Study===== 

A 2010 study had 200 University of Maryland (USA) students go without all forms of media, including non-technological media, for 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Moeller, S. D. (2010). A Day Without Media | Research conducted by ICMPA and students at the Phillip Merrill College of Journalism, University of Maryland, College Park, USA. Retrieved from http://withoutmedia.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; After 24 hours, students logged onto class blogs and reported their successes, or, in many cases, failures. The results of the study were definitive: mobile technology not only changed students' relationships with the news and access to information but also had a profound impact on their relationships with friends and family. The study concludes that constant connection to media has caused students to make different social and moral decisions with their 24 hours than if they had spent the day surrounded by their average collection of media outlets (withoutmedia, 2010). 

Severing the students' tether to technology created feelings similar to those of an addict going through depression and separation anxiety. Some students claimed that they had feelings similar to &quot;[http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/87/1/107.long phantom limb pain]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nikolajsen, L., &amp; Jensen, T. S. (2001). Phantom limb pain. Retrieved from http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/87/1/107.long&lt;/ref&gt; experienced often by disabled war veterans. Students found themselves twitching towards their iPods or feeling their back pockets for their phone before realizing they were doing it. After physically removing themselves from technology and media, they found that they couldn't mentally separate from it. Media dependency had become a habit. A student participant from the study said the following:
{{quotation |“A few hours later, I brushed my teeth, came back to my room, opened my laptop, and got on Facebook.

Media dependency | A Day Without Media. Retrieved from http://withoutmedia.wordpress.com/study-conclusions/dependence/&lt;/ref&gt; }}

A question remains - do those in an 'always-on' culture live a richer life or those who remain disconnected? A few voices from the study say that &quot;I believe that those who are not tied to this system are missing something... they are missing information.” (withoutmedia, 2010). Information itself is a commodity that people collect, trade, and put value in. Those who have a constant connection to media possess more information than others and therefore become &quot;richer&quot;. Without certain information or internet access the world becomes much smaller. It could take several weeks to learn about the [http://edition.cnn.com/2014/04/01/world/americas/chile-earthquake/ 8.2 magnitude earthquake that struck Chile] April 2nd, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, D., &amp; Ahmed, S.

Internet is out, as is television and newspapers. Face-to-face would remain the most reliable transfer of information but the earthquake news would be dated and limited to those who physically heard it from the source. One student commented that, “Those who aren't connected through media probably have no idea about certain things going on in the world,” (withoutmedia, 2010).

===Part of 'The Network'===
boyd talks of 'the network'; the particular platform (out of thousands available) online users utilize to connect with people who have similar interests and aspirations, in order to achieve a common goal/objective&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead of 'tethering' being an addiction, it is instead a practical evolutionary step building upon humanity's natural social requirements and curiosity&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;. Most of our networks are personalized, and we only interact with those we wish to interact with (the exceptions being trolls and hackers)&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;. This means that people wish to be 'always-on' in order to continuously develop and progress - as interaction with like-minded individuals can further our own ends and development&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;:

:''&quot;Many who blog and tweet are not writing for the world at large; they are writing for the small group who might find it relevant and meaningful. And, realistically, the world at large is not reading the details of their lives. Instead, they are taking advantage of the affordances of these technologies to connect with others in a way that they feel is appropriate&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier Jaron Lanier] calls the 'network' the 'tribe':

:''&quot;The central mistake of recent digital culture is to chop up a network of individuals so finely that you end up with mush. You then start to care about the abstraction of the network more than the real people who are networked, even though the network by itself is meaningless. [...] The members of the tribe are my lifelong friends, my mentors, my students, my colleagues and my fellow travelers.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Lanier, J. (2010) 'You Are Not A Gadget', London: Penguin Books Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;.

Lanier talks here about the different groups of people that participate in this 'always-on' culture. A common thought is that the majority of this network are teenagers: 

:''&quot;So immersed were these young people in their social networks that the idea of being unavailable, even for an instant, was unimaginable.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt; Gots, J. (2012). Switching Off an &quot;Always-On&quot; Culture. Retrieved from think-tank/switching-off-an-always-on-culture &lt;/ref&gt;

This idea of teens being totally involved in the network is a popular one, however, as Lanier stated above, they are not the only people. More and more workplaces expect their employees to be 'always-on', to be part of the network with their other colleagues in order to work to their full potential. In order for them to achieve this, they have to be networked to each other, it will get their work done in a much more timely and efficient manner. 

It is with these opinions that being 'always-on' is viewed as a positive measure, as realistically humans do not have the capacity to be 'always-on' to everything the internet has to offer. Thus we restrict what we are 'always-on' to - to things that solely benefit us&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite this perceived restriction on the 'network', Fowler &amp; Christakis note that increased involvement within a network (particularly one based around social media) yields positive benefits to the individual through ''situational inequality'' and ''positional inequality''. Using the example of loneliness, on average people are lonely for 48 days of the year, but for every extra friend within an individual's 'network' the number of lonely days per year is judged to decrease by almost two days&lt;ref&gt;Christakis, N. and Fowler, J. (2011) 'Connected - The Amazing Power of Social networks and How They Shape Our Lives', London: Harper Press&lt;/ref&gt;. This is an example of ''positional inequality'' positively effecting an individual in the form of ''situational inequality'', demonstrating boyd's notion that being 'always-on' to the 'network' yields positive results.       

However, views on the concept differ, with even initial supporters highlighting negative issues resulting from being 'always-on'. It can be argued that Fowler &amp; Christakis' view shows that instead of willingly being 'always-on' to the 'network', individuals are coerced into participation out of fear of the adverse consequences associated with being disconnected - ''&quot;loneliness [...] a cause and a consequence of becoming disconnected&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Christakis, N. and Fowler, J. (2011) 'Connected - The Amazing Power of Social networks and How They Shape Our Lives', London: Harper Press&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, in a study by Eastin and LaRose&lt;ref&gt;Eastin, M. and LaRose, R. (2000) 'Internet Self-Efficacy and the Psychology of the Digital Divide' in Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication&lt;/ref&gt; , it was observed that there was a spike in levels of depression among individuals who experience 'Internet Stress', such as being unable to establish a a solid connection. The impact is decidedly negative, and could raise the argument that the 'always-on' culture has caused an overall increase in anxiety and depression by its ability to give more chances for people to experience this form of 'Internet Stress'. It has also been noted that 'always-on' culture could eventually develop into a component of the 'locked in' theory, forcing humans to rely even more greatly on technology, even for simple social contact&lt;ref&gt;Lanier, J. (2010) 'You Are Not A Gadget', London: Penguin Books Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to these theories, because individual's are forced to utilize the 'network' during their free time (due to job and family commitments), it has also been noted that being 'always-on' increases anxiety levels and is a large contributor to disrupted sleeping patterns&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;. From this it has been identified that 'always-on' culture, at this point, has been neither fully researched nor fully understood.

==='Tethering'===

One of the main concepts focused on within 'always-on' discussion is the idea that we are tethered to our technological devices. Academic Sherry Turkle coins the term in her discussion of the growing 'always-on' culture. She describes  the concept of a 'Tethered self' as the idea of people being consistently accessible through technology and our expectations for them to always be contactable. She explores how even when not physically using our phones or social networking we are still contactable through them, therefore we are forever linked to our communication outlets. &lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (2011). Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less From Each Other, New York: Basic Books &lt;/ref&gt;
. In her piece &quot;Always-On/Always-On-You: The Tethered Self,&quot; Turkle looks at how technology has changed the social acceptability of being disengaged with the people in your physical space and more connected with people miles away. The idea of being tethered to a device raises issues on our increasing reliance on the technology we use &lt;ref&gt; Turkle, S.(2008). Always-On/Always-On-You: The Tethered Self. from Katz, J E., Handbook of Mobile Communication Studies. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press &lt;/ref&gt;. We expect our technology to always work and for others to be immediately responsive, however if the technology breaks or people do not responded we panic. Throughout the working world, staff are expected to be constantly accessible, to the extent that if they are not &quot;on&quot; there is potential for them losing their job. &lt;ref&gt; Gots, J. (2012). Switching Off an &quot;Always-On&quot; Culture. Retrieved from think-tank/switching-off-an-always-on-culture &lt;/ref&gt; Academic danah boyd comments that &quot;It's no longer about on or off, really. It's about living in a world where being networked to people and information wherever and whenever you need is just assumed&quot; &lt;ref&gt; boyd, d. (2012). 'Participating Always-On Lifestyle' from Michael Mandiberg (ed.) The Social Media Reader, New York University Press,p.71-76 &lt;/ref&gt;.

According to Turkle, the idea of the 'Tethered Self' brings up the issue of boundaries; &quot;a parent, partner, or child can be lost for a few seconds or a few minutes to an alternative reality&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Turkle, S.(2008). Always-On/Always-On-You: The Tethered Self. from Katz, J E., Handbook of Mobile Communication Studies. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press &lt;/ref&gt;. People are having to draw clear lines as to when they are present in the physical space around them and when they are 'on' or connected to other people and spaces. Instead of being a natural act, turning of has to be a conscious decision made by the user.

Acknowledging our tethered state raises the question of to whom or to what we are connected &lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. E. (2008). Handbook of mobile communication studies. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
With the ever-growing state of convergence in technological advancements we are starting to see a change in the way we interact with humans. We are tethered to a completely different community in the 21st century. We are not restricted to being tied to only family and friends via local telephone, the Internet has enabled a broader array of contacting. With the growth of technology the 'always-on' culture has grown, we are always connected to the Internet, we can phone people all around the world; we are always tethered.

Tethering is not simply about one's own choice to be connected through the 'main' social media (text, email, Facebook, Twitter). It has been suggested by researcher [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_Zizek Slavoj Žižek] in his work &quot;Big Brother, or The triumph of the Gaze Over the Eye&quot; that in our modern society, anxiety is more likely to arise through not being accessible or existing in this online sense. This has resulted in it becoming something of an oddity for someone to be outside of these online platforms, and socially surreal.

As Žižek points out, the culture of 'always-on' has made some people act in bizarrely voyeuristic ways - almost as if they were broadcasting their entire lives as a reality show. He compares aspects of the use of social media to the presentation of the film ''The Truman Show'' and the reality television series ''Big Brother'', in terms of the manner in which people are almost utilizing themselves as actors, casting forth an image of themselves to formulate an impression of themselves for others to digest &lt;ref&gt; Žižek, S. (2002). Big Brother, or The triumph of the Gaze Over the Eye from Ctrl Space, London: MIT Press &lt;/ref&gt;. This includes occasionally detailing processes of life that would be usually deemed unworthy of note, simply because it seems to be expected of oneself to do so.

'Always-on' culture and tethering can be seen as causing crucial problems for businesses. In correlation with people having expectations of their own technology always working we have the same expectation for the technologies of companies. This causes companies who suffer from unexpected technological failures to lose money and reputation as a result. For example in February last year a crash of the Bank of America's online banking system caused disruptions for numerous customers wanting to check their finances at the start of the month. The customers were seen to later vent their frustrations to social media sites. &lt;ref&gt; Seddon, C and Issac, D. (2013). The business implications of an 'Always-on' Technology Culture. Dealing with a new era of it outages.. Retrieved from http://www.pinsentmasons.com/PDF/TMTInsightsummer.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;. Hence the company's reputation was hurt due to unavoidable technological failures due to their customers reliance on being 'always-on'. On the other hand if businesses were to reject the use of social media they would inevitably lose out in publicity to other more vocal companies, or be seen as outdated for not utilizing new technology. 

Besides tethering affecting businesses, it is also contributing to an ever-growing issue of internet addiction disorder, giving ease of use to to people to connect to the Internet, anywhere and anytime. &quot;IAD was originally proposed as a disorder in a satirical hoax by Ivan Goldberg, M.D., in 1995, though some later researchers have taken his essay seriously.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_addiction_disorder#Problematic_Internet_Use_.28PRIUSS.29&lt;/ref&gt; This is the results of the 'always-on' culture, addiction, a severe mental disorder. As Sherry Turkle mentions in 'Connected but alone?'  ‘[...]those little devices in our pockets are so psychologically-powerful, that they don’t only change what we do – they change who we are.’ &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/sherry_turkle_alone_together?source=facebook&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently showing you the power of technological convergence, tethering and the internet's effect on the 21st century.

====Tethered to the Workplace====

Just as the younger generations have an inescapable tie to technology, adults in the workplace are finding it just as hard to tear themselves away from their work once 5'o'clock rolls around. Meeting memos, online calendar appointment books, stock market app live updates, and the constant flurry of work emails make it impossible for workers to leave work at the office. Everyone is expected to be 'always-on' as a next-day meeting could be announced via email that was sent out during dinnertime. Expectations have changed. Workers are often required to always be connected to media to learn the latest news or even just to stay updated with company happening. A [http://www.apaexcellence.org/assets/general/2013-work-and-communication-technology-survey-final.pdf recent study] done by the American Psychological Association (APA) discovered that more than half of employed adults said they check work messages at least once a day over the weekend and outside week work hours. More than 4 in 10 workers reported doing the same while on vacation. In the same study, adults reported that being 'always-on' increased their workload by a third as more work could be done faster and from anywhere. Stepping out of the office doesn't include the mobile phone in the jacket pocket or the work laptop in the briefcase in hand. 

The APA suggests a few tips for unplugging for the day from the office, but it's the case of easier said than done. A few tips include managing expectations, setting boundaries, limiting multitasking, and turning work media off after work hours. For many companies out there, this isn't possible. Workers are hired with the knowledge that a 40-hour, 8-to-5 work week is a dream. Employees may not be strictly required to be &quot;on call&quot; 24/7 but the expectation might be set by employers.  

Small business owners also struggle with the demands to remain 'always-on'. In this age, many store owners need an online presence to attract business, even Facebook profiles to send out updates or even to post store hours. A [http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/231515 recent LinkedIn study] found that 81% of sampling of small businesses use social media to drive growth. YellowPages have moved online and businesses follow. Often, resources and time are thin when it comes to maintaining, or even creating, an online presence. Websites are difficult to set up and look appealing so many people opt to make social media profiles as a marketing tool in addition to an online presence itself, [http://www.forbes.com/sites/thesba/2013/11/25/how-much-is-online-presence-helping-small-business/ (Forbes, 2013)]. An online presence can connect business with a large number of potential consumers with very little effort.

==='Online Dis-inhibition'===
Another main concept within 'always-on' is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect online dis-inhibition]. The process of online dis-inhibition is described as the phenomenon of online users posting comments or discussions which they would be unlikely to say in real life. Users are seen to lose sense of some of their real world inhibitions that would dictate what to say in their offline conversations.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Suler John Suler], a Psychology Professor based at Rider University specialises in online dis-inhibition. He explains that they can be split between 'Benign dis-inhibition' and 'Toxic dis-inhibition' &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J. (2005). The Online Disinhibition Effect from International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, Vol. 2, No. 2: 184-188 &lt;/ref&gt;. 

====Benign Dis-inhibition====  
Often, benign dis-inhibition can be seen as an extension of online dis-inhibition where the online user can express emotions of sincerity and affection. Benign dis-inhibition was described by Suler in its simplest terms as ''an attempt to better understand and develop oneself. &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J. (2005). The Online Disinhibition Effect from International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, Vol. 2, No. 2: 184-188 &lt;/ref&gt;'' Behaviours can include sharing secrets and revealing more of themselves online than they would confide in a friend. Often online blog sites and chatrooms, such as Tumblr, keep users relatively anonymous and, as such, users feel more open to sharing pieces of themselves or acting kindly towards others. However, the same anonymity that allows users the privacy to share such thoughts also can lead to more destructive behaviors and actions. 

====Toxic Dis-inhibition====  
Similar to benign dis-inhibition, toxic dis-inhibition can be viewed as an extension to the idea of online dis-inhibitions. However, in contrast to benign dis-inhibition, toxic dis-inhibition is the act of users spreading negative views and expressions online including social platforms and blogs. Such acts have recently been taken very seriously and as a result, many online laws and legislations have had to be changed. Toxic dis-inhibition can be linked to social media, particularly Tumblr, Twitter and ask.fm. These sites have been in the media a lot recently as stories relating to toxic dis-inhibition have brought the serious consequences of the issue - such as cyber-bullying - into public consciousness. Cyberbullying has become a recent trend in middle and high schools with the explosion of the internet and an addiction to technology. Children and teens don't have as much supervision on the internet and feel more anonymous. The only requirement for many social media sites is an email address which can be faked easily. Cyberbulling has been shown to have disastrous effects, making kids become depressed and withdraw, and in some extreme circumstances, driven students to suicide. &lt;ref&gt;Amichai-Hamburger, Y. (2013). The social net: Understanding our online behavior. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to benign dis-inhibition, Suler has simplified the idea to its base meaning of ''&quot;a blind catharsis, a fruitless repetition compulsion or acting out of pathological needs without any beneficial psychology change. &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J. (2005). The Online Disinhibition Effect from International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, Vol. 2, No. 2: 184-188 &lt;/ref&gt;&quot;''

====Popular Examples of Online Dis-inhibition====
One oft-acknowledged example of dis-inhibition affecting a large online populace is with the community surrounding Chatroulette. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatroulette Chatroulette] is a webcam-based chat service that connects the user randomly to another user, often from a pool of several million potential users who are online at any one time, anywhere in the world. The website receives little to no moderation, so if one connects to others on Chatroulette, there is no possible way to identify who they are about to connect with. Furthermore, the website utilises anonymous connections for all of its users, and as such, extreme or otherwise hurtful things are displayed on Chatroulette with some degree of frequency&lt;ref&gt;Singh, G. (2014). ‘Always-on Culture’, lecture at University of Stirling, 4th March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;. This would point to the dis-inhibition of Chatroulette being easily categorised as toxic. Since the user is anonymous and randomly connected to another person anywhere in the world, often times people using the service will act in bizarre or lewd ways (including expressing themselves violently with with a great degree of explicitly sexual content).

A well known example of toxic dis-inhibition was the volatile reception Rebecca Black's 2011 song &quot;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0 Friday]&quot;. After her music video went viral, Black started to receive death threats from members of the public. Black had to be taken out of school to be taught at home by her mother due to the extent of her bullying. &lt;ref&gt; BBC Newsbeat (2011). Rebecca Black to be home-schooled after being bullied. Retrieved from http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/14488181 &lt;/ref&gt; Of course, threatening the life of an innocent 13 year old girl is unacceptable and the California Police Department had to make investigations. &lt;ref&gt; Wright, D. (2011). Rebecca Black &quot;Friday&quot; Singer, Receiving Death Threats. Retrieved from http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/rebecca-black-friday-singer-receiving-death-threats/story?id=13425921 &lt;/ref&gt; However they never discovered who was behind it, thus re-iterating the idea that people believe that they can say whatever they want online and they will not get caught.

Another example of online dis-inhibition was the &quot;Twitter joke trial&quot; of Paul Chambers in 2010. After discovering that his local airport was closed a week before he had to fly, he posted this tweet: ''&quot;Crap! Robin Hood airport is closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your s*** together otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!!&quot;'' He was arrested and fined for threatening the airport and consequently lost his job. He was granted an appeal in 2012 &lt;ref&gt; The Guardian. (2012). Twitter joke trail: Paul Chambers Wins High Court Appeal Against Conviction. Retrieved from theguardian.com/law/twitter-joke-trial-high-court &lt;/ref&gt;

==='Reduced Social Context Cues'===
[http://people.stern.nyu.edu/lsproull/ Sproull] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Kiesler Kesler] (1986) and reduced social context cues. Sproull and Kesler argue that email and social networking, two main means of communication in 'always-on' culture, are of a low fidelity CMC. A low fidelity CMC meaning a low number of social context cues. With email, texts or social networks we are limited to text based communication where we lose out on people's expressions and immediate responses to information. They argue this mode of communication will lead to people becoming more self absorbed in communications since they don't have the other person physically present. Particularly with 'always-on' culture, people online can be seen to get annoyed at slow responses to communication despite the recipient potentially being too busy to respond, since there is no way to know why they recipient isn't responding. &lt;ref&gt; Sproull, L. and Kiesler, S. (1986). Reducing Social Context Cues: Electronic Mail in Organizational Communication from Management Science, vol.32(no.11), 1492-1512 &lt;/ref&gt; Communication such as jokes or sarcasm will also be comparatively more difficult to read leading to potentially misread situations. However with the increasing use of communication in the form of video chatting we are seeing higher fidelity means of communication, therefore this issue can be seen as becoming less of a concern. That being said taking reduced social cues on a larger scale not seeing people's reactions can lead users to post rude or hurtful posts to celebrities or on YouTube comments, because they see no obvious repercussion of doing so. This phenomenon is unlikely to change due to higher fidelity video chatting as this tends to only occur between people who already know each other. As opposed to between audiences and you tubers, celebrities etc.

===Determinism===
====Technological Determinism====
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_determinism Technological determinism], also known as hard determinism, is the idea that technology has important effects on our lives. The term was first coined by the American sociologist [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen Thorstein Veblen], who theorised that technology was the driving force behind social change and influences how cultures develop and grow in response to technology and its constant development. This theory argues that technology drives history and becomes determinant at a certain stage in its own history. It refers to how technology is responsible for the formation of new social and cultural conventions, establishing how we live our lives as we adapt and change around these technologies. For example, the development of mobile technology has increased many peoples accessibility to social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, because of this increased accessibility through these advancements, online interaction between people has increased considerably and new conventions regarding society and social media have been formed. It has been argued by Dovey and Giddlings (2008) that the idea of technological determinism figures prominently in the popular imagination and political rhetoric&lt;ref&gt;Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I. &amp; Kelly, K. (2008). New Media: A Critical Introduction. 2nd ed. London: Taylor And Francis&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Cultural Determinism====
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_determinism Cultural determinism], also known as soft determinism, is the idea that technology itself does not have an important effect in peoples lives, but rather people make technology important. This means that human agents intend to make technology an important part of their life&lt;ref&gt; Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I. &amp; Kelly, K. (2008). New Media: A Critical Introduction. 2nd ed. London: Taylor And Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to these ideas, being raised in a technology-saturate environment will have a significant fact on the current generations and amplified effects for generations to come as technology develops. By 1990, a large number of adults had mobile phones. In 2005, most teenagers had the same technology, but with more features in a smaller package. In 2014, many children have listed the latest smartphone on their Christmas lists. Technology and media play a role in a developing mind's emotional maturity, interpersonal communication skills, and other behaviors that will change as technology plays an even bigger role in our lives than it does now.

===Low Fidelity/High Fidelity===

Examples of &quot;Low fidelity&quot; communications are ones which are solely text-based or voice-based. Low fidelity is characterised by the lack of interpersonal and social context cues which determine how an individual feels or expresses their opinion. For example, text-based communications can lose the intended meaning depending on how the receiver interprets it. Different emphasis on certain words can change the importance significantly. Voice-based communications are of a slightly higher fidelity, but they lack facial expressions which are a clear indicator of one's position on a matter&lt;ref&gt;Sproull, L. &amp; Kiesler, S. (1986). Reducing social context cues: Electronic mail in organizational communication. Management Science, 32 (11), pp. 1492--1512&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[File:Video Call.jpg|thumb|left|Video call between Sweden and Singapore]]

Communicating with strangers without face-to-face cues also may lead to the reader subconsciously creating a voice and/or visual image for the other person conducted from their own imagination. This, in turn, will create a different version of the person which the user is communicating with based on his/hers individual desires and needs. Thus, the &quot;reality&quot; of these types of conversations may be distorted and develop into a fantasy face-to-face conversation, imagined by the reader, where the stranger fits into a specific role which the reader requires&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), pp. 184--188.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Video based communications give you both voice and facial recognition aspects but they provide a different atmosphere than from when you are in the same room as another human being. For example, content and micro facial expressions can be lost through a drop in signal or a low quality webcam. Eye contact can provide a lot of information and be a strong non-verbal cue in a conversation, and it can never be achieved with the use of webcams.

===Locked In===
Locked in is the idea that some software and ideas are used so much that they become industry standard, and are accepted by most people to the extent that they are nearly impossible to change. Lanier often uses the example of MIDI, a system which was created in the early 1980's. This system concerns musical notes and it transfers them from electronic instruments to computers. Lanier argues that this system is not the best and has limitations; however, as many new and different programmes have been created and adapted to be able to use it, it means that MIDI is still currently used. Another example is the QWERTY keyboard. This layout of keyboard became popular and frequently used in type writers. As most people know how to type using this sort of keyboard and are familiar with this layout, using another one would most likely not be successful with people, meaning that the QWERTY keyboard remains used&lt;ref&gt;Fish, A. (2011). Book review: Jaron Lanier, You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto. New York: Alfred Knopf, 2010. New Media \&amp; Society, 13 (3), pp. 510--513&lt;/ref&gt;.

===danah boyd===

: ''&quot;It's no longer about on or off really. It's about living in a world where being networked to people and information wherever and whenever you need it is just assumed. I may not be always-on the Internet as we think of it colloquially, but I am always connected to the network. And that's what it means to be always-on.&lt;ref&gt;boyd , danah (2012) ‘Participating in the Always - On Culture’ in Mandiberg (ed.) The Social Media Reader. p. 71-72. Retrieved 4/4/14 from https://archive.org/stream/TheSocialMediaReader/Mandiberg-theSocialMediaReader-cc-by-sa-nc_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;'' -danah boyd 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danah_boyd danah boyd] is an academic researcher, focusing primarily on social media and how society interacts with it. Her work in ''The Social Media Reader'' &lt;ref&gt; boyd, danah (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Lifestyle' in The Social Media Reader, London: New York University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; highlights the problems that arise when defining the 'always-on' lifestyle, especially looking at when being online begins and ends. In this boyd argues that different social contexts create different relationships with being 'always-on', meaning that how society uses technology is not defined by space, but by the contexts we create. Continuing with this idea, boyd reasons that 'always-on-ers' are characterised by their values and lifestyle rather than generation. Therefore raising questions of who is involved in this 'always-on' lifestyle according to their professional life and social activities, widely varying the spectrum. Technological literacy is no longer limited to the younger generations as we see a rise in more and more user friendly technology that can be used by the majority. Furthermore, boyd supports the notion that technology provides a new area for understanding, curiosity, and interaction allowing users to gain knowledge about people and information, with 'always-on-ers' taking full advantage of the possibilities available.

boyd summarises the effects of the 'always-on' culture by using the example of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat Snapchat].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2014/03/21/snapchat-attention.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In this blog post she points out how technology users automatically scroll through information without taking the time to engage with it. A result of being 'always-on' is mindlessly accessing information without any need or desire to. However, Snapchat offers a solution to mindless media consumption by limiting the amount time the information is available for, portraying the message of &quot;You’ve got 7 seconds. PAY ATTENTION&quot;. This type of technology forces people to engage with media again rather than only being semi-consciously aware of their 'always-on' lifestyle.

'''The Blurring of Virtual and Reality'''

This is an idea that boyd argues is applying more and more to our everyday lives. This exist because technology is gradually replacing tasks that would otherwise be carried out manually. Examples of this lie in the writing of essays, communicating with others, applying for jobs, entertainment, and gaining knowledge. Due to this different spheres of life are infiltrating others, such as work and leisure, meaning that since users can be communicated at all times through technology. Therefore, new information related to work can be read at home, and the same for personal news can be found out whilst at work. It could be argued that this blurring of leisure and work is the consequential result of the blurring of virtual and reality. 

'''Ubiquity'''

One of boyd's main ideas is that technology and connectivity has become ubiquitous. This means that the technologies are being used as part of everyday life, and no longer thought of as simply technology. boyd refers to ubiquity in terms of how technology is becoming part of the social infrastructure, and supporting people in what they do. Furthermore, boyd is referring to the connectivity of technology and how it is a service for everyday people, not just technologists. This relates to 'always-on' culture because as technology becomes more ubiquitous it is being used for more reasons in everyday life, and thus is a key component in being 'always-on'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/Etech2007.html], boyd, d. (2007) Retrieved on 2nd April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The 'Network''''

Being surrounded by technology also links in with boyd's idea of what the 'network' truly means. boyd believes that the 'network' does not refer to the technology available, but rather to the idea that it offers a new platform to express pre-existing cultural ideas. Interaction and engagement are the driving forces behind information access and communication within the &quot;networked public&quot;. boyd argues that this formation of networks is primarily visible on social networking sites(SNSs) and media-sharing websites. The purposes of these networks, according to boyd, are socialisation, consumption, and civic engagement. This links to 'always-on' culture because socialising is being greatly influenced by technology and ease it offers in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/DigitalHandshakes.pdf], boyd, d. (2007) Retrieved on 2nd April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Addiction to Technology'''

According to boyd being always-on is like being a part of the online community where people are connected to each other through layers of information. She calls it an ‘ecosystem in which people can stay connected to one another through a variety of microdata’. That’s where she made interesting point about online addiction. Some people see being always-on as an obsession; a virtual sickness which destroys lives. Boyd argues that always-on has nothing to do with technological addiction but more to do with the passion that people have for information and the lives of others.&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d. (2012) 'Participating in an Always-on Lifestyle'. pp. 74 - 75&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Online and Offline Lives'''

Whilst boyd seems to make a relevant point that our online lives are as ‘real’ as our offline lives, more could be said about the significant difference between these two aspects of our lives, in particular how we behave online versus how we behave offline. Suler (2005) makes the point that when we communicate online, our input comes after some delay, perhaps minutes or hours or days, and this affects what we say, in text form, and how we say it. Importantly, he asserts that when we communicate face-to-face with others, “moment-by-moment responses between people powerfully shapes the ongoing flow of self-disclosure, usually in the direction of conforming to social norms” (p. 185). If this is the case, if an increasing amount of our time is spent online this could perhaps leave some people struggling with face-to-face social skills necessary to fit into a particular environment, such as that of an organisation with a clear expectations of cultural behaviour, or to succeed in particular roles where face-to-face interaction with people is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Suler (2005) p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sherry Turkle===

[[File:Sherry Turkle.jpg|thumbnail|Sherry Turkle]]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry_Turkle Sherry Turkle] is another key theorist associated with 'always-on' culture and, specifically related to 'the tethered self'. Sherry Turkle is an American professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the area of social studies.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian. (2013). Sherry Turkle: 'We're losing the raw, human part of being with each other. Retrieved 03/23, 2014, from http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/may/05/rational-heroes-sherry-turkle-mit&lt;/ref&gt; Turkle is a hugely influential theorist in this field and is incredibly important when talking in terms of Social Media and this 'always-on' culture.  She has contributed to many academic papers and research journals, with much of her work focusing on the psychology of human relationships and technology where she discusses and develops further this notion of the 'tethered self' stating that:

&quot;Networked, we are together, but so lessened are our expectations of each other that we can feel utterly alone. And there is the risk that we come to see others as objects to be accessed - and only for the parts we find useful, comforting or amusing.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Turkle, S. (2011). Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less From Each Other, New York: Basic Books &lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;We are tethered to our 'always-on/always-on-us' communications devices and the people and things we reach through them: people, Webpages, voice mail, games, artificial intelligences... they live for us through our tethering devices, always ready-to-mind and hand.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Turkle, S.(2008). Always-On/Always-On-You: The Tethered Self. from Katz, J E., Handbook of Mobile Communication Studies. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press &lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Tethered Self'''

The &quot;Tethered Self&quot; is a prominent part of her 'always-on' study.   This idea concerns the way in which people are connected and have access to it a communication device, such as a smart phone.  She often discusses how people can always be reached through mobiles or emails and if the person cannot contact the users, then machines often represent them, such as voicemail.  Also,  how a growing number of people are connected to some sort of network, such as Facebook, and rarely disconnect from it.  From interviews she has conducted, she concludes that people, especially teenagers, feel at a loss without their mobile and without being connected.  She argues that people have become more reliant on their technologies and this has led to users checking their networks more for any notifications. For example, users checking their smart phones for notifications.&lt;ref name='Turkle&gt;Turkle, S. (2013). Always-On/Always-On-You: The Tethered Self. Handbook of Mobile Communication Studies. (pp. 121). Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Life on The Screen'''

Another book published by Turkle in 1995 'Life on The Screen: Identity in The age of the Internet' which is part of her work based around computers and the effect they have on us. She developed ideas of 'cyberspace' - a place where we can, every day, go to interact and connect with people anywhere- and develop relationships with them online. In writing she said human beings were changing and adapting due being unable to distinguish between computers and real life. 

The concept of being able to go on at any time to speak to someone any where gives the idea of being 'always-on' and in this sense, with a computer. Always having access to these online worlds and being able to be reached from people even when we are not there, we are still 'always-on'. &lt;ref&gt; Turkle, S. (1997). Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet. Simon &amp; Schuster; 1st Touchstone Ed edition &lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Second Self'''

The “Second Self” is Sherry Turkle's second published book.  Throughout, she refers to ideas of computers being more than a device and how it is an important part of the user’s life, physiologically and socially.&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (2005) “The Second Self Twentieth Anniversary Edition.” Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; Her book is based upon opinions and attitudes of people who use computers and how that effects on their lives. &lt;ref&gt;NY Times. (1984) “The Second Self.” Retrieved 04/01, 2014, from http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/03/specials/turkle-second.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Written in 1984, before today's technology was invented and before most people owned a smart phone,  Turkle expresses ideas that could lead to today's 'always-on' culture such as the fear people initially had about becoming &quot;addicted&quot; to technology.&lt;ref name= ‘Turkle’&gt;Turkle, S. (2005) “The Second Self Twentieth Anniversary Edition.” Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Turkle also mentions ideas, similar to theorist Marshall McLuhan, of technology extending the self but she also adds how it extends the “external” world for the user.&lt;ref name= ‘NY Times’&gt;NY Times. (1984) “The Second Self.” Retrieved 04/01, 2014, from http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/03/specials/turkle-second.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
She states in the book, the idea that technology “changes not only in what we do but how we think” which is similar to her ideas in “Alone Together.”  This idea is emphasised in her later work as by then more technology had been developed and consumed. &lt;ref name= ‘Turkle’&gt;Turkle, S. (2004) “The Second Self Twentieth Anniversary Edition.” Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alone Together'''

Her book &quot;Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less From Each Other&quot; (2011) mentions the idea of 'always-on' culture and the relationship between people and technology and the consequences that can have.
This is where she drew on the main ideas of 'tethering' and the 'always-on' culture. She made points about how we are more connected now than what we have ever been before but with that we are still alone. We are replacing our social interactions- conversations and intimacy with texting and communicating through computer use. &lt;ref&gt; Turkle, S. (2011). Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less From Each Other, New York: Basic Books &lt;/ref&gt;

Turkle gave a talk through the website [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TED_(conference) TED] called &quot;Connected, but still alone?&quot; here she discussed some of the main points from the book. She talked about the ideas of communication and how it changed who we are and what we do and so we are developing social problems when it comes to being offline. We are now expecting less from each other and more from our technologies altering our relationships and friendships in the outside world and we are also losing valuable skills in conversation and social behaviour do to our new forms of connection and technology.&lt;ref name='Ted Talks'&gt;Ted Talks.

===Leslie Perlow=== 

'''About'''

[http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=24278 Leslie Perlow] is a professor of Leadership in the Organizational Behaviour area at Harvard Business School.  Most of her research focuses on being 'always-on' in the work place. In her latest publication, “Sleeping With Your Smartphone” she focuses on employees of businesses who feel the need to be always online and always be connected and she discusses how disconnecting can be the most powerful tool for them.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School. (2014). Leslie A. Perlow. Retrieved 03/29, 2014, from http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=24278&amp;facInfo=fea&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Sleeping With Your Smartphone'''

In her latest publication, “Sleeping With your Smartphone,” she surveys thousands of different businesspeople in different professions over how much they work and their smartphone habits.  Some of her questions included how often they check their phone and how often they can disconnect from it. She argues that professionals feel pressure to be 'always-on' and they often feel that if they disconnect, others may still stay on and become more successful than them.&lt;ref&gt;Huffington Post. (2012). Turning Off Your Smartphone: More Stress or Less?. Retrieved 09/29, 2014, from http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leslie-perlow/work-stress_b_1429692.html&lt;/ref&gt;  
Due to different time zones and needing to be contactable for clients and fellow colleagues, Perlow has argued that it leads to employees to change their timetable and reschedule their time to make sure that they are always connected and remain to be perceived as a good employee as constantly being on is often expected from high pressure jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business Review. (2012). Are You Sleeping With Your Smartphone?. Retrieved 03/29, 2014, from http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/05/are-you-sleeping-with-your-sma/&lt;/ref&gt;    

'''Disconnecting'''

Perlow experimented with a company, Boston Consulting Company, to see if their employees would be able to disconnect and if that could be achieved.  At 6:00pm each night, a different employee would be able to disconnect from their work network and other employees were able to deal with clients if need be.  
Most employees felt many benefits such as finding their work more satisfying.  They also felt that they regained more control over their work life.  
Perlow argues that when this approach is applied correctly, not being 'always-on' can benefit not just the employee but the organisation as well.&lt;ref&gt;Big Think. (2012). Switching Off An &quot;Always on&quot; Culture.. Retrieved 03/29, 2014, from http://bigthink.com/videos/switching-off-an-always-on-culture-2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thriving in an Overconnected World'''
In 2013, Perlow gave a TEDTalk on what she perceived as a detrimental effect that the 'always-on' culture of smartphones was having on businesses and organizations, as well as family life and relationships. She asserted that because of 'always-on' culture existing, people are constantly checking their smartphones for updates on career-related issues, e-mails from colleagues, or for information about their current duties at work - all the while squandering the time they spend outside of work doing this. Perlow describes this as a common attitude - stating that it is easy for one to think it's the best thing to do for their career. She further asserts that these behaviors have lead to a significant deterioration in the relationships and skills people use to deal with situations and issues outside of the workplace. Perlow concludes by asserting that this &quot;overconnected world&quot; does not have to lead to negative effects - if proper changes are made to the workplace structure and certain criteria are established for what is and what is not good use of one's connected devices, work and life can be improved, avoiding the downfalls of an &quot;overconnected&quot; society. &lt;ref&gt;TED.com.

===Naomi Baron===

'''About'''

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Baron Naomi Baron] is a linguist and professor of linguistics at American University in Washington D.C. She researches topics such as language in social context, language acquisition and computer medicated-communication. Her book, Always On: Language in an Online and Mobile World, which was published in 2008, won the English-Speaking Union’s HRH The Duke of Edinburgh ESU English Language Book Award for 2008. 

'''Domestication of technology''' 

In her book, 'Always On: Language in an Online and Mobile World' she talks about the idea of domestication of technology, a theory with comes from Rodger Silverstone and Leslie Haddon. This is the idea that we use technology as an everyday essential without giving it a second thought. She explains that such communication technologies has gradually changed our social norms and an example of this is that it is so much easier for us to go online and find out what the weather is going to be rather than turn on our televisions, go to the weather channel and await our local report. As domestication of communication technologies spreads through the populace, people are increasingly “on” networks that extend beyond the landline. Her theory that the domestication of such technologies like email, IM, blogging and facebook can have some dangers. The first is that once you become “on” it is hard to come “off” and it is increasingly easy to being 'always-on'. Once you have got past the first fees of buying a computer or a phone it becomes less and less expensive to keep connected through them. Secondly is that anyone can be an author or a publisher and can surpass legal authorities. And the third one and probably the most dangerous is the compromising of our safety and privacy. This is potentially the worst but can be put simply from accidentally sending an email to the wrong person or before you are finished to some of our banking information being hacked or stolen.

==Effects of Being &quot;Always-On&quot;==

===Advantages===

'''Instant Information'''

A main advantage of being 'always-on' is being able to receive information and news as soon as it becomes available. Prior to the advancement we have seen in technology today, people would have to log on to a PC, buy a newspaper or wait for a letter to arrive at their door to receive information. Nowadays, however, they can receive these kind of communications instantly through their mobile device and, in some cases, be notified exactly when they become available. The time taken to communicate has been significantly shortened and made much more convenient for the user. As the world becomes more and more online everything we need becomes more readily available to us. We can get information in a matter of seconds and everything that we need to know we are able to find out. According to filmmaker [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Shlain Tiffany Shlain] director of 'Connected: An Autoblogography About Love, Death &amp; Technology', &quot;something happens in one place and we can see it, feel it, and do something about it which has such huge potential&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Shlain, T. (2011). Connected: An Autoblogography About Love, Death &amp; Technology. Video. Retrieved from http://www.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70166245&amp;trkid=13462100&amp;tctx=-99%2C-99%2Cd198df6c-98f6-426a-876d-d4ec4155f6b2-8256831 &lt;/ref&gt;.

Information is no longer something that takes an exertion to locate, we have it right at our finger tips. “Work will be dominated by fast-moving, geographically diverse, free-agent teams of workers connected via socially mediating technologies.” (Fred Stutzman, Carnegie Mellon) This theory explains the influence that being “always-on” has on us and the idea of what its effect on our society has been. It is thought that because the spread of information is so quick, diverse and free moving, that our society will become quick, diverse and free moving, and as a result of this, our culture will benefit greatly. All of these factors make for a much more efficient way of communicating and working. According to Royston Martin (2009) the notion of media being “everywhere and always on” does not have to be viewed negatively. “The spread of free, easily accessible instant information – be it on, for example, health care or democratic election processes – are small examples of the potential the digital media has to help raise living standards.”

'''Development of Different Skills'''

There are a lot of theories that say the 'always-on' culture is having a negative effect on children and teens with side effects as lower attention span and inability to work through problems. This may be true however there are a lot of other benefits that our weigh these. Studies show that 55 percent of those surveyed say that the brains of young people in 2020 will be wired differently from those of their parents. What’s more, they say, is the ability of always-connected young people to nimbly get information from an array of online sources and then share it seamlessly among a broad network of people is a positive trend. (Laura B. Weiss, 2012) It is shown that the younger generation may not be able to do the same things their parents can do however they will have skills that are above their parents head. With these on-going technological advances it may not be as necessary for the younger generation to have really long attention spans as information is so available however it may be more beneficial for them to have the skills to hunt down information and share it to a mass audience.  Young people born around the year 2000  “have grown up in a world that has come to offer them instant access to nearly the entirety of human knowledge, and incredible opportunities to connect, create, and collaborate,” says Janna Anderson (Laura B. Weiss, 2012) Therefore these are the way their brains have developed and grown to adapt to these circumstances therefore will be affluent in this particular set of skills unlike their parents who have had to adapt to their generational technologies and grew up with a set of skills that would help them in their world. 

'''Making Plans and Meeting Up'''

Now that the majority of Westernised society has a mobile phone, meeting up with individuals or groups has become much easier. Before the popularization of the mobile phone, people would have most likely contacted one another via land-line. A simple plan would be made to meet up, and the persons involved would not talk to one another again until they saw each other in person at the time and place agreed. Now, thanks to mobile technology, plans can be altered with ease, depending on the situation. For example, if a person on a train which is running late, they can contact their 'always-on' friend from their mobile to let them know what is going on and to rearrange plans.

'''Communication with Others and Synchronisation of Media'''

A major upside of 'always-on' culture is the ease of communication that it has brought to people - particularly technologically engaged youths. If one desires to communicate with another electronically, there are nearly infinite ways of accomplishing this - all depending on the type of communication desired. One can use microblogs (sites like Twitter), blogs (like Tumblr, Wordpress, or Blogspot), social media sites like Facebook, or they could even use various multimedia forms of communication like e-mail, text messaging, or Skype in order to communicate easily with other individuals. On top of the ease of communication that 'always-on' culture affords, it also supports a fantastic level of synchronisation for most forms of social media. For instance, one can easily link their Instagram account to their Facebook, Twitter, or Tumblr accounts (as well as many other social networking sites)&lt;ref&gt;http://help.instagram.com/169948159813228&lt;/ref&gt;, allowing posts on any or all of those sites to be visible across platforms, and also allowing the user to keep their communications and musings synchronised across multiple platforms of social media and keeping things orderly at the same time.

===Disadvantages===

'''&quot;Disconnectivity Anxiety&quot; (DA)'''

DA is, as defined by Dr. Jim Taylor, &quot;a persistent and unpleasant condition characterized by worry and unease caused by periods of technological disconnection from others&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Taylor, J. (2010). Disconnectivity Anxiety. Retrieved from http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-jim-taylor/disconnectivity-anxiety_b_647773.html &lt;/ref&gt;. This anxiety can come from anything, such as, not being able to connect to the Internet or someone not responding quickly enough to a message. From Taylor's perspective, the constant need to be connected is a problem in society and people should make an effort to detach themselves when the technology is not necessary.

'''“Continuous Partial Attention” (CPA)'''

CPA is: “to pay partial attention — CONTINUOUSLY” &lt;ref&gt; Stone, L. (2009). Continuous Partial Attention. Retrieved from: http://lindastone.net/qa/continuous-partial-attention/ &lt;/ref&gt;. The term was coined by writer Linda Stone in 1998. When we use our attention in this way, we are dividing it between multiple things but at a superficial level. CPA is motivated “by a desire to be a LIVE node on the network”. Continuous partial attention is different from multitasking, we multitask to be more efficient and we use CPA because we don’t want to miss anything. In large doses, it can play a part in creating a very stressful lifestyle through &quot;operating in crisis management mode&quot;.

'''Reduced Personal Privacy'''

It has been noted that always being connected can disrupt and interfere with an individual's privacy, as they simply cannot disconnect themselves. Jan van Dijk talks of, particularly in relation to the use of GPS technology in social media, an inability for an individual to detach themselves from their 'network' for personal reasons - simply because society as a whole now functions in an 'always-on' fashion&lt;ref&gt;van Dijk, J.(1999) 'The Network Society', London: SAGE Publications Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&quot;There is pressure in all communications technology to ''be within reach at any time and place'' [...] it causes the individual to be traceable to the deepest crevices of the social fabric and in all environments. Almost every place becomes a social place. And even if one tries and succeeds using blocking options, the chances of having to justify oneself are increasing&quot;&lt;ref&gt;van Dijk, J.(1999) 'The Network Society', London: SAGE Publications Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;.

It is argued that being 'always-on' is an increasing danger to personal autonomy, as our &quot;natural space to withdraw&quot;&lt;ref&gt;van Dijk, J.(1999) 'The Network Society', London: SAGE Publications Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; is shrinking as a direct result&lt;ref&gt;van Dijk, J.(1999) 'The Network Society', London: SAGE Publications Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;. Being 'always-on' and open to so many social outlets takes away an individual's personal time, whilst reducing their ability to switch off, which would eventually result in an overload of data to process; as no individual has the capacity to take in all that the internet has to offer&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;.   
  
'''Inability to Focus'''

As discussed in Nicholas Carr's book 'The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains',' always being connected to the Internet or mobile network can create difficulty to focus on any single thing for more than a few minutes  &lt;ref&gt; Carr, N. (2012) &quot;Nicholas Carr - The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains,&quot; video. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt_NwowMTcg &lt;/ref&gt;. The Internet gives you short bursts of information and then leads you to something else not giving a lot of time to focus on one thing. 

'''Changing Attitudes'''

Turkle expresses how she feels that attitudes of users of the technology is changing.  She often mentions how communication is breaking down due to the increasing use of technology to communicate. Turkle also argues that the way technology is now being used is not just changing the way the users communicate with each other, but it is also changing the user as a person.  The need for attention is able to fulfilled by social media and the ability to message people from a device but this can also lead to users feeling more bored or alone in real life situations.  In a 2012 Ted Talk, she expresses how face-to-face communication is suffering due to the rise of online conversation and how even when people are in them presence of others they often want to be somewhere else, so they communicate online while in the company of others.  She gives the example of people texting and emailing from boardrooms and during meetings.  Overall, she expresses that the popularity of communicating online and the the decline of communicating in person hence creating a feeling of isolation for the user.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Talks. (2012) &quot;Connected But Alone?&quot; Retrieved 03/29, 2014, from http://www.ted.com/talks/sherry_turkle_alone_together&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychological Damage by Being 'Always-On'

There are some psychological issues related to being ‘always-on'. 'Being drop into a mode of permanent online activity’ can create lots of stress and anxiety. Constantly checking messages on the smartphones can lead to the point that there is no break whatsoever. This situation can create a feeling of being overwhelmed, depressed and in some cases makes people even to commit suicide.The pressure of being ‘always-on’ is huge, especially in the work place. There is confusion where the media demands stop and where the life starts. &quot;Work and life are blended into a stressful soup of endless demands. In many workplaces, switching off is seen as uncommitted, even unprofessional&quot;. Many people are place in the situation that the demands from the work place take over their personal life.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph (2014) The 'always -on' culture: smartphones, stress and suicide. Retrieved from http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/micwright/100009425/the-always-on-culture-smartphones-stress-and-suicide/  &lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing Media Industries and Convergence===

===== Newspapers =====

Newspapers fall under the heading of “old media” whilst the Internet is considered “new media”. It could be argued that newspapers are becoming a thing of the past. They were once the only means for people to be informed of current events around the globe and could typically be found in every household. However, now the need to buy a newspaper is waning due to free websites providing up-to-date information, sharing news the instant it occurs. In the age of Twitter and trending topics, there is far less need to track down newsworthy events when they will come to you whether you seek them or not. Many online news providers let users customize their news feed so only topics their interested come to them, such as RSS Feeds.&lt;ref&gt;Using Google News RSS Feeds - News Help. (2014). Retrieved from https://support.google.com/news/answer/59255?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; Older generations might still purchase newspapers; however, newspaper readership in the younger generations is declining as they have all the information they could need at their fingertips. 

Many traditional print newspapers are putting more money and resources into the digital side of news. “At present, the major British newspapers are edging sideways towards the digital tipping point. Print staffs and print supplements and people and resources shifted into digital.” &lt;ref&gt; Brock, G. (2013). Out of print. &lt;/ref&gt; As well as regularly updated websites, many newspapers have launched smartphone apps allowing people to access news on the move and provide notifications for breaking news. Some newspapers have made the complete digital transition as physical readership couldn't maintain profit; instead, newspapers find it more cost beneficial to &quot;print&quot; online, thereby reaching more users and cutting costs.

=====Television=====
As Marshall McLuhan said: ''&quot;There is a basic principle that distinguishes a hot medium like radio from a cool one like the telephone, or a hot medium like the movie from a cool one like TV... A hot medium is one that extends one single sense in &quot;high definition&quot;.''  &lt;ref&gt; McLuhan, M. (1964). Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man. New York: McGraw-Hill &lt;/ref&gt;

Television was once a cool medium - meaning something that could be consumed passively, unlike a movie at the cinema or a lecture for example. However, the more we use social media and the internet, the more interactive television is becoming.  &lt;ref&gt; Koten, Hamid van. (2006) &quot;The Digital Image and the Pleasure Principle: The Consumption of Realism in the Age of Simulation&quot;. In Digital Visual Culture ed. Anna Bentkowska-Kafel, Trish Cashen and Hazel Gardiner. Intellect Books: Bristol &lt;/ref&gt;

Although TV had become interactive before smartphone technology, with the popularisation of voting reality shows like Big Brother (Channel 4/Five) to magazine programmes with debating segments such as This Morning (ITV), the boom in social media and 'always-on' culture has meant that audiences now expect TV shows to have a presence online and want to have their say more than ever. &lt;ref&gt; BBC Academy (2013). Online and social media in TV. Retrieved from http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/production/article/art20130823083150575 &lt;/ref&gt;

For example, it is now possible to download apps for specific TV shows to a smartphone which allow the user to interact with the shows producers and with other viewers. This year, the BBC launched an app for their talent show The Voice which allows users to play along with the blind audition element of the show and voice their opinion, as well as vote in the later stages of the programme. &lt;ref&gt; Digital Spy. (2014) The Voice UK launches new iOS, Android app for series 3 Retrieved from http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s154/the-voice-uk/news/a541355/the-voice-uk-launches-new-ios-android-app-for-series-3.html#~oAiFgbk054sHOs &lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of this is the frequent reminders during a television show to &quot;Like&quot; Facebook pages and to &quot;Tweet&quot; using certain hashtags which essentially encourage the viewer to join in discussions about the programme and receive the latest news on it. This both helps the shows producers understand the audience they have and make sure that they draw in as big an audience as possible as reminders can be sent out.

====Video Games====
Many popular video games have recently begun to utilise social media as a way to report the player's progress through the game as they play it. For instance, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_2:_Among_Thieves Uncharted 2: Among Thieves] features an option for players to link their Twitter account to the game, and as they play the game, whenever they reach a milestone of progression across the game's many chapters, Twitter will post snapshots or small updates of the player's progress&lt;ref&gt;Flip the Media. (2009).  Social Networks and Video Games. Retrieved 4/4/14 from http://flipthemedia.com/2009/11/social-networks-and-video-games/&lt;/ref&gt;. Another notable example of this is with the recent title [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V Grand Theft Auto V]. In Grand Theft Auto V, the player is presented with the option to link their game account to their Facebook account, allowing the game to post status updates and small bits of information about the player's behavior in the game (such as number of in-game kills, recently completed missions, or recently-won multiplayer games). As well as this Rockstar games has also created an online game profile category which enables players from all over the world to link together and share player profiles of your in game progress, evidently video game producers are admirably trying to converge and synergies social media and online gaming as much as possible to keep an Always-On culture active to keep the success and 'Buzz' surrounding the game. 

Additionally, in a more aggregate sense, there is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achievement_%28video_gaming%29 popular system of measuring progress] on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox Xbox] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation Playstation] consoles (referred to as Achievements and Trophies, respectively). These systems of measurement track a player's progress as they complete goals set by the game's designers. Many third-party websites allow players of games on these consoles to automatically update their social networks (such as Twitter or Facebook) with notifications of their progress. Additionally, the Playstation supports native Twitter integration support for players to cross-post their Trophies to their feeds.

With the introduction of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_%28eighth_generation%29 current generation of gaming consoles], the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ps4 Playstation 4] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One Xbox One] both feature the capacity to share video feeds of any one player's gameplay in real-time via popular video game streaming site [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch.tv Twitch.tv]&lt;ref&gt;The Verge. (2013). Xbox at E3 2013: everything you need to know. Retrieved 4/4/2014, from http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4414176/microsoft-xbox-one-at-e3-2013-everything-you-need-to-know&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twitch.tv. (2013). Twitch Confirmed for PlayStation 4. Retrieved 4/4/2014 from http://blog.twitch.tv/2013/08/twitch-coming-to-ps4/&lt;/ref&gt;.

(2013). PS4 Responsible For 10 Percent of All Twitch Streaming. Retrieved 4/4/2014, from http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/12/10/ps4-responsible-for-10-per-cent-of-all-twitch-streaming&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Fashion Industry====
Similarly, the concept of constant technology has further branched out into other major industries across the world influencing fashion as well as culture and social aspects of everyday living. Zeki (2014) describes - in an interview with designer Tuba Ergin - how the fashion world and technological world are becoming forever more 'harmonised' with each other, as well as how each compliment one another. Designer Ergin, showcased his designs at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Istanbul in 2012, which included the new addition of circuit cards into each of his fashion garments including dresses and tops, and furthermore onto shoes and bags. Ergin (2014) mentions how each and every one of us now as members of society are now fully under the influence of the sheer absorption of technology. He evens goes as far to state that &quot;I believe there is almost no difference between drug abuse and technology addiction&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Ergin, T. (2014) &lt;/ref&gt; Such a statement allows us to see how we are now fully 'Always On' with our devices and the extent to which can be compared to such a heavily addictive substance such as drugs. In his interview, Ergin then goes on to discuss the developments of our devices that we are forever always using in our everyday lives such as technological glasses as well as watches. However, he then states that technology in the future will lead into clothes that can react to body temperature and the human pulse, such advancements will allow fitness merchandise to rocket, presumably.

====Marketing Industry====
Technology addiction has had a massive influence over the business-orientated world. With people constantly being visible and incorporated in their online world allows large businesses to make thousands of pounds from these users. The more people are on their phones and technology devices, the more money companies make. Such large organisations such as Facebook allow their adverts to become more expensive and make great amounts of money on their customers simply through their use online being forever constant. Cookies and other internet bugs allow marketers to track every move we make online and more importantly, how long we are on a certain webpage for and where our mouse is hovering. Such details allow them to store great information on the everyday user and can show the great extent to how intense the everyday person is 'always on' on their devices. Therefore, it is clear that marketers are cashing in on us ourselves being constantly addicted to our devices.

====Social Media, Celebrity and Fan Culture====

Social media - in particular, Twitter - now allows us to keep up to date with what is going on in the lives of people we admire and the fan communities surrounding them. It is now very rare to find a significant individual in the public eye who does not own a Twitter account as developing an online presence within this 'always-on' culture helps to create and keep up interest in what you are promoting - even if what you are promoting is simply yourself as an online personality. 

There is a law of attraction which states that people develop a greater preference for something that they are exposed to often &lt;ref&gt; Psych Central. (2009) Mere Exposure Effect. Retrieved from http://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/2009/mere-exposure-effect/ &lt;/ref&gt; which, when applied to social media, may help us to understand how online fan communities work. The greater the presence that the social media user has online - particularly if they are already famous offline - will help create fans or increase interest among casual fans. Once we are enticed by a user through their social media account, it can become very addictive and very often people will feel that they need to know what is happening in that persons life - no matter how trivial. Fan communities and sites can also help to increase interest in a subject. Therefore, as they are 'always-on&quot;, we are 'always-on'.

====Always-On and the Growing Effect on Society====


The rise of the 'always-on' culture is having drastic effects on society as we know it today, the rise in technology is allowing everyone worldwide to be able to connect to the internet using personal devices such as smartphones and laptops 24/7 365 days a year. Studies into the effects of always being online are starting to develop more and more stories day by day, for example the effects of the 'always-on' culture in the workplace; Carsten Schloter, the 49-year-old chief executive of the Swiss telecoms group, Swisscom, was found dead at his home in July 2013, according to the Telegraph “The always-on culture: smartphones, stress and suicide” were main links to his death. Such links are tied in with the norms and traditions of working in an environment in the 21st century, one always has to be ‘always-on’ to read those important emails. “Though the culture of being instantly available for emails and calls is often a product of unspoken pressure, sometimes it’s official policy.” &lt;ref&gt; http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/micwright/100009425/the-always-on-culture-smartphones-stress-and-suicide/ &lt;/ref&gt;

The 'always-on' culture in education, is this culture changing education, how we learn and how our brains behave? Being always on can have it’s advantages and disadvantages, people who disconnect often get withdrawal feelings, ostracism and difficulty connecting, many professionals compare the withdrawal symptoms of disconnecting to that of drugs. Ignoring or creating a negative perception of technology in education that students willingly and actively use in every other aspect of their lives is not a winning educational strategy, research by Brian Chen  &lt;ref&gt; http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yq9cAPVjOusC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=always+on+culture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=br8-U83oG4ithQeWlIHYAQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=always%20on%20culture&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated how top performers in school and in further education were more likely to be those best at distinguishing high quality data. Whether technological devices make students smarter is neither here nor there, technology is only getting more advanced and therefor the always on culture in education is likely to grow more and more.

==Relating Always-On to Other Digital Media and Culture Topics==

===Cognitive Surplus===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_surplus See also: Cognitive Surplus]

Technology has developed to allow the user to create and share their thoughts and ideas. 'Always-on' culture means individuals can partake in cognitive surplus when they so wish. 'Always-on' culture also allows the user to view collective work online at the touch of a button. For example, Wikipedia is free of data charges in Middle-East and Africa: http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero

Thus, the development of an always-on society has created a new means of collaboration and communication. An example of this can be seen in Peter Chroust's research on far-right political movements' use of the internet, in relation to the concept of 'smart mobs'. Chroust uses the example of the Taliban, although it is debatable whether this organisation can be referred to as a 'smart mob', the organisation must remain 'always-on' in order to act out and respond efficiently to 'spontaneous' action - and gather more support&lt;ref&gt;Chroust, P. 'Neo-Nazis and Taliban Online: Anti-Modern Political Movements and Modern Media'. In. Ferdinand, P (2000). ed. 'The Internet, Democracy and Democratization' &lt;/ref&gt;:

:&quot;To right-wing groups the internet not only serves as an electronic mail-box. It also enables the distribution of ideologies for political training of the cadres - and for reaching interested people outside the real network&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chroust, P. 'Neo-Nazis and Taliban Online: Anti-Modern Political Movements and Modern Media'. In. Ferdinand, P (2000). ed. 'The Internet, Democracy and Democratization' &lt;/ref&gt;.

Chroust does however note that the internet, alongside the act of being 'always-on', is most likely seldom utilized aside from through internal communication within the Taliban&lt;ref&gt;Chroust, P. 'Neo-Nazis and Taliban Online: Anti-Modern Political Movements and Modern Media'. In. Ferdinand, P (2000). ed. 'The Internet, Democracy and Democratization' &lt;/ref&gt;. Despite this, &quot;opponents of modernisation and globalisation&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chroust, P. 'Neo-Nazis and Taliban Online: Anti-Modern Political Movements and Modern Media'. In. Ferdinand, P (2000). ed. 'The Internet, Democracy and Democratization' &lt;/ref&gt; are present throughout the world, with organisations such as Al Qaeda operating in numerous countries across different time zones. It is with this in mind that being 'always-on' is an essential component of a 'smart mob' working quickly, efficiently and spontaneously&lt;ref&gt;Chroust, P. 'Neo-Nazis and Taliban Online: Anti-Modern Political Movements and Modern Media'. In. Ferdinand, P (2000). ed. 'The Internet, Democracy and Democratization' &lt;/ref&gt;:

:&quot;That explains why the Taliban invest financial resources and manpower in their presence on the internet. That most of the Afghan population have no electric light and even are illiterate, let alone have access to the world wide web, is not such a paradox as it first seems&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chroust, P. 'Neo-Nazis and Taliban Online: Anti-Modern Political Movements and Modern Media'. In. Ferdinand, P (2000). ed. 'The Internet, Democracy and Democratization' &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Technological Determinism===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_determinism See also: Technological Determinism]

'Always-on' culture may bring about a big cultural shift relating to communication which has been determined by innovations in media technology where the user has the ability to be connected to the internet at all times. Technology has the power to transform culture, society and way people look at the world. Due to the advance in technology, people have developed a greater need to be connected to other people via mobiles/computers/tablets and are more likely to share experiences through these forms of communication than face-to-face.

===Online Identity===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_identity See also: Online Identity]

Being 'always-on' leads to the constant overlapping of the user's real life identity and online one. It could be argued that the user's online identity is just as 'real' as their 'real life' identity - that an online identity is carefully thought out regarding what the user displays about themselves, but in face-to-face encounters it is much more 'real time' and people are perhaps a bit more vulnerable to show themselves in a less-than-ideal way - albeit showing a more 'natural' self. Online identity is about portraying of self as a living-out of states of being, becoming, belonging and behaving through the range of everyday social and discursive practices that are connected with the body. Yet it is also a close editing of self: ‘it’s me, but minus the things I don’t like about me’ – those aspects of self chosen to be shared with the public &lt;ref&gt; Thomson, A. (2007). Youth Online: Identity and Literacy in the Digital Age. Peter Lang Publishing: New York &lt;/ref&gt;. 

'Always-on' may mean that some users of technology feel the need to “check-in”, update their internet status or upload pictures from their real life to portray a specific online identity &lt;ref&gt; Mendelson, A.L &amp; Papacharissi, Z. (2010). Look at Us: Collective Narcissism in College Student Facebook Galleries from A Networked Self. Routledge: London &lt;/ref&gt;. These activities may take up a lot of time and be of great importance to individuals in order to determine an online identity which is always-on and available to access (i.e. Impression Management). Always-on with regard to texting, Facebook, email etc. will all contribute to your online identity as they are managed by you and reflect you as a person whether it is informally with friends (text, Facebook) or for a more professional purpose (email, LinkedIn). José van Dijck  &lt;ref&gt; Van Dijk, J. (2013). The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media. Oxford University Press: Oxford &lt;/ref&gt; differentiates between Facebook and LinkedIn, the former existing for users’ personal presentation of online identity and the latter for promotion of their professional identity with both organisations using similar means of connectivity. However, he also asserts that both platforms have a “vested interest in pushing the need for a uniform online identity” ''(p. 200)'' which may not be in the best interests of users who may want, for example, one identity for friends and another for employers.

McLuhan's view that the &quot;medium is the message” links to your 'always-on' identity: The medium in which you use to communicate affects the message originally intended. For example, text speak is informal, thus leading to a cultural change where acronyms, such as “LOL” (laugh out loud) are used in real conversation and bad punctuation is more frequent.

====&lt;u&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan Marshall McLuhan]&lt;/u&gt;====
[[File:Marshall McLuhan holding a mirror.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Marshall McLuhan]]

McLuhan’s assertion that the 'medium is the message' seems to be becoming more evident as the technology we use is tied in with our identity and what it says about us. Three of the world’s largest technology companies, Google, Intel, and Facebook all announced, almost on the same day, that they were investing heavily in wearable technology. Google announced that it was partnering with Italy's Luxottica, the makers of Ray-Ban sunglasses and Oakley sports glasses to ensure their new smart glasses, Google Glass, were at the cutting edge of fashion &lt;ref&gt; The Guardian. (2014). Ray-Ban maker Luxottica to work with Google on Google Glass eyewear Retrieved 25/03 2014 from,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/25/ray-ban-maker-to-work-with-google-on-google-glass-eyewear &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; BBC. (2014). Facebook buys virtual reality headset start-up for $2bn. Retrieved 03/26 2014, from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26742625 &lt;/ref&gt;. Google Glass is a small screen attached to a pair of glasses which can record video, access email, and retrieve information from the web by connecting wirelessly to a user's mobile phone. Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, increased its investment in wearable technology by buying Basis Science, a company that has devices and services for tracking a person’s health, and wanted to accelerate its position in wearable technology  &lt;ref&gt; BBC. (2014). Intel buys wearable technology firm Basis Science. Retrieved 03/26 2014, from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26743537 &lt;/ref&gt;. Facebook also made a big investment in wearable technology by buying the virtual reality technology firm Oculus VR for £1.2bn and Mark Zuckerberg going as far as saying that “virtual reality will be the next social communications platform” &lt;ref&gt; The Guardian. (2014). Oculus: Facebook buys virtual reality gaming firm for $2bn Retrieved 25/03 2014 from, http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/25/facebook-buys-virtual-reality-gaming-firm-oculus &lt;/ref&gt; and will “change the way we work, play and communicate”  &lt;ref&gt; BBC. (2014). Intel buys wearable technology firm Basis Science. Retrieved 03/26 2014, from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26743537 &lt;/ref&gt;.
If these investments by the world’s largest technology companies produce a proliferation of new, fashionable, technology, the reliance on wireless technology and greater bandwidth within that technology, will undoubtedly increase.

====&lt;u&gt;[http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/hamid-van-koten/1b/40/5ab Hamid Van Koten]&lt;/u&gt;====

Van Koten’s work is of significant relevance to this development in wearable technology, particularly Facebook’s recent acquisition of Oculus VR. In the context of technology providing an extension of our social networks, Van Koten wants to uncover the ''“shift from the real to the imaginary as the dominant drive towards the consumption of these representations” &lt;ref&gt; Van Koten, H. (2009). The digital image and the pleasure principle: the consumption of realism in the age of simulation from Bentkowska-Kafel, A., Cashen, T. and Gardiner, H. (ed) Digital Visual Culture: Theory and Practice. Intellect: Bristol &lt;/ref&gt;''.
He says from a Jungian perspective, ''”games provide an outlet for the archetypal forces within the collective unconscious. Onscreen we can safely place ourselves in the role of the Hero […] alternatively, in a Freudian sense, games are a means of enacting the Oedipus complex” &lt;ref&gt; Van Koten, H. (2009). The digital image and the pleasure principle: the consumption of realism in the age of simulation from Bentkowska-Kafel, A., Cashen, T. and Gardiner, H. (ed) Digital Visual Culture: Theory and Practice. Intellect: Bristol &lt;/ref&gt; ''. Van Koten’s work build’s on that of McLuhan and it would seem with the three investments made by Google, Intel, and Facebook, the merging of games technology, which allows us to act in an imaginary world in much the same way as described in the disinhibition argument, with social media, his observation of the shift from the real to the imaginary will increase significantly.

==Introduction==

Cognitive Surplus, a term coined by Clay Shirky, is the concept of people using their mindpower to create and share content through various media platforms, particularly the internet and mobile phones, as opposed to merely being consumers of media. For example, watching television has now become so much part of our 21st century culture that over one trillion hours of free time a year is devoted to this act. However, with the presence of Web 2.0 and the increasing accessibility to and range of digital media platforms, in increasing number of people are spending this time creating and sharing content. We are motivated to do this in two different ways - intrinsically and extrinsically -and each contribution we make has a different value: personal, communal, civic or public.

==Main Concepts==

===Value===
Shirky discusses that all forms of creative acts have value, regardless of how mediocre they appear.  He claims that there is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work, and claims that even mediocre creations have value because they have at least bridged the gap between “doing anything and doing nothing” &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2010). ''How Cognitive Surplus Will Change The World''. Ted Talks. Retrieved from: http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world &lt;/ref&gt; Shirky splits this value into four groups; Personal, communal, public and civic. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2011). ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age''. London: Penguin Books, pp.173-5 &lt;/ref&gt;

*Personal - this is the basic kind of satisfaction we get from being active rather than passive. In personal value, both the participants and beneficiaries act individually, but get some kind of value our of one another’s presence. Shirky gives the example of 'lolcats' being a creative act with personal value - it has no other purpose or value other than for personal enjoyment and amusement. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2011). ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age''. London: Penguin Books, pp. 173-4 &lt;/ref&gt;
*Communal - this is something which benefits a small community of people. Shirky uses Meetup.com as an example. This is a website in which like-minded individuals can arrange a “meetup” – anything from groups of hillwakers, to book enthusiasts, to coffee drinkers. Obviously this only benefits those who are members of the site, giving it communal value. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2011). ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age''. London: Penguin Books, p. 174 &lt;/ref&gt;
*Public - Public value benefits any member of the public. It is fully interactive and is open to anyone, regardless of whether they are participants or not. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2011). ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age''. London: Penguin Books, pp. 174 &lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include blogs or news websites such as Buzzfeed, the Huffington Post and the BBC News. 
*Civic - this could be seen as a cross between public value and communal value, as it is available to anyone, but is has more of an agenda – typically improving society in some way. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2011). ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age''. London: Penguin Books, pp. 175 &lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include charities or awareness websites, such as womenkind.org which aims to improve the lives of women across the globe.

Shirky points out that although creative acts all have some kind of value, we should be more interested in those which have public and civic value because they benefit society, and are also harder to create. He points out that things with personal or communal value, such as lolcats, are never likely to go away or be under-provisioned. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2011). ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age''. London: Penguin Books, pp. 175 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Motives - Intrinsic &amp; Extrinsic===
There are two types of motivation in terms of cognitive surplus. 
Intrinsic motivation is when the satisfaction of doing an activity is reward enough for a person. 
Extrinsic motivation is when there is an external reward for an activity, such as money.&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2011). Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age . London: Penguin Books. p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This concept is linked to value, because acts with personal value can be seen to be generated by intrinsic  motivation, whereas acts with public or civic value can be seen to have been generated through extrinsic motivation, since the creator can gain a number of things through this - improved society, fame, or in some cases, money.

In 1970 psychologist, Edward Deci ran an experiment testing the motivations for why people do certain things. The experiment was on students who were asked to build shapes with seven uniquely shaped blocks. After the test Deci would leave the room for eight minutes and observe the subjects through a one way mirror. In the first instance Deci saw that the students would on average continue playing with the blocks for four minutes into the break, this will have been to satisfy their own needs to fulfil a task or because they enjoyed doing it. Deci then ran the same experiment, only this time half of the students were being paid one dollar for every complete shape that they built using the blocks. While on the break the students continued to play with the blocks for a minute more than the original test. The test was run for a third time with no reward being offered and the students on this occasion played with the block for just three minutes, so less than the original time and less than when there was money involved. This showed Deci that being offered a reward for something depressed the free choice factor of an activity and therefore showing extrinsic motivation can directly affect a person’s enjoyment of an activity. &lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2011). Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age . London: Penguin Books. p.70-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second experiment was run by Deci to test these findings, and was again done using students. Four journalism students were the subjects and were not aware that they were being observed. They were told that for every headline they wrote for the bi-weekly student newspaper, they would receive 50cents. Another four journalism students who worked on a different day and also unaware they were being tested were offered no money for their headlines, they were the control group. The group that were being paid per headline were told after four weeks that the newspaper could no longer afford to pay them, and after this the speed of their writing was used an indicator for motivation. The final results showed that a monetary reward decreased a person’s intrinsic motivation, as the headline writing speed decreased when the extrinsic motivation was taken away from the subjects. This backed up Deci’s initial findings from the previous example that one’s enjoyment can be affected by an extrinsic motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2011). Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age . London: Penguin Books. p.70-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generosity===

Shirky believes that acting in a generous manner is the basis of allowing us and encouraging others to be innovators in creating valued content.  In the past, limited opportunities in the world dictated human’s role as media consumers or ‘couch potatoes.’  With opportunities remaining few, human behaviour changed little, and as a result the status of the population as couch potatoes remained.&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2011). Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age. London: Penguin Books, pp.63&lt;/ref&gt;

New media brought about a change in this behaviour however.  The introduction of new technology such as the internet, mobile phones and laptops allowed humans the opportunity to harness their cognitive surplus. They could utilise their generosity by making content, particularly online, which would stand to help or influence others in the online spectrum or otherwise.  In the past, many believed behaviour to be a stable category – one that changed very little over time.  However, with new media bringing a drastic change of behaviour this theory has been proved wrong.  Shirky summed up this new found realisation:  “In a world where opportunity changes little, behaviour will change little, but when opportunity changes a lot, behaviour will as well, so long as the opportunities appeal to real human motivations.”  

Despite this change in behaviour, Shirky believes that these new tools haven’t caused this generous behaviour, but instead given humans a platform in which to express their generosity.  Yochai Benkler, a legal scholar at Harvard, backs up this theory.  He, along with Helen Nissenbaum - a philosopher at NYU - wrote a paper in 2006 called “commons-Based Peer Production and Virtue.”  The title is Benkler’s term for systems that rely on voluntary contributors to operate.  They conducted a study into group participation, participation which takes place in order to make these contributions, largely voluntarily, to different outlets such as Slashdot or Kuro5hin.  They explored what the social motivations were for people who voluntarily worked as part of a group on different types of tasks.  They concluded that our new communications networks encourage membership and sharing and they also provide support for autonomy and competence.&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2011). Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age. London: Penguin Books, pp.78&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of being actively part of something propels us to contribute with the tasks that needs to be achieved.  This basic human emotion existed long before the introduction of new technology.  

With this new media providing a platform for people to express their generosity, there was a rapid surge in people using their generosity in order to help others and achieve their own motivations.  One example of this is the work done by fans of singer Josh Groban, or ‘Grobanites’ as they are referred as.  The story began when a group of hard-core fans gathered together to discuss what to get Groban for his twenty-first birthday.  After rejecting several ideas they decided to make a charitable donation in his name.  They raised over $1,000 dollars at a fundraiser and donated it to the David Foster Foundation.  After seeing the success of their first fundraiser, they decided to continue their work.  They decided to aim bigger, and attempted to attract other Grobanites to meet and donate through Josh Groban’s website JoshGroban.com.  The plan worked, and from his next birthday and over the course of the year raised over $100,000.  The success of the fundraising led to the founders creating their own non-profit organisation, Grobanites for Charity.  This organisations has spanned sister organisations such as Grobanites for Charity and Grobanites for Africa.  To date, Grobanites for Africa has generated over $150,000 to help fight poverty and the effects of HIV/AIDS, with 100% of the funds raised spent to help these causes.&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2011). Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age. London: Penguin Books, pp.66-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Through this example, Shirky demonstrates how generosity is key to creating something which others will see the benefits of.  Without this generosity, we would notice a steady decline in civic content and other factors would dominate people’s motivations for making content such as economical.

===Collective intelligence===

Collective intelligence is a term coined by French social theorist Pierre Lévy in his book “Collective Intelligence: mankind’s emerging world in cyberspace” (1999). Collective intelligence is defined by Lévy as a “form of universally distributed intelligence”. Simply put, collective intelligence is based on the fact that not one person knows everything. As a group (or collective) humans must use their individual knowledge to enhance and mobilise the skills and intelligence of both themselves and others. We do this through creating systems of networked intelligence, which is made possible through computers. Through the advance of technology in society, Lévy believes that the internet and the world wide web “will serve to filter and help us navigate knowledge and enable us to think collectively rather than simply haul masses of information around with us” &lt;ref&gt;Lévy, P. (1999). ''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace''. Cambridge: Perseus Books&lt;/ref&gt;.
Our understanding of collective intelligence is core to the concept of cognitive surplus.
 
===Copyright===
A fundamental aspect of modern democracies is the recognition that products are created through creative labour, such as ideas and concepts. Therefore the copyright law came into existence in the UK in 1710 to:
*Protect the interests of authors and creators
*Ensure creators are credited for their work
*Regulate adaption, copy and fair use
*Regulate financial benefit
Copyright is a particular issue for cognitive surplus, because with so much original content being created and shared freely through digital media, problems can arise over who owns that material and who has a right to use it and distribute it, and how they are allowed to use it.

He popularised the concept of Cognitive Surplus through the publication of his book, &quot;Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age&quot;. In this book he argues that humans use their free time constructively to create value. He has written, talked about and studied Cognitive Surplus and has presented these ideas in different formats. 

====''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age'' (2010)====
In ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age'', Shirky presents the concept of Cognitive Surplus, mostly through the use of case studies. He writes about the Cognitive Surplus created by the rise of television and how the internet has influenced this.


====TED Talk: Clay Shirky: How cognitive surplus will change the world====

In June of 2010, Clay Shirky presented a TED Talk on Cognitive Surplus entitled ‘How Cognitive Surplus Will Change the World’. &lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2010). How Cognitive Surplus Will Change The World. Ted Talks. Retrieved 2nd April 2014 from: http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world &lt;/ref&gt;

Shirky divides his notion of Cognitive Surplus in to two halves; the first half regards the abundance of free time that we have in the twenty-first century as consumers of media and how we may appropriate our individual talents for the purpose of production and sharing, and the second half being the media landscape as it stands today with modern technology such as mobile phones and computers which allow us to create and share that which we create.

Once Shirky explains how we can embrace our cognitive surplus, he goes on to note the two distinct values of that which is created. He terms these as that which has ‘communal’ value and that which has ‘civic’ value. Media with communal value is that which is created to entertain and encourage discourse within a community of media consumers and contributors. Examples of media produced with 'communal' value includes ‘LOLcats’, memes and music, video, picture and text content uploaded to sites such as Soundcloud, Youtube, Flickr and WordPress. Media with 'civic' value is that which is created as an outlet for information and data sharing. Shirky gives the example of Ushahidi, a website set up by two programmers who had read the blog of Ori Okolloh, a lawyer from Nairobi, who collated information regarding the 2007 election in Kenya and the consequent outbreak of violence caused by said election. Ushahidi was used as a service which collates reports from the field, such as those posted online or shared via mobile phones and similar devices, and displays useful information on a map. The purpose of this was to collate the necessary information and display what is happening and where it is happening live.  

Shirky believes that we are entering an &quot;age of generosity&quot; as both &quot;civic&quot; and &quot;communal&quot; values are both intrinsically good and not motivated by outside factors , such as economic factors. We create and consume both, not because we are forced to but because we enjoy it. In an experiment done by professors Gneezy and Rustichini concerning the change in late pick ups at an Isreali daycare centre where one remains the same and the other is given a fine when the child is picked up late. The study showed that when the daycare centre implemented the fine late pick ups rose substantially, whereas the control group remained the same. Shirky argues that the control group, which remained the same, should have been operating without constraints. However, it dealt with social constraints instead of contractual ones. These social constraints in turn created a more generous culture. It is this social obligation that Shirky brings into his argument for Cognitive Surplus as he believes we should should be driven by social constraints and not economic ones to produce more &quot;civic&quot; content.

Shirky ends his talk by stating that although media created with the intent of civic value is obviously more useful than that which is created with the intent of communal value, each are equally valid as they both address our surplus of free time and encourage us to engage with one another and contribute to the wider media landscape.

===James Surowiecki===
James Surowiecki is a journalist and a staff writer at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Much like Lévy his work involving &quot;Collective Intelligence&quot; focuses on; opinions in a group being diverse, these opinions being independent of others within said group and that these opinions and information are specialised.

==== &quot;Wisdom of Crowds&quot;====
Not quite the idealist that Rheingold comes across as with his &quot;smart mobs&quot;, Surowiecki too recognises that &quot;groups are remarkably intelligent&quot; (2004)and that even with a disparity in intelligence and knowledge progress can still be made. Shirky's idea of Cognitive Surplus can be seen to flow in tandem with Surowiecki's thoughts due to the fact that society as a group has no linear intelligence and knowledge. Societies knowledge is diverse and independent but much of it specialised. It is this diversity and independence that allows society to produce both &quot;civic&quot; and &quot;communal&quot; values at the same time. Surowiecki puts this down to the fact that &quot;human beings are not perfectly designed decision makers&quot;(2004). Therefore, producing two forms of values.&lt;ref&gt;Suroweicki, J.(2004). The Wisdom of Crowds. Retrieved 2nd April 2014 from:http://www.asecib.ase.ro/mps/TheWisdomOfCrowds-JamesSurowiecki.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

=== David Gauntlett===
Gauntlett relates cognitive surplus to the concept of collective intelligence. Gauntlett acknowledges that the invention of the World Wide Web has made it easier for people to share and connect with each other.  However, he also attributes this to “Web 2.0”.

====Web 2.0====
WEB 2.0 “describes a particular kind of ethos and approach”.  Web 2.0 pages are used for connecting with others and sharing content&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, T. (2005). ''What Is Web 2.0''. O'Reilly. Retrieved 30 March 2014, from [http://www.oreilly.com/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html www.oreilly.com/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the content that users created before was personal websites, with a focus on searching and reading. Now, instead of creating a personal site, users start a blog which is widely connected and shared. According to Gauntlett, Web 2.0 can be used as a metaphor for any sort of collective activity in which individuals contribute their ideas to create something “bigger than the sum of its parts”. This concept relates to cognitive surplus because the creation and sharing of content creates both civic and political value, as previously described. In fact, Wikipedia itself is often cited as a prime example of cognitive surplus and indeed Web 2.0. Wikipedia exists solely on the basis of voluntary contributions from both experts and others to create the worlds’ largest encyclopaedia. Although it is simply searched and read by many, there are volumes of contributors creating new content every day in their spare time&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011). ''Making Is Connecting''. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Jaron Lanier===
Jaron Lanier studies digital media and online culture and has written several books on these topics: ''You Are Not a Gadget'' (2010) and ''Who Own the Future?'' (2013). His theories and writings have become influential in the study of digital media.

====''DIGITAL MAOISM: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism''====
In the article ''DIGITAL MAOISM: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism'' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Lanier, J. (2006) ''DIGITAL MAOISM: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism'', Edge, retrieved 30 March 2014 from http://edge.org/conversation/digital-maoism-the-hazards-of-the-new-online-collectivism&lt;/ref&gt;, Lanier presents certain concepts on online collectivism and the collective intelligence.

====Collective Intelligence====
Lanier takes a different view to Gauntlett over what he calls the new online collectivism. He acknowledges that “in some special cases the collective can be brilliant”, yet “the collective can be stupid too”. He notes that there is a problem with the growth of collaborative sites.  He exemplifies Wikipedia – it has rapidly gained importance through aggregating the content of other sites, and the knowledge of individuals. It seems that for anything to be verified as credible information, it must exist on Wikipedia. For Lanier, he has a problem with this idea, as more and more websites compete to become, what he calls, “the Meta” – “subsuming the identity of all other sites” (Lanier, 2006).

===Howard Rheingold===

Howard Rheingold is a critic, writer and teacher in the field of Digital Media. He discusses the concept and work of Smart Mobs in ''‘Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution’'' (2002). &lt;ref&gt;Rheingold, H. (2002). ''Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
====Smart Mobs====

Smart mobs are defined as a group of people who “use mobile media and computer networks to organize collective actions.” &lt;ref&gt; Rheingold, H. (2002) SMART MOBS, Edge, retrieved 2nd April 2014 from http://edge.org/3rd_culture/rheingold/rheingold_print.html &lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a community coming together to produce and share content for one another ties in with the example of Ushahidi &lt;ref&gt;Ushahidi, retrieved 2nd April 2014 from http://www.ushahidi.com/ &lt;/ref&gt; which Clay Shirky mentions in his TED Talk on Cognitive Surplus. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2010). How Cognitive Surplus Will Change The World. Ted Talks. Retrieved 2nd April 2014 from: http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world &lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Rheingold goes on to note the potential of smart mobs when he states, “Communication and computing technologies capable of amplifying human cooperation already appear to be both beneficial and destructive, used by some to support democracy and by others to coordinate terrorist attacks. Already, governments have fallen, subcultures have blossomed, new industries have been born and older industries have launched counterattacks.” &lt;ref&gt; Rheingold, H. (2002) SMART MOBS, Edge, retrieved 2nd April 2014 from http://edge.org/3rd_culture/rheingold/rheingold_print.html &lt;/ref&gt; Although many argue that his views are utopian and may never be realized entirely, the rise of ownership of personal media devices such as mobile phones, tablets and personal computers make it more accessible than ever before for smart mobs to gather information and assemble, either online or in person, for their chosen cause. A further example of this is the ‘Occupy’ movement; a smart mob who convened in agreed places across the globe to protest against government secrecy and capitalism. &lt;ref&gt; Smart Mobs.

===Abigail De Kosnik===
Abigail De Kosnik has studied the concept of &quot;Free&quot; Fan Labor within online cultures. These ideas were presented in the essays ''Interrogating &quot;Free&quot; Fan Labor'' (2013)&lt;ref&gt;De Kosnik, A . (2013)  ''Interrogating &quot;Free&quot; Fan Labor'' , Spreadable Media, retrieved 2 April 2014 from http://spreadablemedia.org/essays/kosnik/&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Fandom as Free Labor'' (2013)&lt;ref&gt;De Kosnik, A. (2013) 'Freedom as Fan Labor' in Scholz, T. (Ed.) ''Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory''. New York: Routledge. pp. 98-111&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Free Digital Labour====
The way in which we put our collective talents to work is a social issue and not entirely a personal one, but should this hard work be paid? Abigail De Kosnik presents the term 'Fandom as Free Labour. “Free” fan labor means “free” fan labor which is not paid. These fans may revise, rework, remake, and otherwise remix mass-culture texts without dreading legal action or other interference from copyright holders. Fan production is regarded as poor and of little importance or value. (Digital Labor, 2013)

However, Kosnik suggests that fandom is already monetized as the internet is not free space. Many websites that fans work on are driven by fan activity. Fans must produce for these sites and then share and consume what other fans have produced in order for these websites to be successful. Therefore, free digital labour works by fans increasing the worth of mass-media productions without receiving any pay at all. (Digital Labour, 2013)

===Tiziana Terrinova===
Tiziana Terranova also argues the internet depends on free labour. For Terranova examples of free labour that produces value for the internet can be anything from reviews to opinions to songs and images, that people produce everyday on the web. Terranova suggests that “the Internet is about the extraction of value out of continuous, updateable work, and it is extremely labor intensive. It is not enough to produce a good Web site, you need to update it continuously to maintain interest in it and fight off obsolescence.” At the moment the majority of internet users are continually updating their online content therefore keeping their websites fresh and interesting, even though they are unpaid. (Network Culture, 2004)

===Lawrence Lessig===
Lawrence Lessig (Free Culture, 2004) is a law expert based at Stanford who specialises in copyright legal history and creative commons. Lessig claims that a free culture supports and protects creators and innovators. 

Current law in relation to the growth of the web controls not just commercial creativity but of everyone. Its role is less to support creativity and a civic value and more to protect industries against competition therefore an economic value. Lessig states, ‘The technology that preserved the balance of our history – between the uses of our culture that were free and the uses of our culture that were only upon permission – has been undone. The consequence is that we are less and less a free culture, and more and more a permission culture.’ (2004: 8)

===David M. Berry===

David M. Berry is a Reader in Media and Communication at the University of Sussex. His work focuses on the methodological and theoretical challenges of studying digital media. &lt;ref&gt; Profile: David M. Berry. University of Sussex. Retrieved 4th April from http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/125219 &lt;/ref&gt;

====Creative Commons====
Berry has a pessimistic view of Lessig's idea that there should be a &quot;free culture&quot;. He feels that it only labels culture as a &quot;resource&quot;, and it can be easily controlled and owned at the expense of finding the ethical motives behind ownership. Berry argues that the Creative Commons may allow the sharing of culture resources but none of it is &quot;shared in common, nor owned in common, nor accountable to the common itself&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; Berry D. and Moss G.(2006) &quot;The politics of the libre commons.&quot; retrieved 3 April 2014 from http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1403/1321 &lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is down to private individuals to pick and choose when to reuse the commons when they so wish. In turn, blockages in creativity become a problem in the cases of lawyers due to the fact that they become mandatory passing points. This means that the &quot;ethical implications&quot; of the sharing of culture is now being restricted by legal barriers.&lt;ref&gt; Berry D. and Moss G.(2006) &quot;The politics of the libre commons.&quot; retrieved 3 April 2014 from http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1403/1321 &lt;/ref&gt;

==How Cognitive Surplus has Changed the World==

As Clay Shirky focuses on in his TED talk, civic value or civic engagement is one of the most relevant aspects of Cognitive Surplus. Nowadays, with the internet never being more accessible, people are able to communicate faster and more often. The idea of sitting on a couch and watching TV in our spare time is less appealing.  More often than not, people are coming round to the idea of using their free time in a positive way, like raising awareness on social networking sites. 

Using the internet as a prime example, it is an ideal tool to harness Cognitive Surplus. The recent Malaysian Airlines MH370 aircraft that went missing on the 8th of March 2014 caused major controversy all over the world. Mail online posted the article&lt;ref&gt; Webb, S. &amp; Shears, R. (2014) 'Web sleuths claim to have spotted missing Flight MH370: Student posts 'satellite' image showing a jet over the jungle as thousands join online search for plane' Daily Mail Online. Retrieved 3rd April 2014, from  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2583807/Did-Malaysian-fisherman-missing-flight-MH370-flying-low-Gulf-Thailand.html &lt;/ref&gt;&quot;Student posts ‘satellite’ image showing a jet over the jungle as thousands join online search for plane” written by Sam Webb and Richard Shears 10 days after the airliner went missing and it highlights Shirky’s idea that Cognitive Surplus can be used in a productive way. The article describes how thousands joined an online search for the missing flight via analysing satellite images provided by Tomnod - the official map search website set up in the hunt for the Malaysian aircraft.  Volunteers joined online communities on message boards such as Reddit to discuss potential sightings of the plane. Webb and Shears also explain that celebrities have taken to joining in the search, “offering up their suggestions” which received extensive media coverage and in turn informing more of the online search taking place. 

This online search for MH370 is proof that when given the opportunity, people are willing to use their cognitive abilities to work towards a common goal. The problem facing cognitive surplus at this time is the lack of infrastructure to enable it. Additionally, the extensive media coverage and global mystery caused by the disappearance may be an explanation for the surge in motivation for a collaborative effort.  However moving forward, the lack of incentive for people to spend their time in this way is a critical issue that will need to be addressed. As Clay Shirky originally stated: “Once you’ve figured out how to tap the surplus in a way that people care about, others can replicate your technique, over and over, around the world.” (Shirky, 2010)

==Introduction==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing Crowdsourcing] can be described as &quot;the use of mobile media to incite and organize collective action&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Rheingold, H, (2008) &quot;Mobile Media and Political Collective Action&quot; from Katz, E, Handbook of mobile communication studies pp.225-  239, USA: MIT&lt;/ref&gt; or obtaining useful information for a large and generally varied group of people, the most popular venue being the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_community online community]. This use of crowdsourcing is helpful in the modern digital age because it is able to generate large amounts of feedback or services with minimal effort. Crowdsourcing is effective in generating a wider knowledge of an event such as a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster natural disaster] or a need for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding funding] as well as compiling small bits of knowledge or labour into a larger pool. For example, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia Wikipedia] is a crowdsourced database itself.

==History of Crowdsourcing==
====The earliest recorded use of Crowdsourcing====
In the mid-19th century the creators of the 'Oxford English Dictionary' began an open search for volunteers to help identify all words in the English language and to provide quotations that exemplify their usage. Over six million volunteers responded over the course of seventy years. &lt;ref&gt; Lanxon, Nate. How the Oxford English Dictionary started out like Wikipedia. 13 January 2011. 04 04 2014 &lt;http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-01/13/the-oxford-english-wiktionary&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

====Early uses of Crowdsourcing in Business====
Minh Le, a Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver demonstrated how customers could be used to create innovations around existing products. In 1999 Le modified a video game called ''Half-Life'' and turned it into the instantly successful ''Counter-Strike''. Instead of filing a law suit against him for stealing intellectual property, the owners of ''Half-Life'' instead realised that there was profit to be made off the back of it. In 2000 the company officially released ''Counter-Strike'' and by 2003 it had quickly become the most popular game on the Internet with an estimated 2.5 Million players. This success story meant that Crowdsourcing would become a recognised strategy for many more companies in years to come. &lt;ref&gt; Howe, Jeff. Crowdsourcing: How the Power of the Crowd is Driving the Future of Business. New York: The Crown Publishing Group, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Howe, a popular academic on the subject of Crowdsourcing said in an article named 'The Rise of Crowdsourcing': &quot;Remember outsourcing? Sending jobs to India and China is so 2003. The new pool of cheap labor: everyday people using their spare cycles to create content, solve problems, even do corporate R &amp; D.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Howe, Jeff. &quot;The Rise of Crowdsourcing.&quot; Wired Magazine 14 June 2006: 1-5. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Main Concepts==
The term &quot;crowdsourcing&quot; was first used in 2005 by Jeff Howe and Mark Robinson, editors at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Magazine Wired Magazine] and a later blog post by Howe published in June 2006 gave the term a proper definition. Howe describes crowdsourcing in the following manner:

     Thus the term crowdsourcing (a term, for the record, coined jointly by Mark and myself that day, in a fit of back-and-forth wordplay).
     Simply defined, crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and 
     outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call. This can take the form of peer- 
     production (when the job is performed collaboratively), but is also often undertaken by sole individuals. The crucial prerequisite is 
     the use of the open call format and the large network of potential laborers.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Jeff. &quot;Crowdsourcing: A Definition.&quot; crowdsourcing.com. 02 June 2006 2006.Web. &lt;http://www.crowdsourcing.com/cs/2006/06/crowdsourcing_a.html&gt;.l&lt;/ref&gt;

The key ingredients of crowdsourcing according to a few dozen scholars who have published on the topic, are:

* An organisation that has a task it needs performed.
* A community (crowd) that is willing to perform voluntarily.
* An online environment that allows the work to take place and the community to interact with the organisation.
* Mutual benefit for the organisation and the community. &lt;ref&gt; C.Brabham, Daren. Crowdsourcing. Massachusetts: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;


Crowdsourcing as a method of compiling information has been gradually becoming more commonplace over the course of the 21st century to the extent that there now exists a multitude of organisations which use crowdsourcing to their advantage.

===Examples and Applications===
Wikipedia itself is one of the most relevant examples of crowdsourcing in modern society. Before crowdsourcing was established as a method of collating information, to construct the contents of an encyclopaedia one would have to consult an enormous variety of experts on a large number of different fields and areas of research. With the emergence of crowdsourcing, however, this task has been greatly simplified. Wikipedia can be accessed and edited by any expert on any subject from almost anywhere on the planet. Thus, information can be contributed to a resource such as Wikipedia with greater ease and hopefully with more accuracy than in the past, through the use of crowdsourcing. This use of [[Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/Chapter_4:_Cognitive_Surplus|cognitive surplus]] enables many people to project their ideas for the use of a greater group, making information much more available to the general public. 

====Crowdfunding====
Crowdfunding is a branch of crowdsourcing and uses the same basic principles but instead of the participants’ time, it requires their finance. There are multiple types of crowdfunding, such as for a nonprofit campaign or charity- many charities rely on regular payments of small sums of money from thousands of people. Crowdfunding for people in need or those who have done noble things can be particularly effective as it tends to trigger an emotional response from the backer. Such campaigns have a tendency to go viral and may accumulate thousands of backers in a short amount of time. 2012 London Marathon fun runner Claire Squires' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justgiving Justgiving] donation page has thus far raised in excess of £940,000 from over 80,000 backers.&lt;ref&gt;Squires, Claire. &quot;Claire's page.&quot; justgiving.com. 10 Apr 2012 2012.Web. 4 Apr 2014 &lt;http://www.justgiving.com/Claire-Squires2&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Participating in the marathon to raise money for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans_(charity) Samaritans] charity, she collapsed and died during the race.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Amelia. &quot;Claire Squires donations rocket after London Marathon death.&quot; theguardian.com. 24 Apr 2012 212.Web. 31 Mar 2014 &lt;http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/24/claire-squires-donations-london-marathon&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial crowdfunding campaigns, usually advertised on websites such as [https://www.kickstarter.com/ Kickstarter], [https://www.indiegogo.com/ Indiegogo] or [http://www.rockethub.com/ RocketHub], allow for a number of projects to become commercial success stories. Projects advertised on crowdfunding services rely on the generosity and curiosity of project backers. To entice the public to fund projects, incentives ranging from a tour of company labs to being one of the first to own the finished product are ''sold'' to backers. The more appealing the incentive, the larger the sum of money a backer is asked to donate. Many of the projects advertised on these websites would likely never have received any publicity because of how difficult they would be to fund using conventional means. Without crowdsourcing, these services would be ineffective, lacking the large-group activity that it takes to provide the projects with their funding. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch) Pebble Technology] successfully funded their project using Kickstarter and broke the record for the most money raised using the website. The company is now able to mass produce the Pebble smartwatch thanks to the project’s backers and their product is now on the market in its second iteration.&lt;ref&gt;Byford, Sam. &quot;Kickstarter funding record smashed by $3.3 million of Pebble smartwatch pledges.&quot; theverge.com. 17 Apr 2012 2012.Web. &lt;http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/17/2954187/kickstarter-record-3-3-million-pebble-smartwatch/in/2775692&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowdfunding can lead to startup companies becoming so attractive that the owners are tempted to sell to make a large financial gain, potentially upsetting early backers. This was the case recently when Facebook bought virtual reality technology firm Oculus VR for £1.2bn and Mark Zuckerberg claimed that “virtual reality will be the next social communications platform”.&lt;ref&gt;TKiss, Jemima. &quot;Oculus: Facebook buys virtual reality gaming firm for $2bn.&quot; theguardian.com. 25 Mar 2014 2014.Web. 25 Mar 2014 &lt;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/25/facebook-buys-virtual-reality-gaming-firm-oculus&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction from the early backers were mixed with some against and some in favour.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Facebook buys virtual reality headset start-up for $2bn.&quot; bbc.co.uk/news. 26 Mar 2014 2014.Web. 26 Mar 2014 And understandably so, as expanded upon in the Criticism chapter. &lt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26742625&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This example further demonstrates how crowdfunding can clearly set in motion the development of products that begin with an idea and can become part of a global means of communication, as evidenced by the acquisition of such a product by Facebook, one of the world’s largest technology companies.

====Uses in Science====
Asking large groups of people on the Internet to contribute to scientific research is still somewhat of a novel idea. In recent years however, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science citizen science] projects have taken off as crowdsourcing is used in innovative ways to excel the rate of various scientific research. Galaxy Zoo 2 was one example of a citizen science project, nearly 84,000 volunteers organised over 300,000 galaxies by answering questions about their visual forms. Each galaxy was classified roughly 44 times resulting in accurate classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Willett, Kyle W., et al. &quot;Galaxy Zoo 2: Detailed Morphological Classifications for 304 122 Galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.&quot; Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2013): 30/03/2014. Web. &lt;http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/09/15/mnras.stt1458.full&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford University is currently running a project, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home Folding@home], where users are able to donate their computers’ unused processing power to analyse data collected by the university. The researchers send small packets of data with problems that need solving to users’ computers. Once the problem is solved the data is sent away and swapped for another problem.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What if you could help find a cure?&quot; folding.stanford.edu. 2013.Web. 4 Apr 2014 &lt;https://folding.stanford.edu/#&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung too is actively engaging with crowdsourcing; collaborating with the University of Vienna in a similar way, the electronics company has created an Android app called [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.samsung.powersleep Samsung Power Sleep]. The app donates users’ smartphones’ unused processing power whilst they sleep to decrypt protein sequences. Cleverly, the app is actually also a fully functional alarm.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;So good while you sleep.&quot; samsung.com.Web. 4 Apr 2013 &lt;http://www.samsung.com/at/microsite/powersleep/en/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of the two aforementioned examples is to find cures for diseases the researcher are investigating. 

====Internet Gaming====
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(software) Steam]'s Greenlight system offers another example of modern day crowdsourcing. Through Greenlight, Steam users are allowed to upload their own games and game-related content for other users to access and use. As a result of this, the most popular Greenlight projects will be approved and given further exposure to the Steam community. Thus, Greenlight acts as a sort of filter which determines what kind of games and features of Steam are positively received by its users. Simultaneously, Steam developers are able to see what is unpopular, and alter the software in order to best suit its users' needs and demands.

==== Disaster Relief====
Crowdsourcing does not necessarily require an online community. However, it would be accurate to assume that in many cases consulting a large group of people is most efficiently achieved using the Internet. One recent large-scale crowdsourcing effort- the search for a missing [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370 Malaysian Airlines Flight 370] recruited in excess of 150,000 volunteers who combed thorough satellite imagery provided by DigitalGlobe. Volunteers visited [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomnod Tomnod], a crowdsourcing website provided by DigitalGlobe dedicated to identifying physical objects from satellite imagery to aid in search and rescue efforts. &lt;ref&gt;Martinez, Michael. &quot;Crowdsourcing search for Malaysian plane goes viral, but no luck so far.&quot; 2014.Web. &lt;http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/12/us/malaysia-airlines-plane-crowdsourcing-search/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The volunteers were able to tag objects of interest, such as rafts and oil slicks, from computers around the world. Tagged objects would be examined further and potentially forwarded to the Department of Civil Aviation. Similarly, after [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy hurricane Sandy], a large-scale damage assessment had to be carried out to direct response agencies. The Civil Air Patrol and The Federal Emergency Management Agency made 35,000 images of the affected areas public for assessment. 6,717 public volunteers rated damages on a scale of little/no damage; medium damage; or heavy damage. Interestingly, the report notes that conventionally the data would have been analysed in the same way, (also using crowdsourcing) but the analysers would have been paid. $3,000 was saved thanks to the goodwill of the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Munro, Rober, Schuyler Erle, and Tyler Schnoebelen. Aerial Damage Assessment for Hurricane Sandy. Quality Analysis After Action Report for the  Crowdsourced Aerial Imagery Assessment  Following Hurricane Sandy., 2013. 30/04/2014. Web. &lt;http://idibon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ISCRAM2013_Paper.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Crowdsourcing thus knows no boundaries in the digital age and can be legitimately called upon to help save lives. These examples explain the practice of crowdsourcing particularly well, without the combined efforts of thousands of willing volunteers, experts would likely take months to analyse the hundreds of kilometres worth of satellite imagery.

==Criticism==
Though crowdsourcing may be an easier and more accessible way to gain the opinion of many, it also presents problems. As computer scientist Jaron Lanier writes, &quot;I have attempted to retire from directing films in the alternative universe that is the Wikipedia a number of times, but somebody always overrules me. Every time my Wikipedia entry is corrected, within a day I'm turned into a film director again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://edge.org/conversation/digital-maoism-the-hazards-of-the-new-online-collectivism&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Lanier himself attempted to correct his own Wikipedia page and failed is a testament to the potential hazards of crowdsourcing. Incorrect information can be spread quickly and over large masses of people, causing a rumour to be believed and therefore effecting the quality of information used in various ways. Another related idea of crowdsourcing or using mass media negatively is that &quot;they can be used to stifle, misdirect, and demoralize those who would otherwise be involved in these activities&quot; (Rheingold, p. 17) meaning that any useful participants in certain situations can be diffused with the same ease that they can be rallied.

===Junction===
Junction is a film investment company which has been described as &quot;Kickstarter for the rich.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Child, Ben. &quot;Tom Hanks film seeks crowdfunding via 'Kickstarter for the rich' site.&quot; theguardian.com 27 March 2014. Web. Retrieved 2 April 2014. &lt;http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/27/tom-hanks-film-crowdfunding-kickstarter-junction&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to media news website [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wrap The Wrap], Junction is only available to people with an annual income of over $200,000 or a net worth of at least $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Zakarin, Jordan. &quot;New Crowdfunding Site Hosts Big Names – Tom Hanks Film Among First Projects.&quot; thewrap.com. 26 March 2014. Web. Retrieved 2 April 2014. &lt;http://www.thewrap.com/new-crowdfunding-platform-launches-hosting-campaigns-tom-hanks-aaron-paul-films/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While this approach will certainly allow Junction to pursue their projects more successfully, it can be criticised for not following the usual crowdsourcing pattern because of its exclusivity. One of the most important attributes of crowdsourcing is that it is open to everyone, a universal method of achieving goals. However Junction's method limits its members, allowing only wealthy donors. It can be argued that this is not only a flawed crowdsourcing technique, but also discriminatory towards people who may not have a high enough income.

===Going commercial===
The acquisition of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_VR Oculus VR] by Facebook was aforementioned in relation to crowdfunding leading to the development of products which could have considerable impacts on society. Success stories such as these, however, raise questions of ownership and recognition. The Oculus Rift Kickstarter page as an example had 9,522 backers who collectively financed the project with $2,437,429.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Oculus Rift: Step Into the Game.&quot; kickstarter.com. 28 Mar 2014 2014.Web. Kickstarter. 3 Apr 2014 &lt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game/posts&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Just over a year a half after the project was successfully funded, Facebook is to acquire Oculus VR in a $2 billion valuation of the virtual reality technology company.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Facebook to Acquire Oculus.&quot; newsroom.fb.com. 25 Mar 2014 2014.Web. 3 Apr 2014 &lt;http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/03/facebook-to-acquire-oculus/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; I question the ethicality of this deal; selling out is unlikely to be seen in a positive light by the backers of the Kickstarter project. Backers of these projects support the projects financially but often may not get any real value from doing so- except the satisfaction of helping a startup and the promise of an eventual product. In the case of Oculus VR, many backers are left with T-shirts and posters; comparatively underwhelming merchandise from a company which would likely not have succeeded without the backers' initial support. Crowdfunding therefore can be a fickle undertaking with backers not having any controlling interest (thus influence) in the projects they choose to fund. It is understandable how backers can feel left high and dry while the owners of the projects become wealthy and successful.

==Endorsement==
Overwhelmingly, crowdsourcing has a great value in the modern society and is used nearly every day. 
Technology has allowed humankind to advance greatly, joining us in previously unknown ways. The ability to have real-time conversations with others across the world is an innovation that has evolved rapidly over the last decade. It's easy to see how technology has &quot;the power to persuade and communicate, joined with the power to organise and coordinate, multiplied by the three billion mobile telephones in the world today poses a disruptive political potential that could equal or surpass that of the printing press, landline telephone, television or the Internet.&quot; (Rheingold, pp. 225-226). In recent elections, the ability to crowdsource has dramatically changed the results of a nation. In Ghana, cell phones were used to report fraud and illegal actions taken by the politicians themselves, or voters who wished to rig the results. Authorities can quickly become involved in matters where crowdsourcing is used because the more people that report an incident, the higher the chance that actions will be taken to remedy the situation, helping to keep governments and authorities honest by being unable to deny that events have taken place. Large companies can also use crowdsourcing to their advantage. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lush_(company) Lush ], a company devoted to quality handmade cosmetic products is involved in many charities such as [http://www.foxproject.org.uk/ The Fox Project], which aims to reintroduce foxes into the UK wilds. By buying a specific product by Lush, the charity benefits. More people know about the companies than the charities, therefore crowdsourcing can be a bolster to funds by raising awareness through the purchase of popular products.

==Future of Crowdsourcing==
In 2012 reports showed that there was an estimated 2,405,518,376 people worldwide with access to the Internet. This data indicates that there was a 556.4% increase in the number of Internet users in just two years. &lt;ref&gt; Group, Miniwatts Marketing. Internet World Stats: Usage and Population Statistics. 21 March 2014. 04 April 2014 &lt;http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt; Mark Prensky coined the term &quot;digital native&quot; to describe the 'cohorts that are coming of age in the Internet era'. It is a popular belief amongst academics that we are fast approaching &quot;the crowdsourcing generation, a demographic that is perfectly adapted to a future in which online communication will supplant the conventional corporation.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Howe, Jeff. Crowdsourcing: How the Power of the Crowd is Driving the Future of Business. New York: The Crown Publishing Group, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Howe expands on the idea of the ‘digital native’ by describing what he believes will happen in the future: “Crowdsourcing has already wreaked upheaval in a few select fields… this is because the crowd has made a once scarce resource abundant. As digital natives continue to acquire the skills it takes to build, design, and create, the scarcity of other commodities will also decline, posing great challenges to the companies that traffic in them.” &lt;ref&gt; Howe, Jeff. &quot;How the Power of the Crowd is Driving the Future of Business&quot;. London: Business Books, 2009. Print. &lt;/ref&gt;  He uses the example of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_photography stock photography] as where the crowd has caused a decline in scarcity to occur. Graphic designers found it cheaper to share images with each other, which allowed those who took photos or designed images as a hobby to also share their work– hence the need for specialists to provide stock photography declined, and the work of the hobbyists (the crowd) became an abundant resource. According to Howe, companies could face challenges such as picking the right crowd to target– he says that over a billion people are using the Internet so to attract the right people, companies need to be very selective; making sure they don’t see the crowd as a cheap workforce. Howe argues that people’s busy lives mean they would not want to spend a long time doing something unpaid for a business; having to trawl through bad contributions to get to the good ones –not all the thousands of contributions will work; and [http://www.bizbriefings.com/Samples/IntInst%20---%20Crowdsourcing.PDF others]. &lt;ref&gt; Howe, Jeff. &quot;CROWDSOURCING Why the Power of the Crowd is Driving the Future of Business.&quot; Summaries.Com. 2008. Web. 4 Apr 2014 p.9&lt;http://www.bizbriefings.com/Samples/IntInst%20---%20Crowdsourcing.PDF&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  He ends his argument about what could happen in the future by citing a quote from Thomas Malone: “Obsolescence isn’t a new phenomenon. Kids who grew up with running water wouldn’t know how to work a hand pump, and in this new world we’re entering, a lot of what’s familiar will go the way of the hand-pump.” &lt;ref&gt; Howe, Jeff. 2009. p277 &lt;/ref&gt; Basically, we could be moving into a future where the crowd is the norm for business and contemporary methods will cease to exist.

;Usage
This template is usually included by inclusion via {{tl|FUN-top}}, but is produced separately so it a can be placed on appropriate intermediate and advanced topic pages in [[Trainz]].
* When defined by '''&lt;nowiki&gt;|inhibitTOC=&lt;/nowiki&gt;''anything''''', the ''named parameter 'inhibitTOC' ''suppresses generation of a TOC local to the templates location on a page. This allows a long page to include several {{TG|I|instance}}s of the template on some long pages.

;Purpose
:This template is used with {{Tl|FUN-bot}} to set off Trainz Beginner oriented and organized Wiki pages from intermediate, or advanced topics, and ''[[:category:Trainz reference pages|Trainz reference classed topics]]'' on the Wiki. It is a multipurpose template used on many pages of the Trainz Wikibook.
;Parameters and their effects
 {{FAB-todo|Fill in some blanks and port the usage page to /docs}}
* The ''''''hold'''' parameter'' can be used to suppress the assertion of the {{tl|beginner links}} table and auto-TOCright.
&lt;pre&gt;
{{{Intro|{{{intro|}}}}}} case Intro, display Introductory Trainz Identifier page banner,
        Set up case wherein alttitle2 is armed, but conditional on 'both' parameters
        (i.e. xref2/both) and 'Intro' also being defined to assert both messages,
        as in default case.
{{FUN-beg|refs2={{{refs2|{{{both|}}}}}}
 | alttitle1 = {{{alttitle1|Introductory Trainz — page by page instruction}}}
 | alttitle2 = {{{alttitle2|Setting up Trainz properly for yourself}}}
}}&lt;!--
----&gt;|&lt;!-- otherwise
  --&gt;{{#if:{{{Intro-ref|{{{intro-ref|}}}}}}|&lt;!-- case Intro-ref, set refs2 and alttitle2
   ---&gt;
{{FUN-beg|refs2=true|alttitle1={{{alttitle1|}}}
 |alttitle2={{{alttitle2|Setting up Trainz properly for yourself}}}
}}&lt;!--
  --&gt;|&lt;!-- otherwise normal call
   ---&gt;{{FUN-beg|refs2={{{refs2|{{{both|}}}}}}
 |alttitle1={{{alttitle1|}}}
 |alttitle2={{{alttitle2|}}}
  --&gt;}}&lt;!--
 --&gt;}}&lt;!--
--&gt;}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
* It will not auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz fundamentals pages]], you must use {{Tl|FUN-bot}} to do that, which may be modified on this wiki to do page navigation.

* It can be given the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{inhibit}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to suppress the automatic assertion of {{tl|TOCright}} moving the Table of Contents to the left margin in the default position. 

* Similarly, defining the named parameter 'no' to any value totally suppresses the beginner links.

;Purpose
:This template is used with {{Tl|FUN-top}} to set off Trainz Beginner oriented and organized Wiki pages from intermediate topics, content creation, and ''[[:category:Trainz references|Trainz reference classed topics]]'' on the Wiki.

* It will also auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz fundamentals pages]]. 
:* Given either the defined parameters 'IT', 'intro-ref', or 'intro' the page is auto=categorized as well in [[:category:Introductory Trainz]].
:* Parameter 'intro-ref' also asserts the auto-[[:category: Trainz references]] for use on pages like how to set up Trainz topics, that have a valid life in appendices or references as well.

* It can be given the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; default parameter to alter the sort order of the reference page as listed in that category.

'''A contagious joy transmitting health to children''' &lt;br /&gt;
Project implemented by the [[w:Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service|Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service]] &lt;br /&gt;
Uttar Pradesh, India,  March 2014 &lt;br /&gt;
----

Sometimes, communities are sharply divided between &quot;modernists&quot; that advocate for social change and &quot;traditionalists&quot;, that favour a return to fundamental religious values and oppose all social reforms that are not in harmony with orthodox doctrines.  

Such an old ideological divide is today being bridged by organizations active in social dialogue and building awareness that &quot;change&quot; and &quot;continuity&quot; are two sides of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Defining Development|development]].  In their vision, science and spirituality are not seen as reciprocally contrasting but as different perspectives that integrate each other. 

The Indian State of Uttar Pradesh is ranked as one of the least developed regions of Asia:  Here, 1 in every 2 women is illiterate; women's life expectancy is just 59 years. And in rural areas, 1 out of 10 children die before reaching the age of one. 

We visited the [[w:Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service| Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service]], where besides spiritual and welfare activities that are typical of the Ramaskrishna Missions, a child health care programme is being successfully managed and has become a model for the whole region.  

The Ramakrishna Mission is an Indian organisation, founded in 1897 by Vivekananda, a former rationalist, who then became a disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahansa, an important Hindu mystic from Bengal. The Mission headquarters are located near Kolkata in eastern India, but associated centres exist across the world.

One of the fundamental principles of the Organization is that selfless service to others is a means for self realization; and that awareness is the primary health determinant for the individual and for the community.

The health care and education programme of the Mission in Varanasi extends beyond the city to serve a population of more than 60,000 persons living in more than 30 villages across the districts of  Mirzapur, Sonbhadra and Azamgadh.  Its activities include promoting good health, hygiene, sanitation and nutrition education amongst women and children in schools and villages.

There are Community Health Workers that live in the villages, advise the population where, when and how they can get medical and social assistance and report about emergencies in their villages. Mobile health clinics regularly visit these villages, conducting basic medical diagnosis, giving medical advice and distributing free medicines.
 
They build awareness among women on their rights and duties and how they can advocate for it, as individuals, as groups and as a community. They also train teachers for improving learning processes in schools and for making schools more child-friendly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;Periodic trends are specific patterns that are present in the periodic table, which illustrate different aspects of a certain element, including its size and its properties with electrons. When comparing the properties of the chemical elements, recurring ('periodic') trends are apparent. This led to the creation of the periodic table as a useful way to display the elements and rationalize their behavior. When laid out in tabular form, many trends in properties can be observed to increase or decrease as one progresses along a row or column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These period trends can be explained by theories of atomic structure. The elements are laid out in order of increasing atomic number, which represents increasing positive charge in the atomic nucleus. Negative electrons are arranged in orbitals around the nucleus; recurring properties are due to recurring configurations of these electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main periodic trends include: electronegativity, ionization energy, electron affinity, atomic radius, melting point, and metallic character. The periodic trends that arise from the arrangement of the periodic table provide chemists with an invaluable tool to quickly predict an element's properties. These trends exist because of the similar atomic structure of the elements within their respective group families or period and the periodic nature of the elements.&lt;/p&gt;

==Introduction==
'''Surveyor''' is the built-in ''world editing tool'' of the three [[Trainz]] {{wp|Graphical user interface}} operating environments. Like the Windows application {{TL|Content Manager}} the three GUIs draw on the Trainz local data base for asset information. Most versions of Trainz include the Surveyor module - the notable exceptions are the few &quot;driver only&quot; introductory products such as the 2005 release [[Trainz/Versions#Trainz_Driver|Trainz Driver]]. The {{TA|Route and Session Creation}} pages provides details on the fine points of how build {{TL|routes}} and their associated gameplay {{TL|session rules|sessions}} using Surveyor, whereas this module will focus on the basics with a number of examples of how to get skilled so you can fly on making your own dream railway with a different method: we're going to provide some projects and start you out modifying a stock route the way most of us learned to get good with Surveyor.

{{TrainzTip|The first thing to realize is Trainz protects you from boneheaded gaffs, and will automatically clone a built-in route should you enter one and modify it. Thereafter, it will be listed in your local content in CM with your own Trainz KUID as part of it's identifier. This forced SAVE AS protects you from overwriting the release version's stock content.
* It does not protect you from over writing yourself. Do a save as BEFORE making major changes to your route and practice suffixing a version to the name. You can weed them out later as per {{TA|Removing Unwanted Assets}}.
}}
==Tools and modes==
Surveyor has seven major tools that are accessable via hot key combinations and mouse click combinations and from the earliest Trainz Beta 0.9 release until the latest, these differ only in the sixth tab which until layers were introduced in TS2010 was for World control settings like clouds, water appearance, season of the year, time of day and the world origin. Most of these are intermediate controls that for now either will already be set up (since we're going to Look, modify, learn not create from scratch. 
* For now suffice it to say the world controls have been moved off the {{kp|F6}} tab and put into the surveyor options menu in favor of a new powerful mode tool, the Layer association tab/tool on the {{kp|F6}} tab instead.
* This tool let's the user associate assets on either a session definition (Navigation waypoints called {{TG|T|trackmarks}}, things a session Rule might test like  {{TG|T|triggers}} and {{TL|rolling stock}} in {{TG|C|consist}}s) which are integral to making up a given scenarios needs) or '''''on the 'route/map/layout'''' (track, scenery items, landscape features, interactive industries like train stations, yards, switching, and so on and so on).
==Trainz Community tutorials==

==Editable Items==
Surveyor allows the manipulation of the following aspects of the game:

* Routes
:* Ground Height
:* Ground Textures
:* Water
:* Route Layers ''(see below for layer details)''

* Sessions
:* Environmental Conditions
:* Session Rules
:* Session Layers ''(see below for layer details)''
:* Customised Initial Junction Directions
:* Customised Map Object Properties

* Per-Layer
:* Map Objects (Scenery, etc.)
:* Scenery Splines
:* Track
:* Trackside Objects
:* Trains
Content Search Filter is a powerful tool that allows you to selectively filter the items you want to find.

The Filter is opened by clicking on the Funnel Icon on the top menubar. 

For example, typing &quot;red&quot; in the Filter Window will then show only items containing the letters &quot;red&quot; in the Objects panel, Trains panel on the right hand side.

Don't forget to reset your filter when you have found what you are looking for.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;General chemistry (sometimes called &quot;gen chem&quot; for short) is a course often taught at the high school and introductory university level. It is intended to serve as a broad introduction to a variety of concepts in chemistry and is widely taught. At the university level, it is also sometimes used as a &quot;weed out&quot; course for disciplines (sometimes related, sometimes not) which are perceived to require a high level of intellectual rigor or large course loads. It is also one of the few chemistry courses in most universities that does not explicitly explore a particular discipline such as organic chemistry or analytical chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General chemistry courses typically introduce concepts such as stoichiometry, prediction of reaction products, thermodynamics, nuclear chemistry, electrochemistry, chemical kinetics, and many of the rudiments of physical chemistry. Though the list of subjects covered is typically broad, leading some to criticize both the class and the discipline as encouraging memorization, most general chemistry courses are firmly grounded in several fundamental physical rules for which the primary challenge is understanding when the rules are applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Concepts Taught ===
# '''Properties of Matter''': An explanation of the most fundamental concept in chemistry: ''matter''.
# '''Atomic Structure''': While technically in the domain of physics, ''atoms'' determine the behavior of matter, making them a necessary starting point for any discussion of chemistry.
# '''Compounds and Bonding''': Chemical ''bonding'' is introduced, which explains how less than one hundred naturally-occurring elements can combine to form all the different compounds that fill our world.
# '''Chemical Reactions''': Things get interesting once chemical ''reactions'' start making and breaking bonds.
# '''Aqueous Solutions''': Substances ''dissolved'' in water have special properties.  This is when ''acids and bases'' are introduced.
# '''Phases of Matter''': A detailed look at the ''organization of substances'', with particular focus on ''gases''.

A '''crystal''' or '''crystalline solid''' is a [[solid]] material whose constituent [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, or [[ion]]s are arranged in an [[order and disorder (physics)|ordered]] pattern extending in all three [[spatial dimensions]]. In addition to their microscopic structure, large crystals are usually identifiable by their macroscopic geometrical shape, consisting of flat faces with specific, characteristic orientations.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as [[crystallography]]. The process of crystal formation via mechanisms of [[crystal growth]] is called [[crystallization]] or [[solidification]].

Examples of large crystals include [[snowflake]]s, [[diamond]]s, and table [[salt]]. Most inorganic solids are not crystals but [[polycrystal]]s, i.e. many microscopic crystals fused together into a single solid. Examples of polycrystals include most metals, rocks, ceramics, and ice. A third category of solids is [[amorphous]] solids, where the atoms have no periodic structure whatsoever. Examples of amorphous solids include [[glass]], [[wax]], and many [[plastic]]s.

===Crystal structure (microscopic)===

The scientific definition of a &quot;crystal&quot; is based on the microscopic arrangement of atoms inside it, called the [[crystal structure]]. A crystal is a solid where the atoms form a periodic arrangement. ([[Quasicrystal]]s are an exception, see [[#Quasicrystals|below]].)

Not all solids are crystals. For example, when liquid water starts freezing, the phase change begins with small ice crystals that grow until they fuse, forming a ''[[polycrystalline]]'' structure. In the final block of ice, each of the small crystals (called &quot;[[crystallite]]s&quot; or &quot;grains&quot;) is a true crystal with a periodic arrangement of atoms, but the whole polycrystal does ''not'' have a periodic arrangement of atoms, because the periodic pattern is broken at the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]]. Most macroscopic [[inorganic]] solids are polycrystalline, including almost all [[metal]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[ice]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], etc. Solids that are neither crystalline nor polycrystalline, such as [[glass]], are called ''[[amorphous solid]]s'', also called [[glass]]y, vitreous, or noncrystalline. These have no periodic order, even microscopically. There are distinct differences between crystalline solids and amorphous solids: most notably, the process of forming a glass does not release the [[latent heat of fusion]], but forming a crystal does.

A crystal structure (an arrangement of atoms in a crystal) is characterized by its ''unit cell'', a small imaginary box containing one or more atoms in a specific spatial arrangement. The unit cells are [[honeycomb (geometry)|stacked]] in three-dimensional space to form the crystal.

The [[crystal structure|symmetry of a crystal]] is constrained by the requirement that the unit cells stack perfectly with no gaps. There are 219 possible crystal symmetries, called [[Space group|crystallographic space groups]]. These are grouped into 7 [[crystal system]]s, such as [[cubic crystal system]] (where the crystals may form cubes or rectangular boxes, such as [[halite]] shown at right) or [[hexagonal crystal system]] (where the crystals may form hexagons, such as [[Ice Ih|ordinary water ice]]).

===Crystal faces and shapes===
[[File:Crystal facet formation.svg|thumb|350px|As a [[halite]] crystal is growing, new atoms can very easily attach to the parts of the surface with rough atomic-scale structure and many [[dangling bonds]]. Therefore these parts of the crystal grow out very quickly (yellow arrows). Eventually, the whole surface consists of smooth, [[surface energy|stable]] faces, where new atoms cannot as easily attach themselves.]]
Crystals are commonly recognized by their shape, consisting of flat faces with sharp angles. These shape characteristics are not ''necessary'' for a crystal—a crystal is scientifically defined by its microscopic atomic arrangement, not its macroscopic shape—but the characteristic macroscopic shape is often present and easy to see.

[[Euhedral]] crystals are those with obvious, well-formed flat faces. [[Anhedral (petrology)|Anhedral]] crystals do not, usually because the crystal is one grain in a polycrystalline solid.

The flat faces (also called [[facet]]s) of a [[euhedral]] crystal are oriented in a specific way relative to the underlying [[crystal structure|atomic arrangement of the crystal]]: They are [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] of relatively low [[Miller index]].&lt;ref&gt;''The surface science of metal oxides'', by Victor E. Henrich, P. A. Cox, page 28, [http://books.google.com/books?id=X6x1MmPisKkC&amp;pg=PA2 google books link]&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs because some surface orientations are more stable than others (lower [[surface energy]]). As a crystal grows, new atoms attach easily to the rougher and less stable parts of the surface, but less easily to the flat, stable surfaces. Therefore, the flat surfaces tend to grow larger and smoother, until the whole crystal surface consists of these plane surfaces. (See diagram on right.)

One of the oldest techniques in the science of [[crystallography]] consists of measuring the three-dimensional orientations of the faces of a crystal, and using them to infer the underlying [[crystal system|crystal symmetry]].

[[Crystal habit|A crystal's habit]] is its visible external shape. This is determined by the [[crystal structure]] (which restricts the possible facet orientations), the specific crystal chemistry and bonding (which may favor some facet types over others), and the conditions under which the crystal formed.

===Occurrence in nature===

'''Rocks'''
By volume and weight, the largest concentrations of crystals in the earth are part of the Earth's solid bedrock.

Some crystals have formed by [[magmatic]] and [[metamorphic]] processes, giving origin to large masses of crystalline [[rock (geology)|rock]]. The vast majority of [[igneous rocks]] are formed from molten magma and the degree of crystallization depends primarily on the conditions under which they solidified. Such rocks as [[granite]], which have cooled very slowly and under great pressures, have completely crystallized; but many kinds of [[lava]] were poured out at the surface and cooled very rapidly, and in this latter group a small amount of amorphous or [[glass]]y matter is common. Other crystalline rocks, the metamorphic rocks such as [[marble]]s, [[mica-schist]]s and [[quartzite]]s, are recrystallized. This means that they were at first fragmental rocks like [[limestone]], [[shale]] and [[sandstone]] and have never been in a [[molten]] condition nor entirely in solution, but the high temperature and pressure conditions of [[metamorphism]] have acted on them by erasing their original structures and inducing recrystallization in the solid state.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rock crystals have formed out of precipitation from fluids, commonly water, to form [[druse (geology)|druse]]s or [[quartz]] veins.
The [[evaporite]]s such as [[halite]], [[gypsum]] and some limestones have been deposited from aqueous solution, mostly owing to [[evaporation]] in arid climates.

'''Ice'''
Water-based [[ice]] in the form of [[snow]], [[sea ice]] and [[glacier]]s is a very common manifestation of crystalline or polycrystalline matter on Earth. A single [[snowflake]] is typically a single crystal, while an [[ice cube]] is a [[polycrystal]].

===Organigenic crystals===
Many living [[organisms]] are able to produce crystals, for example [[calcite]] and [[aragonite]] in the case of most [[mollusc]]s or [[hydroxylapatite]] in the case of [[vertebrate]]s.</text>

=Lighting Suzanne:  Introductory one lamp lighting= 

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}}

If you have followed all these tutorials you now have quite a library of images:  A simple figure with a hat, a penguin, a volcano, a jeep and several goblets, not to mention dice, a head and a house! To show them off to best effect, you need to experiment with lighting.

'''Lighting''' is a complex subject, as any photographer can tell you.  Blender allows many different arrangements and numbers of lamps to be used in combination to light your image.  For this introductory tutorial, let us consider single lamp lighting and do some experiments to see how it works. (In later sections more complicated lighting is covered: [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Basic Lighting Rigs|Lighting Rigs]].)

__TOC__

==Suzanne, Our Star==

We need an object to light. Who better than Blender's favorite resident simian, Suzanne!  Open the default startup page.  Delete {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}} the default  cube.   Be sure the 3D cursor is at the origin.  Add a plane.   ''Add&gt;Mesh&gt;Plane'',  scale it up nice and large {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|2KEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|0KEY}}, and in the  Properties panel (which by default is the lower right panel) add a material [[File:Blender255MaterialContextButton.png ]] color such as light blue that will render well.  In that same panel be sure that under SHADOW the Receive box is checked.

Now Add Suzanne, the famous monkey.  ''Add&gt;Mesh&gt;Monkey''.  Move her up about 1.5 Blender units so she is above the plane but close to it.  {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|1KEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|.KEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|5KEY}}. Rotate her around the Z axis so she is facing the Right View.  {{B3D:N2P/Do|R}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|9KEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|0KEY}}.  Add a material [[File: Blender255MaterialContextButton.png ]] color such as red (red is my favorite color).

==The default light==

[[Image:  L01 default quad.png|thumb|left|300 px|Default Quad view]][[Image:  L02 first render.png|thumb|right|300 px|First Render]] Now lets change to the Quad view, which you should refer to extensively throughout this tutorial.  Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|QKEY}} to bring up this view.  You now have the TOP, FRONT and RIGHT ORTHO views. In the top right you will see your camera view.  Suzanne should be seen in 3/4 profile just above the plane.  If not, rotate and scroll in or out until she is.  Then I suggest you bring up the object panel {{B3D:N2P/Do|NKEY}}, scroll down to View and put a check next to Lock Camera To View.

In the outline panel, select Lamp. You will see the default lamp position.  In Ortho Quad view, we can see that the default lamp is up, in front of and slightly to the right of Suzanne as she now faces. If you don't see it, scroll out in each view window until the lamp shows up as a point with a double dashed circle around it. 

When your screen looks like the screenshot, render for the first time to get a good image of Suzanne and her shadow.

==Types of lamps==
Lamp should still be selected in the Outline panel.  In the Properties panel, click the [[File:Blender-2.5_lamp_radio_button.png]] button to see the properties of the light.  The default lamp is a POINT lamp with ENERGY 1.000.  Let's experiment with those settings.  First, click in turn each of the different kinds of lamp, SUN, SPOT, HEMI and AREA, and render after each one.  You can see that each of the light types has its own characteristics.  With the light in the default position, your images should look like this:

[[Image: A01 DEFAULTS.png|thumb|center|800 px|Comparison of light types.]]



===Point lamp===

This is the default type. The light rays are assumed to originate in a single point and spread from there.  At the default value of ENERGY 1.000 is not very bright and covers a limited area.  It casts a good sharp shadow.  Point is the basic general purpose lighting in Blender.  Advanced lighting rigs will frequently use several point lights with different settings.

===Sun===

The sun is assumed to be infinitly high in the sky so its rays are all parallel.  It puts out a bright light and casts heavy shadows.  It is the lighting type of choice for outdoor scenes but can also be used to good effect indoor.

===Spot===

The Spot lamp behaves very much like a theatrical spotlight (DUH).  It casts a limited circle of light. Within the circle it is bright and casts a heavy shadow, but outside the circle all is dark.  (Note: Under the Shadow setting, the Spot lamp is the only one that can cast a Buffer shadow. The distinction is subtle but important in some more advanced applications.)

===Hemi===

The Hemi lamp resembles lights photographers choose for indoor shots.  It is the only kind of light that does not cast shadows.  It gives a very bright lighting that is relatively even over the entire picture.

===Area===

This light behaves more like a flood light, as if the area is flooded with it.  It is extremely bright and casts a very heavy shadow.

==Light Energy==

Each type of light has its own brightness.  This is controlled mostly by the ENERGY setting of the light.  Obviously less energy reduces the amount of light, more energy increases it. Still in the Properties panel, try different settings for ENERGY and see how it affects the image.

Begin with energy increased to 2.000.  Render each type of lamp.   We can see that reacts differently to the energy settings.  Area is almost too bright at Energy 2.000, while Point and Spot are just reaching nice bright levels.  Sun is ... Sun.  Remember that it is infinitely far away and its rays are parallel.  Little changes with the Sun.  Now reduce energy to 0.300 and render each type of lamp.  Point and spot at these settings are way too dim, while Area becomes a very useable setting.

[[File:A02 combined energy.png|thumb|center|800 px|Lighting varying energy settings]]

==Distance and Height==

The distance of the lamp also affects brightness and its position affects several things, particularly including the shadows.  In the quad view, grab the default lamp and raise it up quite high, say to Z=25.  The light falls off with distance, so point becomes very dark.  The spot area increases with distance so the circle in the spot example is now quite large.  The Sun ... well, the sun was infinitely far away already, remember?  The shadow cast by the sun does not change, and hemi still casts no shadow.  But the shadow cast by the other three lights moves considerably and is now almost directly under Suzanne.

Lower the lamp to Z=3, placing it almost directly at a level with the subject.  Both the distance and the angle of light change.  The brightness increases, the size of the spot circle shrinks, and now the shadow is long and far behind the subject, except, of course, for the Sun which remains infinitely far away and casts parallel rays.

[[File:A04 combined height.png|thumb|center|800 px|Effects of height on lighting]]

==Rotation==

[[File:L11 rotations.png|thumb|right|400 px|Effects of Rotation on lighting]]

The last setting we will consider in this lesson is Rotation. The Point light cannot be rotated since it is equal in all directions.  Each of the others reacts differently to being rotated.

The Sun finally shows a different effect when rotated.  I am not sure how Blender interprets the difference between location and rotation for the Sun.  It seems rather counter intuitive. The sun when rotated seems to me to behave as if it has been moved.  But in any case you can see that the shadow and the lighting show a distinct difference.

The Spot behaves very much like a real spotlight.  Its circle of light moves with the rotation and frames whatever it is pointed at.

The Hemi lamp also finally shows a bit of difference.  Even pointing it entirely way from the subject still lets light leak through it and give that same shadowless flat lighting.

The Area lamp has its characteristic brightness over a large field, and then suddenly cuts off in to total blackness. The contrast is very striking.

==Experiment!==

You can experiment with other placements of the light, and see the effects on the illumination and the shadow.  There is an almost infinite variety of ways to light a Blender image, and this is just with a single lamp.  Multiple lamp setups increase the variety many fold as will be seen in the Advanced portion of this tutorial.

==Note on Transparency==

[[file:L09A make transparent.png|thumb|left|300 px|Where does that shadow come from?]][[file:L10 receive transp.png|thumb|right|300 px|Plane Shadows set to Receive Transparency]]
A special case of lighting is transparent objects. What sort of a shadow do transparent objects cast?  You can try an experiment.  Click on Suzanne to select her.  Now in the Material panel [[File: Blender255MaterialContextButton.png ]] scroll down to Transparency and put a check in the box.  Just below that is the Alpha setting, which controls the amount of transparency, with 1.000 being fully opaque and 0.000 being completely transparent to the point of invisibility.  Lets try setting it to 0.200 for an almost glassy effect.  Render your view, and then ask yourself, why does this glassy object still cast a thick black shadow in the render?

The answer is not in Suzanne, but in the settings for the plane which is her background.  Recall that we checked Receive under shadows for that plane. But go back to the properties panel for the plane, and notice that there is another check box under Shadows that says Receive Transparent.  By default, to save rendering time, Blender assumes that all objects block light equally.  Only if that box is checked does it make a check for transparency in the object casting the shadow.  Now render your view and you will see that the shadow is suitably glassy.

Experiment with this one.  Try different types of lamp (Area is so strong that transparent objects effectively disappear) and different values for the alpha setting.  You might want to remove the color material from Suzanne and see what effect that has.

==Note on World Lighting==

It is not absolutely necessary to use any lamp source.  In the World panel [[File:Blender255WorldContextButton.png]] you will find several lighting settings that simply produce light throughout the scene without any particular source.  Experiment with Environment Lighting and Indirect Lighting and see the effects they produce.

==Trainz Notations==
This special glossary page will assist the new reader in getting the gist of Trainz-speak. It is a terse set of other terms that are usually more fully elaborated on in the {{TL|Glossary}} and at times, given topic pages all their own for in depth exposition.

{{Trainz-stub}}

===Keypress notations===
Many Trainz functions are accessed using the mouse or hotkeys. The later change depending upon which module of the software suite is active, though commonality of purpose is preserved from application to application when there is overlap. Mostly there isn't.

==Standard Abbreviations==
* ''in this book '' &amp;mdash;means may see elsewhere, but this is what is meant here.
* ''general shorthand'' &amp;mdash;means seen often on the web forums too.
* '''Kc:, Kd:, Ks:''' Keys, usu. Hotkeys respectively in CM, Driver (DVR) or Surveyor (SUR)

There are many reasons to send e-mails from a web app, e.g., to receive user feedback or usage data of the web app. Unfortunately, JavaScript does not directly support sending e-mails. 

One solution is to use a PHP script (on a web server that supports PHP) and let that PHP script send the e-mail since PHP does support sending e-mails. In this case, all the web app has to do is to send the data to the PHP script. 

Here is an example for a simple PHP script that sends an e-mail to a hard-coded e-mail address with a hard-coded subject line. The script puts the raw data (in plain text format) that has been &quot;post&quot;ed to it into the body of the e-mail:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  if (isset($HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA)) {
    mail(&quot;my.email@example.com&quot;,
      &quot;my subject&quot;,
      filter_var($HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING),
      &quot;From: my.email@example.com\n&quot;);
  }
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Of course, you should replace the e-mail address by your e-mail address to receive the e-mails. Note that this e-mail address will be publicly visible; thus, you should use an e-mail address that you are willing to abandon in case it is abused.

The name of the PHP script should have the extension &quot;.php&quot; such that the web server can identify it as a PHP script. If you don't have access to a web server that supports PHP, you might know someone who does and is willing to host your script (at the risk that it significantly increases network traffic).

The script itself checks whether any raw data (in plain text format) has been posted to it (see below for how this is done in JavaScript). If so, it sends an e-mail with the sanitized raw data. Sanitizing is necessary to avoid abuse of the script by others. The maximum size of the raw data depends on the configuration of the web server; typically it's more than a megabyte.

In the JavaScript code of the web app, you can then send some data (here the string &lt;code&gt;&quot;my\r\ndata\r\n&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) through the PHP script (here it is assumed to be at &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;http://example.com/url/of/php/script/emailme.php&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;):
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
    httpRequest.open(&quot;post&quot;, &quot;http://example.com/url/of/php/script/emailme.php&quot;, true);
    httpRequest.setRequestHeader(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;text/plain&quot;);
    httpRequest.send(&quot;my\r\ndata\r\n&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
Of course, you should replace the URL of the PHP script to wherever your script is located and you should replace the data that is sent by any string you want to send. (Note the recommended line breaks with a return and a newline character: &lt;code&gt;&quot;\r\n&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.)

==Trainz Mice Click!==
This page is dedicated to all the new Trainzers, and to those who haven't been around for a while because the software takes a lot of learning. Here we link a page with a brief on how the mouse is used in various Trainz modules. In most cases, the use is quite instinctive, but this page gives us a way to just begin loading data into your learning curves without explaining on everypage what this stuff means.

===Mouse use notations===

# {{kp|LMB}} - Left Mouse Button, click
## In {{TL|Driver}}, will attach your external camera to a traincar, even in another {{TG|C|consist}}&lt;!--; possibly some other {{TL|Cab Mode}} actions in later developed content--&gt;. Also operates the button controls in Driver, just like Windows clickings, switch junctions using click toggle action, or (when in exernal or free camera mode) toggle/operate ''button organized controls'' like couple and decouple this or that hitch between cars.
## In {{TL|Surveyor}}, attaches (puts down something) using the active selected tool or {{TG|S|scenery object}} adder tool to the world mesh ''if in add mode''; gets asset in the various ''get'' (identify or select the same asset) ''tools'', and generally puts things down like scenery objects (buildings, bushes, animals, trees), spline objects (stretchy track, fences, telephone wires) or'' 'selects' them in some way (move this there, get that same thingy), including tools and tool panel controls.
## In {{TL|Railyard}}, controls the click driven viewing menu modes.
# {{kp|LMBH}} - Left Mouse Button, Hold
## In Driver is used to select control in Cab Mode preparatory to dragging adjustment (e.g. throttles, air brake levers, Horn or steam engine whistle, etc.)
## In surveyor is used to select vertexes or assets preparatory to dragging ({{kp|LMBHd}}) including changing surface elevations in the terrain up/down tool. [mode and tool dependent]
# {{kp|LMBHd}} - Left Mouse Button, Hold and drag 
## In surveyor and driver is used to select and move things.
## In driver is used to select and move control levers, rotate valves or the DCC mode 'virtual dial control'.    
# {{kp|RMB}} - Right Mouse Button, click
# {{kp|RMBH}} - Right Mouse Button, Hold 
# {{kp|RMBHd}} - Right Mouse Button, Hold and drag 
## In CM/CMP accesses a drop down menu, in which case you also need to drag, then release on the selection desired.
## In Surveyor and Driver - {{kp|RMBHd}} is how we move (slide or fly) around. In Surveyor (and Driver's external camera view, or free camera {{kp|4}} mode) it causes the camera position and your relative movement to operate as described in the below Tip-box, enabling us to get around in the virtual worlds of Trainz.

==Moving in Trainz==
{{TrainzTip|1=Surveyor Options menu, allows two map mode or movement controls to be modified to the users preferences. The default mode when the game first boots to operate ''many find confusing'' because the mouse controls camera position sliding, altitude, and rotation all in one, when and if panning. We recommend this combination initially for the best easiest operations: (New users have enough to get used to without the disorientation the default controls can give.) 
* Camera behavior - '''Rotation''' not Panning (default)
* Compass Movement - '''Mouse''' or Keyboard
These options are accessible  in the &lt;code&gt;Main Menu &gt; Surveyor Options&lt;/code&gt; and affect behavior in both Driver and Surveyor operations. 
* Movement around in Trainz will then become instinctive and intuitive, use the {{kp|←}} and {{kp|→}} arrow keys to rotate, the {{kp|↑}} and {{kp|↓}} keys to tilt the view, roll the {{kp|thumbwheel}} to zoom in or out. 
* The camera is offset from the screen center at all times by the combination of the {{kp|↑}} and {{kp|↓}} setting and zoom, focused away from the center aiming circle. Tilting the camera angle down, causes the camera viewpoint to rise above it's location, allowing look down viewing at most any angle. When moving tilted down, some of us call it '''''flying the route''''', for it's free as a bird with the similar viewpoint.
* Rotate relative to North-South as noted above, thereafter {{kp|RMBH}} and move the mouse away from the center aiming point will cause the camera viewpoint to slide ''proportional to the distance the mouse tip deviates from center''. It will move rapidly if you press the button farther away, so can cover ground quickly, slower if you keep it held down closer to on target. 
:* You'll also quickly learn (''to the point it becomes unconscious and instinctive'') to position the mouse tip near center screed before clicking the {{kp|LMB}} when in rhe free camera modes. That is the only mode inside Surveyor. Driver has four camera modes: In Cab, external on the consist (attached to any one car), fixed or Tracking cameras (if and when some are pre-placed by route builders), and free camera mode (you can fly or walk the ground).
:* With the wrong choice of angle and in some terrain you can teleport a mile or so in one click, so don't click on far away hills unless you want to go there!
* A single click {{kp|RMB}} off center will jump the locus to the new point off to the side in the current ({{TG|P|panorama}}) view). Rotation relative to the cartesian world (N-S) axis is fixed unless you use the arrow keys to change it.
:* This jump mode is similar in the minimap as well, on which sliding does not work. That is accessed pressing {{kp|CTRL|M}} (or just {{kp|M}} in Driver, where {{kp|CTRL|M}} also works. Click on a locus away from the aiming target/center and hop around the map in the same orientation North=to=South.
:* Roll the mouse wheel in the minimap to zoom in or expand your view outwards (so the map shows more terrain, but less detail.) It'll take only a few minutes and only a few trys to master.

{{Trainz-admin}}

==Purpose==
This associated index page is a master '''&lt;u&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/u&gt;''' page for reference material relocated into '''[[Trainz references|Trainz Wikibook Appendicyclopdeia pages]]''' whilst overhauling the dated [[Trainz]] 'beast', which was begun systematically in March 2014. Other Volumes are being created with materials on content and operations and split into other volumes...
: {{bull}} [[Trainz AM&amp;C]] (Trainz Asset Management and Creation (TA),
: {{bull}} [[Trainz Content Creation]] (TC)
: {{bull}} [[Trainz]] which will be slanted to introductory Trainz and Trainz topics, whereas the Trainz AM&amp;C deals with Tyro class or slightly advanced topics. TC intermediate and advanced Content Creation information and tutorials whilst TR are select excerpts of the uncopyrighted TrainzWiki so under the thumb of the N3V programmers. Unlike that source material, the version here is expected to contain ample examples, explanatory prose, including historical older forms and formats and other such materials which aid understanding, ease learning curves and speed mastery of the many topics in Trainz.

There are currently two glossaries to aid understanding of topics in this [[Trainz]] Book Volume
*{{TL|Glossary}}
*[[Trainz references/Steam locomotive components|Steam locomotive components]] and a template suite developed in the last few weeks to ease writing and linking Trainz Topics. See {{Tlx|TL}}, {{Tl|TA}}, {{Tl|TC}}, {{Tl|TG}}, {{Tl|TR}}, {{TL|Admin}} and {{TL|Templates}} for starters if you wish to assist in writing understandable aids to other less experienced Trainzers. Three are also templates to license images put on the Mediawiki.commons, and others to consistently categorize pages of these volumes. 

===Organization and conventions===
;for contributors, these conventions
* Excepting quotes around tag or container names in the N3V developers wiki, use the same case and titles as used therein, but for tags, add the word 'tags' if the page does not have such suffixes.
** This references has sister-levels, Kinds, Containers, Tags, and references (as a catch-all group. The later will hold more generalized formats, data references, config.txt files, etc. discussions. the first three specialize to the types as indicated.

* Make sure to enter the source page in {{Tlx|ORP-bot|src=http...}} for proper C-C-by-S-A licensing notice and cross linking. Multiple word titles as in a url should contain underscores NEVER spaces between words, or links won't work. (See {{Tl|Plain link}} or {{tl|N3V}} for more on that.)
* Always remember the mission is to present clear how to, unlike the N3V wiki, so write and explain, elaborate as necessary to assist newbie and intermediate Trainzers gain understanding and mastery.

Place full up example pages in a 'title-related' sub-page with a title {{TR|K|KIND Traincar|KIND Traincar example of Passenger Car}} or {{TR|K|KIND Traincar|KIND Traincarexample of Diesel-Electric Locomotive}} for example data types like {{TR|K|KIND}}s are sub-pages of the 'Kinds' page&amp;mdash; a division of this page. So too should you properly place an example of various examples of {{TR|K|KIND Traincar}}s while indenting in the TOC table to show the parent-child relationship. 
----
;note these links above formed as
&lt;pre&gt;
{{TR|K|KIND Traincar|KIND Traincar example of Passenger Car}}
{{TR|K|KIND Traincar|KIND Traincar example of Diesel-Electric Locomotive}}
{{TR|K|KIND}}s
{{TR|K|KIND Traincar}}s 
&lt;/pre&gt;
----
* Do install such examples as as a sub-sub-page under the sub-page [[Trainz/Kinds/KIND Traincar]] such as [[Trainz/Kinds/KIND Traincar/Kind Traincar example of Diesel-Electric Locomotive]] as is the nominal standard in the wiki.

;Purpose
:This template is used with {{Tl|ORP-bot}} to set off Trainz reference oriented and organized Wiki pages about intermediate, or advanced topics, categorized in ''[[:category:Trainz references|Trainz reference classed topics]]'' on the Wiki.

* It will not auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz references]], you must use {{Tl|ORP-bot}} to do that and more importantly acknowledge CC-by-SA-2.5 licensing for materials quoting the N3V wiki. That template may be modified on this wiki to do page to page navigation in the future as well.

'''KIND Traincar''', provides the self-definition basis for all individual train Vehicles in their {{TR|R|config.txt file}}s. For example, a single item of {{TG|R|rollingstock}}, such as a single locomotive, or a single tender begins with inclusion and proper definition of the specified requisite types in KIND Traincar.

This asset type inherits all trackside positioning and mesh display characteristics from the parent class {{TR|K|KIND Scenery-trackside}}, and adds vehicle-specific functions such as traincar physics and control mechanisms.

==KIND Hierarchy==
===Parent Classes===
* {{TR|Kinds|KIND Scenery-trackside}}
===Child Classes===
* ''none.''

==Tags Table==
Each traincar asset supports the following tags. Each tag is shown here with its default value.

==Supported Tags==
These are individual tags and their meanings.

====bogeys====
:Type: [[Bogeys_container|Bogeys Container]]
:Desc: Specifies what bogies are attached where, and with what modifiers. Documented separately [[Bogeys_container|here]].

====cabin_muffle====
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Amount that the enginesound volume should be reduced to when in-cab. Default of 0.4 is 40% volume, intended to represent a fully enclosed and noise deadened cab. Note: Steam locos have a different default. They default to 1.0 - no muffling at all. (Steam loco cabs are very frequently not fully enclosed, let alone fitted with noise deadening material.)
====cabinsway====
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Controls the amount of 'sway' the interior view has as the vehicle takes corners. A bigger number will result in more sway.

====company====
:Type: English Text String
:Desc: Text string to indicate which railway company or organisation this vehicle is in service with as represented.

====disable-extra-track-sounds====
:Type: Boolean
:Desc: Disables extra track sounds for this vehicle. Useful for making drivable ships, aircraft, road vehicles, etc. - anything that should not make wheel-on-rail type sounds.

====ditch_color====
:Type: Color(RGB)
:Desc: Color of ditch lights (values are integer between 0 and 255, comma separated for red, green, and blue).

====engine====
:Type: Boolean
:Desc: If 1, vehicle is a locomotive, if 0, vehicle is an unpowered traincar. Locomotives are expected to have cab interiors, hornsounds, enginesounds, and so on.

====enginesound====
:Type: KUID
:Desc: [[KIND Enginesound|Enginesound Asset]] to use with this locomotive.

====enginespec====
:Type: KUID
:Desc: [[KIND Engine|Enginespec Asset]] to use with this locomotive. Defines locomotive performance characteristics.

====flash_scale====
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Sets the speed that the ditch lights flash at.

====fonts====
:Type: Integer
:Desc: Number of running-number fonts to use on this locomotive.

====fonts-path====
:Type: Text
:Desc: Asset name to use when determining where running numbers are stored. This will be concatenated with &quot;_alpha_numbers&quot; to work out the path to the images to be used for the running numbers.  For example if the supplied name is &quot;my_loco&quot; then the path, from the asset folder, will be &quot;my_loco_alpha_numbers&quot;.

====high_beam_value====
:Type: Decimal array
:Desc: Comma separated sequence of decimal values - used to configure the brightness of the lights when in high beam mode. First number applies to first headlight point, and so on. Values are divisors - e.g. a value of 2 means half brightness.

====hornsound====
:Type: KUID
:Desc: [[KIND Hornsound|Hornsound Asset]] to play when locos horn is blown.

====light_color====
:Type: Color(RGB)
:Desc: Color of headlight (values are integer between 0 and 255, comma separated for red, green, and blue).

====low_beam_value====
:Type: Decimal array
:Desc: Comma separated sequence of decimal values - used to configure the brightness of the lights when in low beam mode. First number applies to first headlight point, and so on. Values are divisors - e.g. a value of 2 means half brightness.

====mass====
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Mass of the vehicle in Kilograms when empty - i.e. the tare weight, not the gross weight. The mass of any products loaded into queues will be added to this by the game.

====max-coupler-gap====
:Type: decimal
:Desc: Specifies the amount of permissible coupler slack on this vehicle in Metres. Note: The observable slack between any two vehicles will be the average of the values for each vehicle. Cannot be zero.

====max-tractive-effort====
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Maximum tractive effort this vehicle can put into the track in Newtons. (Only used for Diesel and Electric locos - Steam locos use a different system defined in the enginespec.)

====pantograph====
:Type: KUID
:Desc: [[KIND Pantograph|Pantograph Asset]] to attach to pantograph attachment points.

====real-engine====
:Type: Boolean
:Desc: This will enable an unpowered vehicle to have an audible horn and visible headlights when set to 0. This is useful for cab cars, driving trailers, and unpowered end cars of multiple units.

====smoke_fastlife====
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Length of time (seconds) smoke particles will exist for when vehicle is moving 'fast'.

====smoke_fastspeed===
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Speed (m/s) at which traincar is considered to be moving 'fast'.

===smoke_height===
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Additional speed for 'slow' smoke to make it drift higher from the traincar.

===smoke_random===
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Controls the amount of randomness introduced into the direction of new smoke particles. Larger numbers == more randomness.

===smoke_shade===
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Value in the range (0.0 .. 1.0) which controls the color (including Alpha - so 0.0 will be transparent, 0.1 a dark mist, 1.0 a thick white) of each smoke particle. The alpha value will decay to zero (transparent) over the life of the particle.

===smoke_slowlife===
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Length of time (seconds) smoke particles will exist for when vehicle is moving 'slow'.

===tender===

:Desc: Used by the AI to determine if it should take this vehicle with the loco when doing orders like 'run round'.

===use-coupler-sounds===
:Type: Boolean
:Desc: Enables or disables the coupler slack sounds for this specific vehicle.

==Obsolete tags==

====origin====
:Type: Text
:Desc: ''Obsolete''

====paintshed-template-used====
:Type: KUID
:Desc: ''Obsolete''. Was KUID of paintshed template used to create this reskin - used by Paintshed to reload the reskin for further editing.

====paintshed-skin-used====
:Type: KUID
:Desc: ''Obsolete''. Was KUID of paintshed skin used to create this reskin - used by Paintshed to reload the reskin for further editing.

====product-id====
:Type: Text String
:Desc: ''Obsolete''. Was used by Paintshed to indicate that this asset was for use with paintshed.

====product-type====
:Type: Text String
:Desc: ''Obsolete''. Was used with Paintshed, to mark out a traincar as being repaintable in paintshed, but not for placement in-game.

====product-version====
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: ''Obsolete''. Was the version number of Paintshed that the model was intended to be used with.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Consider some limit

&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

which cannot be evaluated directly, that is, either f(a) = g(a) = 0 or

&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to a} g(x) = \lim_{x\to a} g(x) =  \infty&lt;/math&gt;

L'Hopital's rule says that 

&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

Suppose both are equal to zero. The Newton definition of the derivative is

&lt;math&gt; f'(a) = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

&lt;math&gt; \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)} =  \lim_{x\to a} \frac{\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}}{\frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x-a}} = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{g(x) - g(a)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)} = \frac{f(a)}{g(a)} = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}&lt;/math&gt;

Now suppose that both &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g&lt;/math&gt; diverge to positive or negative infinity. Another way to define the derivative is by

&lt;math&gt; f'(a) = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{f(x+a)}{x} &lt;/math&gt;

Then

&lt;math&gt; \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}  = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{xf(x+a)}{xg(x+a)} = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{f(x+a)}{g(x+a)} = \frac{f(x+a)}{g(x+a)} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cell Fractionation==

===Purpose===
Cell Fractionation is a standard procedure used to separate subcellular organelles based on how cells differentially separate in a centrifuge. Organelles separate in a centrifuge based on density, shape, and size. The nuclues is typically the first organelle to become pelleted in a centrifuge. 

The central piece of equipment in cell fractionation is a centrifuge. A centrifuge is a piece of equipment that spins rapidly and thus adds a centripetal force on the object that is spinning. All particles in the centrifuge will feel the same force being applied, but those that are more dense will move much faster through the liquid and sediment with less force than particles that have lower densities.

The centrifugal (or centripetal) acceleration is usually expressed as multiples of the acceleration of gravity. For example, if the centrifuge is exerting the same force that gravity would exert, then it is expressed as 1 G. If it's exerting a force 10 times stronger than gravity, then it is expressed as 10 G. The relative centripetal acceleration (commonly called the Relative Centrifugal Force)can be calculated using the formula 
RCF= (r X RPM&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; X (2π)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; * (100/36))/(1000&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; X g)
Where:
*r = the radius in centimeters of the sample from the center of the centrifuge
*RPM = Revolutions Per Minute
*g = gravitational constant (9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
This equation is usually reduced to RCF = 11.19 X r X (RPM/1000)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

If your centrifuge will not obtain the specified RCF, then you may be able to compensate by centrifuging for a longer time. For example, if a procedure calls for centrifuging with an RCF of 10,000G for 60 seconds, but your centrifuge can only obtain 9,000 G, you may be able to compensate for this by centrifuging for 67 seconds.
The equation to determine the compensation time required is:
t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = (t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; X RCF&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)/RCF&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;
Where:
*t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = the time required in your centrifuge
*t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = the time specified in the instructions
*RCF&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = The RCF specified in the instructions
*RCF&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = The maximum RCF your centrifuge can obtain

Differential Sedimentation:
:Separation of cellular organelles is possible because particles tend to sediment at different rates. There are several factors that determine the sedimentation rate. 
* Density: All other things equal, the more dense a particle is, the faster it will sediment. However if a particle is the same density as the liquid in the sample, then it will not sediment at all. If, however, the particle is less dense than the liquid medium (as is the case with oils and lipids when placed in water), it will move to the top of the medium. 
* Size: All other things equal, the larger a particle is, the faster it will sediment. If two rocks of different size, but the same density are dropped off of a boat, the larger rock will tend to sink faster. This is because there is more mass (assuming density is equal) on which gravity can act. The larger mass can more easily overcome the friction of the water and sink faster. This does not mean that gravity acts differently on different masses. It is simply another way of describing the action of the medium that it is passing through. A single feather will fall slower than a bag of feathers. However, in a vacuum, they would fall at the same speed. 
* Viscosity: The viscosity (or thickness) of the liquid medium can slow the rate of sedimentation. If two particles are relatively close in size and density and only have small differences, it may be possible to separate them from each other by increasing the viscosity of the liquid medium. 

This procedure allows isolation of the cell nuclues, mitochondria, and cell membrane.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Not sure how to edit the title of the page and link it properly. I tried following the format that I had seen on another section, but it ended up looking much different.

I need some help! I don't know how to set up equations. If someone could explain to me how to do it, then I would appreciate it.
Also, I know I put a lot of stuff in this article about centrifugation. Perhaps it should be moved into the &quot;basic&quot; section of this book. IDK, any thoughts are appreciated

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &amp; 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century western imperialism was not the first example of the attempt by powerful nations to completely subjugate the peoples of a variety of ethnicities, nationalities and cultures.  Numerous civilizations dating back to and even before ancient Mesopotamia sought territorial expansion and the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples.  However, beginning in the mid-19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, a combination of factors led western Europe, the United States and Japan to engage in global territorial conquest on a scale never before seen.  Competition for territories in Africa, Asia, the Pacific Rim region and, to a much lesser extent, South America brought about as complete a domination of the globe's resources and peoples such that the ancient Greeks, Romans and Mongols could only have dreamed of, let alone achieved.  The examination of this era of &quot;New Imperialism&quot; requires consideration of not only the causes and effects of western empire building.  It also requires an examination of the responses by the various peoples from around the world who saw their land, their culture and their society completely altered by the demands of their new imperial overlords.

Britain Conquers India

India and China were key trading destinations for Europeans for centuries prior to the mid-19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Spices, opium, indigo and, tea were high-priced, highly-prized trading commodities for the British, Dutch, French and Portuguese, all of whom established trading posts in both countries during the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries.  However, by the mid-18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, Britain broke away from the &quot;pack&quot; and established hegemony over large swaths of India as the result of several European wars whose reach extended to the Indian sub-continent.

&lt;!--{{TOCright}}--&gt;
The '''ACS Text Format''' is an Auran-defined international languages supporting text format used for storing {{TR|R|config.txt file}}s and other generic key/value data. At the simplest level, an ACS Text file is a standard text file encoded in {{wp|UTF-8 |UTF-8}}. It is typically recommended that an ACS Text file start with a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark Unicode BOM sequence] (Byte Order Mark), however that is not strictly required, but will be noticeable in many config.txt files as a invisible code occupying the first line of the file.

==Basic File Structure==
;In programmer jargon
ACS Text files contain an ''unordered list of '''key-value''' pairs''. In any given processing scope, each key '''must''' be unique. A key-value pair can be declared in {{plain link|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form|Extended Backus&amp;mdash;Naur Form}} (EBNF) ({{wp|Metasyntax}} forming a context-free grammer) as follows:

 &lt;singlespace&gt; ::= ' ' | &lt;TAB&gt; ;
 &lt;whitespace&gt; ::= &lt;singlespace&gt; | { &lt;singlespace&gt; } ;
 &lt;line-start&gt; ::= { &lt;whitespace&gt; | &lt;EOL&gt; } ;
 &lt;key-value-pair&gt; ::= &lt;line-start&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;whitespace&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;EOL&gt; ;
 &lt;acs-text-file&gt; ::= [ &lt;unicode-bom&gt; ] { &lt;key-value-pair&gt; } &lt;line-start&gt; ;

It is important to note that the &lt;value&gt; may span multiple lines in some cases.
* (I've been programming since 1976, and ''even my eyes glaze over reading and trying to understand that''... so we write for you here in the Wikibook!)

;In layperson terms
Auran/N3V have set up a system of data structures where there are pairs and values, and some values are complex types which can include other simple and complex types.
{{TextBox|These later are called {{wp|data structure}}s like {{wp|struct}}s, {{wp|union type|unions}}, or {{wp|array}}s in many languages&amp;mdash;especially {{wp|The C Programming Language|C-language}} derived {{wp|computer language}}s and are generally just lumped together as '{{TA|containers}}' in Trainz. When you see a container containing a container you are dealing with a structure part of which is another structure type, such as arrays (e.g. passenger lists product types) or bogeys (trucks, which specify wheels, X,y,z factors of mount points, type of mounting, etc., but all data which is related to the other factors so ''''''is grouped together'''''' since it is used together and that's the way we humans think of it best too.)
}}
==Keys==

A '''key''' ('''key name''') is a sequence of unicode characters with a maximum size of 511 bytes. Control characters ({{wp|ASCII}} 0..31) and the space character (ASCII 32) are not permitted. Uppercase ASCII characters (ASCII 64..89) are not permitted. The open-brace character (ASCII 123) is not permitted as the first character of a key. The close-brace character (ASCII 125) is not permitted.

For future compatibility, it is strongly recommended that implementations limit keys to the following set of characters when constructing an ACS Text file. Implementations '''must'' accept all valid characters when parsing an ACS Text file.
* 'a' .. 'z'
* '0' .. '9'
* '-'
* '/'
* '_'
{{TextBox|Note these key omissions: '\', ':', ';', '`', '~',, '@', '*', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&amp;', '{', '[', ')', ']'
}}
==Values==

Each value may include zero or more UTF-8 characters. Several types of value are available with unique encodings. Value types are automatically identified based on the contents of the value, no type information is written into the file. 

 &lt;value&gt; ::= &lt;null-value&gt; | &lt;numeric-value&gt; | &lt;numeric-array-value&gt; | &lt;string-value&gt; | &lt;kuid-value&gt; | &lt;container-value&gt; ;

==Null Value==

A null value is literally a zero-length value.

 &lt;null-value&gt; ::= [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] ;

===Numeric Values===

A numeric value is an integer or decimal representation.

 &lt;number&gt; ::= [ &quot;-&quot; ] &lt;digit&gt; { &lt;digit&gt; } [ &quot;.&quot; &lt;digit&gt; { &lt;digit&gt; } ] ;
 &lt;numeric-value&gt; ::= &lt;number&gt; [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] ;

===Numeric Array Values===

A numeric array value is a sequence of multiple numbers, separated by commas.

 &lt;array-separator&gt; ::= [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] &quot;,&quot; [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] ;
 &lt;numeric-array-value&gt; ::= &lt;number&gt; &lt;array-separator&gt; { &lt;number&gt; &lt;array-separator&gt; } &lt;number&gt; [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] ;

===String Values===

A string value is a sequence of zero or more UTF-8 characters, surrounded by quotation marks (ASCII 34.) The use of the double quote character (ASCII 34) and the backslash character (ASCII 92) ''are proscribed''. Strings may continue over multiple lines and may include whitespace (including the newline or CR-LF ASCII EOL sequence). The delimiting value is the enclosing quote marks.

 &lt;string-value&gt; ::= &lt;double-quote&gt; { &lt;string-character&gt; } &lt;double-quote&gt; [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] ;

==KUID Values==

A KUID value is a single KUID in a [[KUID|kuid valid format]].

 &lt;kuid-value&gt; ::= &lt;KUID&gt; [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] ;

===Container Values===

A container value nests additional key-value pairs over multiple lines.

 &lt;container-value&gt; ::= [ &lt;EOL&gt; ] &quot;{&quot; &lt;EOL&gt; { &lt;key-value-pair&gt; } &lt;line-start&gt; &quot;}&quot; ;

==Key Ordering==

The 'ACS Text Format' is technically an unordered key-value soup, however all existing implementations are order-preserving for trivial (read, write) operations. It is recommended that future implementations maintain this convention.

==Format Violations==

The effect of a format violation detected during parsing is undefined. An implementation which follows this specification must not generate a file which violates any aspect of this specification.

I'm a biology major recently accepted to Medical School.

I just discovered Wikibooks and would like to donate some time and energy into improving biology texts. 

Like I said, I'm new and wikibooks is not at all intuitive. There will be a learning curve, but grace is appreciated</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;This template does nothing.

More exactly, it outputs the [[w:null string|null string]]. It's useful for programming advanced templates.

*It often is used within a template to the right of an equals sign. 
*It can be''very useful'' in (usually temporary pending a revision, or to troubleshoot template behavior) killing part of template or page containing text and (''especially multiple'') html comments (&amp;lt;!--- some commented stuff ---&amp;gt;) surrounding the combined strings and multiple lines inside the template, which feeds them ... nowhere. Into the mythological bit bucket. 

==Alternatives==
It's also possible to use &lt;code&gt;{{x|ns|ns:0}}&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{void}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

Some [[mw:Magic words|magic words]] like {{x|END}} might also have the desired effect of doing nothing.

All other sequence attributes (rate, velocity, lifetime, minsize, maxsize) are interpolated so there are smooth transitions between phases. If the mode is set to anim, start is a value from 0.0 to 1.0 which describes the start time into the object’s animation cycle. If the mode is set to timeofday, start is a value from 0.0 to 1.0 which describes the time of day when this effect will start.

==Introduction to the KIND Hierarchy==

'''KIND TrainzBaseSpec''' provides the basis definitions for all Trainz asset types in all {{TR|R|config.txt}} {{wp|ini file}}s. The TBS provides for a number of &quot;Standard Tags&quot; which are common to (''or at least, can legally be defined'') for any and ''all Trainz assets''. 
* Some of these are mandatory, for they determine the further processing of the asset and the interpretation of the config.txt file and the assets data in its folder.
* However most are optional and a defining line using the tag may be omitted in most sub-assets.
==Depreciated tags==
The following'' 'de facto TrainzBaseSpec tags' ''are obsolescent by programmer fiat in TS2009-SP0 and after releases and will generate errors if the asset is upgraded to {{TR|t|trainz-build}}s V2.9 and greater data models:
* '''asset-name''' &amp;mdash; V1.3&amp;ndash;v2.8 &amp;mdash;found historically in virtually all scenery, spines, and Trackside assets.
* '''region''' &amp;mdash; V1.3&amp;ndash;v2.8 &amp;mdash;a former filter modifier, amd found historically in virtually all assets, but were especially prevalent in rolling stock, scenery, spines, Track types (including tunnels and bridges) and Trackside assets. 
:* Map assets still retain the keyword Region which has and was defined to be a {{TR|K|KIND region}} kuid reference.
:* Any region tag to a text string is obsolete after the TRS2006 spinoffs.

* '''type''' &amp;mdash; V1.3&amp;ndash;v2.8 &amp;mdash;a former filter modifier, amd found historically in virtually all assets, but were especially prevalent in rolling stock, scenery, spines, Track types (including tunnels and bridges) and Trackside assets&amp;mdash;found historically in virtually all date-worthy assets.
:* Replace with string-array type {{TR|T|category-era}} with no whitespace and semi-colons between date codes; these are given as full four digit decade numbers followed by a 's' (Small Ess) suffix.
:* Whitespace in the string array will cause an error
* types '''category-region-nn''' &amp;mdash; V1.3&amp;ndash;v2.8 &amp;mdash;found historically in virtually all local-worthy assets.
:* Replace with string-array type {{TR|T|category-region}} with no whitespace and semi-colons between the two character country codes enumerated in that afore-referenced tag page; these are given as full two uppercase letters comprising {{TN|E|enumerated}} codes followed by a ';' separator between codes, but not at the last before the terminal end-quotes.
:* Whitespace in the string array will cause an error, including at the end.

===Parent Classes===
* None. KIND TrainzBaseSpec is a '''root class''' from which other Trainz Asset classes are derived. They are said to be derived because they inherit processing attributes and values defined by the parameters listed herein.

===Child Classes===

The {{TR|Kinds|KIND TrainzBaseSpec}} supports the following tags in a {{TA|config.txt file}}. {{FAB-todo|Did I ... Each tag is show here with its ''default value''}}:

&amp;nbsp;
===kind===
:''type:'' string.
:''desc:'' The asset type which this {{TL|config.txt file}} represents. See the list: {{TR|Kinds|KIND_TrainzBaseSpec#Table_of_KIND_Child_Classes|here (above)}}

===kuid===
:''type:'' {{TG|K|KUID}}
:''desc:'' The unique asset ID referencing this asset.

;KUID
:'' 'Koolthingz Unique IDentifier'.'' A unique database reference number for an asset, extended to track multiple versions in the KUID2 form. The heart and soul of Trainz upgradability, and modular design of assets, as each asset has it's own unique kuid code, so one can specify a component (bogeys) or entire Traincar from another, and selectively replace eit'''her in a new asset (re-skin or modified truck). Most Trainz assets specify list of dependencies&amp;mdash;other component assets which are assembled by the various parts of the software suite to make up a renderable and useable asset in a {{TR|containers
|kuid-container}}.

;KUID2
: A updated and update tracking modified version of the KUID format which allows a version number to be specified. A &lt;code&gt;&lt;kuid:xxx:yyy&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the same as saying &lt;code&gt;&lt;kuid2:xxx:yyy:0&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (Zero revisions or version zero, '''''meaning the original''''')
:* This allows data items (Trainz Assets) to carry an inherent version code for the asset. This will not generally match the {{N3V|Trainz-build|Trainz-build code}} identifying the software technology levels, but indicates previous versions history.
:* Assets having a higher suffixed code in the KUID2 override or replace older assets, given both the assets in the data base. Having an early version is not necessary but {{TL|CM}} will list the missing chain of revisions as missing dependencies, a software bug to those who resent the contamination of that facility in CM or 'feature' kept as is by the programmers, in any respect reducing the utility of using CM to identify what a user is missing, and causing users to spend time manually figuring out what is really what.
''

===[[Trainz/tags/trainz-build tags|trainz-build tag]]===
;make redirects:
: ''[[Trainz/references/trainz-build tag]], &lt;br/&gt;[[Trainz/trainz-build tag]]''
:''type:'' One decimal point floating point number {{TG|E|Enumerate}}d by N3V to track and identify data types corresponding to the technical level of the evolved software. 
:* Each legal value must exactly match a released Trainz version number. 
::* Values are Trainz 1.0=v1.0, Trainz 1+SP1 =V1.1, TRS2004-sp0 = v2.0 then incremented, where each is incremented by 0.1 from 2.0 to present releases (v3.7 = TS12-SP1). {{TG|H|Hotfixes}} do not change version numbers.
:::* with these exceptions:
:::: V1.4 was Paintshed's release 
:::: the gap between 1.5 and 2.0 was either foreign language releases, or as seems likely, unused.
::* from v2.0 ({{TL|Appendices|TRS2004}}) onwards the Trainz-build tag number values have been continuous though non-monotonic Trainz TS09-sp3&amp;mdash;TS09-sp4 share some {{N3V|trainz-build|Trainz-build}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/Trainz-build &quot;Trainz-build&quot; tag] direct link&lt;/ref&gt; values overlap
:''desc:'' '''The file format version to which this asset is built''' (and archived) not necessarily anything to do with technology levels used by the asset, but corresponds to the asset level assigned by creating an asset in {{TA|Content Creator Plus}}&amp;mdash;the same as will be found in the title bar of {{TL|CM}}.
* This number should generally be set to the Trainz version number of the Trainz installation on which the asset is being created and tested. Some asset kinds are parsed significantly differently depending on their ''trainz-build'' version tag. NOTE: The ''{{TR|S|trainz-build|p=trainz-build tag}}'' is compulsory. If not specified, Trainz will make a primitive attempt to guess at a legacy Trainz version based on the contents of the {{TR|R|config.txt_file}}.

===script===
:''type:'' string filename.
:''desc:'' Indicates the filepath of the primary script file for this asset, if any. This filepath should always end in a &quot;.gs&quot; extension - the runtime will attempt to add or substitute a &quot;.gs&quot; extension if the filepath has an alternative extension.

===class===
:''type:'' string.
:''desc:'' Indicates the script class name to load as the primary class for this asset, if any. This class is loaded from the primary script file for this asset.

===script-include-table===
:''type:'' The {{TR|C|script-include-table container}}.
:''desc:'' A key-value table of scripted assets which are searched for script includes when compiling this asset's script file(s). The key is currently unused but must be unique; the value indicates the KUID of the asset to include.

===username===
:''type:'' UTF-8 string, {{TR|Tags|&quot;@Username&quot; tag}}.
:''desc:'' The '''English''' human-visible name for this asset. This field should never contain non-English text, except where the asset name is a Proper Noun (eg. a place name) with no English localized variant.

===username-XX===
:''type:'' UTF-8 string, {{TR|Tags|&quot;@Username&quot; tag}}.
:''desc:'' (Where ''XX'' is replaced with the appropriate {{N3V|localization code}} for the language being represented.) The localized human-visible name for this asset. This field is similar to the ''username'' field except representing a non-English locale. Multiple ''username-XX'' tags may be present in an asset, once for each supported locale. If the appropriate 'username-XX' tag is not present to represent this asset on a given end-user system, the English ''username'' tag is used instead.

===description===
:''type:'' UTF-8 multi-line string, {{TR|Tags|&quot;@Description&quot; tag}}.
:''desc:'' The '''English''' human-visible descriptive summary for this asset. This field should be kept to a short (1-2 paragraph) blurb describing the asset. Extended details should be provided via an ''info-url'' page. This field must be comprised of English descriptive text, although the text may reference non-English Proper Nouns as explained above.

===description-XX===
:''type:'' UTF-8 multi-line string, {{TR|Tags|&quot;@Description&quot; tag}}.
:''desc:'' (Where ''XX'' is replaced with the appropriate {{N3V|localization code}} for the language being represented.) The localized human-visible descriptive summary for this asset. This field is similar to the ''description'' field except representing a non-English locale. Multiple ''description-XX'' tags may be present in an asset, once for each supported locale. If the appropriate 'description-XX' tag is not present to represent this asset on a given end-user system, the English ''description'' tag is used instead.

===string-table===
:''type:'' UTF-8 string list container, the {{TR|Tags|&quot;@String-table&quot; container}}.
:''desc:'' A key-value list of '''English''' strings. Each key is a meaningful script identifier. Each value is an '''English''' string. As described above, an English string may comprise of or reference a non-English Proper Noun.

===string-table-XX===
:''type:'' UTF-8 string list container, the {{TR|Tags|&quot;@String-table&quot; container}}. 
:''desc:'' (Where ''XX'' is replaced with the appropriate {{N3V|localization code}} for the language being represented.) This field is similar to the ''string-table'' field except representing a non-English locale. Multiple ''string-table-XX'' tags may be present in an asset, once for each supported locale. Each should contain a list of strings with the same Keys as in the ''string-table'' list, but with different Values. If the appropriate 'string-table-XX' tag is not present to represent this asset on a given end-user system, or the appropriate string is missing from the that list, the English ''string-table'' container is referenced instead.

===kuid-table===
:''type:'' KUID list container, the {{TR|Tags|&quot;@Kuid-table&quot; container}}.
:''desc:'' A key-value list of assets upon which this asset is dependent. The keys may be any unique value (typically, sequential integers if the keys are meaningless, or script identifiers if the asset is to be referenced from script.)   Entries in this table serve two purposes - firstly, to ensure that the game systems are aware of the dependency such that installing and loading this asset will successfully install and load any dependencies, and secondly to allow scripts to locate relevant child assets. Only first-level dependencies are included.  Circular dependencies are legal.  An asset cannot be listed as a dependency if it is also marked as an obsolete version of this asset.  An asset cannot be listed as its own dependency.

===obsolete-table===
:''type:'' KUID list container, the {{TR|Tags|&quot;@Kuid-table&quot; container}}.
:''desc:'' A key-value list of assets which are made obsolete by this asset. Any attempt to load an asset referenced in this list will result in this asset being loaded instead. The assets referenced in this list must have the same creator as this asset. It is illegal for two assets to both mark a third asset obsolete, unless one of the two also marks the other as obsolete. Circular obsolete references are illegal. All lower-numbered KUID2 versions of this asset are implied as obsolete and need not be included in this list.  It is illegal to mark a higher-numbered KUID2 version of this asset as obsolete as that creates an implicit circular reference.

===category-region===
:''type:'' string-array.
:''desc:'' A list of two-character {{TR|s|category-region}} codes, separated by semi-colons (';'). No other characters (including whitespace, etc.) should be present in the string. This asset is considered relevant to each of the specified regions - this is most relevant for {{TR|Kinds|KIND Traincar}} and {{TR|Kinds|KIND MOSignal}} assets, but may be supplied for any asset.

===category-class===
:''type:'' string.
:''desc:'' A single 2-3 character {{TL|references|Category Class}} code which describes this content item. The ''category-class'' tag is used to provide additional human sub-categorization beyond what is implicit from the Asset Kind. Note that many category-class codes are only relevant to specific Asset Kinds - category-class codes must not be applied to assets of an inappropriate Kind.

===category-era===
:''type:'' string-array.
:''desc:'' A list of five-character {{TR|s|era code}}s, separated by {{wp|semi-colon}}s (&lt;b&gt;';'&lt;/b&gt;). Each era code represents a decade as an 's' terminated, four digit integer (e.g. &quot;1990s;2000s;2010s&quot;), a token which must be an exact match for one of the specified legal {{TR|references|era code}}s. No other characters (including whitespace, etc.) should be present in the string, including at the end before the terminating double-quote character. The only meaning of this asset is to other humans, that this asset is considered valid and appropriately relevant in the specified era range.

===category-keyword===
:''type:'' UTF-8 string.
:''desc:'' A list of natural-language keywords, separated by semi-colons (';'). No other characters (including whitespace or irrelevant punctuation) should be present in the string. These keywords form the basis for asset keyword searching. The asset's name need not be repeated in the ''category-keyword'' list. Various {{TR|references|default search keywords}} are supplied automatically based on the asset type.

===custom-category-list===
:''type:'' ascii string.
:''desc:'' A list of custom category identifiers, separated by semi-colons (';'). Each {{TL|references|custom category identifier}} should be a short (eg. 3-6 character) alphanumeric token. No other characters (including whitespace) should be present in the string. These custom categories are used to enable scripts to rapidly locate certain classes of asset. It is strongly recommended that new custom category identifiers are introduced sparingly. The ''custom-category-list'' tag value may have no more than 64 characters total. This tag should be left blank unless there is an existing specific script requirement that can only be fulfilled via the custom-category-list approach.

===must-have-product-rights===
:''type:'' ascii string.
:''desc:'' A list of required product rights, separated by semi-colons (';'). If the local installation does not have the required product rights then the asset may not be loaded by certain game systems.

===must-not-have-product-rights===

__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;

The SQL standard knows three kinds of data types
:* predefined data types
:* constructed types
:* user-defined types.

This page presents only the '''''predefined data types'''''. ''Constructed types'' are one of ARRAY, MULTISET, REF(erence) or
ROW. ''User-defined types'' are comparable to classes in object-oriented language with their own constructors, observers, mutators, methodes, inheritance, overloading, overwriting, interfaces and so on.

== Overview ==
The standard groups predefined data types into types with similar characteristics.

*Character Types
:*Character (CHAR)
:*Character Varying (VARCHAR)
:*Character Large Object (CLOB)
*Binary Types
:*Binary (BINARY)
:*Binary Varying (VARBINARY)
:*Binary Large Object (BLOB)
*Numeric Types
:*Exact Numeric Types (NUMERIC, DECIMAL, SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT)
:*Approximate Numeric Types (FLOAT, REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION)
*Datetime Types (DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP)
*Interval Type (INTERVAL)
*Boolean
*XML

Character types hold printable characters, binary types any binary data. Both may have a fixed or variable size with an upper limit. If the upper limit exeeds a certain value the type is a 'large object' with special methods and functions. 

Exact numeric types hold numeric values without digits after the decimal or with a firm number of digits after the decimal.

Approximate numeric types hold numeric values with an implementation defined precision (after the decimal).

Temporal types hold values for INTERVAL (a certain range on the time bar), DATE (year, month, day), TIME with and without TIMEZONE (name of timezone, hour, minute, second including fraction) and TIMESTAMP with and without TIMEZONE (name of timezone, year to second including fraction).

The boolean data type holds the two values ''true'' and ''false''.

Part 14 of the SQL standard extends the list of predefined data types by introducing the data type XML (Oracle calls it XMLType) together with a bunch of particular functions. Columns of this type hold XML instances.

In the outdated SQL-2 standard there was a data type 'BIT'. This data type is no longer part of the standard.

Most DBMS implement the majority of predefined data types, but there are some exceptions. Also the naming differs slightly. An overview about the major implementations is available in the wikibook [[SQL_Dialects_Reference]].

Data types are used within the CREATE TABLE statement as part of column definitions - or during CAST operations.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE &lt;tablename&gt; (
  &lt;column_name&gt; &lt;data_type&gt; ... ,
  &lt;column_name&gt; &lt;data_type&gt; ... ,
  ...
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Character ==
A series of printable characters - which is a string - can be stored within character types. If all rows of a table use the same fixed size for the strings, the data type is &lt;code&gt;CHAR(&lt;n&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;n&gt; is the size of the strings. If the size varies from row to row, the data type &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR(&lt;n&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; defines that '''up to''' &lt;code&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;/code&gt; characters can be stored in the column. So &lt;code&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;/code&gt; defines the upper limit for this column. The maximum value for &lt;code&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;/code&gt; depends on the used DBMS implementation. If applications need to store longer strings than it is allowed by this upper system limit, the data type &lt;code&gt;CLOB&lt;/code&gt; must be used. Also &lt;code&gt;CLOB&lt;/code&gt; has it's own upper limit, but this is significantly greater than the upper limit of &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table with columns of fixed and variable size strings and a CLOB string
CREATE TABLE datatypes_1 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 CHAR(10),       -- exactly 10 characters
  col_2 VARCHAR(150),   -- up to 150 characters
  col_3 CLOB            -- very large strings (MySQL denotes this data type: 'LONGTEXT')
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Binary ==
Binary data types are similar to character data types. They differ in that they accept a different range of bytes. Binary data types accept all values.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table with columns of fixed and variable size binary data and a BLOB
CREATE TABLE datatypes_2 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 BINARY(10),     -- exactly 10 byte
  col_2 VARBINARY(150), -- up to 150 byte
  col_3 BLOB            -- very large data: jpeg, mp3, ...
);
&lt;/source&gt;

A hint to Oracle users: The data type &lt;code&gt;BINARY&lt;/code&gt; is not supported, the data type &lt;code&gt;VARBINARY&lt;/code&gt; is denoted as &lt;code&gt;RAW&lt;/code&gt; and is deprecated. Oracle recommends the use of &lt;code&gt;BLOB&lt;/code&gt;.

== Exact Numeric == 
Exact numeric types hold numeric values without digits after the decimal or with a firm number of digits after the decimal. All exact numeric types are signed.

&lt;code&gt;NUMERIC(&amp;lt;p&gt;,&amp;lt;s&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DECIMAL(&amp;lt;p&gt;,&amp;lt;s&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; denotes two types which are nearly the same. &amp;lt;p&gt; (precision) defines a fix number of all digits within the type and &amp;lt;s&gt; (scale) defines how much of them resides behind the decimal place. Numeric values with more than (p - s) digits before the decimal place cannot be stored and numeric values with more than s digits after the decimal place are truncated to s digits after the decimal place. p and s are optional. It must always be: p ≥ s ≥ 0 and p &gt; 0.

SMALLINT, INTEGER and BIGINT denotes data types without a decimal place. The SQL standard did not define their size, but the size of SMALLINT shall be smaller than the size of INTEGER and the size of INTEGER shall be smaller than the size of BIGINT.


&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table using five exact numeric data types
CREATE TABLE datatypes_3 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 DECIMAL(5,2),    -- three digits before the decimal and two behind
  col_2 SMALLINT,        -- no decimal point
  col_3 INTEGER,         -- no decimal point
  col_4 BIGINT           -- no decimal point. (Not supported by Oracle.)
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Approximate Numeric ==
Approximate numeric types hold numeric values with an implementation defined precision (after the decimal). All approximate numeric types are signed. Their primary use cases are scientific computations.

There are three types: &lt;code&gt;FLOAT (&amp;lt;p&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DOUBLE PRECISION&lt;code&gt;, where p denotes the garanteed precision of the &lt;code&gt;FLOAT&lt;/code&gt; data type. The precision of &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DOUBLE PRECISION&lt;/code&gt; is implementation defined.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table using the approximate numeric data types
CREATE TABLE datatypes_4 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 FLOAT(2),     -- two or more digits after the decimal place
  col_2 REAL,
  col_3 DOUBLE PRECISION
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Temporal ==
Data types with respect to temporal aspects are: &lt;code&gt;DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;INTERVAL&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; stores year, month and day. &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt; stores hour, minute and second. &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; stores year, month, day, hour, minute and second. Seconds can contain digits after the decimal. &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; can contain the name of a TIME ZONE.

The SQL standard defines two kinds of INTERVALs. The first one is an interval with year and month, the second one is an interval with day, hour, minute and second.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table using temporal data types
CREATE TABLE datatypes_5 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 DATE,                       -- store year, month and day (Oracle: plus hour, minute and seconds) 
  col_2 TIME,
  col_3 TIMESTAMP(9),               -- a timestamp with 9 digits after the decimal of seconds
  col_4 TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,   -- a timestamp including the name of a timezone
  col_5 INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH,
  col_6 INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND(6)   -- an intervall with 6 digits after the decimal of seconds
);
&lt;/source&gt;

A hint to Oracle users: The data type &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt; is not supported. Use &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; instead.

A hint to MySQL users: The use of TIME ZONE as part of data types is not supported. MySQL implements a different concept to handle time zones. Fractions of seconds are not supported. The data type &lt;code&gt;INTERVAL&lt;/code&gt; is not supported, but there is a data value &lt;code&gt;INTERVAL&lt;/code&gt;.

== Boolean ==
SQL has a 3-value-logic. It knows the boolean values &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;. Columns of the boolean data type can store one of the two values &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; is represented by storing no value, which is the NULL value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table with one column of boolean
CREATE TABLE datatypes_6 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 BOOLEAN     -- not supported by Oracle
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== XML ==
Part 14 of the SQL standard extends the list of predefined data types by introducing the data type XML. The standard also defines a wide range of particular functions for this data type.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table with one column of data type XML 
CREATE TABLE datatypes_7 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 XML
);
&lt;/source&gt;
A hint to Oracle users: The data type &lt;code&gt;XML&lt;/code&gt; is denoted as &lt;code&gt;XMLType&lt;/code&gt;.

A hint to MySQL users: The data type &lt;code&gt;XML&lt;/code&gt; is not supported.

== Domains ==
In the context of data types the standard knows ''domains''. The purpose of domains is to constrain the set of valid values that can be stored in a column. The domain-concept is a very early predecessor of user-defined types and may be outdated.

== Clean Up ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
DROP TABLE datatypes_1;
DROP TABLE datatypes_2;
DROP TABLE datatypes_3;
DROP TABLE datatypes_4;
DROP TABLE datatypes_5;
DROP TABLE datatypes_6;
DROP TABLE datatypes_7;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exercises ==
&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Create a table 'company' with columns 'id' (numeric, primary key), 'name' (strings of variable size up to 200), 'isin' (strings of length 12), 'stock_price' (numeric with 2 digits before and 2 after the decimal), 'description_text' (a very large string) and description_doc (any binary format).
&lt;/div&gt;

There's a mention in the text that this is content from MSDN, and it seems that it is at least partially copied (see [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cx9s2sy4.aspx here]). Clearly any verbatim copied text should be deleted.

      <comment>/* Geologic Time */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Geologic Time ==
Geologic time can be measured in two very distinct ways: [[relative dating]], which involves placing geologic events in sequential order, and [[absolute dating]], which utilizes radioactive decay to quantify the number of years that have passed since a particular geologic event. When assessing geologic time, these two fundamentally different ways of measuring geologic time must work in tandem to reveal a more complete understanding of Earth processes.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Cells Turn Nutrients into Usable Energy =

Cells manage a wide range of functions in their tiny package — growing, moving, housekeeping, and so on — and most of those functions require energy. Cellular nutrients come in many forms, including sugars and fats. In order to provide a cell with energy, these molecules have to pass across the cell membrane, which functions as a barrier — but not an impassable one. Like the exterior walls of a house, the plasma membrane is semi-permeable. In much the same way that doors and windows allow necessities to enter the house, various proteins that span the cell membrane permit specific molecules into the cell, although they may require some energy input to accomplish this task.

Complex organic food molecules such as sugars, fats, and proteins are rich sources of energy for cells because much of the energy used to form these molecules is literally stored within the chemical bonds that hold them together. Scientists can measure the amount of energy stored in foods using a device called a bomb calorimeter. With this technique, food is placed inside the calorimeter and heated until it burns. The excess heat released by the reaction is directly proportional to the amount of energy contained in the food.

In reality, of course, cells don't work quite like calorimeters. Rather than burning all their energy in one large reaction, cells release the energy stored in their food molecules through a series of oxidation reactions. Oxidation describes a type of chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred from one molecule to another, changing the composition and energy content of both the donor and acceptor molecules. Food molecules act as electron donors. During each oxidation reaction involved in food breakdown, the product of the reaction has a lower energy content than the donor molecule that preceded it in the pathway. At the same time, electron acceptor molecules capture some of the energy lost from the food molecule during each oxidation reaction and store it for later use. Eventually, when the carbon atoms from a complex organic food molecule are fully oxidized at the end of the reaction chain, they are released as waste in the form of carbon dioxide.

Cells do not use the energy from oxidation reactions as soon as it is released. Instead, they convert it into small, energy-rich molecules such as ATP and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), which can be used throughout the cell to power metabolism and construct new cellular components. In addition, workhorse proteins called enzymes use this chemical energy to catalyze, or accelerate, chemical reactions within the cell that would otherwise proceed very slowly. Enzymes do not force a reaction to proceed if it wouldn't do so without the catalyst; rather, they simply lower the energy barrier required for the reaction to begin.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Cancer Classification =

Cancers are classified in two ways: by the type of tissue in which the cancer originates (histological type) and by primary site, or the location in the body where the cancer first developed. This section introduces you to the first method: cancer classification based on histological type. The international standard for the classification and nomenclature of histologies is the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3).

= Classification by tissue types =
From a histological standpoint there are hundreds of different cancers, which are grouped into six major categories:

* Carcinoma
* Sarcoma
* Myeloma
* Leukemia
* Lymphoma
* Mixed Types (Blastoma)

= Classification by site of origin =

By primary site of origin, cancers may be of specific types like breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer), oral cancer, brain cancer etc.

= Classification by grade =
Cancers can also be classified according to grade. The abnormality of the cells with respect to surrounding normal tissues determines the grade of the cancer. Increasing abnormality increases the grade, from 1–4.

Cells that are well differentiated closely resemble normal specialized cells and belong to low grade tumors. Cells that are undifferentiated are highly abnormal with respect to surrounding tissues. These are high grade tumors.

* Grade 1 – well differentiated cells with slight abnormality
* Grade 2 – cells are moderately differentiated and slightly more abnormal
* Grade 3 – cells are poorly differentiated and very abnormal
* Grade 4 – cells are immature and primitive and undifferentiated

= Classification by stage =
Cancers are also classified individually according to their stage. There are several types of staging methods. The most commonly used method uses classification in terms of tumor size (T), the degree of regional spread or node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M). This is called the TNM staging.

For example, T0 signifies no evidence of tumor, T 1 to 4 signifies increasing tumor size and involvement and Tis signifies carcinoma in situ or limited to surface cells. Similarly N0 signifies no nodal involvement and N 1 to 4 signifies increasing degrees of lymph node involvement. Nx signifies that node involvement cannot be assessed. Metastasis is further classified into two – M0 signifies no evidence of distant spread while M1 signifies evidence of distant spread.

Stages may be divided according to the TNM staging classification. Stage 0 indicates cancer being in situ or limited to surface cells while stage I indicates cancer being limited to the tissue of origin. Stage II indicates limited local spread, Stage II indicates extensive local and regional spread while stage IV is advanced cancer with distant spread and metastasis.

To say happy birthday to your friends, family or someone in Bahasa Indonesia, you can say '''''selamat ulang tahun'''''. Selamat meaning Congratulation and Ulang tahun meaning Birthday, so litterally meaning in english is Congratulation for your Birthday.

=='''How old are you?'''==

Do you remember numerals in Bahasa Indonesia, if you don't, you can check your lesson, because we wil use it. So how we asking ''How old are you'' in Bahasa?. Look the sentences below:
# Berapa usia anda? (formal, polite)
# Berapa usia kamu? (informal, standard)

Please carefully to whom you are talking, if you are talking with a older people than you, you should you the polite form, never use it informal form to people is older than you. You can use the informal form to your friends or people younger than you.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| Berapa usia kamu?   || How old are you? (informal)
|-
| Berapa usia anda?   || How old are you? (formal)
|-
| Saya 27 tahun    || I'am 27 years old
|-
| Saya berumur 20 tahun   || I'am 20 years old
|-
| Umur saya 17 tahun    || My age is 17 years old
|-
| Kamu berumur berapa?   || How old are you? (informal)
|}Note: Indonesia has 2 way to say age there are Usia and Umur. There is no rule for that, you can use one of them, because if you use umur or usia, Indonesian will understand what do you mean. 

==My age is .....==
If you don't remember numerals in Indonesia, look at the table below:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-

|}

formal form :
            ==&gt; subject + prefix ber- + umur + (age) + tahun &lt;==
           ex: saya berumur 20 tahun (i'am 2 years old), or

           ex: umur saya 20 tahun (i'am 20 years old), or

You're the only person from the group I can find on here. And I've no idea if I'm doing this right... [[User:Cir00004|Cir00004]] ([[User talk:Cir00004|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cir00004|contribs]]) 15:54, 18 March 2014 (UTC)


oh hey, whats up [[User:Heyrach|Heyrach]] ([[User talk:Heyrach|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Heyrach|contribs]]) 15:46, 19 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Hollie - George from Megabytes team here - we are doing Always On too - so we're happy to contribute to your stuff - feel free to contribute to ours as well! Our usernames are: StineEliseJ (Elise); Kellymcdonach (Kelly); GemmaMiller (Gemma); Ania-polish accent (Ania); amandajayner (Aj) and George Berrie (that's me). I'll put the same message on your team mates' discussion pages too to see if we can get some cross-team contributions going. Cheers.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 15:09, 27 March 2014 (UTC)


Hey,Hollie. I think just fleshing out the entire page with things we think are missing is all that's really needed at this stage too. I'll probably look at the theorist sections the closest to try and help write a concise summary. Like I said, I already wrote a little bit about Zizek but I don't think there's enough on him to merit his own section. [[User:Cir00004|Cir00004]] ([[User talk:Cir00004|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cir00004|contribs]]) 20:16, 1 April 2014 (

Hi there Hollie :) Just to let you know that I've put up a little lesson plan type thing on my discussion page for our group presentation. It's super vague but it's a starting point to help us think about how we want to structure things and what we want to say. Have a look and I look forward to seeing what you think and hearing any ideas you have! [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

I've also just started our groups little movie thing I was telling you guys about after the seminar. So far it looks pretty good! I'm just making it to be an introduction to the subject and we can develop the actual topic during the seminar itself but I think it's just a interesting thing to add that people might find a little different and hopefully enjoyable :) [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

== Setting out topics ==

Each person in our group should take a specific topic... but we should try and make them all link together, so we should discuss what major topics there are or what we even may be interested in doing and then we can discuss those topics on each persons page and then link our own topics to them too so that we have a large range of knowledge.. am I making sense. I don't mind looking at any topic, I am quite happy with whatever topic. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:30, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Some topics that could be focused on are the main concepts of Always-On (introducing the topic), key theorists and theories behind the topic (danah boyd, Sherry Turkle, 'tethered'), as well as key terms such as blurred boundaries, ubiquitous, disinhibition, and context cues. Just a few ideas, hoping everyone else has more. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 17:42, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

I think I wan't to have a look at context cues for a little because it's something I never understood 100% in class so this will be good for me to help understand it more... Are you familiar? Give me an outline of what it is? [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 12:50, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I haven't looked at context cues in too much detail, but from what I can gather it basically means that there are certain cues in reality about how we should act - eye contact, inviting someone to a conversation, facial expressions. However, in the virtual world we don't have those so there is a clear lack of them meaning that people may act in ways they don't in person - abruptly, rudely, uninvited etc. Does that make sense? I feel I'm explaining it very long-windedly. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 12:14, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

===Comments===

Hi, I'm Gemma from the Megabytes, we've not heard back from other groups yet but were just wondering what referencing style your group were intending to use. Wiki states that they have no set referencing style yet they like users to keep it consistent (See here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf). Our group thought it would be easier just to stick with APA as that is the set referencing style for Media modules. What do you guys think? Look forward to hearing from you. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 15:23, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi there Gemma, this seems to be the referencing style most others groups are using, so i'm guessing it's okay to use and lie you said it keeps things nice and consistent. I'd say go ahead! It's the style I'll be using from now on anyway... [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

Yeah APA has been used already throughout the page and is easier to stick to, I also think it makes referencing a little easier. I will also have a look at what other groups are doing though... so we can try and see if we can be consistent throughout the wiki book.

== Sherry Turkle ==

Sherry Turkle was another key theorist associated with &quot;Always on&quot; culture and, specifically related to 'the tethered self'. Sherry Turkle was a professor at the Massachusetts institute of Technology. 

&quot;We are tethered to our 'always on/always-on-us' communications devices and the people and things we reach through them: people, Webpages, voice mail, games, artificial intelligences... they live for us through our tethering devices, always ready-to-mind and hand.&quot; (Turkle, &quot;The Tethered Self&quot;)

== Main Concepts ==

'''Life On the Screen'''

Part of her work was based around computers and the effect they have on us. She developed the ideas of 'cyberspace' - a place where we can, every day, go to interact and connect with people anywhere- and develop relationships with them online. In her piece 'Life on the Screen: Identity in the age of the internet' she said human beings were changing and adapting due to the 'fading boundary' between computers and real life. This related to the 'Always on' Culture as it is adding to her work on looking into the relationship between humans and their technology. 

The concept of being able to go on at any time to speak to someone any where gives the idea of being 'Always on' and in this sense, with a computer. Always having access to these online worlds and being able to be reached from people even when we are not there, we are stil 'always on'. 

'''The Second Self'''

Turkle developed more ideas about the computer and how it is more than a tool now but an actual part of our everyday lives. In 'The Second Self' Turkle conducted interviews as part of her research, this showed that computers are both part of ourselves and part of the external world. 

More ideas here that link in with the concept of being 'Always on' and that computers are part of us and part of our daily lives. We are constantly on-line and connected to them.

'''Alone Together'''

Turkle published a book in 2011 called 'Alone Together' which was a study on technology and how it is effecting our generations. This is where the main ideas of 'tethering' and 'Always on' culture arose from her. She made points about how we are more connected now than what we have ever been but with that we are still alone. We are replacing our social interactions- conversations and intimacy with texting and communicating through computer use. 

She gave a talk through the website TED called &quot;Connected, but still alone?&quot; here she discussed some of the main points from the book. She talked about the ideas of communication and how it changed who we are and what we do and so we are developing social problems when it comes to being offline. We are now expecting less from each other and more from our technologies altering our relationships and friendships in the outside world and we are also losing valuable skills in conversation and social behaviour do to our new forms of connection and technology.

===Discussion===
Hey, in reply to the comment you left on my discussion, I agree, they are important to include as well.  I focused on the tethered self the most but it would be useful to incorporate the ideas you mentioned.  I think it would be a good idea to at least mention and explain her ideas about it.  Have you researched it yet? [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 15:59, 1 April 2014 (UTC)
Hey Hollie, After you mentioned it to me, I have now added a section to my discussion page about The Second Self and linked that to the idea of Always on Culture. Feel free to edit it and change bits according to the information you have found. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 21:57, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Hollie - agree with your comments re the Glossary. I've had a go at tidying up the References section - putting it into alphabetical order etc - but haven't checked the actual formatting.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 13:00, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey Hollie, I am a little confused about how we are referencing the wikibooks?? Also to we quote or paraphrase things we have read?? Any help would be great [[User:Heyrach|Heyrach]] ([[User talk:Heyrach|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Heyrach|contribs]]) 13:22, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey Hollie, the information you have is great too! [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:05, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Hollie - responded to your referencing query on the Always On discussion page you mentioned - agree with your comments - in view of time left I think we just ask Kelly to get on with doing what she suggests - it would make it consistent and that is the important thing.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:56, 2 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

==Online Identity Project==

Hi, Imara! As I was saying earlier today, I thought about something that might be useful for your bit about blending identities and online dating and that's Tinder! Tinder's based on our Facebook profiles, which sort of make people trust it a bit more since it seems to be authentic online identity. But it only uses your FB pictures, interests and friends, but it does allow you to register even if you don't have any FB friends. So you could basically create a totally new FB profile just for Tinder and use somebody else's pictures for it, meaning that it's not as authentic as people think. I don't know if that's relevant to what your doing and you don't have to write anything about it, but I thought it was interesting haha.

= Topics Related to Always-On Culture =


==Online Identity==

-Being “always-on” leads to the constant overlapping of the user's real life identity and online one. Is the user's online identity any less 'real' than their 'real life' identity? Is it maybe just different in as much as they think a lot about what they display about themselves before putting it online, but in face-to-face encounters it is much more 'real time' and they are perhaps a bit more vulnerable to show themselves in a less-than-ideal way - albeit showing a more 'natural' self?

-Online identity is about portraying of self as a living-out of states of being, becoming, belonging and behaving through the range of everyday social and discursive practices that are connected with the body. Yet it is also a close editing of self: ‘it’s me, but minus the things I don’t like about me’ – those aspects of self chosen to be shared with the public. (Thomson, Angela (2007). 'Youth Online. Identity and Literacy in the Digital Age'. p 9) ([[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 23:13, 1 April 2014 (UTC))

-“Always-on” meaning that some feel the need to “check-in”, update their internet status, upload pictures from their real life to portray a specific online identity.  ''(Mendelson, A.L &amp; Papacharissi, Z. 2010. ‘Look at Us: Collective Narcissism in College Student Facebook Galleries’ from &quot;A Networked Self&quot;)''.

-These activities may take up a lot of time and be of great importance to individuals in order to determine an online identity which is always-on and available to access (i.e. Impression Management).

-Always-on with regard to texting, Facebook, email etc. will all contribute to your online identity as they are managed by you and reflect you as a person whether it is informally with friends (text, Facebook) or for a more professional purpose (email, LinkedIn).
José van Dijck (van Dijck 2013) differentiates between Facebook and LinkedIn, the former existing for users’ personal presentation of online identity and the latter for promotion of their professional identity with both organisations using similar means of connectivity. However, he also asserts that both platforms have a “vested interest in pushing the need for a uniform online identity” (p. 200) which may not be in the best interests of users who may want, for example, one identity for friends and another for employers.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 12:31, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

==Technological Determinism==

-Always-on culture bringing about a big cultural shift relating to communication which has been determined by innovations in media technology where the user has the ability to be connected to the internet at all times.

-Technology has the power to transform culture, society and way people look at the world. Due to the advance in technology, people have developed a greater need to be connected to other people via mobiles/computers/tablets and are more likely to share experiences through these forms of communication than face-to-face.

-“Medium is the message” linking to your always-on identity: The medium in which you use to communicate affects the message originally intended. For example, text speak=informal, and has led to a cultural change where “Lol” is used in real conversation and bad punctuation is more frequent.

===&lt;u&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan Marshall McLuhan]&lt;/u&gt;===


[[File:Marshall McLuhan holding a mirror.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=A]]
[[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 19:00, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

McLuhan’s assertion that the medium is the message seems to be becoming more evident as the technology we use is tied in with our identity and what it says about us. Three of the world’s largest technology companies, Google, Intel, and Facebook all announced, almost on the same day, that they were investing heavily in wearable technology. Google announced that it was partnering with Italy's Luxottica, the makers of Ray-Ban sunglasses and Oakley sports glasses to ensure their new smart glasses, Google Glass, were at the cutting edge of fashion (The Guardian, 25th March, 2014; BBC 25th March, 2014). Google Glass is a small screen attached to a pair of glasses which can record video, access email, and retrieve information from the web by connecting wirelessly to a user's mobile phone. Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, increased its investment in wearable technology by buying Basis Science, a company that has devices and services for tracking a person’s health, and wanted to accelerate its position in wearable technology (BBC 26th March, 2014). Facebook also made a big investment in wearable technology by buying the virtual reality technology firm Oculus VR for £1.2bn and Mark Zuckerberg going as far as saying that “virtual reality will be the next social communications platform” (The Guardian, 25th March, 2014) and will “change the way we work, play and communicate” (BBC 26th March, 2014).
If these investments by the world’s largest technology companies produce a proliferation of new, fashionable, technology, the reliance on wireless technology and greater bandwidth within that technology, will undoubtedly increase.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 11:27, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

===&lt;u&gt;[http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/hamid-van-koten/1b/40/5ab Hamid Van Koten]&lt;/u&gt;===

Van Koten’s work is of significant relevance to this development in wearable technology, particularly Facebook’s recent acquisition of Oculus VR. In the context of technology providing an extension of our social networks, Van Koten wants to uncover the “shift from the real to the imaginary as the dominant drive towards the consumption of these representations” (Van Koten 2009: p. 89)
He says from a Jungian perspective,” games provide an outlet for the archetypal forces within the collective unconscious. Onscreen we can safely place ourselves in the role of the Hero […] alternatively, in a Freudian sense, games are a means of enacting the Oedipus complex” (Van Koten 2009: p.96). Van Koten’s work build’s on that of McLuhan and it would seem with the three investments made by Google, Intel, and Facebook, the merging of games technology, which allows us to act in an imaginary world in much the same way as described in the disinhibition argument, with social media, his observation of the shift from the real to the imaginary will increase significantly.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 12:40, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

===&lt;u&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier Jaron Lanier]&lt;/u&gt;===

[[File:Jaron lanier.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A]]
[[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 19:00, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

In ''&quot;You are not a gadget: A manifesto&quot;'', Jaron Lanier discusses the many people who partake in the &quot;Always-On&quot; culture, showing that despite the assumption that the majority are teenagers, people from all walks of life can become immersed in it. He lists ''&quot;lifelong friends, my mentors, my students, my colleagues and my fellow travellers.&quot;'' (Lanier, 2011) [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 19:40, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Lanier also said that the most important thing about a technology was how it changed people (Lanier 2011) and, if this is correct, the changes brought about by new wearable technology from Facebook, Google, and Intel promise to change us considerably.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 14:42, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

==Cognitive Surplus==

-Technology has developed to allow you to create and share your thoughts and ideas. Always-on culture means you can partake in cognitive surplus when you so wish.

-Always-on culture allows to you view collective work online at the touch of a button. For example, Wikipedia is free of data charges in Middle-East and Africa: http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero

-Always-on technology has created this new way of collaboration and communication.

upon one or two questions that you wish the rest of the seminar to discuss 


A total mark will be given for: 

 Effective communication (delivery, slides, control of materials) 

 Audience engagement (co-ordination of discussion, delegation of tasks) 

 Critical engagement (reflecting upon the group’s contributions to the Wikibook; your 
understanding of the project and its implications) 

Presentations during Weeks 9, 10 &amp; 11. 
Your group’s presentation week will be assigned by the end of play, Week 6.

===&lt;u&gt;Discussion&lt;/u&gt;===

What everyone think about the idea of creating a bit of performance about being 'always-on' during our presentation? I just thought that it could be quite expressive if we simulate a situation where by phoning, sending a text to few members of our team, having a laptop in front of our faces, we can show how disturbing it is to ourselves and others. ([[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 13:05, 2 April 2014 (UTC))

I like that idea, maybe we could have our phones or laptops sitting next to us during the presentation and then announcet that we will be checking them at the end to see how many notifications/texts etc. we have received in that time to emphasise us being &quot;always-on&quot; in relation to being always &quot;available&quot; online even within a short hour of not being on our phones.

Hi Gemma! Thought that was a well thought out start - you've put a lot into it. I've made a small edit - but its more of a question than an edit re online and 'real' identities. [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 12:28, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, thanks very much. I think what you've said is totally correct. I've had difficulty trying to think of a term other than &quot;real life&quot; as our online identity is included in that. I think it's more a case of having the best possible version of yourself put online for the world to see, even though this may not be the most natural or true-to-life version as you've said. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 13:19, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, you've provided great points and information.  I made some slight changes by changing things like &quot;we&quot; to &quot;the user&quot; etc. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:27, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Perfect, I'm still getting used to the style of the Wikibook. Hopefully reading everyone's entries will give me some insight. Thanks! [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 17:17, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

[Gemma, are you ok if I add a bit here re LinkedIn re the professional bit and also a bit about how Facebook use the new timeline so that they too are managing our online identity and how it is presented? [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:48, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

George - In reply to your edit above, yes that sounds great! All relevant and I think that it should be added, go ahead and feel free to edit/add bits to my section as you wish. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:03, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, just to remind you that we are now going to use the APA style of referencing to keep it consistent. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:07, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, I've stuck with what was already being used on the Always-On page, so it is Surname, First name (Publication date) Title. Does that help? Or do you think it would be better to go with something different? [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 16:21, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, I'm having some trouble finding a resource on what cultural/technological determinism is? So if you have a resource on it that would be great, because then I can write a proper definition of the term! [[User:StineEliseJ|StineEliseJ]] ([[User talk:StineEliseJ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StineEliseJ|contribs]]) 16:24, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi! Maybe we should write a little (and I mean just a word or a very short sentence) about who the different people actually are? (Marshall McLuhan, Jaron Lanier etc.) From what I have read on Wikipedia, I think it may be smart to just say who they are and why they are mentioned in this particular text. Or what do you guys think? [[User:StineEliseJ|StineEliseJ]] ([[User talk:StineEliseJ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StineEliseJ|contribs]]) 16:49, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Elise, there's a definition for technological determinism in the book &quot;New Media&quot; which is the first book listed on the resource list for FMS9A4. If you search the document you will find it in the glossary (pp. 429). Also,I think that's a great idea. We were talking about linking the theorist to their wiki pages. So, for example, Jaron Lanier's name would be a hyper link to his Wikipedia page. What do you think? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 21:51, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, thanks, I will look at it. And linking the theorists to their wiki pages is a great idea! But does anyone know how to actually link the pages together? [[User:StineEliseJ|StineEliseJ]] ([[User talk:StineEliseJ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StineEliseJ|contribs]]) 11:09, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Elise, I've tried it above if you want to have a look and see if this is okay? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 12:15, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma and Elise. I've been trying to do this but failing miserably (Gemma, you should work for Wiki!) so I asked a Wikipedian and what he said follows right after this - so I don't know if we should be doing it now. My instinct tells me it makes sense though - what do you guys think? &quot;Hi George Berrie.Because this is Wikibooks, if you write an ordinary wikilink, it only links to a page with that name on Wikibooks. If you write markup [[Reykjavík]], you get a redlink, Reykjavík, because there isn't a book called that.Books are relatively self-contained; that's part of what makes them books. So we don't link all that often to other wikimedia projects, such as Wikipedia. There's a prefix for each of the sister projects, that can be used to create links to them; but sister links within a book are relatively few, and are typically set aside from the text, such as in a box on the right or in a list at the bottom of a page. Here's a link to a Wikipedia page: Reykjavík. --Pi zero (discuss • contribs) 01:45, 1 April 2014 (UTC)&quot; [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:48, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi there, better to just go with the APA style set out in the media guidelines? I think that is what we are doing, better to be safe! [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:29, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma - yes I think we should make the links you mention. I say this because I've had a look at one of the Wiki help pages and there is stuff about exactly what a Wikibook is - it is really good - and there is plenty of mention of making links to other pages/other websites/Wikipedia. Here is a link to it ... https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Announcing/About_this_book I'm going to make some of these links myself now - well I'll try! Are you going to transfer stuff over to the main book soon? I was going to do it tonight but I think I'll wait until I get these links in.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 19:27, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey! Just trying to send all the Always-On people a message about the boyd section. In the discussion page it has been decided that we will write her name in lower case throughout the wiki page, so that it remains consistent and coincides with her actual wikipedia page. Thanks!

Hi Gemma! I've moved my stuff across to the main book now and followed the heading/subheading format that was there - relatively straight forward. However, I can't see the place on the book where you go in and sign with three tilds to show that you have made an entry - any idea where it is?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 09:42, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, I've now moved all my stuff onto the main page and tried to edit some information together.  Your discussion page is looking good, I like how you included pictures, we should maybe incorporate that into the main page.  Could you perhaps tell me how to do that so I could use it to put an image of Sherry Turkle on the main page?

No problem, that's me just added my information from my discussion page to the main page minus the references. Will double check they are not already listed then add more. How is everyone getting on?

Hey, I'm doing okay, just about to do some referencing, did you use footnotes or not? I'm slightly confused if I am to use them or not.  How are you getting on? [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 20:29, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey, I have no idea what to do re footnotes. We would need to label each one to a number but that would entail going through every other reference on the page. Some of the footnotes already applied from other groups don't work so I don't know how difficult it would be to do so.

== Discussion/Always on ==

Hi there, I noticed you have gone into technological determinism and our group hasn't looked at that. I am writing about Sherry Tuckle right now and I think a lot of her work is influenced by technological determinism? I am wondering if you would take a look at my page and see if you think I could link in any thing about Technological determinism. I think it links anyway but I am not 100% sure.

Hi Laura!

Hi again,
I was just reading over your stuff on the wiki- first of all: good work! Then I'd recommend you to adjust your referencing a little, changing it from the &quot;essay style&quot; intext citation to footnotes, like you started doing it in the draft below. Just something I've noticed, I might be wrong here... [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 15:02, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

== YouTube and Vlogging ==

YouTube is a public video sharing site created in 2005. People of all ages, races and genders use YouTube as a way of forming an online identity. Among entertaining home video clips, and amateur short films, Video Blogging (Vlogging) is one of YouTube’s most popular trends, as it provides a medium to create a publically accessible performance of “the real me”. Hobsbawn sees the current age as defined by a “hunger for a secure identity” (Strangelove)&lt;ref name=&quot;Strangelove&quot;/&gt;. This then highlights the obvious attraction of Vlogging, as a way for any person with a video camera and an internet connection to document their identity and present it for the world to see. Vlogging is one of the rawest forms of media as it is simply people sharing their feelings and experiences with the world, and as Van Koten states while discussing McLuhan’s theories concerning hot and cold media “…when we peel away the layers of media we ultimately end up with human experience”.  (Van Koten) This closeness to human experience and supposed honesty that people put across in Video Blogs (Vlogs) encourages others to use this medium and share their own feeling and experiences in order to feel like an individual within a community.  Mendelson and Papacharissi discuss how Carey (1975) “emphasised a ritual view of communication which helps foster community integration through the sharing of common experiences and values” (Mendelson &amp; Papacharissi). It is true that YouTube is seen as a community and safe place to share these feelings and experiences and the users of YouTube are regularly referred to as the “YouTube Community”. But why do people use this public video forum to share these inner most confessions rather than keeping a physical diary or having real life conversations. Sherry Turkle states in her TED Talks “Connected, but alone?” that “the feeling that ‘no one is listening to me’ makes us want to send time with machines that seem to care about us” (Turkle). YouTube provides an instant audience of listeners for any user, millions of people can access a Vlog at any one time, the community of an instant audience must surely play a key factor in why people choose to share their life experiences via Vlogs as opposed though real life social interaction. However, Turkle also states that through her research she has discovered that many feel that a feeling or experience is not valid until it is shared through the internet, usually via some form of SNS “I share therefore  I am” (Turkle). So, by sharing these personal/confessional videos on YouTube, not only do users receive and instant audience to listen to their feelings as they try to work out their own identity, but they also gain validations of those feelings through the process of sharing. The idea of being part of a community which also validates ones inner most feelings must surely be an appealing one for many, hence the popularity of Vlogs on YouTube. However, the identities presented on YouTube are not necessarily exact representations of how those users behave in their real world lives. Michael Strangelove in his book “Watching YouTube: extraordinary videos by ordinary people” discusses how “There are hundreds of videos online title ‘the real me’ that explore the difference between videographers on-screen persona and their ‘real’ self.” He goes on to give an example of a video made by college student Kevin Wu with the above title, Kevin explains how he is a different person from his videos, “You don’t know me…you don’t really know someone through the internet” (Strangelove). The construction of an ideal persona on SNS is seen across all mediums; YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr etc. When discussing the formulation of college students photos galleries on Facebook Mendelson and Papacharissi state that we “consciously and unconsciously transform ourselves before the camera, portraying a version of ourselves we wish to be” (Mendelson &amp; Papacharissi). So, while people wish to feel that their feeling are validated and they as themselves are accepted as part of a community, the common case is still that they present an ideal version of themselves and push that forward to be accepted as their true identity, whether is accurately reflects their real world persona or not.

Hi George that sounds great will be good to get as big a mix of contributions to both pages ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 23:02, 28 March 2014 (UTC))

Hi Kathryn, we're using Rachel's page as a discussion page. Her wiki name is redhead Rachel. We're also gonna try and meet in the library tomorrow at 3 o'clock before the seminar.

Hey! Just trying to send all the Always-On people a message about the boyd section. In the discussion page it has been decided that we will write her name in lower case throughout the wiki page, so that it remains consistent and coincides with her actual wikipedia page. Thanks!

=Sherry Turkle=

== About ==

Sherry Turkle is an American theorist and a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the area of social studies.  Many of her ideas in her books revolve around the culture and trends in technology.  Her book &quot;Alone Together&quot; mentions the idea of &quot;Always-on Culture&quot; and the relationship between people and technology and the consequences that can have.

== Turkle's Ideas ==

Much of Turkle's work focuses on the idea of &quot;Always-on Culture,&quot; the idea that collectively, people are always connected through technology. The &quot;Tethered Self&quot; is a prominent part of her always-on study.   She often mentions in her work, the idea that being constantly connected affects the user and is resulting in attitude changes, such as the break down of communication and people feeling more comfortable to communicate through mobile technology such as texts or emails.   

== The Tethered Self ==

This idea concerns the way in which people are connected and have access to it a communication device, such as a smart phone.  She often discusses how people can always be reached through mobiles or emails and if the person cannot contact the users, then machines often represent them, such as voicemail.  Also,  how a growing number of people are connected to some sort of network, such as Facebook, and rarely disconnect from it.  From interviews she has conducted, she concludes that people, especially teenagers, feel at a loss without their mobile and without being connected.  She argues that people have become more reliant on their technologies and this has led to users checking their networks more for any notifications. For example, users checking their smart phones for notifications.  

== Changing Attitudes ==

Turkle expresses how she feels that attitudes of users of the technology is changing.  She often mentions how communication is breaking down due to the increasing use of technology to communicate.   Turkle also argues that the way technology is now being used is not just changing the way the users communicate to each other, but it is also changing the user as a person.  The need for attention is able to fulfilled by social media and the ability to message people from a device but this can also lead to users feeling more bored or alone in real life situations.  In a 2012 Ted Talk, she expresses how face-to-face communication is suffering due to the rise of online conversation and how even when people are in them presence of others they often want to be somewhere else, so they communicate online while in the company of others.  She gives the example of people texting and emailing from boardrooms and during meetings.  Overall, she expresses that the popularity of communicating online and the the decline of communicating in person hence creating a feeling of isolation for the user.

== The Second Self ==

The “Second Self” is Sherry Turkle's second published book.  Throughout, she refers to ideas of computers being more than a device and how it is an important part of the user’s life, physiologically and socially.&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (2005) “The Second Self Twentieth Anniversary Edition.” Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; Her book is based upon opinions and attitudes of people who use computers and how that effects on their lives. &lt;ref&gt;NY Times. (1984) “The Second Self.” Retrieved 04/01, 2014, from http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/03/specials/turkle-second.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Written in 1984, before today's technology was invented and before most people owned a smart phone,  Turkle expresses ideas that could lead to today's &quot;Always On&quot; Culture such as the fear people initially had about becoming &quot;addicted&quot; to technology.&lt;ref name= ‘Turkle’&gt;Turkle, S. (2005) “The Second Self Twentieth Anniversary Edition.” Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Turkle also mentions ideas, similar to theorist Marshall McLuhan, of technology extending the self but she also adds how it extends the “external” world for the user.&lt;ref name= ‘NY Times’&gt;NY Times. (1984) “The Second Self.” Retrieved 04/01, 2014, from http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/03/specials/turkle-second.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
She states in the book, the idea that technology “changes not only in what we do but how we think” which is similar to her ideas in “Alone Together.”  This idea is emphasised in her later work as by then more technology had been developed and consumed. &lt;ref name= ‘Turkle’&gt;Turkle, S. (2004) “The Second Self Twentieth Anniversary Edition.” Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;




= Leslie Perlow = 

== About ==

Leslie Perlow is a professor of Leadership in the Organizational Behaviour area at Harvard Business School.  Most of her research focuses on being Always-on in the work place.  In her latest publication, “Sleeping With Your Smartphone” she focuses on employees of businesses who feel the need to be always online and always be connected and she discusses how disconnecting can be the most powerful tool for them. 

== Sleeping With Your Smartphone ==

In her latest publication, “Sleeping With your Smartphone,” she surveys thousands of different businesspeople in different professions over how much they work and their smartphone habits.  Some of her questions included, how often they check their phone and how often they can disconnect from it.  
She argues that professionals feel pressure to be always on and they often feel that if they disconnect, others may still stay on and become more successful than them.  
Due to different time zones and needing to be contactable for clients and fellow colleagues, Parlow has argued that it leads to employees to change their timetable and reschedule their time to make sure that they are always connected and remain to be perceived as a good employee as constantly being on is often expected from high pressure jobs.    

== Disconnecting == 

Parlow experimented with a company, Boston Consulting Company, to see if their employees would be able to disconnect and if that could be achieved.  At 6:00pm each night, a different employee would be able to disconnect from their work network and other employees were able to deal with clients if need be.  
Most employees felt many benefits such as finding their work more satisfying.  They also felt that they regained more control over their work life.  
Parlow argues that when this approach is applied correctly, not being always-on can benefit not just the employee but the organisation as well. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 22:17, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

=Comments=

* Great work AJ, You've spend a lot of time on putting this together. May I make the suggestion of citing the entry with numbers throughout the text to make it easier to see where you used your references? I'll have another look tomorrow to see what else I can add to this. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 00:15, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
* Thank you Gemma, that is a good idea, I was initially thinking of adding that but was unsure how to go about it.  I have suggested on George's discussion that we collectively work through the referencing before creating the Wikibook. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 11:15, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
* This is fantastic Aj! It gives us something to discuss and agree re references when we meet next week. Should we try and find other theorists who might have a different point of view so that we can create an argument? [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:05, 25 March 2014 (UTC)
* Yes George that is a great idea.  I will research over the weekend and then I will share what I found at our group meeting on Monday. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 17:47, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi AJ, I would to say that I looking forward to our meeting about the wiki book, even though you arranged it for straight after this class [[User:Kellymcdonach|Kellymcdonach]] ([[User talk:Kellymcdonach|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kellymcdonach|contribs]]) 15:54, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Aj - hope you get this as my Wiki skills are as basic as they come - hope to see you and the rest of the team at 4.30pm in the 24 hour zone. Maybe we could talk about this ...

AJ, did you get my email about not being able to make it on Monday 7th to arrange the presentation as I have another meeting at the same time? Do you know if we can reschedule as I feel I need to be there in order to put together the slides effectively.

= Discussion = 

Hey Hollie here, I am doing 'Always on' culture, in Group X, I am actually writing aout Turkle too and during my research have found some other things that I thought were quite important. The second self/Life on the screen/Alone together, will you be mentioning any of these, do you think they are relevant? I think they are relevant but don't want to go too off track and get off topic. I am sure I could link them in but I was wondering if you were planning on looking into them at all? [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 15:17, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Amanda, I think you have a lot of good information about Turkle but I think it would be interesting to add something about the validation that being 'always on' gives. I was going to contribute some info to that section. --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 16:30, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Aj - yes I was thinking the same - re adding our stuff today. I'm going to cut and paste it tonight - not sure how I'll strip out the contribs for this - so long as they remain on the discussion page that's the main thing I think. Are you transferring stuff over soon too?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 17:41, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Just been checking out other books - some have included a Glossary - which I think we should do because it is in the main book - and some haven't. And those who have are using different styles. The one for Always on looks good I think. Do you think we should just add to the main book as far as the Glossary goes and stick with the format that is there, or start ours from scratch? For what its worth, I think we should just add to what is there, adding only new stuff based on our own content. What do you think?

Hey Aj! I've moved my stuff across to the main book now and followed the heading/subheading format that was there - it was relatively straight forward and I edited out the contribs stuff when I was in edit mode on the page. However, I can't see the place on the book where you go in and sign with three tilds to show that you have made an entry - any idea where it is? Have you moved your stuff across now?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 09:45, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

This looks good, i will add what I have in with what you have, over all we will have loads. I have done a couple of her other main concepts and link them in with always on culture but nothing too much. What you have is great though. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 11:31, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Aj - Gemma has cracked the problem of the 3 tilds on the main book - you just go to the main page and a list of contributors is at the bottom - you just have to go down and edit it and put your 3 tilds in there. Incidentally, I see some other groups have got a List of Contributors at the bottom of their page too - seems like a good idea for ours - what do you think?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 15:20, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi AJ, you go to [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikimedia Commons] and search for the image you'd like. Once you have the file name for it, you insert it onto your page alongside the specified code. Once you have done that, there is a tutorial on how to change the position and size [[Using_Wikibooks/Inserting_Images|here]]. It took me a long time playing about with it to get the images to the right size, but it's just trial and error. Hope this helps! Any questions, just message me!

'''RE Anonymity''' I will crack on with what I'm working on, and if there's anything you feel can be improved or would like to add you can go ahead and let me know you're going to edit and make the slight alterations you feel necessary - it is a group project afterall! All for one and one for all! [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 14:42, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Anonymity''' I think the online cue of anonymity feeds into various topics [such as disembodiment, disinhibition effect, trolling, self-disclosure etc] It can be approached as an umbrella heading for all of these sub topics, or these topics can be addressed separately with a thematic thread of anonymity running through them. I'm not sure what seems best - do you think an umbrella heading of &quot;anonymity&quot; would suffice as a section? It seems more of a condition of the online realm [an aversion of the accountable body in real life] rather than a topic all by itself.... That being said I am currently reading some texts which state the anonymity factor can be used to produce honest self-disclosure and allow the lonely and anxious to express themselves honestly on the online realm. So not all negative! Thoughts?  [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 14:11, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi, I'm Gemma from the Megabytes, we've not heard back from other groups yet but were just wondering what referencing style your group were intending to use. Wiki states that they have no set referencing style yet they like users to keep it consistent (See here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf). Our group thought it would be easier just to stick with APA as that is the set referencing style for Media modules. What do you guys think? Look forward to hearing from you. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 15:24, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey! Just trying to send all the Always-On people a message about the boyd section. In the discussion page it has been decided that we will write her name in lower case throughout the wiki page, so that it remains consistent and coincides with her actual wikipedia page. Thanks! [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:50, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

== Discussion ==

Just going to copy and paste some of the major points we have been discussing on other platforms to keep you in the loop with what is going on as I know you don't have access to the conversation. We looked over things that other groups may have addressed and what we could address:
Main Concepts
Theorists/Speakers (Boyd, Turkle- their main concepts)
Definitions
Getting connected/different meanings
Examples of &quot;Always On&quot; Culture e.g., Text/Email/SNS/Web Pages/TV Red Button/Blu-ray Live
References
Glossary

I know Siobhan wants to touch up on danah boyd and add stuff on the page to that.  We've also been talking about how to add links to other pages which I wasn't quite sure of myself but I know Siobhan knows how to do it so you could go on her page and ask about that if you are looking to link something.

I think Jennifer is looking at examples of tv and its interactivity. 

Hope this keeps you up to date and is everything you need to know. not sure what you want to cover but I think we are now at the stage where we are all adding in stuff that we think is missing or what also need to be put in. 

[[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 12:41, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I meant to add that I am looking at Shirley Turkle and her main concepts/always on/the second self/ life on the screen and Alone together and how these are all linked into the 'always on' and tethering cluture. Hope this helps [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 15:04, 1 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

Hey George, that also sounds good. We can bring it up at next weeks meeting to see how we can engage with the other groups and the best way to do so. Perhaps we could add to their own user discussion pages and see what differences they have/what they deemed as important? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:12, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, wasn't really sure where to put this. Within my group I'll be looking at danah boyd, we're yet to properly assign roles to everyone though. Bouncing some ideas around sounds good though! 
[[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:36, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey George, it's Kathryn from 4KR. The work your group has done looks really great! As of yet, my group hasn't allocated certain topics for certain people so, as far as I'm aware, we will just be contributing to each subject if and where there is anything to add. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 13:39, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi again. I was just wondering which referencing style your group used so that I can ensure that I use the same one. Thanks. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 14:34, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Kathryn, we will be deciding on a final referencing style on Monday at our team meeting, once we know I will get back to you on that one. Have your group been adding to their discussion pages or to the Yearbook page? I'm kind of confused as to how it's going to work because people have already submitted work to it and a lot of the ideas will be roughly the same. Any thoughts from your group on this? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 12:00, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, this is just a reminder that we are now going to use the APA style of referencing for now.  Gemma posted on your page already about the wikipedia referencing link, but here it is for convenience:  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:10, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, I'm part of the 4KR group also doing always on culture. The work your group has done looks great so far! Has all of the work come from your group or have you been communicating with the other group? We're just collecting the last of our information and getting ready to add our stuff tonight. 
[[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 13:40, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, about what you said on my page regarding the hyper-links: do you reckon we should include hyper-links to the other topics which are mentioned on my discussion (On-line Identity and Cognitive Surplus)? This will provide navigation to other pages from the &quot;Always-On&quot; chapter emphasising their connections with the other chapters in the yearbook. Do you know what I mean? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 19:07, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, forgot to say, could you please have a look at my discussion page and find the note I left on the &quot;References&quot; section? I would appreciate it if you could let me know which articles you referred to. Thanks [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 19:10, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, just got your message. Yes, I am going to add my content to the page now.  In terms of the glossary I think we should add new content that we have that is missed. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 20:49, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey, I get what you mean with the others putting content straight on there. We've just started putting content straight onto the book now too since its getting nearer deadline day. We've got a sort of draft page on the discussion page of one of the girls in my group just now so we have a lot more stuff still to go on there. It's quite hard to tell who has posted what on the book unless you bother scrolling through all of the edit history too! I think this would've been a lot easier if Wiki was easier to navigate lol. [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 10:00, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey George, in reply to your comment on my discussion page, I have now moved all my content over to the main page but I am yet to edit it with the content that is already there.   Also, I don't know either were to put the three tides. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 10:22, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey george, I seen your message on Siobhan's wall and I think it would be a good idea just to build a glossary together, so everyone add their own little bits and people can just add more of their own terms or anything people have missed instead of everyone individually writing a glossary as I am sure we all have a grasp on the main terms anyway I hope! [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 11:57, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hiya, in reply to your message, we sign the three tides under the &quot;List of Contributors&quot; title on the contents page of the Yearbook. I've done mine just now so hopefully people will be able to spot it easier. Here's a link: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014 
[[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 15:03, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for the help George! Yeah, that sounds like a good idea! [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:02, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Tidying up references sounds good, once we have the glossary up and running we should definitely have that put in alphabetical order as well. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 16:50, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Just to add on to what I just said, I just looked at the glossary that is already there, I have ordered it in alphabetical order but I do think it maybe needs some padding out. Or a bit more information. So definitely something the groups could be looking at tomorrow/closer to when it's finished [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:04, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Another thing to add on...I've been talking with Kelly another girl from another group and we have noticed that the references on our over all page are mixed and they should all be the same... i.e some are foot notes and some is APA. I know you have spent time looking at them so we wanted to get your opinion on changing it all to the same, we are swaying more towards foot noting and Kelly says she is happy to do, obviously we could help her. We are discussing this on the Talk page/Discussion page on the actual 'Always on' project page, so it would be good if you could get the general consensus from your group before we go ahead and footnote it all. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 18:32, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey, did you manage to sign your name on the book? I'm not completely sure if we're thinking of the same thing here but Greg was saying in this weeks seminar that we can sign our name on the main page of the book under the list of contributors. I'm not sure if this is what you meant. [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 20:43, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, I'm (almost) done with the definitions, the only thing I need before posting it on the year book page is a name in one of the paragraphs that you posted on my discussion page. The name somehow got lost when I tried to do the in text referencing, and I can't seem to get back. I think it's supposed to be Lanier, but I can't really post it without knowing.

Hi guys! I am now finished, and I have posted my contributions on the main wikibook page! [[User:StineEliseJ|StineEliseJ]] ([[User talk:StineEliseJ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StineEliseJ|contribs]]) 12:32, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi George Connor here, was wondering if you could now post your section on technological determinism on our book with the references. I think it would be best going under the section titled Marshall McLuhan-Extensions of the Human Body. Thanks [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 13:39, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, did you get my email about not being able to make it on Monday 7th to arrange the presentation as I have another meeting at the same time? Do you know if we can reschedule as I feel I need to be there in order to put together the slides effectively.

=Being 'On': the different means of getting connected=


Being ‘always on’ means taking into account both technical networks and social networks according to danah boyd. When we cannot connect to the technical network we can often feel frustrated, angry, or worried that we can’t get access to a particular piece of information, or that our productivity will fall, or we can’t make a particular social connection at that precise point in time (Boyd 2012). This section looks at the how the internet developed and the legacy issues from that development, the technical network today and how each part has advantages and disadvantages. 

==Origins of the Internet and its Legacy==

The internet’s origin began in the 1960s with a network created by Advanced Research Projects Agency which was part of the US Defense department. It was called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET ARPANET] and was originally designed to connect universities and laboratories (IEEE, 2014). Many other networks were subsequently created in different organizations and  countries but the networks themselves could not effectively interconnect (BBC, 2012). In 1974 [http://research.google.com/pubs/author32412.html Vint Cerf]and [http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/bios/Robert,Kahn/ Robert Kahn]wrote communication protocols to enable information to be easily sent from one network to another and this was published in the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers magazine in May 1974. The protocols they wrote were called TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) and now form the protocols that run the internet (IEEE, 2014). Despite the clear benefits at the time of allowing the internet to flourish, TCP/IP might now be categorized as a ‘Lock-in’ as described by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier Jaron Lanier] (Lanier, 2011), and we are now somewhat constrained by a major tool we use to understand the world.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 14:54, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

==The Wireless Network: 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi==
There are a number of ways that we get 'on' the internet and it can often be a combination of wired and wireless methods. This section looks at wireless connections and some of the advantages and disadvantages.

===[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G 3G] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G 4G]===

3G and 4G are short for 3rd Generation and 4th Generation Technology. These developments have allowed for an increase in the speed of communication but also gave the user the addition of video calling, live streaming, mobile internet access and IPTV as the 3G/4G spectrum provides the necessary bandwidth to allow this: 3G technology is specifically designed to cater for multimedia communication (Engineersgarage.com). This advancement of generations means we have better and faster access to visuals, graphics and animation that would have appeared less sophisticated previously (about.com, 2014).

3G speed can provide up to 2 Megabits per second whereas 4G's speed of up 200 Megabits per second (Ibrahim, 2002) is significantly faster and is able [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 17:03, 31 March 2014 (UTC) to provide much faster speeds for High definition video streaming than 3G and Wi-Fi (about.com, 2014). [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 12:24, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

4G is now widely available and has an expanded coverage in comparison to 3G, so provides more or less constant connectivity. Although, it is still not available in many locations of the globe and is still a new generation so users may experience glitches and bugs with the technology (about.com, 2014). [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 12:24, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

===Wi-Fi===

Wi-Fi is wireless technology that uses microwave radiation to transmit and receive signals between devices and because of its method of transmitting and receiving it is thus vulnerable to interference (Clout, 2014). The existing wireless standard is 802.11n and is only capable of 150 Megabits per second. In addition, the greater the number of users accessing a wireless access point at a given time, the greater is the degradation of service experienced by those users (Clout, 2014).

However the need for greater speed when multiple users are using Wi-Fi has led to a new much faster Wi-Fi standard being developed: 802.11ac. The 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard has the potential to transfer information at 7 Gigabits per second which is more that ten times faster than the current standard.  The new standard was approved in January, 2014 (IEEE, 2014) thus enabling new devices to be designed and manufactured. Whilst the new standard makes it comparable with wired Gigabit Ethernet it will still retain the problem of interference as radio waves struggle to get through dense building materials and the signal deteriorates over a fairly short distance. (Digital Trends, 2013).

Networks which use wireless technology are more difficult and expensive to secure compared with wired networks and are thus vulnerable to identity theft and unauthorized surveillance  (Clout, 2014).



•Advantages of using Wireless: 

-Wireless provides convenience and the ability to work anywhere.

-There are less/no cables so more people can connect to the one access point.

-Ability to use internet on phones and tablets, providing a cheaper alternative for browsing.


•Disadvantages of using Wireless:

-There is a limited signal range, so speed will decrease the further away you go from the access point. 

-Wireless provides low security as signals can be intercepted. 

-Signals can also be affected by other signals/radio waves/walls/other physical barriers. 

-Wireless connection is not as fast as wired networks.


•Wi-Fi VS. 3G/4G

-Wi-Fi has the advantage when it comes to raw speed.

-3G/4G give you increased mobility as they cover a wider area

-Having access to both Wi-Fi and 3G or 4G on smart phones gives the user a degree of resilience if one or the other is not available. Wi-Fi is dependent on wires delivering the internet to the wireless/wired router.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:27, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

==The Wired Network: Fibre Optic Cable and Gigabit Ethernet==
===Gigabit Ethernet===


Gigabit Ethernet is a multi-core cable in which the data transfer speed is 1000 Megabits per second and so is about four or five times faster than Wireless. It can run over 100 meters which is much farther than existing Wi-Fi (Digital Trends, 2013).

[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 15:49, 28 March 2014 (UTC)


•Advantages of using an Ethernet cable: 

-Cannot be intercepted down the wire.

-High connection speed/high bandwidth. 

-Long cables are relatively cheap.

-&quot;Plug and play&quot; aspect

[[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:54, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

In terms of improved social cues, high bandwidth matters: video-based communications are of 'high fidelity' in terms of the cues we transmit to others and compares with 'low fidelity' for text-based comms and a lack of interpersonal cues (Sproull, L. and Kiesler, S., 1986) . [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:28, 26 March 2014 (UTC)[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 20:30, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

===Fibre Optic Cable===
Instead of using metal wires to send signals, fibre optic cables work using thin, flexible strands of glass and pulses of light to send information (About.com, 2014). The current industry standard for fibre optic broadband is 10 Gigabits per second and is about 66 times faster than wireless (IEEE, 2014).

Fibre optic technology has none of the reliability problems faced by wireless technology. It is claimed that fibre is even more reliable than metal wire cables as information moves through fibre optic cables in a way that makes it less vulnerable to interference from other data traveling along the same fibre cable (Clout, 2014).

==Future Direction==
The advance towards true &quot;Always-on&quot; connectivity globally, and in particular wireless connectivity, has recently been the subject of intent from two of the world's largest technology companies: Google and Facebook[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 17:07, 1 April 2014 (UTC) On the 28/3/14, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg], CEO of Facebook, announced that he has plans to expand the boundaries of the internet to ensure every person in the globe has affordable, basic access to internet services. He expects to do so through the use of wireless drones, satellites and lasers, thus creating a fully &quot;Always-on&quot; world (Pimental, 2014). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg Zuckerberg] provides competition for Google who intend to do the same with balloons and radio signals rather than drones and satellites (Simonite, 2014).

==DRAFT of our Always On project==

Team,

I've had a go at putting the main headings for our project - please feel free to hack this to bits and edit it as you please - its just a start. Within each heading I've used the module handbook wordings to keep us right so that we put the right material in.

Also, I've tried to capture what we agreed at our first meeting - apologies if I have got any names wrong! I thought we could use this as a framework for our work. From the workshop I've got a note of some of the markup codes for headings and so on - but I'm sure they exist in a more comprehensive way some where on the wiki - let me know if you find them please! Ok, so here is the framework - as I say feel free to edit it as you think fit ...

===Introduction===
We should put in here a brief overview of the subject we are writing about
===Main Concepts===
In here we put the concepts associated with &quot;Always On&quot;, where the concepts came from - that's stuff like the theorists and what they had to say). Here are the concepts we thought we should have in our project:
====Theorists/Speakers====
This was allocated to Aj (Wiki name is amandajayner)  for Sherry Turkle and Ania (cool Wiki name is Ania-polish accent) for danah boyd

====Definitions====
This was allocated to Elise and was to include 'Disinhibition' (Wiki name is StineEliseJ)

====Engagement with other Groups researching &quot;Always On&quot;====
This was allocated to Gemma (Wiki name is GemmaMiller) 
====Getting &quot;On&quot;: the different means of getting &quot;connected&quot;====
This was allocated to George (Wiki name is George Berrie)
 
====Examples of &quot;Always On&quot; Culture e.g., Text/Email/SNS/Web Pages/TV Red Button/Blu-ray Live====
This was allocated to Kelly (Wiki name is Kellymcdonach)

Has anyone heard from Kelly as no contributions have been made by her yet? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 11:57, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

===References===
This is the primary and secondary sources we found about our chosen subject

===Glossary===
This is where we identify our key terms and provide concise definitions - so it ties in with what Elise is doing.

===Early Comments===


Hi George, see you at the social study with our media group later! [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 15:55, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey George, I hope at least someone in our group has a clue how to work this, because I'm lost. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 15:54, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, the topic that has been listed for me below is different to the one I thought I had. What do you mean by &quot;engagement with other groups&quot;, and do you reckon that is a title? What would this entail? I've discussed other topics which relate to &quot;Always-on&quot;, not collaborated with other seminar groups. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 13:25, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, I thought that you were going to engage with the other groups doing 'always on' to see if we could share stuff - but I've probably picked it up wrong because the stuff you've done already looks spot on! Maybe we should all just ask the other teams what they are doing when the time is right? 'Group X' and '4KR' also doing 'Always on'. Should we bring this up at next Monday's meeting?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:11, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey George, in terms of glossary it looks like people are just adding things to it as they crop up. That's probably the best way to go about it so everyone can check what is already there before adding more. I think that way there won't be any repeats, and just one person won't be doing work that has already been done [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:40, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey! Just trying to send all the Always-On people a message about the boyd section. In the discussion page it has been decided that we will write her name in lower case throughout the wiki page, so that it remains consistent and coincides with her actual wikipedia page. Thanks! [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:52, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hejka! Just to let you know that I have added first points about the psychological aspect of 'always-on'.([[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 13:10, 2 April 2014 (UTC))

==Things to Discuss at our Meeting on 31st March (1pm - 2pm in the Library)==
1. Should we all individually contact members of Group X and 4KR (who are also doing 'Always On'), or nominate one of our team to do this. [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:18, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

2. The organisation of our page we are making and what information to use

3. Check over referencing and make sure that it is consistent [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 11:07, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

(Guys, this page might be of use to us regarding references as we need to use code when doing so. We can refer to this at the meeting: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf) [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:00, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

4. Discuss whether we have covered all main concepts, and if not, delegate topics to group. 

5. Discuss everyone's contributions and whether certain topics need more work/content added [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:16, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

6. When to start posting things on the &quot;Always-On&quot; Chapter in the Yearbook. Some groups have already started doing so. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:16, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

7. Maybe we can look also at the psychological damage that 'Always-On' can do to some people?

Hi Kris, thanks for answering my question. I think you are right, I just wasn't sure. I think you could do an entire heading under anonymity rather than a subheading of something else, and then yourself or someone else in the discussion could make reference to how it could be used for negative distortion. Is that the sort of thing you were thinking? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 12:49, 27 March 2014 (UTC)


I have also been reading some positive aspects to anonymity  too, thus I think it should be an umbrella subheading (but that is the sort of thing I like). I will leave it down to you, but it seem like you have lots of good information to fill it. And if you do it one way and don't like it, you can always change it as we still have a week to complete this :)[[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 14:36, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Kris, it's at the very bottom of the discussion page on our online identity wiki, I made a new heading for Impression Management.

Hi there Andrew. Greg informed me that you're in our group for the wikibooks. Mostly we've kept our discussion [[User talk:Flailkerrin|here]] about everything, and there you'll also find all the members of our group. --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 10:30, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

All of below is copied from a Facebook chat:

March 22nd &quot;Hey! I'm your group for this wikibooks project, just wondering if we all have to meet up at all?&quot;

AmericanStephen: No, I don't think so. We were really just discussing everything that we were planning to do on Iain's discussion page but I see that you've already found that. At this point we're all just going through the various material for always on culture that has been in lectures and readings, and trying to make sense of it to put it on the actual page. I don't think we'd really discussed meeting at any time

&quot;Ahh cool cool, sounds good! Are we collaborating on one page or on our individual pages? Sorry, I've been out the loop from the internet for the last week, trying to catch up haha&quot;

&quot;Nah man it's all good. We're all working on the page linked through the wikibook for the whole class. I think the others may have made some contributions already: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/%27%27%27Chapter_3:_Always-on_Culture%27%27%27

&quot;Ahh I see, thanks a lot man, life saver! I was about to go off on a complete tangent there haha&quot;

March 25th &quot;hi there is no link to our wikibooks page on the discussion page, have you got a link please?&quot;


&quot;Search for chapter 3: always on culture&quot;

&quot;right, so do we have our own topic we are writing about, or do we write about anything about &quot;always on culture&quot;?&quot;

&quot;Anything related to always-on culture, whether the lecture, reading, or outside research&quot;

&quot;brilliant thanksso we just add to whatever is still there?&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot;

&quot;thanks&quot;

== Presentation Group ==

Hi Kasia,

I know Caroline and Clare are in out group, but can you remember the name of the fifth member? (If the fifth member reads this please jump in.)

Elizabeth


Do you know how we can start a discussion with the remaining members of our group? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 17:07, 26 March 2014 (UTC)
 
I'm not too sure, the only way I can think of is by continuing discussions on the online identity page, but it seems that not everyone has got in touch with it yet. We couldn't always try Facebook as a last resort, and then maybe direct them to this page to discuss here? [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 17:51, 26 March 2014 (UTC)


I have left you something that you could start with regarding online gaming and but mostly Second Life, on the online identity discussion page.

Hey! Just trying to send all the Always-On people a message about the boyd section. In the discussion page it has been decided that we will write her name in lower case throughout the wiki page, so that it remains consistent and coincides with her actual wikipedia page. Thanks!

Hellooo Charlotte! 
[[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 15:33, 19 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Charlotte - George from Megabytes team here - we are doing Always On too - so we're happy to contribute to your stuff - feel free to contribute to ours as well! Our usernames are: StineEliseJ (Elise); Kellymcdonach (Kelly); GemmaMiller (Gemma); Ania-polish accent (Ania); amandajayner (Aj) and George Berrie (that's me). I'll put the same message on your team mates' discussion pages too to see if we can get some cross-team contributions going. Cheers[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 15:15, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Thank you George, there's some really great stuff that's been pulled together over the past couple of weeks, it's really impressive. [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

Hey there! As I went to post on the Reading Room page, I saw your post and thought I'd help you out if I could! I see you have a discussion page but no user page. I just went and typed something on your user page. Go ahead and replace it, just a sentence or two bio of yourself should be fine :) Hope this works!

== Presentation Group X: 1st Meeting ==

The topic of our presentation shall be 'Always On' Culture on Tuesday 15th April during our seminar from 12:00-1:00. The first meeting for our presentation for the FMS9A4 Module on Digital Media &amp; Culture has been arranged. We shall meet outside the University library at 2:30 on Wednesday 9th April. We will meet again after this but will arrange something after our first meeting together. [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

Really looking forward to getting this going! If you look below you'll see I've drafted a rough lesson plan type thing that Group X can work from. Check it out and I look forward to hearing your opinions and suggestions. [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

== Group X Members ==

The members of the presentation Group X are as follows:

Charlotte Ryder(myself),
Hollie Irvine,
Siobhan Rathwell,
Jennifer Wylie,
Ciara Roe and 
Rachel Barr [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

== 'Always On' Culture Presentation Plan ==

Here is a very rough lesson plan for the seminar Group X will be presenting and conducting on the 15th April. It can be subject to change and is VERY vague but it's a starting point to get us thinking. If Group X members could add things/discuss ideas/put forward points/ask questions about our presentation here that would be great! 

1. Introduction - Short film (about 1 minute long) introducing ourselves and the topic.

2. Talk about main points of subject - Generate group discussion.

3. Activity for the class (potential for handouts and reference sheets).

4.Wikibooks Evaluation - How we put it together/What we choose to cover/What we found or learnt/Our opinion of the task.

5. Conclusion.

Like I've said it's a really vague lesson plan but it gives us something to work with. Let me know what you all think! [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

This sounds really good so far, we could make the activity really good and totally interesting. A wordsearch! no I am just kidding but sounds really good, glad you are so organized! [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:42, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

This seems cool so far! I think the main thing we need is a really awesome way to get the discussion going. If everyone starts thinking of ideas before we meet up. Do we want a presentation or have the film playing over in the background as we talk? Making controversial points would be good too. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 22:08, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Looks like you've got a pretty good idea of what the bones of our presentation could be, I'd be happy to follow that structure. I think Siobhan is right about everyone thinking of ideas before we meet up, that way we know everyone will make a contribution to the creative process and we'll be more likely to find a stimulating activity for the seminar if we pool our ideas.

This sounds great, Thanks Charlotte! [[User:Jenniferhw94|Jenniferhw94]] ([[User talk:Jenniferhw94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jenniferhw94|contribs]]) 16:35, 4 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction==
Hi, I'm Jennifer and I'm a second year journalism student at the University of Stirling.

I am new to the Wiki community and learning as I go. I joined for the purposes of completing a class project but I am interested in contributing more to Wikipedia and Wikibooks in the future.

I write for Brig, Stirling's student newspaper. My other interests include blogging, volunteering, swimming and learning languages.

== Definitions ==

=== Always-on ===
The term &quot;always-on&quot; is used to refer to the way modern technology (mobile phones, computers etc.) continuously keep people connected to each other through the internet, and therefore always accessible. Sherry Turkle suggest that people have become so tethered with their &quot;always-on&quot; communication devices that the self has become attached to its devices and that life now has become both physical and digital lives on multiple screens: the devices are always ready in hand&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. E. (2008). Handbook of mobile communication studies. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press. Sherry Turkle, &quot;Always-on/Always-on-you: The thedered Self&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Others, such as Danah Boyd, look at this from a positive perspective, she says that the online world is always just around the corner, and that the online world does not necessarily have to be a bad thing. Boyd also say that most people are &quot;always-on&quot; without technology being the center of the activity; &quot;there is no longer about on or off. It's about living in a world where being networked to people and information wherever and whenever you need it is just assumed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mandiberg, M. (2012). The social media reader. New York: New York University Press. Danah Boyd, pp.71--76&lt;/ref&gt;. If people in some way are connected to the network, through a mobile phone, a computer, gaming console etc., they are considered to be &quot;always-on&quot;.

While Boyd seems to make a relevant point that our online lives are as ‘real’ as our offline lives, more could be said about the significant difference between these two aspects of our lives, in particular how we behave online versus how we behave offline. Suler makes the point that when we communicate online, our input comes after some delay, perhaps minutes or hours or days, and this affects what we say, in text form, and how we say it&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), pp. 184--188&lt;/ref&gt;. Importantly, he asserts that when we communicate face-to-face with others, “moment-by-moment responses between people powerfully shapes the ongoing flow of self-disclosure, usually in the direction of conforming to social norms”&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;. If this is the case, if an increasing amount of our time is spent online this could perhaps leave some people struggling with face-to-face social skills necessary to fit into a particular environment, such as that of an organisation with a clear expectations of cultural behaviour, or to succeed in particular roles where face-to-face interaction with people is necessary. ( [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:51, 27 March 2014 (UTC) )

=== Disinhibition ===
The term &quot;disinhibition&quot;, or &quot;the disinhibition effect&quot;, has been defined, after years of research on psychology and the Internet, as a recognition of people behaving differently online, than they would in offline situations (real life situations). Examples of this type of behaviour is a person who outrageously flirt online, while acting completely opposite when offline&lt;ref&gt;Gackenbach, J. (2007). Psychology and the internet. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;. The fact that people cannot see or hear each other when online can be enough to trigger the disinhibition effect&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), pp. 184--188&lt;/ref&gt;. Offline communications allows people to see facial expressions such as frowns, shaking hands and many other subtle signs to tell if a person is disapproving, which inhibits what people now are willing to express. ( [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:32, 27 March 2014 (UTC) )

Disinhibition can be split into two opposing directions, benign disinhibition and toxic disinhibition. When people show fear, reveal secret emotions, wishes, and in general share personal things about themselves it can be defined as benign disinhibition. It also suggest that people show unusual acts of generosity and kindness, and can go out of their way to help others. When people act in the opposite way, being rude, give harsh criticism, show anger and hatred and even threats, it can be defined as toxic disinhibition. This means that people visit the dark underworld of the Internet, places they would never explore in the real world, such as pornography, crime and violence-territory&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2004). The online disinhibition effect. Cyberpsychology \&amp; Behavior, 7 (3), pp. 321--326.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Dininhibition has also been defined as people expressing themselves in a way they cannot when offline. They behave in a certain way that expresses what can be defined as the &quot;real me&quot;. The &quot;real me&quot; is not filtered, censored or fabricated and acted - following several dynamic reasons such as social norms and sanctions, shame and guilt. When offline, these people might feel trapped, and once online they feel freer to be closer to their basic personality structure and actualize psychological needs, which can only be done in cyberspace where they can stay anonymous if wanted.&lt;ref&gt;Barak, A. (2008). Psychological aspects of cyberspace. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Low Fidelity/High Fidelity===
Examples of &quot;Low fidelity&quot; communications are ones which are solely text-based or voice-based. Low fidelity is characterised by the lack of interpersonal and social context cues which determine how an individual feels or expresses their opinion. For example, text-based communications can lose the intended meaning depending on how the receiver interprets it. Different emphasis on certain words can change the importance significantly. Voice-based communications are of a slightly higher fidelity, but they lack facial expressions which are a clear indicator of one's position on a matter&lt;ref&gt;Sproull, L. &amp; Kiesler, S. (1986). Reducing social context cues: Electronic mail in organizational communication. Management Science, 32 (11), pp. 1492--1512&lt;/ref&gt;.

Communicating with strangers without face-to-face cues also may lead to the reader subconsciously creating a voice and/or visual image for the other person conducted from their own imagination. This, in turn, will create a different version of the person which the user is communicating with based on his/hers individual desires and needs. Thus, the &quot;reality&quot; of these types of conversations may be distorted and develop into a fantasy face-to-face conversation, imagined by the reader, where the stranger fits into a specific role which the reader requires&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), pp. 184--188.&lt;/ref&gt;. ( [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 13:53, 28 March 2014 (UTC) )

Video based communications give you both voice and facial recognition aspects but they provide a different atmosphere than from when you are in the same room as another human being. For example, content and micro facial expressions can be lost through a drop in signal or a low quality webcam.

===Locked In===
Locked in is the idea that some software and ideas are used so much that they become industry standard and are accepted by most people to the extent that they are nearly impossible to change. Lanier often uses the example of MIDI, a system which was created in the early 1980's. This system concerns musical notes and it transfers them from electronic instruments to computers. Lanier argues that this system is not the best and has limitations; however, as many new and different programmes have been created and adapted to be able to use it, it means that MIDI is still currently used. Another example is the QWERTY keyboard. This layout of keyboard became popular and frequently used in type writers. As most people know how to type using this sort of keyboard and are familiar with this layout, using another one would most likely not be successful with people, meaning that the QWERTY keyboard remains used&lt;ref&gt;Fish, A. (2011). Book review: Jaron Lanier, You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto. New York: Alfred Knopf, 2010. New Media \&amp; Society, 13 (3), pp. 510--513&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Determinism===
====Technological Determinism====
Technological determinism, also known as hard determinism, is the idea that technology has important effects on our lives. It argues that technology drives history and becomes determinant at a certain stage in history. This idea figures prominently in the popular imagination and political rhetoric&lt;ref&gt;Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I. &amp; Kelly, K. (2008). New Media: A Critical Introduction. 2nd ed. London: Taylor And Francis&lt;/ref&gt;.
( [[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 22:35, 1 April 2014 (UTC) )

====Cultural Determinism====
Cultural determinism, also known as soft determinism, is the idea that technology in itself do not have an important effect in peoples life, but people make technology important. Meaning that human agents intend to make technology an important part of their life&lt;ref&gt; Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I. &amp; Kelly, K. (2008). New Media: A Critical Introduction. 2nd ed. London: Taylor And Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;.

* Hey! After today's meeting, we decided to use the APA style of referencing to keep consistency, there is examples of it and details in the module handbook. Also, Gemma found a good link for referencing on wikibooks which is: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:17, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

* Hi Elise. Just been checking out other books - some have included a Glossary - which I think we should do because it is in the main book - and some haven't. And those who have are using different styles. The one for Always on looks good I think. Do you think we should just add to the main book as far as the Glossary goes and stick with the format that is there, or start ours from scratch? For what its worth, I think we should just add to what is there, adding only new stuff based on our own content. What do you think? [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:34, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

* Hi George. Glossary sounds like a good idea. I think we should just add to what is already there. Should I just read everyone's discussion pages and find different words to put in the glossary, or should you send me the glossaries that you guys find most important in conjunction with each topic?

* Hejka! Just to let you know that I have added first points about the psychological aspect of 'always-on'([[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 13:14, 2 April 2014 (UTC))

* Hi Elise - re the Glossaries I think your first idea is best - that is just read everyone's discussion pages and find different words to put in the glossary. Are you going to just go straight to our main page to do this - that would save time. If you do that, you could edit the main book at the bottom, where its says &quot;contributors&quot; and add your name there too.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 16:24, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

*Hi Elise, did you get my email about not being able to make it on Monday 7th to arrange the presentation as I have another meeting at the same time? Do you know if we can reschedule as I feel I need to be there in order to put together the slides effectively.

Hey Kelly, I saw on the main discussion page that you are writing about Sherry Turkle.  I have researched into some of her ideas (it's on my discussion page) which I will add to the main page later.  Is there anything you can see from my information that I have missed?

Hi Kelly, Good idea! I will add the information I already have to the main book now and then after editing together with everyone else's information, then we can decide what other information to research and add.

Glad to see you take my interests as seriously as I do. If I had to pick a jumper it would probably be the one I am wearing as the mere fact I was wearing this one spurred me to put that down as an interest. I'm capricious like that.

In the discussion page it has been decided that we will write her name in lower case throughout the wiki page, so that it remains consistent and coincides with her actual wikipedia page. Thanks!

Hi there! I saw that you posted in the Crowdsourcing page last night about the text box. An easy way to get that is to indent (or place 5 spaces) to the left of every line, creating a space before like this:
     Writing this way
     Should help to define
     that you are writing
     A quote longer than three lines.
If its under three lines, it's totally fine in quotes. This will give you that fancy text box, and will separate the long quote from the rest of your writing. Hope I could be a little bit helpful!

Hey, I am part of the Digital Media course, just in a different seminar group, I left it incredibly late to join a group and Greg told me I could join one of the groups in your seminar. I was wondering if I could join yours, if that would be possible? Let me know.

Yes, we do, it seems a lot of people are already in full groups though... [[User:LinusEDI|LinusEDI]] ([[User talk:LinusEDI|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LinusEDI|contribs]]) 13:33, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

I have no idea, I guess we can start asking some people, see who's group has the lowest members... if not, then Greg did mention earlier, that he might organise another session at the end of the semester for people who are in mixed seminars.

== Group: ==

There seems to be one other person in our seminar without a group, I was thinking of asking them, and we could either just work in a group of three, or maybe recruit someone from one of the other seminars to flesh out our group a bit. What do you think? Greg also said, we could just potentially join a group of five that already exists...

Hey jennifer? What are you looking at for the project? issues that still need addressed or looked into from us are: definitions, introduction to the topic (basic outlines) a glossary... Main concepts and examples. Look at the page so fat there is some good stuff but we will need to add some more. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:39, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Hollie, I've been working on some ideas about TV becoming more interactive and relying on social media/apps etc and thinking about adding something to The Network section about obsessiveness in fan culture eg. the effect of when fans always know where their idol is and/or if being constantly exposed and connected to something increases interest. [[User:Jenniferhw94|Jenniferhw94]] ([[User talk:Jenniferhw94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jenniferhw94|contribs]]) 20:19, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Think that is really good and that totally links in to 'Always on' and being tethered. The celebrities are 'Always on' so that we can know where they are and what they are doing all the times. So then we are 'Always on' because of them... so it is a vicious circle. This can also be linked into fan culture and this could be, in a way, linked into cognitive surplus and the questions of 'free labour or productive creativity'. If we are always on and celbrities are always on and we are part of a fun culture, especially online we are almost advertising for these celebrities. everytime we retweet or like what they are doing, is it free labour/advertisement or just our own personal doing? I am not sure if all this really links but in my head I am making sense of it. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 13:02, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Definitely. Their careers can be improved by having an online presence as well. Maybe it would be a good idea to put something on the page about connections between always on and the other topics? A lot of this relates to online identity as well! [[User:Jenniferhw94|Jenniferhw94]] ([[User talk:Jenniferhw94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jenniferhw94|contribs]]) 15:12, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey there guys! Our new topic is the Always-On Culture. So lets get editing and so on! Personally I'm about to start going over all the slides and reading materials and so on again to get a better idea of what we're wanting to focus on. So...yeah! Meet back here once we're all up to date. Deal? Deal. Happy reading! --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 10:18, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Me again, gentlemen. I've made a few contributions to the page (very impressed that another group has already made a wonderful start. I was looking for more information on the expectation for other people other than yourself to be 'always on'. I'm sure I read something somewhere which has a good few quotes and terms and so on that would be useful, but me being me, I've forgotten entirely where and what it was. Any helpers?
Also maybe we should start discussing other sub-topics we want to put into the main concepts. I divided the two you can see now, but this is a topic which could have a plethora of subcategories, but I don't know how far would just make it more scattered. --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 17:01, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Sounds like a fair enough deal to do some reading before we contribute, even if you've beat us to it. Should we just add to whats already written or kind of do our own thing?

Welcome to the crew, Andrew! I've started doing a few bits and pieces (as you can see from the handy Edit History section ;D) And Rob; we just add to what's there already but as a group here we should decide what we want to focus on. --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 11:47, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Went a wee bit rogue and finished the 'part of the network' bit, thought it would be useful to explain why we're 'always-on' - well I've earned my coffee. Anything you can see needing done Ismay? I could add to the intro or try and make one of those nice brief intros at the top of most Wikipedia pages?

== I Got Confused As To Where Everything Is So Enjoy This New Group Discussion Topic! ==

.........does what it says on the tin. I'l reiterate that I'm keen to discuss today in class what needs to be done in the book because it's a bit cluttered as it stands. I'm spending the morning doing a bit of maintenance; minor edits such as capitalizing things and formatting properly. --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 09:24, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Right...I'm now able to give this more attention than purely doing reading!  Though of course the majority of main points are already there by now.  

Going through what is already there, I feel that although relevant, the whole sections about online dis-inhibition might be somewhat sidetracked or could be better linked specifically to Always On Culture.  This could just be me, let me know what you think.  I felt the Social Context Cues section was more effective, as it brings up irritation at lack of response without knowing the reason behind the delay.   
 
Another point is inconsistency in some of the format.  Some quotes are italicised, others not.  Some are in the main body of discussion, others are seperate.  I'll look up standard formatting for this and set about bringing it all into line. (finally a use for being pernickity as hell)
[[User:Flailkerrin|Flailkerrin]] ([[User talk:Flailkerrin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Flailkerrin|contribs]]) 22:33, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

&quot;For quotations, use only quotation marks (for short quotations) or block quoting (for long ones), not italics. (See Quotations below.) This means that (1) a quotation is not italicized inside quotation marks or a block quote just because it is a quotation, and (2) italics are no substitute for proper quotation formatting. One way to distinguish long block quotes from ordinary text is to use {{quotation}}, which will box the text. Citation links may not work within such templates; if so, it may be necessary to use {{quote}}.&quot;  This may be from wikipedia's manual of standards, but I feel it is what we should go by here too. [[User:Flailkerrin|Flailkerrin]] ([[User talk:Flailkerrin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Flailkerrin|contribs]]) 22:39, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Should've seen that one coming...there is actually a more extensive section on quoting.  I'll not do much more tonight as I am obviously far too tired to be doing this just now!

I need to stop talking to myself...but somebody else recently went through and italicised a bunch of quotes from what I can see...so most likely wouldn't appreciate me going in and reversing all of it.  I'll check back after pending changes have been confirmed.

==Wednesday 2nd==
Hey.....so since I was on last night, another 4000 or so words of content have exploded into existence.  Half of it looks to just be pasted in from wikipedia, descriptions of what ethernet cables are etc.  And I thought that some of the information on dis-inhibiton was irelevant.  I'm not really sure where to start with deleting any of it, especially as I have no doubt those that put it there will simply try to put it back if I do...thoughts? [[User:Flailkerrin|Flailkerrin]] ([[User talk:Flailkerrin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Flailkerrin|contribs]]) 16:52, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Assuming that's coming from Iain. I think it needs to be marked for deletion - at least all of the 3g/4g/cables nonsense. It's all irrelevant and should not be on the article - ESPECIALLY if it's pasted in from Wikipedia. [[User:Americanstephen|Americanstephen]] ([[User talk:Americanstephen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Americanstephen|contribs]]) 16:36, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Iain - it was me who put the stuff on about wired &amp; wireless - and there were other contributions about this from our team too. It wasn't taken from Wikipedia - much of the source material was from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. We felt that how one gets on the internet (and how it can be interrupted) was relevant to the topic of the culture of Always On. There are four groups working collaboratively on this topic and its fine to delete and move stuff - in fact that is the nature of building such a 
Wikibook - but a little discussion and civility (i.e. not being judgmental of other's comments) is also in the spirit of such a collaborative effort.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 17:19, 2 April 2014 (UTC) 

Aye sorry!  Chucked in my tildes now.  I agree, it's completely cluttering up the page and drawing attention away from the actual relevant info.  I haven't checked, and I don't think somebody would do something as ridiculous as paste it across, but either way, needs scrapping.  I'll be back on this evening and will have a go at it myself then if you haven't already!

what did george write about?[[User:Thesmallerandrew|Thesmallerandrew]] ([[User talk:Thesmallerandrew|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thesmallerandrew|contribs]]) 21:06, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Ah dear, seems I've enraged George.  Don't take it personally, I was being objective.  I agree there is a place for it, but as previously stated, my opinion is that links to the bulk of the information would suffice.  The cables that connect are relevant, but the inner workings of them not so much.  I would have happily debated this with you, the whole point of raising it there was so as others could respond!  There is no need for petty condescension or being precious about your contributions.  I stand by my original point, now more so than ever, what really needs done is refining what is there by trimming out unecesary content.  I am sorry you took offense to the blunt nature of my post, oh, and if you'd read all of the comments here before posting you might have spotted I had faith you wouldn't have got the info from wikipedia.

Alright peeps (loyal Magic Unicorns) when is everyone free to meet and discuss/dish out parts of the presentation to do?

Would you guys be awesome and let me know what we're doing at some point after y'all meet up? I'm still very much on board for the skype idea.

Honestly, pretty much any time would work for me. Maybe we could meet at the library sometime next week? Also smashing ideas Ismay, I think that should work fine. I think your participation (simply by skyping in to join us) will be more than enough participation from you.

==Always-On==

===Key Theorists===
danah boyd - I think I'll focus on the chapter given in the weekly reading by boyd, summing up her key ideas with references to them. I'll also look up some of her videos/talks online and see if they give a little extra insight to the topic and reference those in as well. After a quick search online it turns out she did another talk just a few days ago.

Her work in The Social Media Reader (ref) highlights the problems that arise when defining the 'always- on' lifestyle and when being online begins and ends. boyd argues that different social contexts create different relationships with being always-on. This means that how society uses technology is not defined by space, but by the contexts we create. Continuing with this idea, boyd reasons that 'always-on-ers' are characterised by their values and lifestyle rather than generation. Therefore raising questions of who is involved in this always-on lifestyle according to their professional life and social activities, widely varying the spectrum. Furthermore, boyd supports the notion that technology provides a new area for understanding, curiosity, and interaction. This allows users to gain knowledge about people and information, and always-on-ers are taking full advantage of the possibilities available.

I've added this to the yearbook as well as an example written by boyd about Snapchat. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 14:34, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Oh, I'll do some background work on her too. Her books, talks etc and what key themes she is sharing [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 20:44, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

If everyone can, try to keep the section on boyd in the year book as lower case for her name. That's what has been agreed on the discussion page so that's the best way to go about it [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:43, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Ubiquity and the 'network''''

One of boyd's main ideas is that technology and connectivity has become ubiquitous. This means that the technologies are being used as part of everyday life, and no longer thought of as simply technology. boyd refers to ubiquity in terms of how technology is becoming part of the social infrastructure, and supporting people in what they do. Furthermore, boyd is referring to the connectivity of technology and how it is a service for everyday people, not just technologists. This relates to Always-On Culture because as technology becomes more ubiquitous it is being used for more reasons in everyday life, and thus is a key component in being always-on.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/Etech2007.html], boyd, d. (2007) Retrieved on 2nd April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being surrounded by technology also links in with boyd's idea of what the 'network' truly means. boyd believes that the 'network' does not refer to the technology available, but rather to the idea that it offers a new platform to express pre-existing cultural ideas. Interaction and engagement are the driving forces behind information access and communication within the &quot;networked public&quot;. boyd argues that this formation of networks is primarily visible on SNSs and media-sharing websites. The purposes of these networks, according to boyd, are socialisation, consumption, and civic engagement. This links to Always-On Culture because socialising is being greatly influenced by technology and ease it offers in everyday life.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/DigitalHandshakes.pdf], boyd, d.

==Comments==

I think I would like to look at Sherry Tuckle... or were you wanting to do both theorists? [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 15:44, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Go ahead, I was just going to do both if it wasn't going to be covered [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 15:58, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi, I'm Gemma from the Megabytes, we've not heard back from other groups yet but were just wondering what referencing style your group were intending to use. Wiki states that they have no set referencing style yet they like users to keep it consistent (See here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf). Our group thought it would be easier just to stick with APA as that is the set referencing style for Media modules. What do you guys think? Look forward to hearing from you. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 15:23, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I think this is really good, I have nothing to add so far but I will go take a look at the year book and go over it to make sure it looks good there! Maybe putting in a reference here or there... or do you already have them? just to show where you got all your information from! well done on being so organised. I will start on Sherry Tuckle and see where that leads me in regards to other topics. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:32, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Yupp, the references have been added on the main page. Hoping to find some more about it all though if I can [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 18:37, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I am not sure how to find out information/back ground information on Turkle just to add background knowledge without using wikipedia, any ideas? [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 18:43, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hollie, I don't suppose we could link to Turkle's own Wiki page could we? It would be a good link for people to check her work out in more detail without us paraphrasing or copying it out. I'm just not to sure how to do this... anyone have any ideas? Cheers! [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

I'm sure linking to her own Wiki page would be fine, plenty of other articles on Wiki do it. If she has her own website like boyd it will probably have it all there as well [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 18:57, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Sounds good, Linking to her wikipedia page but I am not sure I can use it as an ACTUAL reference, can you cite your own website if you know what I mean, do you think I will need to back up with outside sources too? [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 12:57, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

If you can find outside sources that'd be great, but you could always just link to the Wiki page rather referencing it if you can't find anything [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 13:24, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Siobhan. Just wondering if anyone in your team is looking at building a Glossary? I think we're meant to do that and I don't think we've tackled it in our group yet ... If everybody does it, it could mean a lot of duplicated work. On the other hand not everybody will have identical terms to put in the main glossary. Just wondered what you or your team thought?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:25, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

That makes sense Siobhan re just adding to the existing Glossary list as we go along.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 20:04, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for the message on using lower case for boyd. I wasn't sure also and remember that it was in lower case in the powerpoints too. [[User:Cir00004|Cir00004]] ([[User talk:Cir00004|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cir00004|contribs]]) 20:21, 1 April 2014 (UTC)   

Heeey!! Thanks for letting me know about the boyd letter casing. Sorry it took so long to reply, I'm still trying to firgure this massive database out haha. Hope you've managed to do it ok! [[User:Thetallerandrew|Thetallerandrew]] ([[User talk:Thetallerandrew|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thetallerandrew|contribs]]) 21:45, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey. I agree that we should have danah boyd's name lower case throughout and I definitely think it will look much better if there is consistency throughout the page.

Hello guys, just in reference to the boyd name issue, just out of sheer interest does anyone know why she chooses not to capitalise her name? I just find the concept really interesting and wondered if people had any sort of knowledge on it maybe? [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

You might find this little post by her of interest http://www.danah.org/name.html. I think that clears up a lot about why she chooses to. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:34, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hej Siobhan I wrote Boyd's ideas about 'always-on' based on her piece of writing 'Participating in the always-on lifestyle'. Maybe you could add the bit about the addiction to media. She has quite interesting opinion about that. She doesn't think that people can be addicted to the technology. People love technology but only because it's a tool for communication. The truth is that people are passionate about people. Hope that help a bit.

==Group meeting==

So we're meeting on the 9th April, just thought we could put some things to discuss in here.


We'll need to cover;

who is researching what parts

how we want to present it (powerpoint etc)

who will make the presentation

what questions to open class discussion


Any other ideas? [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:55, 2 April 2014 (UTC)


I had an idea about putting together a little intro film to start the presentation of. I can pull together a sort of slideshow movie type thing on Windows Movie Maker with a bit of an overview of the topic, some pictures, open questions and references. I don't mind putting that together myself but getting your opinions and input would be great :) [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

That sounds cool! It might be a good place to put examples as well, just so we don't have to awkwardly try to explain them. If that makes sense? [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:30, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey, what exactly is it that we have to put in the presentation? Are we talking about our thoughts on putting together a wiki book, always on or both? I think the film thing is a good idea. [[User:Heyrach|Heyrach]] ([[User talk:Heyrach|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Heyrach|contribs]]) 16:13, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I think it's a bit of both, the handbook explains it all in more detail though. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 16:53, 4 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

Hi Kathyrn - re the reference point you were asking about - one of our team found this link from Wikimedia - basically it says (near the bottom) that wiki doesn't use a specific reference style and as long as the style we use is consistent then that's the main thing. As our module uses the APA style we've decided to use that one for referencing inside wiki. Hope this helps! https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 16:35, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey Katrina, I was just wondering, do you think our group should take a subject each and try and work on that or should we just contribute to which ever sub-heading we want?

Hi. I thinks it's a good idea to meet up. I think we should, instead of focusing on one topic each, try and get as much knowledge as we can about the other topics. That way, if there is something one of us, or the other group, has missed out, then we can include it.

Hi Katrina! So far our stuff has mainly been within our own group - it has been a bit easier to do it that way so far as we had a face-to-face meeting to discuss how to tackle the project. But now we are up and running, talking to other groups is sort of where we are now. We're all going to try to contribute to others now that we've got the hang of it. I'll see if I can contribute to your stuff soon. One problem we've had is that some other team members have put their stuff straight on to the book which has made it hard (impossible maybe?) for others to contribute to it - but that's probably because we're all just getting used to it![[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 17:37, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Presentations''' We should really do this for our presentation. Would you be able to help me set it up?:

Hi Elizabeth! One person from our group just created another user page like the one we all have (ie. mine is BobblehatImara; yours is ButtonsElizabeth) and named it after the group. We all post on the discussion page of that, like I am posting on your discussion page now. Just make sure that the creator of the page logs off of that and back on to their individual user page, or else Greg will not be able to track their posts on the page. Hope this helps! [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 20:27, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

If you go on my user talk page you can access the group discussion page I have set up [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 21:11, 2 April 2014 (UTC)


'''Referencing''' I can certainly try. The key part is the &lt; ref &gt; bit at the start of your normal reference and the &lt;/ ref &gt; bit at the end. Make sure there are no spaces in the entire thing however (I  just had to do spaces here because it would actually make it a reference otherwise, and just put the normal way of referencing in the middle. I hope this helps. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 21:54, 2 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

Hi Kelly! Hope all good with you. Did you get Aj's message about our meeting on Monday 31st March at 1pm in the library? You can add things you want to talk about on my user page - three things on it so far. [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 11:09, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey Kelly, after discussion today, we decided on the APA style of referencing for now, the details of this are in the module handbook.  For help with referencing on wikibook, here is a helpful link that Gemma found: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:13, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Kelly! I feel like some of the things you will contribute are linked with my definitions, so it would be nice to know what you are gonna write and if I should add anything to the definition part of the Wikibook page! [[User:StineEliseJ|StineEliseJ]] ([[User talk:StineEliseJ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StineEliseJ|contribs]]) 17:01, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Kelly - good to see you today. Just been checking out other books - some have included a Glossary - which I think we should do because it is in the main book - and some haven't. And those who have are using different styles. The one for Always on looks good I think. Do you think we should just add to the main book as far as the Glossary goes and stick with the format that is there, or start ours from scratch? For what its worth, I think we should just add to what is there, adding only new stuff based on our own content. What do you think? Do you want to look at our other team member's stuff and build a Glossary?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:37, 1 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello all, this is Team Tenacious D's page for the Stirling Uni Digital Media Wiki project. We can use this space to discuss things together rather than having to organise discussions on seperate profiles because Wikipedia's user experience is horrible and unintuituve.

PLEASE NOTE: Please don't log in and use this account to take part in discussions cause we won't be able to tell who's who. What I mean by that is we can use this user page's discussion area to talk amongst ourselves in a way that Greg can track, but using our individual accounts. I hope that's clear...

Cool. [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 16:07, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Sooo guys. Has anyone done some research yet/ ideas how to structure this? I was thinking we could start with a definition (duh!) and then maybe focus on the different areas that online identity applies to/ where it is important, e.g. social media/networks, the gaming sector (avatars?!), etc. so how we present ourselves online really, maybe if online identity = real life identity (and the differences) and then as the &quot;flip side&quot; the privacy protection e.g. privacy settings, copyright, etc. What do you think? I'm not gonna lie I don't really have a clearly structured image of this in my head, just dropping off some ideas here... --[[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 12:37, 23 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

Yeah! And now to boost my energy levels enough to use this clunky thing for an enire project... [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 13:55, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

== Starting off - Where do we begin? ==

So... What's first? [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 14:24, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Should we all just do research on online identity by ourselves and then come together and figure out what's important what everyone wants to do etc? I feel weird commenting on this since I'm sort of the add-on in the group haha [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 16:09, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey! I've doing some reading about this and if it's okay with you guys, I was thinking about doing a bit about how development of social media has affected how identities are formed online. Eg. 10 years ago it was all chatrooms with nicknames and now it's on Facebook with our own names, like the identities are more authentic. I think I can maybe link to that technological determinism, too, since the computer that we had 10 years ago wouldn't have been able to sustain something like Facebook etc. Is this okay with everybody? Suggestions are always welcome! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 10:01, 22 March 2014 (UTC)

Ok I'll just paste what I wrote on the other discussion board thingy (so confusing!):
Sooo guys. Has anyone done some research yet/ ideas how to structure this? I was thinking we could start with a definition (duh!) and then maybe focus on the different areas that online identity applies to/ where it is important, e.g. social media/networks, the gaming sector (avatars?!), etc. so how we present ourselves online really, maybe if online identity = real life identity (and the differences) and then as the &quot;flip side&quot; the privacy protection e.g. privacy settings, copyright, etc. What do you think?

I think that the privacy aspect is a really good idea since it's an important part of online identities! I also liked the idea you mentioned about gaming and online identities since some people are actually 'married' to someone else in their gaming world. You'll probably get a lot out of that since there's some psychology aspect in that too, I think [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 13:26, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

I agree Liisa. Plus you're lucky to have a psychology expert on your team (which is me in case you didn't get the hint). I was just googling some stuff and the first entry you get is of course Wikipedia (surprise!) but I though it could be useful to get an overview on our subtopic first, so I'll post the link for everyone here. Most importantly read the section on &quot;Online Social Identity&quot;!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_identity --[[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 13:37, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

That's why you're in the group, Lea! Should we also consider how online identities are important for growing business', cause when you google online identity, first suggestions are eg. 'how you can make create an online identity for your business' etc. But does that relate to our topic enough? [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 13:46, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Ok just to take the discussion here and to sum up:
⇒Liisa &amp; Lea: Development
⇒Martin: Security
⇒Euan: Interlinking
⇒Camilla: ?
⇒Imara: ?
I think Liisa's got a point here. Anyone interested in the business part? You could also talk about personalised adverts e.g. on Facebook.
--[[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 13:53, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

It's probably prudent to point out here that we are talking on Facebook as well and are still trying to work out how to make discussing on here work better. But yes, I'll be doing to security part which will cover things like how secure/insecure our profiles and such are. I'll do some research and maybe post some links in here if I find anything of use to us in general whilst doing that! Also I've mailed Greg about Facebook chat logging.[[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 13:59, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, it's a good idea to post stuff here if we come across subjects that other people are doing because it is a collaboration after all! And we're all researching about the same thing basically, so help is always good. A lot of smart people = a really good wikibooks page. ;D [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 14:04, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

UPDATE: '''Liisa:''' Development, '''Martin:''' Security, '''Euan:''' Interlinking '''Lea:''' Personalised Advertising, '''Camilla:''' Online identities in the professional worklife, '''Imara:''' ?

UPDATE 2.0: '''Liisa:''' Development, '''Martin:''' Security, '''Euan:''' Interlinking '''Lea:''' Personalised Advertising, '''Camilla:''' Online identities in the professional worklife, '''Imara:''' Blending Identities

I think it's a great idea to all go and do some separate research on our chosen topics, then when we get some material down on our page that's when we can form a better flow and structure, and start helping each other out too. I'd like to take on the subject of blending online and offline identities, for example in the case of online dating, as Lea suggested in the Facebook chat discussion. Hopefully we can make some really good links between our topics and the lecture/seminar material aswell! [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 15:35, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Good idea, Imara! We can definitely link our topic to other topics covered in the lecture like technological determinism, lock-in, cognitive surplus etc. so we should try to do that! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 08:31, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

How's the research going for you guys? I was wondering how academic our texts have to be as I'm currently looking at loads of super sophisticated journal articles (I'm not going to lie- I'm not a business person and the stuff they say freaks me out a little)... --[[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 10:45, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

Had a wee look at the module handbook and it does infact say &quot;evidence of independent reading of appropriate academic material&quot;, so super sophisticated journal articles are ideal! [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 16:54, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

Oh yaaaay. Should probably read &quot;Business for Dummies&quot; first... :P Thanks! [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 20:08, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

I just found a pretty good dissertation that I'd like to bring to your attention. It talks about identity representation in social media, especially from a commercial kind of perspective (so highly relevant for my bit) but also addresses more general issues such as privacy concerns (Martin?), anonymity, etc. Of course it shouldn't be used as an &quot;academic&quot; primary source, but it cites loads of theorists and general concepts behind impression management online. So you should definitely have a look and check if there is anything in it that might be relevant for your section or maybe use it as a theoretical starting point: http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/files/2013/10/A_critique_of_identity_representation_in_social_media.pdf
Also I was thinking about including something on targeted adverts, I hope this isn't going to much into your topic, Euan?! [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 09:07, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

Cheers for the material! It's a great idea to share articles we all think might be useful, so that we can help each other out as much as possible. Just wanted to ask, are we allowed to link to other wiki pages? For example, if I write the phrase 'online dating', I'd like to highlight and insert a link to the actual Wikipedia page on online dating. Is this allowed? Also, when we've got some information written up on our subject, do we want to post it in this discussion page first, on the yearbook discussion page, or straight on to the yearbook page? I'm guessing the latter, but one of the first two might be useful in terms of getting a couple of opinions before posting officially, though it can always be edited by other users once it's posted officially anyway. Just wondering what everyone's thoughts were. How are you guys getting on so far? I've got a basic definition for blending identity and a couple of examples, just trying to find some academic material to back it up and possible links to lecture and seminar materials. I was also thinking of adding a short word on misrepresentation of identity but possibly only through the media of online dating and fandom as I'm sure misrepresentation might come under someone else's topic (?) and I don't want to be stealing it. If someone else is already writing about misrepresentation, give me a shout and I'll steer clear. [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 13:48, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

P.S. Does this count as appropriate academic material? (http://www.dourish.com/classes/readings/Slater-SocialRelationshipsIdentity.pdf) I'm unsure as to how to reference this. Check it out though, there's some good stuff in there! [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 18:02, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I agree with you, Imara. I've just finished gathering all the info and I hope I'll soon manage to actually produce something. Would be good if someone approved before we're posting stuff... About the wikipedia thing- I have no idea! I guess as long as you just use it as a starting point/ inspiration for further research without actually having to cite Wikipedia as your source it should be fine. That article looks pretty good, I'm sure that counts as academic. I was wondering how the actual writing process is supposed to work- do we have to add something regularly whenever we're working on it (so kind of like we would do in our word documents) or post it all as a whole once we're finished?! How's everyone else getting on? Don't make me feel bad by saying you've already started writing please! I've got so much other stuff on my plate I don't know how to cope..! [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 19:12, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Someone else is doing blended identities too, should I post in the yearbook discussion page what I have so far and ask him to collate or just post it straight on to the yearbook page itself? I'm not sure of the rules here... [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 17:32, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

I think it would be best to cooperate. Just write on the person's personal user discussion board and organise your topic, so there is no time wasted on writing the same text basically. You could narrow down your focus a little or concentrate on a case study or something? I think that would be a good approach to it. [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 10:56, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm currently making my first attempt at writing up all the stuff I found on online advertising but I realised I really have no idea what kind of writing style we should have... [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 13:06, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

RE:Lea, the writing style, having looked around wikipedia some, seems to be mostly focusing on accurate and clear writing. So another way to put it is to avoid literary flourishes and flowery language in stead of being succinct and to the point. Also, apologies all for my silence as I've been having some trouble logging into Wiki on my computer! But I'm back now! My security stuff is going not bad, I'm going to draft something up tonight. One thing I've noticed, and I've posted this on the books' discussion page as well, is that I've noticed that privacy and security are pretty interlinked for social media. Is everyone okay if I at least partially talk about privacy issues as well? EDIT: I've got a book out the Library called &quot;Social Media a Critical Introduction&quot;. It seems to cover a wide range of topics that are immediately useful to us such as security, information useage, fandom, social media in politics and even wikipedia (which I hadn't considered but I guess is a form of social media). I think there's another copy available but if not then if anyone wants to borrow the book or at least meet up to look at it, give me shout! [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 19:01, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi! Sorry I've been a bit MIA, my laptop broke and had to be fixed and didn't get it back until Friday. The best part was that an essay that was due today was completely lost, so I had to do it all over again, which is why I haven't been able to concentrate on this project. But that's done now and I'll start working on it. You all seem to have handle on everything, so there's a bit of catching up for me to do! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 16:19, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Oh, by the way, I found this http://www.postgradolinguistica.ucv.cl/dev/documentos/90,889,Social_network_boyd_2007.pdf which relates to lot of our topics, so look through it, it's really useful! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 17:13, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys, i was talking to Lea and Imara today, and Lea said she was concerned about putting her piece up without it being proof read first, so i suggested that she post it on her own discussion page, and then tell us on here once she's done that. This would also help boost our engagement marks as we could then launch discussions on each others discussion pages which I imagine would help out our engagement marks quite a bit. [[User:EuanWhitelaw|EuanWhitelaw]] ([[User talk:EuanWhitelaw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/EuanWhitelaw|contribs]]) 14:28, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Im also thinking about switching my subject focus to youtube as form of social media and online identity, i was thinking about going along the lines of how it is part of the movement away from anonymity focusing on vlogs and the like, as they are literally showing their faces, voices and homes to the world. and i'm sure ill be able to tie in some theorists and things other people have written into this. I fyou guys think of anything that might be useful, I'm open to suggestions. [[User:EuanWhitelaw|EuanWhitelaw]] ([[User talk:EuanWhitelaw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/EuanWhitelaw|contribs]]) 14:41, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

That sounds good, Euan! Vlogs are a current topic and it hasn't been covered yet, so go for it! Maybe you could consider how often the vloggers have to perform and keep up a certain personality that might not correspond to their real life identity. Or maybe not, I only thought about that since I just wrote an essay for English about performing identities and Shakespeare's Coriolanus, so it might not be relevant to the subject of vlogs at all haha. [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 15:06, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, that could be interesting to think about, because some vloggers show their actual personality and lives, where as some only bring certain aspects of their lives in, and others create an entirely different character. The theory pert id probably what im going to struggle with coz im no good at tying theories into the things im talking about [[User:EuanWhitelaw|EuanWhitelaw]] ([[User talk:EuanWhitelaw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/EuanWhitelaw|contribs]]) 15:15, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

The topic of vlogs is an excellent idea; it centers completely around a user's identity and is also pretty modern. I went ahead and posted a section on online dating to the yearbook page (pending approval), as I just wanted to get a basis down instead of posting it to my page and waiting for advice. However, I still think this is a great idea for anyone who isn't sure if their piece needs work or not- mine does, but I feel better having got it down on the page and now being free to expand and edit it. Loving all this collaboration and discussion! Thanks again for the idea of using Tinder, Liisa! [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 22:09, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I just looked at the actual Online Identity page and holy moly it's grown a lot since I last checked! Thank god no one's covered my topic so far. I'm still not quite sure how long my text should be- I have a feeling it's way too long already! [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 12:15, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

The actual page is so huge that I feel bad for anybody trying to read the whole thing. At the same time it shows how much there's to talk about when it comes to online identity, so doing a presentation about it should be no problem! I hope...[[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 15:21, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm slightly confused at the moment as one of my friends told me today that we kind of deliberately have to leave stuff out so other people can cover it. But then again, I know that no one else is doing my topic and it' not exactly stuff you can base on common knowledge anyway, so I'd rather write about everything I found out...?! [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 16:07, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Why should we leave stuff out for other people? Is it so the people who are going to do this on Friday at the last minute have something to write about? I think you should put everything you found, Lea, since it's your work and you've spent a lot of time one it. [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 16:36, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah that's exactly what I thought! Also I picked such a narrow topic so I wouldn't step on someone else's toes and basically had a section to myself. Even though I don't mind collaborating but I'm not holding myself back just because there is a chance that someone else wanted to talk about the same... And people can always edit each other's stuff anyway... [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 17:09, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Just go for it, Lea, it's only 2 days until the deadline and you should show off all of your hard work! [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 18:12, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah will do. How's it going for you guys? Everyone clear about their stuff? [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 21:06, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm getting there, slowly but surely. I think I have 2-3 paragraphs more to add to my content. I don't know exactly how long to make this but I figure keeping it concise and to the point is better at the moment at least and then it can be expended upon by other wikipedians perhaps. On another note, I know that we're meeting up about this this weekend, but I was having a think about things we could do during our presentation and also did some looking around and one idea I thought might be quite cool is if we get everyone in the class to write down their most recent status update on Facebook, or if they're not on Facebook then maybe Twitter, and then mix them up and hand them out randomly and see if people can guess who's status's they are. It works on a number of different levels theory wise and it's also a bit of fun. Thoughts? [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 22:17, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

well, on Lea's note just before martins... not so clear on mine tbh. I just thought about changing about what I am writing. I think Online Identity theft might be a quite interesting topic aswell. Looking through the wikipage, I don't think anyone's covered it quite in depth yet. 
I have been battling with sort of an issue relating to that with gmail, so it's a topic I've been (having to) look[ing] into... what do you think? Is it an useless addition to the page that already has lots of posts on Online Identity Management? Although none is specific to Online ID theft. ([[User:Camilla baier|Camilla baier]] ([[User talk:Camilla baier|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Camilla baier|contribs]]) 02:24, 3 April 2014 (UTC))

ok, scratch that. sticking to my old topic of online identity in the professional worklife. I will relate it back to self representation on SNS's using LinkedIn as a case study. Sort of..... I think. ([[User:Camilla baier|Camilla baier]] ([[User talk:Camilla baier|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Camilla baier|contribs]]) 02:34, 3 April 2014 (UTC))

Linkedin is a good idea, Camilla, and I don't think anyone's covered that yet, so go for it! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 08:52, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Camilla:''' I think you're free to cover any topic you want as long as you can back it up with facts and link it back to online identity, so whatever you plan to do is will be fine. I think the professional perspective on online identity might be quite interesting though as it adds something a bit more &quot;practical&quot; to the wikibook if that makes sense... [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 09:31, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Guys, if I posted my stuff on my discussion board once I've finished it would you read/edit it for me before I post it on the &quot;official&quot; site? Don't want to embarrass myself by publishing something which is less than good (I don't expect perfection). Thaaanks! [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 09:49, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I think '''Martin''' and '''Liisa's''' ideas are very good. You really have to put some interaction in there, otherwise the other's will lose interest go on their phone *wink wink* Lea ;-) I've taught groups before, and it's always good to have a joker up your sleeve in form of an activity. You have no idea how terribly wrong time management can go when giving a class. You think you're completely prepared and that's gonna be the best class of your life, but suddenly you have gone through all your material, have nothing more to say and there's 15 pairs of expectant eyes staring at you and you still have 35 minutes to fill. It's not fun.
So I think having a couple of short activities is really good, while of course, like Lea said, not losing track of the objective of teaching. ([[User:Camilla baier|Camilla baier]] ([[User talk:Camilla baier|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Camilla baier|contribs]]) 11:01, 3 April 2014 (UTC))

'''To Everyone:''' I just posted my final draft on my discussion board. I'd very much appreciate your feedback before I post it on the wiki.

==Presentation==

I created a different section just for the presentation, so it's easier to keep track what we've been saying. I like the idea you had Martin, sounds fun! I was also thinking about impression management while once again posting a picture of my dinner on Instagram. I took like 10 pictures of it and chose one, so if someone would like to volunteer their selfies as an example for that, it'd be great. Like we could have a slide where there's the finished Instagram picture and all of the other shots that we're taken next to it. Thoughts?  [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 08:56, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Martin:''' It is certainly a good idea to include some activity that engages the class and makes them think about/apply some of the issues and theories addressed in our presentation. So that would probably be a good start/end. However we have to keep track of the time and make sure the &quot;fun stuff&quot; doesn't dominate our seminar... sounds harsh but I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.

'''RE Liisa:''' That sounds like a pretty good approach to it! We could even extend it a bit further talking about profile pictures on Facebook or even Tinder and Snapchat (where you only get to see the picture for 10 sec max but still we mostly try to send a decent photo)... [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 09:36, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Lea''' Good shout with Tinder, Lea since it automatically takes your pictures from FB but you get to decide which pictures are fit to be seen. Add to that, I have a friend who added tons of pictures of herself on FB when she joined Tinder and updated her interest list etc. just so she could get more/better matches. [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 09:54, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Liisa:''' That's exactly the kind of examples that I was thinking of. We should definitely try to include these points, maybe ask the class a couple of questions about their own identity management on these sites before we present our findings?! [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 11:02, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''To everyone:''' So just to be very clear- when, what, how? Meeting up?

Yeah, I was wondering about that, too. Are we moving it to Sunday, since Camilla's coming back then? If so, we should all look at the group presentation stuff and start thinking about how we're gonna do it. Should we book a room in the library for it?

Sunday could be good as most of us seem to be free pretty much all day, giving us plenty of time to blast through this. Early afternoon @ library? Booking a room could be ideal!

== Reply to your message on my talk page ==

In reply to the question about references; Wikibooks seems to be less fussy about references than Wikipedia.  References for many ideas which come from the same source, I believe, only need to be referenced once.  Page numbers are considered very useful if you can.  As you are developing this book for an academic project then it may also depend on the standards or requirements for your course - in that case check with your tutors or other students.  
There is no standard format for books here.  One idea would be to look at previously made books at [[Wikibooks:Card_Catalog_Office|Browse All Books]] or [[Wikibooks:Featured_books|Featured Books]].  The second link will show you some examples of what the Wikibooks community consider to be the best books and you get some nice ideas there.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:26, 9 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

='''Always-On'''=


&lt;u&gt;'''Danah Boyd about 'Always-On''''&lt;/u&gt; 

The common assumption of the term ‘always-on’ means to be connected to online activities twenty four hours a day. It’s like a never ending machine which consumes our life. For some people it’s like that, however Boyd’s theory suggests that being ‘always-on’ doesn't signify someone who is always available online. Boyd underlines that her ‘always-on-ness doesn't mean that I am always accessible to everyone’. She is not a prisoner of constant online activities; it’s not about physical presence online. It’s more about being always connected to the network. As Boyd says ‘it’s no longer on or off reality. It’s about living in the world where being networked to people and information wherever and whenever you need it is just assumed. I may not be always-on the internet as we think of it colloquially, but I am always connected to the network. And that’s what it means to be always-on’.  

Boyd argues that the boundaries between reality and virtuality have become blurred, and that the division which was once there perhaps does not matter as much in this day and age. She states that people who have adopted an &quot;always-on&quot; lifestyle are interested in living in an &quot;augmented&quot; reality which features alterations in their original life to fulfil needs and desires which may not be possible without the use of technology. ''(Boyd, D. 2012. 'Participating in an Always-on Lifestyle'. pp. 74 - 75)'' [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:07, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Being always-on is strongly connected with the availability of technology. Boyd mentions that ‘online is always just in the corner’. That’s when she came to conclusion that even while going about her offline activities  such as shopping, meeting friends face to face and etc. the technology is always there to be use. She can, anytime and anywhere connect to the network for example via her phone. This leads to her argument that the distinctions between the virtual and the real are so weak, that users have to declare &quot;off-time&quot; to let everyone know they will not be &quot;always-on&quot; and contactable (E.g. Facebook holidays), otherwise the user's friends and family will suddenly become worried about the individual due to their lack of connectivity. ''(Boyd, D. 2012. 'Participating in an Always-on Lifestyle'. p. 71)'' [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:07, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

According to Boyd being always-on is like being a part of the online community where people are connected to each other through layers of information. She calls it an ‘ecosystem in which people can stay connected to one another through a variety of microdata’. That’s where she made interesting point about online addiction. Some people see being always-on as an obsession; a virtual sickness which destroys lives. Boyd argues that always-on has nothing to do with technological addiction but more to do with the passion that people have for information and the lives of others.

Whilst Boyd seems to make a relevant point that our online lives are as ‘real’ as our offline lives, more could be said about the significant difference between these two aspects of our lives, in particular how we behave online versus how we behave offline. Suler (2005) makes the point that when we communicate online, our input comes after some delay, perhaps minutes or hours or days, and this affects what we say, in text form, and how we say it. Importantly, he asserts that when we communicate face-to-face with others, “moment-by-moment responses between people powerfully shapes the ongoing flow of self-disclosure, usually in the direction of conforming to social norms” (p. 185). If this is the case, if an increasing amount of our time is spent online this could perhaps leave some people struggling with face-to-face social skills necessary to fit into a particular environment, such as that of an organisation with a clear expectations of cultural behaviour, or to succeed in particular roles where face-to-face interaction with people is necessary. [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 22:36, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
 • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:42, 26 March 2014 (UTC)  Technology is only a new way to satisfy those needs.  
Boyd doesn't completely deny that being ‘always-on’ doesn't cause issues however It can be sometimes overwhelming; that’s why it’s extremely important to keep the balance and have a healthy approach for using technology. Everyone have to find their own way to be connected to the online community.


&lt;u&gt;'''Psychological aspect of ‘Always-On’'''&lt;/u&gt;

There are some psychological issues related to being ‘always-on’ such as:

* ‘Being drop into a mode of permanent online activity’. Constantly checking messages on the smartphones can lead to the point that there is no break whatsoever.  This situation can create lots of stress which finally makes people to feel overwhelmed, depressed and in some cases makes them even commit suicide. 

* The pressure of being ‘always-on’ is huge especially in the work place. There is confusion where the media demands stops and where the life starts. ‘Work and life are blended into a stressful soup of endless demands. In many workplaces, switching off is seen as uncommitted, even unprofessional’.  Many people are place in the situation that the demands from the work place take over their personal life.

Hey! I found some great disadvantages when researching Sherry Turkle that I briefly mentioned.  Ideas like the break down of communication, such as children struggle to form conversations etc.  She mentions this a lot in her 2012 Ted Talk.  In an article in the New York times she quotes a 16 year old that says: “Someday, someday, but certainly not now, I’d like to learn how to have a conversation.” The full article is: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/opinion/sunday/the-flight-from-conversation.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0. This may help for some ideas. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 10:53, 3 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

Hi Katie, I'm from the other team who's working on cognitive surplus. Thanks for getting in touch! We're currently discussing ideas; one member of our team has posted a short introduction on the cognitive surplus wikibook. The majority of our ideas are being discussed on the page you posted on. Since it's mid semester break we haven't had the chance to meet as a group, so we've mostly been communicating through our discussion page and also on Facebook. We're hoping to use Clay Shirky's book on Cognitive Surplus as a starting point and hope to build on our ideas from there. We've also been researching the topic online and so far we have found a variety of articles which have provided us with some real life examples, making the concept of cognitive surplus easier to understand. Have your group taken a similar approach? [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 01:12, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi there,
well basically pne of our group members set up another account with our group name. No one's actually logged-in on the account, we are just using the discussion board to keep each other updated (without having to annoy everyone else), post links and help each other out.

=== Usage ===

This template is used to set an uniform appearance on {{TL|Project|Trainz Projects}}, their Admin and template pages.
: It presents the same color (as seen here as background) for all such pages, normally used in a &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style={{TRS-style}}&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; manner.
&lt;br&gt;
: but will take parameters 1, 2, or 3 and expand the formatting withing the quoted style when given such parameters (i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; etc.).
&lt;br/&gt;
==EXTENDED MODES==
: The template will also take stock formatting parameters BG, B, M, or P to define respectively: 'background', 'border', 'margin' and 'padding' HTML commands. THESE FOUR contain the prefix words just listed with the colon, so only define the desired variables.
&lt;br/&gt;
Contrast with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}, {{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; parameters which must contain the whole HTML format command including the colons.) Note strings passed to these appear later on the style string command, and may override default behavior or BG&amp;ndash;P differently in different browsers if they overlap commands. (i.e. Unpredictable behavior, so don't provide a conflict!)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Liver Diagram.svg|thumbnail|right]]
'''[[w:Livers|Livers]]''' &quot;is a vital organ present in vertebrates and some other animals. It has a wide range of functions, including detoxification, protein synthesis, and production of biochemicals necessary for digestion. The liver is necessary for survival; there is currently no way to compensate for the absence of liver function in the long term, although new liver dialysis techniques can be used in the short term. This gland plays a major role in metabolism and has a number of functions in the body, including glycogen storage, decomposition of red blood cells, plasma protein synthesis, hormone production, and detoxification. It lies below the diaphragm in the abdominal-pelvic region of the abdomen. It produces bile, an alkaline compound which aids in digestion via the emulsification of lipids. 

The liver's highly specialized tissues regulate a wide variety of high-volume biochemical reactions, including the synthesis and breakdown of small and complex molecules, many of which are necessary for normal vital functions.

Terminology related to the liver often starts in hepar- or hepat- from the Greek word for liver, hēpar (ἧπαρ, root hepat-, ἡπατ-).&quot; &lt;small&gt;[1]&lt;/small&gt;
== What do they do? ==
Our livers do three main things which helps and supports our body: digests food, makes proteins, and gets rids of bad stuff. All the blood that goes through our intestines goes to our liver where we get rid of the bad blood cells. So, all your blood cells have to go through your liver before it goes to your heart. Your liver is kind off like the protector of your body. The liver decides what gets kept out, what gets patted down and what's allowed to go through your body.

== Where are they? ==
Below the [[Esophagus]], few inches below your nipple.

== How do we protect them? ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">ion3 is/was a tiling WM that would primarily be operated with the keyboard, but also allowed for basic operations, like switching and dragging windows as well as resizing frames, using a mouse.

The windows are tiled in frames, with their titles in tabs above the actual content, so multiple windows could be inside one frame, but only one remains visible with its tab highlighted accordingly. Clicking the mouse on a tab is an alternative way of switching the active window. Secondary mouse button on the tab would bring up a menu with basic window operations.

It's configuration files are written in lua code, thus enabling rather dynamic setups.

ion3 also has a very basic floating window mode that could optionally be chosen when creating new workspaces (virtual desktops). Windows can not be iconified, but at least rolled up.

A minor flaw in ion3 is not being able to use the mouse to bring up a root menu for launching applications. So it could be operated with the mouse to some degree, but relies on the keyboard or at least some sort of launcher to start applications. Switching workspaces is also not possible without the use of a keyboard or a workaround that would translate mouse events to keys.</text>

;usage
:This template is used to tag [[Trainz]] categories regardless of volume organization. It automatically adds a Trainz category to the composite Administrative list [[:category:All Trainz categories]] unless the inhibit parameter is defined.
* It takes both the optional parameters &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{text}}} or {{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and presents that message inside the box shown above, which also first displays the default header message above.
* The message above can be lengthened with Administrative links for Trainz Admin categories by defining the parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{admin}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to any value.
&lt;br/&gt;
That message appears like this using filler boilerplate:
{{Trainz-cat|inhibit=yes|xadmin=yes|1={{Lorem}}... }}&lt;br/&gt;
* The parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{alt-header}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; can be passed entirely replacing both default message behaviors for an alternative title line, whereas &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{text}}} or {{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; still function as described. 
&lt;br/&gt;

Hi, I'm Gemma from the Megabytes, we've not heard back from other groups yet but were just wondering what referencing style your group were intending to use. Wiki states that they have no set referencing style yet they like users to keep it consistent (See here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf). Our group thought it would be easier just to stick with APA as that is the set referencing style for Media modules. What do you guys think? Look forward to hearing from you.

Hi. Here are a couple of the links that I was talking about in the discussions page. [http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2012/02/research/study-predicts-always-on-generation-will-excel-at-multitasking-lag-in-patience-and-focus/ Digital Shift] and [http://www.elon.edu/e-web/predictions/expertsurveys/2012survey/future_generation_AO_2020.xhtml Imagining the Internet] [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 13:43, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Rachel, I hope you don't mind but I'm starting to work on the newspaper section of the Wiki book just now. Would you mind if I edited some of the stuff you've already put in that section? I'm still looking for good sources but as a journalism student I can probably write quite a bit about it just off the top of my head anyway :) Let me know what you think [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 17:25, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

== References ==

We are using APA referencing, so just add quote and what you have to say about it then do the brackets after (**,**) and then put the actual reference in the 'references' section on the 'Always On' page. If you need any more help just write on my discussion page.

I've commented on everyone's discussions with the TeamAlphaDGM account so everyone should be able to access it. If everyone adds this page to their watchlists it means we can easily keep up with what's happening! '''Our topic is cognitive surplus.''' New section below just to list some ideas of what we should include! 
[[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 14:29, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

[[Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/Chapter_4:_Cognitive_Surplus|Digital Media and Culture Yearbook 2014 - Chapter 4: Cognitive Surplus]]

==Ideas==
Free digital labour, the &quot;hive mind&quot; mentality, theories from Gauntlett and Shirky. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 14:29, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

Picking central topics looks quite difficult - there seems to be a lot of crossover between Cognitive Surplus and Collective Intelligence, like the hive mind. Do you think its okay for us to talk about topics that might be covered in other chapters? [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 13:53, 21 March 2014 (UTC)

I don't see why it should be a problem, as Greg said at the beginning of the module we're meant to look at the module collectively and not treat each week as separate to the next. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 11:54, 21 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys, I just found this video on cognitive surplus by clay shirky, I've not watched it yet so not sure how useful it will be, but I thought I'd post it here anyway http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 12:40, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

I just watched that video - he talks a bit about how generosity is part of cognitive surplus, so that could be another main concept? [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 14:22, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

I found the link to the wiki page about the Cognitive Surplus book written by Clay Shirky, I think the chapter list provides some good ideas for main concepts. There are a few copies of the book available in the library which would probably be useful for us. [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 14:34, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

The TED talk was really useful, definitely agree that generosity is an important part. Shirky also spoke about creating value -the examples he used were civic and communal value. I think we should mention it, but as a sub topic? I read the link on the resource list (&quot;Digital Maoism&quot; by Lanier) and he focused on the hive mind and the collective. Think we should mention these but again as a sub topic. However,  I think this resource will be very useful for putting together our presentation, since it discusses the use of Wikipedia in detail. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 21:08, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_pink_shirky/2/ found this interview with Shirky and another theorist, Pink, on the internet. Although it doesn't go into much detail I think it's useful in how it describes cognitive surplus in a way that's easy to understand. Pink also talks about humans having a &quot;third drive&quot; called &quot;intrinsic motivation&quot; which is quite interesting. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 20:27, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

I found this link quite helpful in understanding what the concept is as it gives it some context in a real world example. http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/06/clay-shirkys-cognitive-surplus-is-creating-and-sharing-always-a-more-moral-choice-than-consuming/ [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 11:13, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

I don't know if it would fit in anywhere with the page but an interesting statistic nonetheless: http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/cognitive-surplus-visualized/ [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 11:30, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Those links were really useful! Its always good to understand how the theory relates to real events. I thought maybe in our main concepts section we could talk about the disadvantages/criticisms of cognitive surplus? Not sure how much there would be to write on it, but I'm reading through Clay Shirky's book and he talks about how some people are skeptical because &quot;sharing at a scale that competes with older institutions is somehow wrong&quot;. He also mentions that people have accused shared software production as being communist. Not sure whether to include these or not because they're kind of subjective/ peoples opinions, and I think wikibooks is just meant to be facts. What do you think? [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 13:20, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

That first link you posted, Mark, is really interesting. I don't know if anyone else noticed but someone from the other group has posted at the very bottom of this discussion. I've got in touch with her, so hopefully we can begin to engage with the other group who are working on cognitive surplus as well. Will be interesting to see how similar/different our ideas are! [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 01:05, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

So from what we mentioned in the facebook group our main concepts could be: the hive mind, free digital labour, web 2.0, generosity, motive and value? And then if anyone thinks of anything else we can add it in :) [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 21:51, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Again, as discussed on Facebook I'll start work on motive this evening and will update as to how I'm getting on so other people can contribute and edit it. [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 16:55, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Sounds good. I'm currently working on the concept of the &quot;hive mind&quot; mentality, will post something later tonight. However it does look like it is closely linked with web 2.0, so they could potentially be amalgamated. Still have a bit of reading to do on the subject though. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 19:34, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Also, I am aware that I have not properly referenced my latest contribution. I have put surnames in brackets but will find out how to properly reference on Wikibooks. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 21:10, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm currently working my way through Motives and will formalise what I've got written tomorrow when I've finished reading it properly. Should have it posted in the book either tomorrow night or Wednesday. [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 21:35, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I was just having a look through the discussion and found the link that Mark posted really interesting.  Always find it much easier to understand when there is a real life example present.  Also, following on from what Katie was saying about the criticims of cognitive surplus, I found a Guardian article which includes some criticism of Shirky's work itself that might be worth researching.  Not sure if we're including any criticisms because it is more opinion than anything else but I thought it was worth posting anyway. http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/10/cognitive-surplus-connected-clay-shirky

[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 00:00, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, I've began working on the topic of generosity.  It kinds of ties in with other topics but I'll aim to get it sorted in the next couple of days. 
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 00:07, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

It's a good idea to include criticisms as well so that we're not biased. Great, Katie and I were just discussing how it would be good if we could all try and post some content by tomorrow so that we have time to edit and format it, and collaborate with the other group. I found the lecture very useful today as it went into more depth on the idea of collective intelligence so I'm going to edit that just now. In terms of referencing, as Greg said we can reference it as we see fit. I think we may aswell use APA because that's what we're used to using - does everyone agree? [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 12:30, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I can try and write a bit about criticisms tonight then, think everyone has topics now so its going spare. APA sounds good to me! I'll have to read up on how to use it again, all my modules use different referncing systems so its easy to get confused. It still uses footnotes doesn't it? I'm reading through that link Jen posted earlier with the interview with Pink and Shirky, thought it might be useful because it mentions another theorist, since a lot of what we've been reading so far has been Shirky's work. [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 13:19, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Try that app, ReferenceME. Basically scan the book and it does it for you, lifesaver! Just make sure it's set for APA and not Harvard! [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 14:50, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I am happy just to use APA as well. I think I have sorted out my 'not existing' problem, can anyone confirm that my user profile is actually there now? [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 17:39, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, does anyone have any thoughts on what Greg was saying about posting our Facebook onto here? We have done the majority of our chatting there after all so might be worthwhile. [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 17:51, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I tried that app Jen, really helpful! Think I might use that for all my essays in the future. As for the facebook chat, would we have to each individually copy and past what we said? Or can one person just copy the whole thing? I found the wikipedia page about referencing, and it seems quite straightforward! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#How_to_place_an_inline_citation_using_ref_tags I think I set up the reference list in the reference section properly, so references should automatically appear there when you cite things in your text. [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 19:35, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I think it's a good idea to put criticisms in, I can give a hand with it if you need any help.  And yeah I'm happy to use APA to reference the work.
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 20:41, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Just on the topic of referencing, if nobody has access to the app that Jen recommended I'd recommend you use citethisforme.com. Always helped me with essays! [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 21:03, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I've written up most of my stuff about motives now but am still wondering where exactly to put it in the book. It doesn't come under concepts or theorists so would it be a section on its own? Just wondering what you all thought. Jordan and I were thinking that because he is doing generosity and I am doing motive that we would sort of put both of those sections together seeing as they tie in quite well. They are both fairly sizeable sections as well so there should be a good bit of content there. [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 22:22, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Just thought I'd reiterate what Mark was saying.  After gathering my notes on generosity I realised how much it does tie in with motives and thought that it could follow motives in the wikibook.  Wondering what you's thought on the idea? 
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 22:31, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, I've pretty much got all of my notes in order for generosity so I will be able to upload that on the page tomorrow for edit.
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 22:33, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Since generosity and motive are chapters in Shirky's book, maybe they could go in the section for that? [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 11:53, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

So put it in the theorists bit? [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 13:16, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm doing a part of my generosity section on the Ted Talk he delivered in 2010.  I noticed on the page there is already a Ted Talk section.  However, I'm focusing on a different aspect than what has been written in the Wikibook which is directly related to motives.  Just wondering if you's think I should still keep it with the motives section or pair it with the Ted Talk section?
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 14:04, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I personally think that your generosity section should go in with Motive sub heading, just because they link in quite well. Don't know if anyone else thinks that there's a better place for them? [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 14:07, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

That's me posted my stuff on Motives ready to edit [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 14:21, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

At first I thought it would have been better for it to go with the motives sub heading since it's relatable, but I'm starting to think the TED Talk part of my generosity section should go with the TED Talk section.  I think it'd be neater for the wikibook if the book section is stuff specifically from the book and the TED Talk section from the talk.  What does everyone think? 
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 14:57, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've also got a section on generosity from the book so that could go in with the motives sub section.

Hi Mark, this link from wikibooks is very useful, I have used it for text formatting on my topic, &quot;Always-On&quot; culture, come over and check out my contributions to the page! If you need any other help just ask! https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Text_Formatting [[User:Thesmallerandrew|Thesmallerandrew]] ([[User talk:Thesmallerandrew|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thesmallerandrew|contribs]]) 21:40, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Andrew, thanks for your help. I'll be sure to stay in touch if I need any further assistance [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 21:59, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

The chapter seems to be coming together quite well! I'll hopefully be able to help fill in some of the definitions tomorrow as well. [[Special:Contributions/139.153.54.182|139.153.54.182]] ([[User talk:139.153.54.182|discuss]]) 22:06, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've been looking for criticisms of cognitive surplus but there doesn't seem to be much! I've mostly just found critical reviews of the book so far rather than the actual concept. Do you think there's any other section we could slot it into rather than making a whole section just for a sentence or two? [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 11:44, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

You could maybe just put it under the book section? [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 14:21, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

No worries Mark! I'm posting some more stuff up on &quot;Always-On&quot; culture which you are welcome to read! Any time man! [[User:Thesmallerandrew|Thesmallerandrew]] ([[User talk:Thesmallerandrew|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thesmallerandrew|contribs]]) 20:37, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Seeing as we have until 5 o clock tomorrow to finish this, does anyone have any last minute ideas? What does everyone think about the structure? I was thinking it might be better to have the main bulk of the content in the 'main concepts' section, and then just have brief summaries of each of the theorists work (a couple of lines) in the 'main theorists' section, what do you think? It might be a bit confusing to switch around now, so it just depends what everyone thinks is best. [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 22:25, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Personally I think it'd flow better as a book if the bulk of the content came under the main concepts section.  The way it is just now it might look to some as if there aren't many concepts. 
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 22:41, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree, a lot of the content in the main theorists section can be treated as main concepts seeing as there is so much information on them, especially the Shirky stuff, seeing as the whole cognitive surplus thing is kind of his idea. Also, when I referenced my value section, I ended up referencing the same pages over and over, do you think there is any way to link all of the references into one citation rather than having a list of about 6 nearly identical ones in the bibliography? [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 22:46, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Or should I make the first reference a footnote and then use in-text citations in brackets after that? [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 22:49, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I was going to suggest making one reference and writing pg173-175 for it but I see you've already sorted it.  I've finished my bit on generosity, do you want me to put it in the main concepts section or under Shirky?
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 23:58, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I was going to write up some of the generosity section from the TED Talk that Shirky delivered but someone from the other team has already written about that so I decided to leave it.  I still have a lot of content from the book though. 
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 00:00, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Sounds good Jordan! The page is really taking shape now. Will get some editing done before 5! [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 09:30, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Think I'm going to move the motives section into main concepts, what do you think? Feel free to move it back, I just think it links in quite well with the value section! [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 10:33, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

There's a line in the introduction about how we spend a trillion hours watching tv, does anyone have a reference for this? [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 10:50, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/cognitive-surplus-visualized/ that has the figure about the amount of tv, it is also in the book somewhere, not sure where though!

== THE GO TEAM ==
Hey guys, I notice that your group are also focusing on Cognitive Surplus. The rest of my group and I were wondering if we could discuss with you guys how both of our groups could contribute to the wikibook page to make it a joint effort as we don't want to overlap each other's information! It would be interesting to know what aspects your group are searching and therefore my group can maybe look at another aspect of cognitive surplus that you guys haven't. I found your discussion page through Wikibooks and its a good idea! Message me on my discussion page to let me know what you think...and apologies for messing up your group discussion page but I wanted to post somewhere you guys are most likely to see! [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]])

Hey guys, I have started to write about Shirky's book &quot;Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age&quot;, but I don't have a copy of it (I'm using the google books preview of it right now). The library says that it's currently on loan, but if any of you guys have a copy of it, could you add some info to that part? Thanks! [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:23, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey, I have also created a section on Main Theorists. At the moment, I have added some information on Shirky with subcategories for his book (as mentioned above) and his TED Talk, which I see you have discussed already. I have also created a section for Lanier and will write about some of his ideas on the topic. Are there other theorists we should mention? [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:30, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi! Sounds good. Basically nearly everyone in our team has taken a topic/chapter in the book to discuss, so we'll hopefully get some of that done tonight! Only other theorist I can think of is Gauntlett, but his work in this area isn't as important as Shirky and Lanier's. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 19:34, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

That's good that your group is tackling the book, we could focus more on the theorists then. There was some good information in today's lecture that we could write about too. Our team will be meeting in the seminar and we will discuss what else we will do, and let you guys know! [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 10:54, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

We've briefly mentioned Daniel Pink before, not read much of his work though so I don't know how relevant it will be! He probably can't be counted as a main theorist, but it might be something worth looking into for some of the main concepts. [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 13:22, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey, would it be possible to move the part 'Key Theorists' from the Key Concepts section to the 'Main Theorists' section? I don't know if it was written by someone from our group or yours, but this way things will be more consistent. The page is coming together nicely! [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:50, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

And looking at your discussion, we'll all use APA referencing? That sounds good to me, I'll make sure our group knows too! (and I'm sorry if it's like I'm spamming here, it just really helps to communicate with your guys!) [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:58, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Not spamming at all, if your group want to discuss the page on here with us that's fine! Makes things more consistent. Do you have a group discussion page? I completed the section on collective intelligence. I was thinking that too - the only thing is I feel that the descriptions both link to collective intelligence and it might be confusing if they're moved further down? [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 16:03, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yep, I just made a section on our group discussion page for you guys [[User_talk:FMS9A4-TheGoTeam]]. Maybe if it's made clear then (for example Key Theorists in Collective Intelligence) and then say that more information is located below in the Main Theorists section? I think that would work okay!

Hi! I notice someone has done referencing.. Yay! But how do you do it? [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 08:49, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi, Katie and I have started some of the referencing. I just removed the citation then clicked the &quot;reference&quot; button, it's on the toolbar beside font tools etc, a little book icon. Then I just typed in the full reference and that's it! Though if part of the reference is in italics you need to fix that before posting because it doesn't save the formatting. So just use the reference inside the the ref tags and highlight the bit you need and use the italics button - ctrl I doesn't work. Hope this helps! [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 12:16, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Thank you! Also, I'm going to start listing what words will need to go in the glossary, so if you come across any words that you think need to go in there can you post them to my group's discussion page, please? [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 12:54, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've put the information on de Kosnik and Terranova into categories about them, to keep it organised. Let me know if it should be changed/added to. I'm writing a short introduction to them as well. [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:32, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I also think we could move the part on Copyright up to the Main Concepts and then create a subcategory for Lessig. How does that sound?

Hey, just letting everyone know what I'm doing just now. Reading through the wikibook and double checking the spelling and grammar, and that the format is the same the whole way through it. Going to have a look and see if I can add anything into the generosity part of it about civic value because Greg says that's the part our group really missed out on.

Hi Lea. I noticed you said you had had discussions with your group- was that over wikibooks discussion, and if so would you be able to tell me how to do it? I think it would be a bit easier than the way we are doing it at the moment. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:34, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

RE: ButtonsElizabeth, your best bet is to either get them to post on the discussion page and mention your other team member’s names in it or potentially you could get them all to just leave notes on each other’s discussion pages. It is of course much easier to meet up with your members together if you are all uncertain of what needs to be done, or potentially you could make a Facebook group with all your members and allocate topics that way or even just share ideas, however, though these are considered to be more convenient, they will gain you no marks for input on the wiki book as Greg will not be able to take note of all of your ideas and the ways in which you have helped each other unless it is via either Wikipedia or the WikiBook. [[User:SmithBiancaAnn|SmithBiancaAnn]] ([[User talk:SmithBiancaAnn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SmithBiancaAnn|contribs]]) 22:55, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

BerinLea, in what I am considering talking about on the wikibook, I feel has direct link to some of your ideas that you also wish to talk about for instance, how one may use online mediums to define and redefine themselves and gather together their sense of self, this I feel would come under the development of identities which is something you seem keen to cover.

Thanks for the input. I have specified my topic a bit more and will mostly write about personalised adverts- so how companies target users by gathering their personal information from social media.

== Draft- to be proof-read ==

'''Social Networks and Advertising'''

The terms '''Social network advertising''' or '''Social media targeting''' refer to forms of online advertisement that specifically focus on their presence on social networking sites. Social network advertising involves adverts being tailored to user information gathered from social media profiles. Given the enormous audience size and amount of time regularly spent on social networking sites companies increasingly become aware of the vast potential lying in SNS. Consequently online advertising is experiencing a shift from simply being distributed through websites to efficiently tracking and gathering user behaviour and personal information on SNS. This enables brands to identify and address their target audience and people that their product might appeal to based on their interests. The fact that these information originate from the customers themselves is majorly beneficial to companies as personal data can be analysed in detail without having to rely on their own statistical projections. Two strategies used in social network advertising are '''targeted advertising''' and '''customised advertising'''.

In '''targeted advertising''' brands aim to shape their product display according to website relevant content or their target group’s interests. While content-targeted advertising is adapted to the particular purpose and content of a website the advert banner is displayed on, targeted advertising tracks the users’ surfing behaviour on the internet. Several websites require users to register with their facebook accounts in order to later display similar advertising content on the social network site. Through the use of cookies people can be tracked back to recently visited websites and are therefore likely to be exposed to similar content on other websites. Companies are also able to track whether one of their adverts has been encountered by a particular customer before and are consequently able to avoid unwanted repetition in exposures and display their contents within appropriate intervals (Braun, 2011, Measuring Online Advertising Effectiveness). A look-a-like function enables the detection of facebook users with similar interests as the one recently accessing a particular website. 

Moving away from simply tracking people’s surfing behaviour via cookies, online advertisement has experienced an important shift to putting more emphasis on using profile information on SNS to create '''customised advertisements''' (Spyer, http://www.theguardian.com/salesforce-partner-zone/taking-advantage-of-targeted-advertisements-on-social-media). Social network accounts provide brands with valuable information about users’ location, interests and social circles. Likes and links to external websites further enrich the image of potential customers that might be targeted in future. According to their profile details users receive pre-selected adverts that are believed to be most compatible with their demands and interests and therefore should be more appealing to them. 

However the massive amount of data genrated by “real identities“ via social networks (http://venturebeat.com/2011/03/15/reid-hoffman-data-sxsw/) is also centre of the growing debate on the implications of the web 3.0 (Reid Hoffman, http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2012/02/the-dark-side-to-personalised-internet.html). As Joseph Turow suggests “the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your world“ (Turow, J. (2012). The daily you: How the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your worth. Yale University Press.) through displaying user customised advertisements on social networks. In this way commodification, capitalist social relations and market forces increasingly engage in and detemine people’s social life by exploiting the fact that to a large extent social interactions are taking place online (Cohen, 2008, The Valorization of Surveillance: Towards a Political Economy of Facebook. Democratic Communique [online]. 22(1), [Accessed 3 March 2013], pp. 5-22. Available From: http://udc.igc.org/communique/issues/Spring2008/cohen.pdf). Consequently social networks have to be considered a double-edged sword (van Dijk, 2013, The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media. New York: Oxford University Press.). While on the one hand being intensely empowering for its users, the fact that their data is under constant surveillance by data mining and analytics companies such as Daily Me, Medicx Media and Rapleaf can also lead to consumers restisting (White et al., 2008) the advert’s appeal as they feel their privacy is being violated (Stone, 2010, http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/technology/04facebook.html?_r=0). Thereby, the root of the problem is the fact that boundaries between advertising and content shaping the 20th-century media are being blurred through networking sites (Turow). However, the significance of personalised advertising does not only make user data a valuable criteria to shape brands after but goes even further. Through “social sorting“ social networks even impact structures of society in allocating people to “target“ or “waste“ (Turow) groups based on information published on their profiles. Brands can explicitely filter out the users that are most valuable to them in terms of a responsiveness to their product based on their interests, income or other characteristics.  In this way the advertisement that is presented to each individual user is indicating their social position in the eyes of companies, making advertisement become status signals (Turow). Nevertheless, companies have to consider the discrepancy between online and offline identity as so far social sorting processes are simply based on personal information generated on SNS. Therefore customer profiles only limitedly reflect the “real“ person behind the profile, including their demands of a product. While social media’s functionality provide the tools for people to construct an online identity they are also heavily shaped after the economic purpose of the site. Cohen (2008, The Valorization of Surveillance: Towards a Political Economy of Facebook. Democratic Communique [online]. 22(1), [Accessed 3 March 2013], pp. 5-22. Available From: http://udc.igc.org/communique/issues/Spring2008/cohen.pdf) suggests that due to their design and the normalisation of the sharing culture SNS can be considered part of an increasing commodification of identity through the influence of corporate interests.

That sounds really good Lea! Really impressive academic writing! Something that relates to that subject is that different companies are collaborating with different bloggers. Like a fashion blog collaborates with an online shop with the shop giving them stuff to review. This way they get advertising space, too. Though that doesn't really relate to personalized ads, so maybe it's not relevant to your subject. Anyways, your piece looks really good and there's nothing I'd do differently!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi everyone! My name is Rachel Skinner, a natural redhead with a typical redhead fiery personality and a love of sarcasm. I'm a third year student, choosing to study abroad in Scotland for a semester. I'm a American-born girl, used to cold and blizzards and food on a stick and wanted a change! I'm pursuing a Communication Studies degree from an college in the middle of nowhere-Iowa with minors in Management and French. I spend my free time writing, watching too much Netflix and singing only slightly off-key at karaoke nights with friends. Drop me a note on my discussion page with any questions, comments, redhead comments, or general curiosities!</text>

On a separate note I am really impressed with the work your group has done on the Always On Culture page, it's looking great. [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

Not a problem LBLottie! And thanks for that! We are trying hard to slog through the content and editing but I'm thinking we'll have a great project to turn in on Friday! Your page isn't looking too bad either! I like the formatting so far!

Hey Rachel, I was just wondering, do you think our group should take a subject each and try and work on that or should we just contribute to which ever sub-heading we want? [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 13:34, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

== Group 4KR discussion for &quot;Always-On&quot; ==

Hey guys... do you want to use this area for group discussion involving the concepts we're coming up with? [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 18:40, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

This seems like a better place for discussions. At present I'm
trying to find some books which would be useful. The other group seem to have concentrated on a lot of the material on the lecture slides and resource list so we will have to go digging for our own. Does anyone have any useful books just now? I've found a few I want from
the library but none of them are online resources so I will have to wait till tomorrow.

[[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 18:45, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Good idea. I'll have a look for some books to get tomorrow as well. I think we should just try and find any other ideas instead of being assigned a topic each. Do you guys agree? That way, there could be something one of us finds that the others didn't. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:48, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I agree with that. It also means we'll probably be able to
come up with a lot more stuff. If we come up with our own concepts first then we will have the chance to look and see if there's anything we can add or change to the work that the other group has done. 

[[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 18:55, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm down with what we're talking about here. This way, the book will seem more cohesive instead of a mere collection of random ideas. In our library meeting tomorrow, we can start a discussion about the direction of our page along with the potential topics we've come up with so far. I'm looking into some online databases for articles and relevant blogs to augment our research. I feel that this will help us dive into some topics that the other group hasn't talked about yet, or could provide some good additional information for their existing subtopics! [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 21:12, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys really sorry but been ill last few so not going to be at University today to meet up, however I think doing more research to try and find more topics for discussion is a good idea. I will look up some articles and books for research at home. Hopefully you guys are alright with filling me in about what happens at the meeting on this discussion page later. ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 09:06, 1 April 2014 (UTC))

Sorry to hear that you are unwell. I'll take some notes at our meeting so I can tell you the most important things we went over. Hope everyone is still ok for the meeting - see you at 2!

Katrina and I have thought about introducing privacy as a major subheading. The other group touched on it a bit but there's a difference between online dis-inhibition privacy and always-on privacy. [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 13:30, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Feel free to contribute any major points involving privacy in always on culture. I think we should add this heading tonight and try and have a draft of the information finished tonight. 

[[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 13:35, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, another topic I think we could do is separating out always-on culture in relation to the younger generations and workplace. I think there are differences that we could touch on there. I know, for me, I didn't think about adults having this problem before this class. However, now that I think about it, their work day doesn't end at 5pm. They might miss a morning meeting announcement that came out via email at 10pm. They need to multitask. I think there are all points we could talk about. What do you guys think? Anything else to add or change? [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 13:43, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I think we should include a section related to the negative and positive aspects of being 'always on' --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 14:32, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

These are all great ideas, and something that the other groups have not yet covered. I will continue looking for more information and let you know if I come up with another idea for a paragraph. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:03, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys you all seem to be coming up with really good ideas. Not sure what else there is to talk about but i'll do some more reading and try to come up with something that hasn't been mentioned. ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 18:30, 1 April 2014 (UTC))

Rachel if your looking for information on the effect of Always On Culture on adults within the workplace I found a article that discusses it and links to a few different studies about the '72 hour week' being created by always on culture. Its not necessarily as good as a book or journal but may be useful seeing as its discussing the topic your looking at, http://zocalogroup.com/2014/rethinking-always-culture/ ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 18:54, 1 April 2014 (UTC)) 

I've also found some journals about the implications on businesses of an always online culture thinking of adding a paragraph on that to the page as it hasn't been looked at yet. What do you guys think ? ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 18:58, 1 April 2014 (UTC))

That sounds good actually. I think anything that the other group haven't covered will be useful at this point! 
[[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 20:20, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I added a little bit to the main book there under disadvantages. Thought I'd just post it there and get it out of the way! I'm concentrating on privacy now but I'm not sure where to put it. Do you think I should just put it under disadvantages too? Also do you think I could bring in a bit about Paris Brown with the privacy settings? I know it was in the lecture so I'm not sure if it would be a good or bad thing to include it?

='''Always-On Draft'''=

==Introduction==

Here we could draft a revised introduction that better introduces Always-On as a general topic rather than an essay-like introduction. [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 14:17, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

==Always-On Privacy==

Katrina has got a start on this and is looking to finish a paragraph to post by tonight.

==The shrinking generational gap==


===The connected young===
One of the most obvious victims of an &quot;Always On&quot; culture are the younger generations, always on their phones or with multiple social profiles online that need constant attention. Ten years ago, a twelve-year-old would never have a mobile phone let alone be on social media sites like Facebook or have a profile on YouTube. Now, twelve-year-olds now have the latest mobile phone and can likely work it better than their parents. Unplugging a young adult evokes feelings similar to an addict going through withdrawal and depression (Telegraph, 2011). Unplugging oneself is not as easy as turning off a phone. Teens have so many technological outlets like personal and school computers, MP3 players, television, eReaders, etc. 





The Connected Young

One of the most obvious and commonly thought of victims of an 'always-on' culture are the younger generations, always on their phone or with multiple social media profiles online that need constant attention. This links back to the idea of their Online Identity Young people today are so constantly connected that if they happen to not post a picture or a status for more than two days, there is genuine concern between their friends about their safety and well being (Vimeo, 2014). Ten years ago, a twelve-year-old would never have had a mobile phone, let alone using several social media platforms such as Facebook or YouTube. Now, twelve-year-olds have the latest mobile phone and can likely work it better than their parents. Unplugging oneself is not as easy as turning off a phone. Teens have so many technological outlets and &quot;are growing up in a world that offers them instant access nearly everywhere to nearly the entirety of human knowledge.&quot; (Imagining the Internet, 2012) Thus, is it understandable, and frankly, unavoidable, that young people are a major part of the growing 'always-on' culture.

====[http://withoutmedia.wordpress.com/ Uplugged: The study]====
A 2010 study had 200 University of Maryland (USA) students go without all forms of media, including non-techonogical media, for 24 hours. After 24 hours, students logged onto class blogs and reported their successes, or, in many cases, failures. The results of the study were definitive: mobile technology not only changed students' relationships with the news and access to information but also had a profound impact on their relationships to their friends and family. The study concludes that constant connection to media has caused students to make different social and moral decisions with their 24 hours than if they had spent the day surrounded by their average collection of media outlets (withoutmedia, 2010). 

Severing the students' tether to technology created feelings similar to those of an addict going through depression and separation anxiety. Some students claimed that they had feelings similar to &quot;[http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/87/1/107.long phantom limb pain]&quot; experienced often by disabled war veterans. Students found themselves twitching towards their iPods or feeling their back pockets for their phone before realizing they were doing it. 

A question remains- do those in an &quot;Always On&quot; culture live a richer life or those who remain disconnected? A few voices from the study say that &quot;I believe that those who are not tied to this system are missing something... they are missing information.” (withoutmedia, 2010). Information itself is a commodity that people collect, trade, and put value in. Those who have a constant connection to media possess more information than others and therefore become &quot;richer&quot;. Without certain information or internet access, the world becomes much smaller. It could take several weeks to learn about the [http://edition.cnn.com/2014/04/01/world/americas/chile-earthquake/ 8.2 magnitude earthquake that struck Chile] April 2nd, 2014. Then again, how would that information even get to the end user? Internet is out, as is television and newspapers. Face-to-face would remain the most reliable transfer of information but the earthquake news would be dated and limited those who physically heard it from the source. One student commented that, “Those who aren’t connected through media probably have no idea about certain things going on in the world,” (withoutmedia, 2010).

{{quote|text=I find it difficult to fathom someone not being connected through media, because I know no other way...|sign=[http://withoutmedia.wordpress.com/study-conclusions/ Student Participant]}}

.nk this part could link nicely to the idea of online identity, I plan to include a brief connection to it in this paragraph. e.g The idea that teens are always on twitter/instagram updating it to make sure that they look good for their followers. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:27, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I've found an interesting documentary about that is relevant to this chapter. I'm going to write it up and hopefully post it tonight, and if not then, tomorrow morning.

===Change in the workforce===

The thought of always being connected or &quot;tethered&quot; to technology is no longer an idea unique to younger generations. Exceedingly, adults are finiding themselves tied to their mobiles, desks, emails, and other forms of connection that can't be escaped at home. 




I was going to write a paragraph or so about this, and take out the bit about teenagers I wrote about in another section and put it there. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:00, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Actually, it makes more sense to write about teenagers in the one about youth. Sorry about that! [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:01, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Good idea! Let's get a start on that. I definitely have a few ideas forming! Mostly problems I've run into with working among so many collaborators on a single page. Navigating multiple users could be a point we go in to? [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 12:17, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Do you think we should make some sort of PowerPoint? And we can all add individual slides? I'm not sure if we have the facilities to use one in class but we could always ask Greg? I'm quite glad we're the second week so we can get an idea of what it's gonna be like from the people doing the first presentation!

Yeah I think we'd be better to meet in person! The only day I can really meet is Tuesday though. [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 15:08, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Tuesday after lecture? We just walk to the Dining/Study Centre in Pathfoot after lecture and talk? [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 15:22, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Tuesday is fine with me, but can we make it later in the day cause I have a seminar straight after the lecture ? We could do it after the seminar and just head to the library from class if your ok with staying at the university later ?

I'm free from 11 till 4. I don't mind staying after class but if we all have a free hour at least before the seminar I think I'd rather do it then cause I'll be sitting about for 5 hours anyway :) [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 09:35, 5 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

:This template is used with {{Tl|ORP-bot}} to set off Trainz reference oriented and organized Wiki pages about intermediate, or advanced topics, categorized in ''[[:category:Trainz references|Trainz reference classed topics]]'' on the Wiki.

* It will not auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz references]], you must use {{Tl|ORP-bot}} to do that and more importantly acknowledge CC-by-SA-2.5 licensing for materials quoting the N3V wiki. That template may be modified on this wiki to do page to page navigation in the future as well.

=== Foreign Key ===
:[[../Foreign_Key|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Reference to a different (or the same) table. This creates 1:m or n:m relationships.

--      ON DELETE / ON UPDATE / DEFFERABLE
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- DELETE and UPDATE behaviour for child tables (see first example)
  -- Oracle: Only DELETE [CASCADE | SET NULL] is possible. Default is NO ACTION, but this cannot be
  --         specified explicit - just omit the phrase.

== Alter Table (ToDo) ==

:[[../Alter_Table|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
ALTER TABLE t1 ...

&lt;/source&gt;

== Drop Table ==
:[[../Drop_Table|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- All data and complete table structure inclusive indices and views are thrown away.
-- No column name. No WHERE clause. No trigger is fired. Considers Foreign Keys. Very fast.
DROP TABLE t1;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Select ==
=== Basic Syntax ===
:[[../SELECT:_Fundamentals|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Overall structure: SELECT / FROM / WHERE / GROUP BY / HAVING / ORDER BY

--     constants, column values, operators,     functions 
SELECT 'ID: ',    id,            col_1 + col_2, sqrt(col_2)
FROM   t1
-- precedence within WHERE: functions, comparisions, NOT, AND, OR
WHERE  col_1 &gt; 100
AND    NOT MOD(col_2, 10) = 0
OR     col_3 &lt; col_1
ORDER BY col_4 DESC, col_5  -- sort ascending (the default) or descending
;

-- number of rows, number of not-null-values
SELECT COUNT(*),   COUNT(col_1) FROM t1;

-- predefined functions
SELECT COUNT(col_1), MAX(col_1), MIN(col_1), AVG(col_1), SUM(col_1) FROM t1;

-- UNIQUE values only
SELECT DISTINCT col_1 FROM t1;

-- In the next example col_1 many have duplicates. Only the combination of col_1 plus col_2 is unique. 
SELECT DISTINCT col_1, col_2 FROM t1;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Case ===
:[[../SELECT:_Case_Expression|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- CASE expression with conditions on exactly ONE column
SELECT id,
       CASE contact_type   -- ONE column name
         WHEN 'fixed line' THEN 'Phone'
         WHEN 'mobile'     THEN 'Phone'
         ELSE                   'Not a telephone number'
       END,
       contact_value
FROM   contact;

-- CASE expression with conditions on ANY column
SELECT id,
       CASE   -- NO column name
         WHEN contact_type IN ('fixed line', 'mobile')  THEN 'Phone'
         WHEN id = 4                                    THEN 'ICQ'

:This template is used with {{Tl|TRSref-top}} instead of {{Tl|ORP-top}} to set off Wiki reference pages, ''and especially those'' that are NOT based the N3V TrainzOnline Wiki which need NO attribution to the {{plain link|https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/us/|CC-BY-SA 2.0 License}}. Use this one on lists, archived dated pages or those using examples of or adapted from the portions of freeware (Public Domain) assets.

* Lastly, this template closes a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot; ...&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; HTML block initiated by {{Tl|TRSref-top}}. They should be used together as a pair top and bottom of each page.

* It will also auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz references]].

* It can be given the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; default parameter to alter the sort order of the reference page as listed in that category.

'''Kinds''' is a keyword denoting one of a set of enumerated basic data aggragate classes in the Trainz Asset definitions hierarchy, and is arguably tied with the {{TR|S|Category-class|p=category-class tag}}, {{TR|R|TrainzBaseSpec}} and {{TR|R|config.txt}} files as the most important data elements to get a handle on for either fixing or creating assets. Trainz Kinds are upper level {{TL|containers}} defining minimal data structures for characterizing a asset type under a single identifying kuid.

{{Trainz-stub-section}}

==Heirarchy and level==
* {{TA|config.txt files}}
:* {{TR|TrainzBaseSpec}}
::* {{TR|s|category-class|p=category-class tags}}
::* '''KINDs''' ''declaration''
'''KINDs''' in the Trainz simulators define the attribute that together with category-class set up required fields of information to make the model of an asset render properly. In a very real sense, the KIND data structure (grouping related data of disparate type relevant to the needs of model rendering and run-time simulation) is a first level {{TG|C|container}} in Trainz (albeit with a special name, &quot;KIND&quot;), and will almost always require other container level data groups accompany it in the ini files. 

Now all container and container-like structures occupy the config.txt file, but the distinction is simply that container defined types usually have scope in several different KIND defined assets, whereas each KIND is unique to that class of asset. KIND Engines and KIND Traincar both have bogeys (wheels on trucks) so both have a bogeys container in their ini file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">From http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html

Certain units that are not part of the SI are essential and used so widely that they are accepted by the CIPM, and thus by this Guide, for use with the SI [2, 3]. These units are given in Table 6. The combination of units of this table with SI units to form derived units should be restricted to special cases in order not to lose the advantages of the coherence of SI units. (The use of SI prefixes with the units of Table 6 is discussed in Sec. 6.2.8)

Additionally, this Guide recognizes that situations on occasion will require the use of time-related units other than those given in Table 6; such as using intervals of time be expressed in weeks, months, or years. In such cases, if a standardized symbol for the unit is not available, the name of the unit should be written out in full. (See Sec. 8.1 for a suggestion regarding the symbol for year and Chapter 9 for the rules and style conventions for spelling unit names.)

... And from http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec08.html#8.1

The SI unit of time (actually time interval) is the second (s) and should be used in all technical calculations. When time relates to calendar cycles, the minute (min), hour (h), and day (d) might be necessary. For example, the kilometer per hour (km/h) is the usual unit for expressing vehicular speeds. Although there is no universally accepted symbol for the year, Ref. [4: ISO 80000-3] suggests the symbol a.

&lt;div style={{TRS-style|was=&quot;background:#aadadf; border: 2px solid blue;&quot;}}&gt;
;usage
This template forms an internal link to '''''the [[Trainz references/Containers]] Trainz Books Volume/Chapter and links to a Subpage of '''Containers''' (with parameter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; i.e. 1= sub-sub-page = Containers) which displays the link by that value (omitting the volume name).
{{TextBox|1=
: IN ALL Cases, including the below (p=''pretty-name'') forms a over-riding'' 'pretty name' ''for display'' of the desired link-to-page of the '[[Trainz references]] volume' ''of the [[Trainz]] Wikibook projects.}}

* The template also incorporates options to access a '''Chapter sub-page''' at the next level down heirarchically speaking&amp;mdash; (Sections in Wikibookian, technically a ''sub-sub-page'') given the optional '''''2nd parameter (2= or &lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;)'''''
 
*  and even a 3rd link forming parameter: &lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; (or 'Sections' sub-sub-sub-pages)&lt;/code&gt; 
{{TrainzTip|1=
* Each last level specified will be the resultant short display name of the link, unless the optional pretty-link re-title parameter &lt;code&gt;'p=' is defined which will then display whatever link is formed.
* The '''4=''section-title''''' option MUST NOT include multi-word titles, so replace SPACES with UNDERSCORES (they both display the same, look at wikimedia urls) to form a section link to the page.
}}
{{Trainz-stub|This is a quick and dirty adaptation of the TR template to access third level down pages.
* It assumes the page is in [[Trainz references/Containers|Trainz references/Containers/&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] in wikimarkup. Otherwise it operates the same general manner as other Trainz link templates. 
* This classed as stub '''until usage is fixed''', but THAT is awaiting overall planning of page placements.
}}
{{void|
==default behaviors==
This allows:
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz references/{{{1}}}{{{{4|}}}               |{{{p|{{{4|{{{1}}}}}}}}} ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 'Chapter' links and/or 
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz references/{{{1}}}/{{{2}}}{{{4|}}}        |{{{p|{{{4|{{{2}}}}}}}}} ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 'sub-sub-page' (Section) links and/or 
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz references/{{{1}}}/{{{2}}}/{{{3}}}{{{4|}}}|{{{p|{{{4|{{{3}}}}}}}}} ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 'sub-sub-sub-page' (Sub-Section) formatted link calls 
... all forming the link and all links in the wikimarkup with the last parameter ('''the actual page title''') as the ''''''DEFAULT display name'''''' (can be overridden by &quot;|p=''some other name''&quot;
&lt;hr&gt;
* Users unfamiliar with wiki-markup parameter parsing, just focus on the last parameter given numerically overriding the text of the whole lengthy link, 
* and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{4}}}  or '|4=Page-section-title' making a 'section-link' &lt;/nowiki&gt; ''generally'' giving a pretty name if and when a short name is desired, such is within a nav template.
&lt;!-- --&gt;
:* NOTE: The parserFunction logic for linking a page section is not exactly as shown above (or the section's title display format would suck), but the simplified code 'guts' is complicated enough without burdening non-coders with the details. (The idea that the template will link sections of pages as well as sub-sub-sub-pages is enough to use it well!)
&amp;nbsp;
'''&lt;u&gt;Example-1, expanded paste down&lt;/u&gt;:'''
:This is because all template default parameters, formally 'numbered parameters' can also be specified like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TR|1=containers
 |2=Thumbnails_container
 |3=Thumbs
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 which wiki-markup language is processed exactly
 the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TR |Thumbnails_container |Thumbs }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
;caution
When using a template such as this which forms a link, it is best to NOT use spaces between the pipe characters &quot;|&quot; as done for clarity above.
{{TrainzTip|Spaces in the 'pretty-text' part are fine in '''TR''' as they are in the related {{tl|TL}} but they will bite you in other link forming typing aids such as {{tl|TG}}, {{tl|TOL}}, {{tl|N3V}} and {{tl|Wp}}! &lt;hr&gt; However,{{indent|7}}When and if there are two or more words in the first parameter term, use underscores to connect into one word sans {{wp|whitespace}} characters.
}}
'''&lt;u&gt;In-line Examples&lt;/u&gt;:'''
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TR|Thumbnails container}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; links as: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz references/Thumbnails container|Thumbnails container]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the other formulation: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Thumbnails container|Thumbnails container]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; both would.
:But... is much easier to edit around on a page when trying to get the best prose presentation.

* Similarly: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TR|Thumbnails container|Thumbnails image handling}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; links as if the constructs: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz references/Thumbnails container|Thumbnails image handling]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Thumbnails container|Thumbnails image handling]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is perhaps part of the phrase you want.

* Sub-subpage links will mainly be needed in the forthcoming Errorfixing series of tutorials and the Programmed Instruction (Trainz A-Z) linked progressive tutorials off their own sub-TOC base page. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:Plan on use of Sub-sub-pages for each task need... '''even given splitting the book down the multiple tracks''' (General operations, Content alteration and fixing, content creation, driving, Surveyor-how-to and trying to keep things straight which page goes where... we're going to make ''a lot of new pages'' in the Trainz_PI tutorials! Whether for beginners or intermediate Trainzers, they'll all end in content creation and other advanced topics like TransDEM map generation anyway.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[w:Colon|The Colon]]''' is the last part of the digestive system in most vertebrates. It extracts water and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the site in which flora-aided (large bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material occurs. Unlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a major role in absorption of foods and nutrients. However, the colon does absorb water, sodium and some fat soluble vitamins. In mammals, the colon consists of four sections: the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon (the proximal colon usually refers to the ascending colon and transverse colon). The cecum, colon, rectum and anal canal make up the large intestine
== What do they do? ==
Also with our [[Wikijunior:Human Body/Digestive System/Kidneys|Kidneys]] and other main body parts that help us with our food, our colon helps us to digest food. Here is a copy of the step by step digestive system to our bodies:
&lt;center&gt; 
# Food begins in the mouth where it is chewed by the teeth into smaller pieces. The salivary glands release juices to help, and the tongue and saliva turn the food into even smaller pieces that will fit into the fit into the esophagus. The esophagus is a 10-inch-long tube that connects to the stomach. Muscles in the esophagus move food into the stomach.

2. In the stomach, gastric juices—protein substances called enzymes— break down the food into smaller bits. The stomach has powerful muscles that churn up the food until it’s a creamy liquid. This material moves into the small bowel

3. In the small bowel, the food particles get even smaller. More juices
from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix together in the small
bowel. Here is where all the important vitamins and nutrients in food
moves through the blood vessels that are in the lining of the small
bowel. The blood takes the nutrients to other organs in the body.
The nutrients are used to help repair cells and tissue.

4. What is left over, which is mostly liquid, then moves into the colon.
The water is absorbed in the colon. Bacteria in the colon break
down the remaining material. Then the colon moves the leftover
material into the rectum.

5. The rectum is like a storage- holder for this waste. Muscles in the
rectum move the waste, called stool, out of the body through the anus.
&lt;/center&gt;
=== A good summary of number 4 ===
On number 4, this is where the colon comes in. What is left after number 3 goes down to the colon and then the liquid is absorbed into the colon. Which then, good Bavteria in the colon break down the remaining materials, could be a few solids in there. Then, the colon moves the leftovers down to the rectum. Then, it leads to your anus, where you shit it out.
== Where are they? ==
The colon is located in the lower abdomen where it connects to the ileum
== How can we protect them? ==
Healthy eating is good for your overall health, but having a low-calorie,
high-fiber diet that includes many fruits and vegetables is important to a
healthy colon. A healthy colon will rid your body of the leftovers it no longer
needs. Your stool is filled with bacteria, so it is important to pass this out of
your body. If your colon isn’t working the way it should, you will experience
problems such as bloating, gas and pain.

&lt;div style={{TRS-style|font-face:Verdana, Garamond,Times,Serif,Arial; font-size: 9pt|border:2px solid blue}}&gt;
 
;Purpose
:This template is used with {{Tl|AM&amp;C-top}} to set off Asset Maintenance &amp; Creation division of the Trainz Wikibook pages.

* Lastly, this template closes a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot; ...&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; HTML block initiated by {{Tl|ORP-top}}. They should be used together as a pair top and bottom of each page.

* It will also auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz AM&amp;C]].
;global pipe-sort optional parameter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* The tool can be given the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; default numeric/place parameter to alter the default sort order of the page as listed in that and the optional categories following below.
:* This is by-definition the first occurring parameter after a pipe but without a preceding '=' equals sign name assignment.
:* This is the same as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|1=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''value''&lt;/code&gt; as is always true in Wiki-markup language. For example &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{AM&amp;C-bot|1=Serial}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is like to &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{AM&amp;C|Safety}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to wiki-markup, but the first 'Se&quot; will sort after the 'Sa' in category lists.

==Options==
# Defining &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{IT|}}} or {{{intro-ref}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Will the add the page to auto-Category: [[:category:Introductory Trainz|Introductory Trainz]] for pages when that classification is desirable.&lt;!-- 
---&gt;{{bullR
}}  It can be then given the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{TIP}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to alter the sort order of the page as it would be listed in that category. This will allow threaded pages to be grouped, if desired. TIP overrides (has precedence over) pipe-sort parameter  &lt;!-- 
---&gt;
# When and if given a defined {{{FUN}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; parameter, this tool will also categorize the page to [[:Category:Trainz fundamentals pages]]. This mode will be used in many Introductory Trainz pages, but both TI and FUN need be specified independently.
# Defining &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{Ref}}} or {{{intro-ref}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;  - Will the add the page to auto-Category: [[:category:Trainz references]] for pages which can also be classified as a general reference page.&lt;!-- 
---&gt;
# Defining &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{domsg|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Will ''''''do'''''' the same output CC-by-SA-2.0 message box as the [[:template:ORP-bot]] footer for pages when that source crediting message is needed. Since a page may be a reference but not share materials with the N3V wiki, it does not auto-assert with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{Ref}}} or {{{intro-ref}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; sensing.&lt;!-- 
---&gt;
# define '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; '| cat1=', '| cat2=', or '|cat3='&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/code&gt;''' &lt;nowiki&gt;({{{cat1|}}})&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{cat3|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;) ''''''some-cat-names'''''' to add those categories to the page (without either &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;Category:&quot; namespace, nor '[[' or ']]' allowed&lt;/nowiki&gt;).&lt;!-- 
---&gt;{{bullR
}}   (they're provided free of charge along with the default 'pipe sorting' to the [[mw:Help:Magic words|Magic word]] &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; page ordering, unless &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is defined to override.)&lt;!--

      <comment>Some basic operations with brain-view2</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">brain-view is a tool for visualising statistics on [http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/Services/HowToWorkWithObjectFiles MINC object files]. 

== Viewing an object file ==

    $ brain-view2 aug30_H149_gray_surface_left_81920.obj

[[File:Brain-view2 - Displaying a surface mesh.png|500px|The brain-view2 interface when a surface mesh has been loaded.]]

== Overlaying data ==

CSV data can be overlayed onto the vertices of the object mesh. The file must have one row per vertex and have the same order as vertices in the object. 

    $ brain-view2 aug30_H149_gray_surface_left_81920.obj  aug30_H149_native_rms_tlink_20mm_left.txt

[[File:Brain-view2 - Displaying cortical thickness data overlayed on a surface mesh.png|500px|The brain-view2 interface displaying cortical thickness data overlayed on a surface mesh]]


Clicking any point on the surface will bring the index of the vertex in the object file, and the value of the overlayed data in the Resources pane.

      <text xml:space="preserve">THERE is no work in the English language 
dealing with the Reptiles of Europe. I have 
therefore endeavoured to supply this desideratum, so 
far as the Snakes are concerned, by drawing up in a 
concise form an account of what is known of their 
characters, their distribution, and their life-histories. 
Professor Sordelli, of Milan, having kindly acceded 
to my request to reproduce some of the beautiful 
figures drawn by him for the work published in 
collaboration with the late Professor Jan under the 
title of &quot;Iconographie Generale des Ophidiens&quot;. I have 
been able to supplement my descriptions with illus- 
trations which leave nothing to be desired from the 
point of view of accuracy. A few drawings have 
been made specially for this book by Mr. J. Green. 
I have further to acknowledge the permission given 
by the Trustees of the British Museum, the India 
Office, and the Zoological Society, to reproduce a few 
figures from previous publications of which I am the 
author. 

In order to render this little book more useful, the 
account of the Snakes of Europe has been preceded
by an Introduction summarizing what is known of 
Snakes generally. 

I have purposely avoided overburdening a work of 
this kind, which aims at concision, with bibliographical
references and synonymic lists. I am sure my 
readers will be thankful for being spared this display 
of erudition. Whenever I have had to compile, and 
to trespass on ground that is not my own, I have 
been careful to draw only from the writings of the 
most trustworthy authorities. The descriptions of 
the species are based on the collection in the British 
Museum, which has been considerably increased 
since the publication of the Catalogue of Snakes 
(1893-1896). I have also had access to Monsieur F. 
Lataste's rich private collection, now under my care, 
and Dr. R. Gestro has kindly entrusted to me for 
study the collection of Italian Snakes in the Genoa 
Museum. I am indebted to Dr. L. W. Sambon for 
the chapter on Parasites, which he has written at 
my request. 

To all who have helped me I beg to tender my 

hearty thanks. 

G.A. Boulenger

      <text xml:space="preserve">SNAKES, are scientifically defined as the suborder Serpentes under the order Squamata and are in the family Reptiliae, the reptiles, which includes the Lizards, Lacertilia, the Chameleons, 
Rhiptoglossa, and the extinct Dolichosauria and 
Mosasauria. Snakes may be defined as greatly elongate 
scaly Reptiles without limbs, or with mere vestiges 
of the hind pair, without movable eyelids, without 
ear-opening, with elongate, deeply forked tongue 
retractile into a basal sheath, with transverse vent 
and paired copulatory organs, and with the two 
halves of the lower jaw independently movable, 
connected at the symphysis by an elastic ligament. 

The latter character alone distinguishes them 
from all Lizards, but no single Lizard possesses all 
the others in combination. 

In their most highly developed form these Reptiles 
are adapted for rapid reptation and for swallowing prey much exceeding their own calibre; hence the 
bones of the skull, on which a prehensile function 
devolves, are loosely attached to the cranium by 
ligamentous elastic tissue, or articulated in such a 
manner as to permit a wide buccal expansion; whilst 
the absence of a sternum and the mobile attach- 
ment of the ribs allow a corresponding dilatation of 
the body as the prey descends into the digestive canal. 

The fatal venom which certain of these Reptiles 
possess has so impressed the mind of men, that for a long time snakes were primarily 
divided into poisonous and non-poisonous, a classi- 
fication in which the more important characters, 
derived from the general structure, and especially 
from the skull, were subordinated to the physio- 
logical. Such a system was far from reflecting 
natural relationships. Besides, as our knowledge 
progressed, drawing a distinction between poisonous 
and harmless snakes became more and more diffi- 
cult, so many snakes previously regarded as harmless 
proving to be poisonous in various degrees- at least 
enough to paralyze the small prey on which they 
subsist, if not to be of serious danger to man. 

In the division into families, as followed in this 
work, the presence or absence of a poison organ is 
left out of consideration. Further, in this as in 
many other groups of the animal kingdom, external 
characters do not furnish trustworthy indications 
for higher divisions, and the definitions of the 
families are therefore based exclusively on osteo- 
logical characters. For those who wish to name 
snakes with facility, the key which concludes the 
chapter on External Characters will, however, remedy 
this defect, and suffice for the identification of all 
the European species without any reference to their 
anatomy. Many attempts have been made to 
furnish an easy criterion for the distinction of harm- 
less from poisonous snakes, but the characters 
hitherto suggested with this object can only be ap- 
plied successfully to the small number of representa- 
tives in a limited area. Thus, in Southern Australia 
it might be stated that all snakes showing the regular 
nine large shields on the upper surface of the head 
are dangerous to man, whilst those with small 
shields or scales are harmless ; but in most parts of 
Europe this criterion would have to be reversed. In 
some countries the shape of the pupil might be used 
for the purpose, in others the size of the ventral 
shields, or the presence or absence of a loreal shield, 
between the nasal and the preocular, and so on. 
But when we have to deal with the snakes of the 
whole world, about 2,000 species, of which nearly 
one-third are poisonous to a greater or less degree, 
every attempt at a definition of the two categories 
without regard to the dentition breaks down. Only 
those who have made a study of the snakes of the 
world can make a guess from the general appearance 
as to an unknown form being poisonous or not, and 
even they may sometimes feel embarrassed, unless 
the dentition be examined; the mistakes which 
have occasionally been made by some experienced 
herpetologists are proof sufficient of the fallacy of 
external characters for this purpose. 

The Ophidia are divided into nine families, the 
first, third, seventh, and ninth of which have repre- 
sentatives in Europe : 

I. No transverse (ectopterygoid) bone ; pterygoid 
not extending to quadrate or mandible ; no supra- 
temporal ; nasals in contact with prefrontals ; 
coronoid present ; vestiges of pelvis. 

Maxillary loosely attached to lower surface of 
cranium, toothed; lower jaw edentulous; a single 
pelvic bone i. Typhlopid^. 

Maxillary bordering mouth, forming a suture with 
premaxillary, prefrontal, and frontal, toothless ; 
pubis and ischium present, latter forming a sym- 
physis 2. Glauconiid^e. 

II. Transverse bone present ; both jaws toothed. 

A . Coronoid present ; nasals in contact with pre- 
frontals, 
i. Vestiges of pelvis ; supratemporal present. 
Supratemporal large, suspending quadrate 

3. BoiDiE. 

(Subfamilies : Pythonincz, Boince.) 
Supratemporal small, intercalated in the cranial wall 

4. Ilysiidjs. 


2. No vestiges of pelvis ; supratemporal absent 

5. Uropeltid,e. 

B. Coronoid absent ; supratemporal present. 

1. Maxillary horizontal ; pterygoids reaching 

quadrate or mandible. 

Nasals in contact with prefrontals 

6. Xenopeltid.e. 
N asals not in contact with prefrontals 

7. COLUBRID.E. 

Three series: A. Aglypha (subfamilies: Acrochor- 
dince, Colubrince, Dasypeltince) ; B. Opisthoglypha 
(Homalopsincz, Dipsadomorphincz, Elachistodontince) ; 

C. Proteroglypha {Hydrophiince, Elapincz). 

2. Maxillary horizontal, converging posteriorly 

towards palatine ; pterygoid not reaching 
quadrate or mandible 8. Amblycephalid.e. 

3. Maxillary vertically erectile perpendicularly to 

transverse bone; pterygoid reaching quad- 
rate or mandible 9. Viperid^e. 

(Subfamilies : Viperince, Crotalince.) 

The technical terms employed in the above 
synopsis will be found explained and illustrated by 
figures in the chapter on the Skeleton. 

No serial arrangement can express the affinities 
of the various groups as conceived by the classifi
cator; a diagram therefore follows to show the 
author's views as to their interrelationships, and 
possibly their phylogeny. Leaving aside the 
Typhlopidae and Glauconiidae, which should be regarded as burrowing types independently derived 
from some Ophidian form less specialized than any 
with which we are at present acquainted, and prob- 
ably without direct relationship to the Lizards, the 
family Boidae, and more especially the Pythons, 
claim the position of ancestral group, from which 
all other snakes may have been derived.

Colubridae opisthoglyphae Colubridae proteroglyphae

Further remarks on this subject in the chapter 
on Dentition. 

It is to be regretted that paleontology cannot 
help us at present as concerns the lines of evolution, 
the comparatively few fossil Ophidians known, from 
the Lower Eocene upwards, the remains of which 
can be identified with some measure of certainty, 
being either non-poisonous types (Boidce, Ilysiidce, 
Palceophiidce, Colubvidce) or Viperidce (Viperines from 
the Miocene of France and Germany, Crotalines from 
the Miocene of North America). The vertebrae from 
the Puerco Eocene of America, on the limit between 
the Cretaceous and Eocene periods, described as the 
oldest snake remains, Helagras, Cope, are stated to 
approach the Lacertilian type. 

Whether the vertebrae named Symoliophis, 
Sauvage, from the chalk of France, and Coniophis, 
Marsh, from the Laramie Cretaceous of North 
America, are Ophidian, as claimed by their descri- 
bes, or Dolichosaurian, cannot be decided without 
further material.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== HABITS === 

SNAKES may be grouped, according to their 
mode of life, in five principal categories, 
gradually merging into each other, or two of them 
not infrequently found combined in one and the 
same species. These categories are: Ground-snakes, 
Sand-snakes, Burrovving-snakes, Tree- snakes, and 
Water-snakes. 

Ground-snakes may be defined as living above 
ground, and only occasionally climbing bushes or 
entering the water. Among European genera, 
Coronella and Vipera are perfect examples of this 
type, whilst Coluber and Zamenis approach the 
Tree-snakes in often ascending bushes, or even 
trees. 

Sand-snakes are adapted for living on loose 
sand, in which they seek concealment. Such are 
Lytorhynchus and some Psammophis among the 
Colubridse, Cerastes among the Viperidse. Eryx connects 
this category with the next. 

Burrowing-snakes live chiefly underground, and 
often have the visual organ atrophied in consequence, 
as in Typhlops ; all the Typhlopidae, Glauconiidae, 
and Uropeltidae, belong to this category; the Viperid 
Atractaspis is also a burrowing type. 

Tree-snakes spend the greater part of their life on 
bushes or trees. Corralus among the Boidae, Dendrophis 
and Dendraspis among the Colubridae, Atheris, 
and various species of Lachesis among the Viperidae, 
may be quoted as examples. 

Of Water-snakes, some are exclusively aquatic, 
like the marine Hydrophiinse and the typical 
Acrochordinae {Acrochordus, Chersydrus) and Homalopsinae 
(Hipistes, Herpeton). Chersydrus and Hipistes 
occur in the sea as well as in fresh water. Many 
species of Tropidonotus (T. tessellatus and T. viperinus 
in Europe), as well as the genera Helicops, Grayia, 
Boidengerina, etc., among the Colubridae, Eunectes 
among the Boidae, Ancistrodon piscivorus among the 
Viperidae, are chiefly but not exclusively aquatic. 

Our Natrix natrix stands between the 
Ground-snakes and the Water-snakes; Boas and 
Pythons are as much Water-snakes as Tree-snakes. 
As shown by these and many other examples which 
might be given, a division into categories cannot 
always be applied with precision, nor does it convey 
an expression of the natural relationships of the 
species, as was believed by many systematists of the 
last century, who appealed to such adaptations for 
the definition of families. 

A vertical pupil denotes more or less nocturnal 
habits. Nevertheless our European Vipers, which 
are provided with such a contractile pupil, are far 
from exclusively nocturnal, delighting to bask in the 
sun, and pairing and feeding in the day-time. The 
Boidse appear to be more nocturnal, but no snake is 
known to be absolutely so, and the two species of 
Coluber which have been found living in perfect 
darkness in limestone caves in the Malay Peninsula 
and China, where they feed chiefly on bats, occur 
also outside the caves, and probably never breed in 
them. 

It is often stated in books that the organs of 
locomotion for the exceedingly elongate body of 
snakes are the ribs, and these creatures have even 
been compared to Centipedes. This statement is no 
doubt true to a certain extent for slow locomotion 
on uneven ground, when the ribs and the corresponding 
ventral shields afford a point of support; 
but it does not account for the rapid movements, as 
when a snake darts like an arrow in pursuit of its 
prey or to escape from an enemy. Besides, the 
winding motions are not different from those of a 
Slow-worm or Glass-snake, in which, encased as they 
are in a bony armour, the ribs cannot come into 
play at all. The action of the muscles alone is quite 
sufficient to account for the reptation of snakes, 
without the ribs having to play an essential part. 

Not only the Cobras, but also several harmless snakes, 
are able to raise the anterior third of the body 
vertically, when taking up a threatening attitude in
the presence of an enemy, at the same time widening 
or inflating the region behind the head. 

Most snakes can climb, and in this case the ribs 
and ventral shields are of great assistance. The Tree-snakes,
usually characterized by a very slender, sometimes compressed,
body, or by a prehensile tail, are 
specially adapted for twining themselves round 
branches, and in several of them the presence of a keel 
on each side of the ventral and subcaudal shields, 
accompanied by a notch corresponding to the keel, 
affords an additional help for climbing on vertical uneven
surfaces, such as the trunks of trees. This condition 
of the ventral shields has a bearing on the 
extraordinary mode of locomotion with which some 
Tree-snakes [Chrysopelea, and probably also Dendrophis)
have long been credited by the Malays. We allude 
to the so-called Flying-snakes, remarkable for their 
habit of shooting down from trees and descending to 
the ground at an oblique angle, the body being kept 
rigid the whole time of the &quot;flight&quot;. It has been 
observed in Chrysopelea that the ventral surface 
between the lateral keels, which may be compared 
to hinges, can be drawn in and become deeply 
concave, whilst at the same time a slight dorsoventral 
flattening of the body takes place. During 
this muscular contraction the snake is like a piece of 
bamboo bisected longitudinally, and is buoyed up in 
such a way as to explain its parachute-like descent. 

All snakes are able to swim, and the more aquatic 
kinds may spend a few hours under the water. A 
Python molurus is known to have remained alive in a 
basket sunk for thirty-six hours in a river. The best 
adapted for aquatic life are the Hydrophiinae, or Sea- 
snakes, most of which never leave the water, and 
are quite helpless and soon die when brought on 
shore ; their body is more or less compressed 
posteriorly, and the tail oar-shaped. Seaweeds and 
barnacles sometimes settle on them. Algae have also 
been observed growing on the fresh-water snake 
Erpeton tentaculatum. 

As regards food, Burrowing-snakes, as well as a 
few small Ground-snakes, subsist mostly on worms, 
insects, and myriopods; Tree-snakes on lizards, 
frogs, birds and their eggs; Water-snakes on fishes 
and batrachians. Among the other types, some 
show a predilection for mammals, others for lizards 
or snakes, whilst not a few feed indiscriminately 
upon mammals, birds, reptiles and batrachians, even 
on slugs, insects, and worms, in addition. However 
surprising, it is a fact that spiny mammals are 
occasionally eaten, spines of the Madagascar Hedge- 
hog (Ericulns) having been found in the excrements 
of a Boa madagascariensis. Even hard-shelled eggs 
and molluscs may constitute the principal or 
exclusive food of certain snakes. 

Thus, Dasypeltis eats nothing but birds' eggs, the 
shells of which are crushed in the gullet, by a special 
contrivance mentioned above (p. 80), and are soon 
after rejected through the mouth as a pellet. Other 
snakes, such as Coluber and Lioheterodon show them- 
selves partial to eggs in addition to live prey, but 
their alimentary canal does not depart from the 
normal, the eggs being broken in the stomach and 
the remains of the shells passed with the excrements. 

The Amblycephalidse subsist almost entirely on 
snails and slugs, the shells of the former being 
crushed in the anterior part of the intestine after 
their contents have been digested, and the debris are 
rejected through the vent. A small land tortoise has 
been found in the stomach of a Cobra (Naia hate) 
from Algeria. 

Snakes which take large prey secure it according 
to three methods: By catching it simply with the 
jaws, and immediately proceeding to swallow it, as 
in Tropidonotus and in some of the Constrictors when 
dealing with small animals; by constriction, after 
having seized it with the jaws, crushing it in the 
coils of their body and thus killing it previous 
to feeding, as in the Boidse and Coluber; or by 
poisoning, by a mere stroke with the fangs, the 
result being awaited before the meal is begun, as in 
most of the Viperidae. Other poisonous snakes 
proceed according to the first method, the use of the 
venom being to reduce the struggles of the victim 
and to relax its muscles. Such snakes as are in the 
habit of previously killing their prey show little 
reluctance to accept dead food in confinement, a 
thing which others usually refuse to do; they 
may, however, be deceived by the dead animal 
being agitated before them, and the system now 
adopted in our Zoological Gardens, of offering all 
snakes previously-killed animals, has been attended 
with comparative success. 

Some species feed almost exclusively on other 
snakes, and often manage to swallow individuals as 
large as, or even a little larger than, themselves. 
Examples are known of harmless snakes showing 
a predilection for dangerous species, to whose poison 
they are immune. 

As a rule snakes that eat fish will also eat batrachians,
but nothing higher in the scale, although 
exceptions have been reported, such as the Anaconda 
feeding on mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish, and our 
Grass-snake having taken mice and birds. Some that 
feed chiefly on lizards and snakes will occasionally eat 
also mammals, and vice versa, but rarely frogs. On 
the other hand, European Vipers accommodate themselves 
to a more varied bill of fare, being known to 
feed on mammals, birds, reptiles, batrachians, insects, 
and slugs, and they have even been observed to eat 
voles showing signs of putrefaction. 

The enormous prey which some snakes are able 
to swallow is quite astounding. Anacondas and 
Pythons, the largest snakes, have been known to 
swallow calves and good-sized antelopes with their 
horns, animals which, even after being somewhat 
crushed by constriction, very much exceed the 
calibre of the snake. A Python molurus, 17 feet long, 
is reported on good evidence to have swallowed a 
gravid Axis deer. A Grass-snake half an inch in 
diameter can manage a frog or toad three times 
that width, and a Dasypeltis of the same size a hen's 
egg. Such feats are rendered possible by the 
mobility of the jaws and palato-pterygoid arch on 
the cranium, and the elasticity of the ligaments by 
which they are attached), as well 
as by the mobility of the ribs and the absence of 
sternal apparatus, together with the great distensibility 
of the skin. When a snake proceeds to 
dispose of a large prey, which, if it be a mammal or 
bird, is usually seized head-first, it pulls itself 
forward by alternate movements of the jaws, the 
maxillary and the mandibular ramus of the one side, 
and then of the other, being extended anteriorly and 
laterally, the snake at the same time producing an 
abundant salivation which renders the prey very 
slimy. Several repeated alternate movements of the 
jaws bring the head of the prey to the gullet, where 
the muscles and ribs come into play, and the two 
sides of the jaws work no longer alternately, but 
together. When once in the oesophagus, the prey 
progresses with much greater facility, and usually 
reaches the stomach in a few minutes, whilst the 
previous process of deglutition may have lasted half 
an hour. While this laborious operation is going 
on, the breathing of the snake is not impaired 
owing to a remarkable contrivance: the trachea 
can be protruded in such a manner as to bring its 
opening outside the mouth. 

In cases where the victim is eaten alive, the snake 
has to contend with its struggles, but retrogression is 
rendered impossible by the backwardly-directed 
sharp teeth with which the jaws and palate are beset. 
A frog is usually caught by one of the hind limbs and 
swallowed back-first, the long hind limbs stretching 
forwards as they fold against the body; its struggles 
are often still apparent when it has reached the 
oesophagus. Snakes when caught immediately after 
a meal are in the habit of disgorging their food, and 
it sometimes happens that a frog or toad is thus 
vomited alive. An instance is known of a naturalist 
having captured a Grass-snake and put it in a linen 
bag. On opening it a short time after, great was his 
surprise to find the snake had escaped through a 
small hole in the bag, leaving instead a living toad 
too big to pass through the hole. 

If not of too large a size, several animals will often 
be swallowed in rapid succession, after which the 
gorged snake will allow its digestive organs several 
days, or even weeks, of repose. A large Anaconda in 
the Paris Jardin des Plantes fed only thirty-six times 
in the course of seven years. Digestion is usually 
rapid in the small snakes, defecation taking place 
twenty-four to forty-eight hours after the feeding;
it lasts much longer in the large Boas and Pythons. 
Thus, in the above-mentioned Anaconda it has been 
observed to take from nine to thirty-eight days. 
Even the hardest bones of birds are decomposed by 
the gastric juices, but hairs, feathers, and horny productions, 
are passed with the excrements, sometimes 
forming regular balls. It is in most cases possible to 
tell, from an inspection of the dried faeces, what a 
snake has been feeding on, hairs, feathers, beaks, 
claws, epidermal horny shields, bits of tooth-enamel, 
being found mixed with the chalky matter which 
represents the decomposed bones. As a rule there 
is but one defecation after each meal, but there are 
in addition more frequent renal dejections, consisting 
chiefly of uric acid. 

In captivity snakes show themselves capricious in 
the choice of food, one individual preferring mammals, 
whilst another, of the same species, will 
only take birds ; and many, although to all appearances 
perfectly healthy, will persist in refusing all 
food, and allow themselves to die of starvation: a 
suicide which may require months, or even years, to 
accomplish. A Rattle-snake in the menagerie of the 
Jardin des Plantes in Paris has lived two years and two 
months without taking any food, a Python sebcs nearly 
two years and a half, a Boa madagascariensis four years 
and a month. A Vipera aspis was kept for three 
years without food and without losing its vicious 
temper. Specimens thus fasting do not, as a rule,
renew their epidermis, or do so but very rarely. Our 
Common Adder can very seldom be induced to feed 
in captivity. Other snakes may rid themselves of all 
shyness to the extent of taking food from the hand, 
or show such appetite as to seize a prey immediately 
on being released from the small box or bag in 
which they have travelled for a considerable time. 

Most snakes drink, and pretty often, not by 
lapping with the tongue, but by drawing in water 
from the mouth and immersing the anterior part of 
the head. Some are said to be fond of milk, but 
there is no foundation for the belief held by peasants, 
that they enter sheds with the object of sucking 
milk from the cows, which would be a material im- 
possibility; their real purpose in visiting such places 
being a search for suitable dung-heaps in which to 
deposit their eggs. 

Snakes cannot be credited with much intelligence 
or educability, nor do they display any very marked 
instincts. The least stupid and most easily tamed 
are the species of the genera Coluber and Coronclla. 
There is, however, considerable difference in this 
respect between individuals of the same species. 
Most snakes, when freshly caught, defend themselves 
by biting, and some individuals retain their savage 
temper after months of captivity ; others hardly ever 
bite, even if molested. The Common Grass-snake, 
for instance, hisses loudly and takes up a very 
threatening attitude, or even pretends to snap with 
open mouth, but very seldom bites; its principal 
defensive action when caught consists in voiding a 
most repulsive secretion from its anal glands, which 
it evidently controls, as it ceases doing so when 
accustomed to being handled. The same snake also 
produces, during the spring, an oily exudation from 
the skin which has the same repulsive smell. 
Mr. H. N. Ridley has observed a Malay snake 
Macropisthodon rhodomelas, exuding drops of a white 
viscid liquid from the skin of 
its neck, which is flattened out like that of a Cobra 
when in an attitude of defence, and he noticed that 
his dog, seizing the snake to worry it, foamed at the 
mouth as if he had been biting a toad. 

The hissing is produced by the rapid expulsion of 
air from the lungs through the trachea and the notch 
at the end of the mouth, which is kept shut at the 
time. Snakes provided with an epiglottis  
produce a much louder hissing. Other sounds are 
produced by some snakes. Thus, the Indian and 
African Vipers of the genera Echis and Cerastes make 
a curious, prolonged, rustling noise, by rubbing the 
folds of the sides of the body against one another. 
This sound is produced by friction between the 
serrated keels of the lateral scales, which are disposed 
obliquely with their tips directed downwards 
and backwards; the noise can even be repeated 
after the death of the animal, by twisting the body 
and thus rubbing or rasping these little saws against 
one another. The same thing probably takes place 
in the African genus Dasypeltis, in which we find a 
similar arrangement of the scales, though to a less 
degree. 

The best known sounding apparatus is that of the 
Rattlesnakes. When alarmed, 
these snakes gather the body in a few coils or roll 
themselves up in a spiral, with the tail erect in the 
centre, and vibrating with great rapidity, whilst the 
head is ready for attack. Other snakes, such as the 
Ancistrodon and some species of Coluber and 
Zamenis, when excited, vibrate the tail in the same 
manner; but, being deprived of the sound-producing 
apparatus, this expression of their anger does not 
attract the same attention. It is from such a habit, 
however, that the rattle must have been evolved and 
perfected, not necessarily in a Lamarckian sense, but 
through the different steps by which evolution or 
creation has proceeded; Natura non fecit saltics, as 
Linnaeus well said. Many suggestions have been 
made as to the use of the rattle. One of them is 
that the rattling resembles the sound made by 
locusts, and serves to decoy insect-eating birds; 
another, that it serves to call the sexes together. 
Probably it is useful to the snake as a warning to 
keep off disturbers which cannot serve as food, and 
thus prevents useless expenditure of venom, or even 
the breaking of the fangs. At any rate, it gives expression 
to the snake's excitement, as does the voice 
in the case of many other animals, and it seems 
reasonable to suppose that it may be applied to 
different purposes. With the advent of man, this 
means of attracting attention must tend to the more 
rapid extermination of the snakes which possess it. 

Another curious behaviour is that of feigning death, 
as observed in a harmless but vicious-looking genus of snakes, 
Heterodon, often called Hog-nosed snakes or Puff-adders in America. 
It looks more like a Viper than a harmless snake, and 
when disturbed hisses loudly and flattens out the 
anterior part of the body, much as does a Cobra, and 
pretends to strike, although it is one of the few 
snakes that never bite man. If, however, this display 
proves of no avail in frightening away the intruder, 
the snake rolls on its back and opens its mouth, and 
then lies for a time, which may exceed a quarter of 
an hour, absolutely motionless, as if dead. As soon 
as it thinks the danger over, it awakens from its 
spasm and rapidly moves off. It is the opinion of 
those who have most experience of this snake that 
this extraordinary behaviour is not to be explained 
as a convulsion or faint due to fright, but constitutes 
a deliberate trick to save its life. Individuals of the 
South African Ringhals (Sepedon hmnachates) and of 
the Grass snake Natrix natrix have also been observed to 
feign death. 

The notion that snakes fascinate their prey, 
attracting it or reducing it to immobility by a 
mysterious power in their glittering eyes, is pure
fable. Animals placed in a cage with a snake evince 
no particular fright, and fly away when pursued, if 
not actually turning round to defend themselves. 
It is even dangerous to offer a good-sized snake a 
wild rat for food, as all keepers of menageries know. 

In cold and temperate climates snakes hibernate, 
lying more or less torpid in holes or hollow trees, 
sometimes assembled in numbers and coiled 
together in a mass. The first thing they do in 
awakening in the spring is to cast the outer coating 
of the epidermis, as described above. Several 
exuviations take place during the period of activity, 
sometimes pretty regularly every month, sometimes 
at very irregular intervals. A few days previous to 
this operation the snake is languid and abstains from 
feeding; its skin is dull and the sight impaired by 
the opaque condition of the lid; a day or two before 
moulting, the outer stratum of the epidermis 
becomes again transparent and the eye clear, 
through this stratum becoming detached from the 
subjacent tissue, until it is pulled off in one piece, 
by the snake rubbing itself against stones or bushes. 
The first exuviation takes place very shortly after 
birth. 

Snakes are long-lived, although the limit of dura- 
tion of life is not known in any of them. They grow 
slowly, and do not appear ever to reach sexual 
maturity until the fourth year, when they continue 
increasing in size for a long period. A Python reticulatus 
and an Ancistrodon piscivorus are reported to 
have lived twenty-one years in captivity in Paris. 
The young of many snakes are very secretive, and 
are not often found in the open, those that are met 
with being as a rule either new-born or approaching 
sexual maturity. 

Snakes are tenacious of life, and remarkable for 
the reflex movements which take place after they 
have been cut to pieces, the severed parts of the body 
and tail wriggling for a considerable time, and the 
head endeavouring to bite. Accounts of decapitated 
Rattlesnakes turning round and striking with their 
bloody stumps are probably not snake stories.</text>

==Usage==
This template is used to present markup or code side by side with the rendered output.

Parameters:
* unnamed 1: Content of row 1, column 1
* unnamed 2: Content of row 1, column 2
:through
* unnamed 39: Content of row 20, column 1
* unnamed 40: Content of row 20, column 2

* '''t1''': Title of column one; defaults to ''Markup''
* '''t2''': Title of column two; defaults to ''Renders as''
* '''title''': Title of table; defaults to none
* '''notitle''': When set, suppresses table and column titles
* '''margin''': set table left margin in em

The ''Markup'' cell is pre-formatted with {{tag|pre|o}} to retain newlines and spaces, but styled to allow content to wrap within the cell. It is usually desirable to escape the content of the ''Markup'' cell so that the markup is displayed by wrapping the markup in {{xtag|nowiki}}. It is technically not possible to add this feature to the template.

In the ''Renders as'' cell, the content is usually the unescaped markup copied from the ''Markup'' cell. There are instances where this may differ:
* If the first line includes wikimarkup that must start on a new line such as #, *  or ; then use {{tl|crlf2}} before the first line; see examples below.
* Header markup such as {{code|1===}} will show in the page table of contents; use {{tlx|fake heading}}.
; See usage at [[w:{{FULLPAGENAME}}]] for examples truncated below. It references or uses templates not here on Wikibooks. 
It is unknown and unevaluated whether the template will function here on Wikibooks. I brought it in because another templates /doc page referred to it as a 'See Also'. // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 18:13, 21 March 2014 (UTC)
;Usage below truncated by including {{tl|void} from here to categories tagging.
{{TextBox|1=
:* Half a dozen redlinked template references to import if you care to have a go at the full usage and examples. Me, I'd see the Wikipedia help!  [[w:{{FULLPAGENAME}}]]&lt;br/&gt;
}}
{{void|
* When using {{tlx|reflist}} with no other parameters, use {{tlx|reflist|close}} to ensure that the reference list is closed.
* Some templates will place the page in a maintenance category, which is usually undesired:
** Instead of {{tlx|citation needed}}, use {{tlx|fake citation needed}}.
* Some template may have error checking that places the page in a maintenance category. Suppress the category as possible:
** {{cs1}} templates can suppress the maintenance category by setting {{para|template doc demo|true}}.

==Limitations==
If you don't wrap the content of the markup cell in {{xtag|nowiki}}, then any template markup will not be escaped, it will be expanded.

This example shows the markup for &lt;nowiki&gt;{{tl|tag}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;:

{{markup|t1=Renders as|t2=Expected rendering
|{{tl|tag}}
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tl|tag}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}

HTML entities are parsed in the markup cell
{{markup|t1=Nowikied markup shows as |t2=Expected markup
|&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;ndash;
}}

To work around this, replace the &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; thus &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt; will show as &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;

==Examples==

'''Simple examples:'''
{{markup
|&lt;nowiki&gt;'''Bold text'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;|'''Bold text'''
|&lt;nowiki&gt;''Italic text''&lt;/nowiki&gt;|''Italic text''
}}

'''Complex example:'''
Note that the second argument to {{tl2|markup}} uses {{tl2|fake heading}} and {{tl2|fake citation needed}}.
{{markup
|&lt;nowiki&gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.{{#tag:ref|A footnote.&lt;ref&gt;A reference for the footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} The cow jumped over the moon.{{fact}}

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group=nb}}

==References==
{{Reflist}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.{{#tag:ref|A footnote.&lt;ref&gt;A reference for the footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} The cow jumped over the moon.{{fake citation needed}}

{{fake heading|sub=3|Notes}}
{{Reflist|group=nb}}

{{fake heading|sub=3|References}}
{{Reflist|close}}
}}

'''Multiple rows:'''
{{markup
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
}}

'''With title:'''
{{markup|title=Foxes and dogs
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
}}

When a template is enclosed within {{tl|code}}, it shows the rendered HTML:

{{markup
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=T. H. |title=The Book of Merlyn |year=1977}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{cite book |last=White |first=T. H. |title=The Book of Merlyn |year=1977}}
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{code|{{cite book |last=White |first=T. H. |title=The Book of Merlyn |year=1977}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{code|{{cite book |last=White |first=T. H. |title=The Book of Merlyn |year=1977}}}}
}}

{{tl|notelist}} creates a section of explanatory notes that were individually specified by {{tl|efn}} tags in the article. This is analogous to the {{tag|references |single}} and {{tag|ref}} tags for normal citations.

The {{tl|notelist}} section should generally occur before the references. This is required when the explanatory notes are referenced, otherwise there will be citations errors. Even if the explanatory notes are not referenced, they are probably more likely to be read than the references, and should be nearer to the top of the [[w:MOS:APPENDIX|MOS:APPENDIX]] sections than the &quot;References&quot; section for this reason.

==Usage==
{{code|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{notelist}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

==Parameters==
* Single unnamed parameter:
: column-count: a [[w:natural number|natural number]] specifying fixed columns into which the reference list is to be rendered. Example: &lt;code&gt;|2&lt;/code&gt;.
: column-width: a typographic unit of measurement such as [[w:em (typography)#CSS|em|]], specifying the width for the reference list columns. Example: &lt;code&gt;|30em&lt;/code&gt;.
* '''colwidth''': explicitly sets the column-width.
* '''refs''': used with named references (e.g., {{tag|ref|s|params=name=name}}); it specifies a list of some or all named references used in the article.
* '''group''': '''{{Para|group}}''' Sets the [[w:WP:REFGROUP|group name|]], and needs to be the same as those inline. This defaults to ''lower-alpha''.

The available options are:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! group !! Styled as
|-
| note || &lt;sup&gt;[note 1]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| upper-alpha || &lt;sup&gt;[A]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| upper-roman || &lt;sup&gt;[IV]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| lower-alpha || &lt;sup&gt;[a]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| lower-greek || &lt;sup&gt;[a][ß]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| lower-roman || &lt;sup&gt;[iv]&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
* '''close''': forces the reference list to close and render all references defined to that point; see the [[w:Template:Reflist#Multiple uses|section on multiple uses|]] for details.

==Example==
;See [[w:{{FULLPAGENAME}}]] for working examples.

      <comment>- Speedy, no such IP is not a reason to delete the page</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I wanted to mention that, when I open my MARY.PY file with the IDLE for Python version 2.7.5 and then &quot;Run Module&quot;, I get the following output:

Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece was white as snow;
('and everywhere that Mary went',)
her lamb was sure to go.

I have no idea why those parentheses are still there, since I took the four Print statements exactly as they appear on the Wiki page.

When I launch IDLE for version 3.4 and &quot;Run Module&quot;, I get the following, correct output:

Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece was white as snow;
and everywhere that Mary went
her lamb was sure to go.

***************************************

I'm a beginner at Python, so I haven't a clue as to why those parentheses would continue to appear, although the two versions are apparently treating the set of statements differently.</text>

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
__NOTOC__ 
This is the '''bullet+R''' template&amp;mdash;meaning menomically 'bullet+{{kp|RETURN}}'; which is something of a misnomer as the ''''forced newline'''' or the '{{kp|RETURN}}' occurs first then the bullet is prefixed (space char omitted) to the following word or term.
* It is extremely useful inside tables and images to set off bullet-points, but generally ''should not' be used on unenclosed text'',
* use instead '''the&lt;big&gt;&lt;tt&gt; '*' or ':::*' &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/big&gt;for such bulleting needs.
* '''''unless''' that is, you want to maintain an indent level relative to the line left margin... then it is your solution!
&lt;br/
&gt;
{{Text-box|1=
: '''Note:''' the 'old daze' '[[w:typewriter|typewriter]]'s keyboard' {{kp|RETURN}} key is usually now the modern keyboard's '{{kp|ENTER}}' key, but at the ASCII coding level of a text file, the bytes still expresses a CR+LF code pair&amp;mdash;'Carriage Return + Linefeed', or the C-language and many modern descendents' ''escape code ''''\n''''''' (newline).}}

This template is used when you want a larger bullet than a [[Template:·|bold middot]] ['''&amp;middot;'''], but something smaller than a [&amp;ndash;] or [&amp;mdash;], and FURTHER, want to start a new row of data or bullet a point. For instance, in dotted lists that have a font-size 80% or less of normal font-size, since then a bold middot becomes too small... so we use {{Tl|bull}}, for those of us who don't know how to code such, and know further that searching for graphics dots is slow and painful. (Letters, on the other hand, are easy to find on ALL KEYBOARDS).
&lt;br&gt;
===Tail of two bulls===
* Both the 'bulls' work similarly to the HTML markup sequence: &lt;big&gt;[&lt;code&gt;'''&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;/big&gt;, that is, {{Tl|bull}} expresses a &lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;non-breaking space, a bullet and a normal space&lt;/code&gt; ...
&lt;br&gt;
* '''while BullR''' expresses a &lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;'' 'carriage-return-to-indent-column' ''and 'linefeed'&lt;/code&gt; (newline) so changes line then shows the bullet indented to the prior indented column. This is akin to setting a return stop on typewriters when Returning would be stopped short of the left margin. (This kept thousands of secretaries employed laboriously setting up the bosses tabular documents! And that's 'No Bull!')

;to illustrate, indenting the below
:then using it and bull together on the same line:
::When displayed {{tl|bull}} looks like [{{bull}}] on the same line, while THIS looks and acts on a '''term or link''' like this when also on the same line: &lt;br/
&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;'''term or link'''... ''unlike {{tl|bull}}'', '''BullR''' begins a newline but indented. Used together with a bit of planning the two make for some nice navigation template options. Used alone, BullR nicely sets off data best viewed in an uncluttered presentation. 
* And unlike {{Bull}}, the bullet stays attached to the following text separated and linked by the opposite nesting order of HTML markup sequence: &lt;big&gt;[&lt;code&gt;''' &amp;amp;bull;&amp;amp;nbsp;'''term or link&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;/big&gt;. 
* Since it expresses a normal space then the bullet and non-breaking space it makes a handy delimiter when table data gets confusing and you need to set off things in an orderly manner:
&lt;br&gt;
* use after some text like this&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BullR&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and just continue your composition. Wikimarkup parsing will search until finding the end of template so the newline equates to a tab or space (all class 'whitespace') and all are ignored. 

{{further|Template:bull}}

{{void| So if you want it. you figure out how to rewrite the below... I was out of time three hours ago!

=== Normal usage ===
The recommended usage is to use ''no'' space before the template and one space after the template, like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt{{&amp;bull;}} Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It will render one space on each side of the bullet, like this:
:Salt &amp;bull; Pepper

If it line breaks then the line break will come ''after'' the bullet, not before, like this:
:Salt &amp;bull; 
:Pepper

For long dotted lists, each list item can be put on its own line with no spaces between each item and the template, like this:
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 Salt{{&amp;bull;}}
 Pepper{{&amp;bull;}}
 Curry{{&amp;bull;}}
 Saffron&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

(It does not matter if there are no or some spaces at the end of the lines, after the templates.)

As before it will render one space on each side of the bullets, like this:
:Salt &amp;bull; Pepper &amp;bull; Curry &amp;bull; Saffron

And if it line breaks then the line break will come ''after'' one of the bullets, not before, like this:
:Salt &amp;bull; Pepper &amp;bull; 
:Curry &amp;bull; Saffron

=== Incorrect usage ===
If the template is used slightly wrong, it will, in some cases, still behave well. For instance, if there are no or several spaces after the template, like these examples:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt{{&amp;bull;}}Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt{{&amp;bull;}}   Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Both of them will render exactly as before, with just one space on each side of the bullet, like this:
:Salt &amp;bull; Pepper

And it will still only line break ''after'' the bullet, like this:
:Salt &amp;bull; 
:Pepper

But putting one or more spaces before the template will cause problems, like these examples:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt {{&amp;bull;}}Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt   {{&amp;bull;}}Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt {{&amp;bull;}} Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt   {{&amp;bull;}}   Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Then it will render with ''two'' spaces before the bullet and one after, like this:
:Salt &amp;nbsp;&amp;bull; Pepper

And if it line breaks it might break ''before'' the bullet, like this:
:Salt
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull; Pepper

=== Technical details ===
The space before the bullet is a non-breaking space. That means it will not line break and will not collapse together with normal spaces that come before the template.

The space after the bullet is a normal space. That means it wraps (allows line breaks) and it will collapse together with normal spaces that come after the template to form one single space.

Under some circumstances, dotted link lists misbehave. They might get unexpected line wraps or they might expand outside the box they are enclosed in.

The history of humanity is an interesting story. From our starts on fertile river banks to the massive globally linked skyscraper sea we live in today, humanity has woven a tail written by war, politics, religions, technology, and curiosity. As we constantly create history in our ever advancing society, one should look back on the history already created to understand the world today. Much of the concepts in society like politics, business, and military have been shaped by events that happened in history. This comprehensive guide will take you through thousands of years of human history from all over the world. This is not an encyclopedia of historical events and persons, but rather a tour guide through history that aims to show how humanity has advanced. The tour starts now.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Prologue to History ==
There was no time. The was no space. There was simply nothing. The universe was but a state of immense heat and energy, and incredible density. Such a scale of energy and heat that was so compact was the precursor to all history, and by means still not exactly known, the dense state of heat and energy suddenly and rapidly expanded, travailing at a speed barely comprehensible. The Big Bang. Just a mere second after the universe came into existence it was at a temperature of 5.5 billion Celsius (10 billion Fahrenheit). This cosmic plasma soup contained a vast array of fundamental particles such as neutrons, electrons and protons, which as the universe gradually cooled died off. 13.798 ± 0.037 billion BCE. The start of history. Over the next billions of years the universe continued to cool off and expand, even to this day, it is still expanding from the force of the Big Bang. Eventually hydrogen, helium and lithium, created from particles formed by the Big Bang, started to come together to form heaver elements, which would in turn form stars. 

Why does this matter? Why is Astronomy history being discussed in a world history wikibook? Because humanity itself is made from the big bang. Carbon-based lifeforms are made up of elements first conceived in the Big Bang. The particles of the early universe are what form our bodies. We are made of star stuff. Further more, the advancement of humanity is also possible only through the formation of the universe. The natural metal and ore deposits on Earth shaped history, as everything from weapons and armor to plows and eating utensils would not be possible if the right elements had not formed in the Big Bang. While obviously in the broad sense the Big Bang created history by creating time itself, the Big Bang contributed all of the necessary conditions and elements for human civilization to arise. People in the past were often fascinated by space and the stars, and rightfully so. Everything we know today came from the stars. Even you, the reader, has portions of the universe from the Big Bang flowing through your veins, beating in your chest. In order to understand and appreciate the proceeding guide through history, it is important to know that all of it was due to a cosmic coincidence that remnants of still can be seen today. Perhaps the amazement with the cosmos is symbiotic, as we continue to study the force that brought us into creation, that force also ever studies us, watching us grow and evolve as our society and civilizations advance. And in that cosmic sense, that is the essence of history</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Typhlops vermicularis''''', the European blind snake or European worm snake, 
[[File:Typhlops vermicularis.jpg|thumbnail|Typhlops vermicularis, the European blind snake or European worm snake]]
is a species of snake in the genus ''[[Snakes_of_Europe/Species/Typhlops|Typhlops]]'', first decribed by Merrem in 1820.   Despite its common name, the range of the European blind snake ranges from the Balkan Peninsula, the Aegean Islands, and Cyprus to Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=Oshea1&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Shea|first=Mark|title=Boas and Pythons of the World|year=2007|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=9781845375447|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common names refer to how it is the only blindsnake of the genus ''Typhlops'' naturally found in Europe.  

==Biology==
Decsribed as growing to 20-35cm in size and being 1cm in diameter.
Unlike most relatives, which are oviparous, this species lays 4-8 eggs. It feeds on insect larvae and ants.

==Identification==
The rostral scale overhangs the mouth to form a shovel-like burrowing structure. They live underground in burrows, and since they have no use for vision, their eyes are mostly vestigial. They have light-detecting black eye spots, and teeth occur in the upper jaw. The tail ends with a horn-like scale. They can often be confused with earthworms as they are both often seen in leaf litter and detritus on the ground, and in the soil.

==Venom and toxicity==
Described as being willing to try to sting with a small spine at the end of its tail &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bayramgocmen.com/hc_snakes.html&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
==Alien species==
The only other blindsnake found in Europe is the Brahminy blindsnake, or &quot;flowerpot snake,&quot; ''Ramphotyphlops braminus'', where specimens have been discovered lurking in the soil at the Kew Gardens, London.&lt;ref name=Oshea2&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Shea|first=Mark|title=Boas and Pythons of the World|year=2007|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=9781845375447|pages=67}}

The '''Typhlopidae''' are a family of blind snakes, first decribed by Merrem in 1820. They are found mostly in the tropical regions of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and all mainland Australia and various islands. The rostral scale overhangs the mouth to form a shovel-like burrowing structure. They live underground in burrows, and since they have no use for vision, their eyes are mostly vestigial. They have light-detecting black eye spots, and teeth occur in the upper jaw. The tail ends with a horn-like scale. Most of these species are oviparous. Currently, 10 genera are recognized containing over 200 species.

==Geographic range==
They are found in most tropical and many subtropical regions all over the world, particularly in Africa, Asia, islands in the Pacific, tropical America, one species is found in  southeastern Europe.

==Species of Interest==
In Europe the only native species is [[Snakes_of_Europe/Species/Typhlops_vermicularis|Typhlops vermicularis, the Blind Snake or Worm Snake]] of the genus [[Snakes_of_Europe/Species/Typhlops|Typhlops]], it is found in southeastern Europe, the Balkans, and islands in the Aegean with distribution stretching across to Afghanistan.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== DR. ESPERANTO’S INTERNATIONAL – ENGLISH VOCABULARY ==

What follows is the original lexicon of Esperanto words as it appeared in ''Dr. Esperanto's International Language'' published in 1889. It is from this original stock of approximately 600 words that the language grew. The pamphlet contained the following note about Esperanto word-building:

:''Everything written in the international language can be translated by means of this vocabulary. If several words are required to express one idea they must be written in one, but separated by [apostrophes]; e.g., frat'in'o, though one idea, is yet composed of three words, which must be looked for separately in the vocabulary.''

The requirement for internal punctuation of a word was dropped from the language not long after this work was published. It is now vanishingly rare to find it in use except in the most rudimentary of primers.

Esperanto is a living language and, like all living languages, the meanings of words drift over time. Herein are the original definitions as they are found in Zamenhof's pamphlet.

In Esperanto, unlike English, words are most commonly abbreviated by means of a hyphen; an em-dash should never be used for this purpose. Consider the following common Esperanto abbreviation ''Ges-roj'' (Mr. and Mrs.): in plain text a hyphen is used to indicate an abbreviation. However, a properly typeset document will use ''Ges&lt;sup&gt;roj&lt;/sup&gt;''. Handwritten documents may either use a hyphen or may superscript and underline similar to the way ordinal numbers are often handwritten in English e.g., 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;nd&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So, written with a pen one might see ''Ges&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;roj&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'' for clarity, but abbreviations should never be typeset with an underline in this way.

== Acronyms ==

Acronyms that are not mixed case, such as ''ktp'' (et cetera) should simply be italicized. If italics is not available, the word should include periods, k.t.p.

Acronyms that are mixed case such as ''a.K.E.'' (BCE) should be in small caps ({{Smallcaps|aKE}}) if at all possible. 

== Miscellaneous Rules ==

In Esperanto, as in English, untranslated words from foreign languages should be italicized. Words from non-Roman alphabets should be transliterated and then italicized. For example a document containing {{hebrew|שׁ}} might read &quot;{{hebrew|שׁ}} (''ŝin.'')&quot;</text>

==Introduction==
[[File:Marsha Coleman-Adebayo.jpg|thumb|Marsha Coleman-Adebayo]]
Dr. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo graduated with a doctorial degree from [[w:Massachusetts Institute of Technology | Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt; NPR Staff. (2011, September 06) High Price of Blowing the Whistle on EPA. http://www.npr.org/2011/09/06/140214594/high-price-of-blowing-the-whistle-on-epa &lt;/ref&gt; After leaving MIT she began working for the United Nations where she learned about African developmental issues. &lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt;  In 1990, she joined the Environmental Protection Agency ([[W:United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]) and became a Senior Policy Analyst in the Office of the Administrator. &lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt; &lt;ref&gt; The No FEAR Institute. Dr. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo Biography.  http://thenofearinstitute.wordpress.com/about/dr-marsha-coleman-adebayo-biography/ &lt;/ref&gt; During her time at the EPA, she traveled to South Africa where she was exposed to the horrors of vanadium poisoning that many South African mine workers were facing. Back in the United States, she reported this issue to the EPA but was ignored. She became a [[w:whistleblower | whistleblower]] when she decided to sue the EPA for discriminating against her.  Like other well known whistleblowers, including [[W:Edward Snowden|Edward Snowden]] and [[W:Chelsea Manning|Chelsea Manning]], her actions have faced mixed reviews as she was ridiculed and allegedly continued to be discrimination against for the remainder of her career at the EPA.

==Vanadium Mining and the Binational Commission==
[[File:Vanadium crystal elektrolytic.jpg|thumb|left|Vanadium crystal elektrolytic]]
In 1995, after [[w: Nelson Mandela | Nelson Mandela]] became the president of South Africa, the United States offered $210-million in support to the newly formed democracy and created the U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission. &lt;ref name=&quot;Stremlau&quot;&gt; Stremlau, J. (2000, July/August). Ending Africa's wars. Foreign Affairs, 79(4), 117-132. JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman-Adebayo represented the EPA as the commission's executive secretary. &lt;ref name =&quot;no fear&quot;&gt;Coleman-Adebayo, M. (September, 2011). ''No fear: A whistleblower's triumph over corruption and retaliation at the EPA.'' Chicago, IL: Lawrence Hill Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission, led by then U.S. Vice President [[w: Al Gore |Al Gore]] and South African Deputy President [[w: Thabo Mbeki | Thabo Mbeki]], met twice a year to discuss education, agriculture, defense, and trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stremlau&quot;/&gt; One resource the United States imports heavily from South Africa is vanadium. South Africa has the world's largest supply of vanadium and there were several American-run mines in the country. &lt;ref&gt; Rotberg, R. (1980). Suffer the future, policy choices in South Africa. Harvard University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; At one American mine, Vametco, workers were dying from vanadium poisoning and children and elderly nearby reported respiratory illness. &lt;ref&gt; The South African Exchange Program on Environmental Justice. (1995, November 19). Protest at the headquarters of Strategic Minerals Corporation. http://saepej.igc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; During Coleman-Adebayo's trips to South Africa, she witnessed first-hand the effects of vanadium mining on the South African people.&lt;ref name =&quot;no fear&quot;/&gt; She reported the problems to the EPA, but her superior told her to shut up. Coleman-Adebayo believes the EPA wouldn't listen to her because they discriminated against her. &lt;ref name=&quot;no fear&quot;/&gt;

==Discrimination==

Marsha Coleman-Adebayo was allegedly faced with discrimination due to her sex, race, and health. After returning from maternity leave, a white man with less experience became her boss - a position she originally wanted. After complaining, she was told: &quot;You're an intelligent woman; you knew not to get pregnant. How can you make that decision and expect to compete with men?&quot; In 1992, after entering a meeting she was told: &quot;Come on in, Marsha. We'll make you an honorary white man so you can join us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;root&quot;&gt; Gordy, Cynthia. (2011, November 3) The High Cost of Being an EPA Whistleblower. The Root. &lt;/ref&gt; Another supervisor also called her &quot;uppity,&quot; a term that has racial connotations. &lt;ref name=&quot;fears&quot;&gt; Fears, D. (2006, July 10) Coming soon: A tale of whistle-blowing at the EPA. ''The Washington Post'' &lt;/ref&gt; After she told the EPA about the vanadium mines, her supervisor believed she was identifying too closely with the black South Africans and thus needed to understand &quot;which team [she] was on.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;root&quot; /&gt;

Coleman-Adebayo brought up the discrimination, but she was faced with threats towards herself and her family. She received a graphic rape threat on her secure cell phone. Two people called insulating a threat to her children as they provided information about her children such as them playing in her front house.  &lt;ref&gt; Buford, L. (2011, October1 18) EUR Book Look: 'No Fear: A Whistleblower's Triumph Over Corruption and Realiation at the EPA.' eurweb. &lt;/ref&gt; The EPA has refused to comment on Coleman-Adebayo's specific allegations, but Jennifer Wood, an EPA spokesperson, denies that the &quot;EPA has discriminated or retaliated against Dr. Coleman-Adebayo.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;fears&quot;/&gt;

==Whistleblowing against Discrimination==
[[File:Environmental Protection Agency logo.svg|thumb|left| Environmental Protection Agency]]
In 1998, Marsha Coleman-Adebayo filed a law suit against the EPA. Coleman-Adebayo claimed that Carol Browner, the EPA administrator at the time, allowed discrimination to persist in the office rather than trying to eliminate it. At the congressional hearing on the matter, Browner's defense was that minorities in senior ranking positions had tripled in number during her time, but she was unable to explain why the culprits of Coleman-Adebayo's claims had not been reprimanded or dismissed. In some cases they had actually been promoted. The jury found the EPA guilty of discrimination and awarded Coleman-Adebayo $300,000. As word of Coleman-Adebayo's case spread, other minority EPA workers came forward with claims of discrimination. One African-American woman said that she was ordered to clean a toilet in anticipation of Browner's arrival at an event. &lt;ref&gt; White, Jack. (Feb. 23, 2001). How the EPA was Made to Clean Up its Own Stain-Racism. Time. http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,100423,00.html &lt;/ref&gt;


Coleman-Adebayo continued fighting the EPA. Between 1998 and 2011 Coleman-Adebayo filed nine civil suits against the EPA for job discrimination and civil rights violations. She sued specific members of the EPA and the organization as a whole. &lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg Law. (2014, April 2). Search results for Coleman-Adebayo&lt;/ref&gt; After her initial suit, Coleman-Adebayo developed [[w: hypertension | hypertension]] and the EPA asked her to resign. It is unclear whether the EPA asked her to resign because of her lawsuit or her medical condition, but she refused because the men who had discriminated against her were allowed to stay. The EPA allowed her to work from home until she was demoted to an in office analyst position in December 2004. She continued to work from home until the EPA eventually ordered her into the office in April 2006. She reluctantly complied but was taken away in an ambulance after she became extremely dizzy. Coleman-Adebayo was placed on unpaid leave. &lt;ref name=&quot;fears&quot;/&gt;

==No FEAR==

Jim Sensenbrenner; Dr. Marsha Coleman -Adebayo; Sen. John Warner; Attorney General John Ashcroft; in foreground, Cari Dominguez; Rawle King; in background Leroy Warren; and right, Dr. Ruby Reese Moone.]]

====No FEAR Act====
In addition to the numerous law suits, Coleman-Adebayo took her case to legislation and spearheaded a law to protect whistleblowers. The Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act ([[W:No-Fear Act|No FEAR Act]]) was introduced to the United States Congress on January 3, 2001 and signed into law by President [[w: George W. Bush | George W. Bush]] on May 15, 2002. &lt;ref&gt; United States Congress. (2002). Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002. Legislative History, ID: PL107-174. ProQuest Legislative Insight. http://congressional.proquest.com/legisinsight?id=PL107-174&amp;type=LEG_HIST &lt;/ref&gt; The Act is based on Congress's findings that &quot;Federal agencies cannot be run effectively if those agencies practice or tolerate discrimination.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002, 5 USCS § 2301. &lt;/ref&gt; The Act requires that Federal agencies provide annual notices to employees about the rights and remedies available under employment discrimination and whistleblower protection laws, train employees at least every two years about those rights and remedies, and submit  annual reports to Congress, the [[W:Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], the [[W: United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], and the [[W: United States Office of Personnel Management| Office of Personnel Management]] outlining the agency's efforts to eliminate discrimination and promote whistleblower protection. Agencies must also detail complaints brought up against them, post on their public website quarterly statistical data about complaints filed with the agency, and reimburse the Judgment Fund for payments made to employees because of violations of discrimination laws, whistleblower protection laws, and retaliation claims. &lt;ref&gt; U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. (2014). Questions and Answers: No FEAR Act. http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/nofear/qanda.cfm &lt;/ref&gt;

====Impacts of the Act====
The Act makes information readily available to the public about discrimination claims filed within Federal agencies. For instance, the [[w: United States Department of Homeland Security | Department of Homeland Security's]] (DHS) report for the 2012 fiscal year reports that 185 civil action cases were filed against them under the No FEAR Act; 85 of those cases were disposed, 68 were decided in favor of the department, 12 were settled, and 5 were sent to mediation. The DHS reimbursed the Judgement Fund $1,528,139. Also, the DHS reports that zero employees were disciplined for discrimination.&lt;ref&gt; Department of Homeland Security. (2012) No FEAR Act Annual Report. http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CRCL/no-fear-act-annual-report-fy2012.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Energy summarizes their complaint activity over several fiscal years; 65 complaints were filed in 2007, 50 in 2008, 49 in 2009, 61 in 2010, and 68 in 2011. &lt;ref&gt; U.S. Department of Energy. (2011). No Fear Act. http://energy.gov/diversity/services/protecting-civil-rights/no-fear-act &lt;/ref&gt; These are just two examples of how agencies are now detailing their actions due to the regulations of the No FEAR Act; however, no analysis has been conducted to determine the effectiveness of the No FEAR Act.

====No FEAR Institute, Coalition and Book====
Passing a law was not the end for Coleman-Adebayo. She started the No FEAR Institute, a non profit organization commiteted to education and defense of victims of employer discrimination. &lt;ref name =&quot;No FEAR Institute&quot;&gt; The NO FEAR Institute. http://thenofearinstitute.wordpress.com/about/ &lt;/ref&gt; She founded the No FEAR Coalition, a group of civil rights and whistleblower organizations. &lt;ref name=&quot;No FEAR Institute&quot; /&gt; In 2011, she published a memoir titled ''No Fear: A whistleblower's triumph over corruption and retaliation at the EPA''. &lt;ref&gt; Amazon.com No Fear: A whistleblower's triump over corruption and retaliation at the EPA. http://www.amazon.com/No-Fear-Whistleblowers-Corruption-Retaliation/dp/B007MXDR8K &lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Coleman-Adebayo serves on the board of the National Whistleblowers Center ([[W:National Whistleblowers Center|NWC]]). &lt;ref&gt; National Whistleblowers Center (2012) Board. http://www.whistleblowers.org/index.php?option=com_advancedtags&amp;view=tag&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional and Ethical Considerations==
Are all whistleblowers definition four professionals? Are all definition four professionals whistleblowers? An important quality of a professional is defiance when defiance is necessary. Whistleblowers, in general, may be considered professionals if their defiance is deemed necessary. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo blew the whistle and exposed the EPA for discrimination based on gender and race. Her actions led to may positive changes including the No FEAR Act, but it seems she may have lost sight of her original missions - aiding the South African miners. Some improvements to the mines were made such as having miner uniforms washed at the mine, decreasing the amount of vanadium miners bring into houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;root&quot; /&gt; The EPA also issued a Toxicological Review of Vanadium Pentoxide on September 30, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanadium review&quot;&gt; EPA. IRIS Toxicological Review of Vanadium Pentoxide. http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris_drafts/recordisplay.cfm?deid=236587 &lt;/ref&gt; This review assessed the vanadium oral reference dose, inhalation reference concentration, inhalation unit risk, and cancer weight of evidence descriptor. &lt;ref name=&quot;vanadium review&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These were minor changes and none of them were done through Coleman-Adebayo. Her initial whisteblowing may have been necessary in order to raise questions about the EPA's alleged discriminatory practices, but Coleman-Adebayo could have stopped after her initial civil victory. She, instead, chose to continue fighting and write a book. While her career at EPA suffered as a result of the whistleblowing, the attention she gained afterwards has given her fame and success outside of the EPA.

==Purpose==
This Book Division index page is a master '''&lt;u&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/u&gt;''' page for Intermediate Skills building topics just as Introductory Trainz linked above is for those just getting their feet onto the first slopes of the various Trainz learning curves, and Content Creation and References are for even more advance topics. If the reader visualizes a large reference work in a three ring binder with TABS sticking out to quickly switch between book sections, you see what we're trying to accomplish in your minds eye.
 
At the file structure level, some threaded materials will be linked both in-sequence (threaded page to page 1st to next page) and in collections of related material where it was relocated into various places such as '''[[Trainz/Appendices|Trainz Wikibook Appendix pages]]''', or other divisions of the Trainz Wikibooks. Consequenly, if you've seen such a page, with a slightly different look the chances are you have&amp;mdash;the magic of modern type setting technology in a Wiki allows that page to appear both ways! These Division TOC pages will also introduce new and older Trainzers to that of organization of the work, and give a greater sense of where to look for things when needed.

==Introduction==
Welcome to the '''Trainz Asset and Creation''' TABLE OF CONTENTS page. In here we will be listing beginner to intermediate level stand-alone and threaded tutorial topics so the newer Trainzer can better focus on Fundamentals, then grow in knowledge by using some of this Chapter when its the right time, or browse on a pick and choose basis.
{{Trainz-stub-section}}
In this work we will introduce the Trainz data structures that you will become familiar with once you download older content and routes that may have dependencies which are out of date. Trainz DLS clean-up is an ongoing work, and there is also some stuff that is less than professional grade put up by novices or as a joke by juveniles. Navigating such a situation is a key skill these pages will help you master.

== Altering Assets==
===Fixing Faulty Content===
All content is not treated equally. This prejudicial attitude is evinced by Trainz against the unwary by means of using the {{TR|T|trainz-build}} number to process data differently on reading it's data. Essentially, every older asset gets translated into a newer data model in Trainz internally. When the data can't be, or because the programmers choose to not ignore some data tag and field, errors are generated by the newer Trainz releases.
{{TrainzTip|
:''Editor's note: Some errors occur in later releases because the Trainz data model changed in the release.
* This many times avoidable'' 'Obsoleted by Program Changes' situation ''is the case now for some {{TR|ST|p=tags}} ''if content is upgraded'', but was very noticeable in Steam Locomotives brought forward into TC3 and TS2009's new data models (when they didn't work) and the parade of new errors messages continue with new levels of error checking at each release.}}

== Asset Fundamentals and Management ==
{{TrainzTip|''Main pages: {{TL|Introduction to assets}} and {{TL|Getting and organizing 3rd-party assets}}''
If you are a new Trainz user, the two links above leads into the first page-linked chapters&amp;mdash; each as part of a set of linked 'How-To' (''and be careful of this or that'') pages, and so both page sequences should be read first. We're even going to throw in pictures now and then.{{bullR
}}The Table of Contents lists below will help you find things easy when you want to revisit a page.&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;}}

===Manage, not reorganize===
Managing your assets becomes essential when your 3rd party and DLS content begins to build up. With more than 250,000 items available from the DLS, and built-in content shipped with every edition, the amount of faulty/missing dependencies or items requiring updates or attention quickly becomes a mammoth task to deal with.
{{TrainzTip|New users are cautioned in the strongest possible terms to limit your greed to just a few non-built-in items ''at first'' and especially to just one route at a time&amp;mdash;these can bring in hundreds of assets, many of them older and broken for immediate use. It is better by far to search for sessions so you get a route with some canned Driver sessions. We're going to cover all that, including perils and pitfalls, and once we pass along some tricks, we'll cut you loose to make your mistakes plenty soon enough.
* If you are very new, limit yourself to routes v-2.9 or later until you get some practice fixing various errors. You will get enough in even new routes, and part of this book is going to introduce you to Surveyor and Driver by way of downloading some content to learn from and by ''do-to-learn-fast'' tautology.
* Any asset not fixed, should be disabled before running Trainz GUI programs using the {{kp|RMBHd}} drop down menu. 
:* This cautionary practice extends especially to disabling software (dependent routes or sessions) as TADdaemon gets hyper-active when it can't resolve dependency references.&lt;ref&gt;{{plain link|http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?110703-TS12-SP1-HF4-validation-validation-validation-so-when-can-I-get-to-use-the-sim|so-when-can-I-get-to-use-the-sim}}, accessdate=2014-0402.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before tackling the below==
Trainz is an application with many parts, so this whole collection of topics has to assume you've read and mastered the following:

# {{TL|Installing Trainz for convenience}}
# {{TL|Upgrading Trainz within a version}} - Newer Trainz will auto-upgrade but politely ask you first. This can take a while, so running a first Driver session and getting your feet wet is okay. In this, we'll cover both cases (you told it yes or no... what next to upgrade?) and discuss manual patches, resources and so forth.
# You've at least completed three or more {{TL|Driver/Driving Tutorials|Driver Tutorials}}
# You've read {{TL|Intro to Content Manager}} and played around with setting filters
## Can find stuff that's built-in or only on the DLS, or stuff in both, can search for routes, sessions, and stuff by a particular {{TA|Recommended Content Creators for New Trainzers|Content Creator}}.
## Further, you've seen {{TA|New Trainzer's Content Guide}} or {{TA|Content Creators to Avoid}}

...

&lt;br /&gt;
Project implemented by  [http://www.y-peer.net/ Y-Peers] &lt;br /&gt;
Lebanon , October 2010 &lt;br /&gt;
UNFPA, [http://www.unfpa.org.lb/UNFPA.aspx The United Nations Population Fund - Lebanon]

----

Baalbek is the administrative headquarters of the Bekaa valley that runs parallel to Lebanon’s border with Syria. It is a small city with a history of more than 5000 years. Two thousand years ago, the magnificent sanctuary of Baalbek celebrated the syncretism between Baal, the God of semitic origin and Zeus-Jupiter, the Gods of Greco-Roman origin. Baalbek was also called Heliopolis, the city of the Sun. Here, we find the largest and best preserved temples of the old Roman Empire. The present population of the town is predominantly Shia muslim but there is an important Christian minority representing the most ancient uninterrupted communities of Christianity.
 
We visited a project in Baalbek, on sexual and reproductive health awareness amongst youth, funded by the United Nations Population Fund and implemented by the Youth Peer Education Network, an organisation that educates youth, especially adolescent girls, on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, drug abuse, and violence against women. In order to inform youth about the risks and causes of sexually transmitted infections, this project utilises innovative communication techniques like theatre, role play, games, radio and television shows.
It is not easy to talk openly about sexual health in this traditional context but the project has been successful in overcoming inhibitions and stereotypes. 

-----
The Youth Peer Education Network or Y-PEER, is a global initiative pioneered by the United Nations Population Fund, spanning 48 countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Middle East, and Latin America. 
In Lebanon, the Y-PEER network comprises peer educators affiliated to NGOs, youth clubs, Scouts, municipalities, private and public schools and 7 Palestinian camps. 

The Y-PEER network was created to enhance awareness amongst youth on reproductive health and to build their capacities in educating their peer groups on issues around adolescent sexual health, youth rights, HIV/AIDS prevention and addressing social stigmas, substance abuse, gender equality and gender based violence, civic engagement, advocacy. 

Through innovative techniques of “edutainment”, or education by entertainment, like theatre, role play, interactive media, games, movies, singing, skills and capacities are built among youth in educating their peer groups and advocating for their rights. Youth sensitize their peers through radio and television shows, conveying messages in events, producing newsletters, and handbooks with practical information, for instance on sexually transmitted infections.

Young people supported as part of this initiative are reaching out and educating thousands of Lebanese youth across the country on HIV/AIDS, STIs and reproductive health care .

This template is used on Wikibook [[Trainz]] for Trainz screenshots that don't contain enough panorama content to be uploaded to the Commons using the [[commons:Category:Trainz templates|Trainz (licensing) templates]] templates.
* It can also be used for other non-free or non-open-source Windows or MAC (OS-X) supporting applications that are not free of proscribed icons and other constrained elements under international copyrights laws and conventions.&lt;br&gt;
* If the page *e.g shows part of a Windows Desktop and icons or Notepad/Word etc. define the Msoft parameter to any value &lt;code&gt;'|MSsoft=1'&lt;/code&gt;.
;When to apply
* Use this licensing template when the image is non-free but educational. Most {{TL|CM}} screen shots will be in this classification.
* If after uploading, auto-page creation adds the two included templates, edit the page and remove them while replacing with this one.
* This template fills in boilerplate for you easing uploading chores the other fields can be provided but may not be needed...
:# define 'module=' or 'use=' parameter if known, but with sub-page reofganizing, best to leave the boilplate. The image and a search will locate which module.

Dear Xania,

May I know why you delete all my pages for the above title at 22:53, 18 December 2011?

I know I have offended the copyright issue, but I already done the edit part which is not directly take from the http://www.thinkgrid.com/cloud-computing.aspx. I edit the pages so many times but end up still have the copyright issues. In addition,I had made some references stating that i have took some words from this web pages. Would'nt you just delete the part which I have offended the copyright part instead of all the part in that pages. This is my group assignments and I do not want to be the black sheep to ruin it. Tomorrow is my presentation for this assignment and I hope u will reply me urgently,
Thanks,

:Xania appears to be on his Xmas break, but you can request undeletion of deleted pages [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion#Undeletion|here]]. (Please log in to your account and click on &quot;Add a new entry&quot; in the &quot;Undeletion&quot; section.)

Xania, can you please explain why you've deleted the entire page of &quot;A Bit History of Internet/Chapter 7 : Cloud-computing&quot; by giving reason there was no response after few weeks but actually there was already response regarding the issue?  Could you just delete the copyright violating section(s) but not the entire page?  It seems to me what you are doing can discourage a new potential wiki contributor.  Please restore the deleted page, thanks in advance.

:The page has already been recreated.  I don't understand what the problem is now.  See [[A_Bit_History_of_Internet/Chapter_7_:_Cloud-computing]].  The section for this page on [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion]] explains that we can't see any trace of a response to the original problem and that is why the page was deleted.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:05, 12 January 2012 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' because I think the book should be deleted. Content is poor and likely of little interest to users. Votes for deletion should be based on your opinion of the book. Has Wikibooks really descended into the mess that Wikipedia has where everybody just quotes random policies instead of their views?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:36, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

&quot;I think the book should be deleted&quot; is not a reason, or it is the most generic reason there is, one that provides no basis for discussion and rational decision making.

== DTFT table ==

Hey Xania,

the DTFT table is wrong indeed.  The DTFT transfers into the periodic frequency domain.  The signals shown in the table are not periodic, and hence they are obviously wrong.  The table seems to list ordinary Fourier transforms for angular frequency, which coincidentally also uses the greek letter &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, although with a different meaning.  This confused the author who apparently copied the table from some book without understanding what he or she did.  I will not revert the page again, but I hope that it is eighter removed, or corrected.

== Wikijunior ==

Hello Xania,

Thank you for the welcome message! Just from the start, I have two questions:
* Are there any naming conventions for templates? If I make a template for Wikijunior, should it be in the Wikijunior namespace, and if I make a template for use only in a specific book (like [[Template:Small numbers/Table]] for [[Wikijunior:Small Numbers]]), should it have book title in its name? 
* I can't quite understand what is the current preferred method of adding new books to Wikijunior. On one hand, [[Wikijunior:New_Title_Policy]] says that the title with some description should be first submitted to [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions]]; but there's a big banner on that page saying &quot;Currently, the process of voting for new books is not used.&quot; So, does it mean that I can add any book I want, but only to [[Wikijunior/Non-Canonical_Books]]?? I am somewhat lost...

== Simple English Wikibooks ==

Hello. There seems to be a conflict of interest regarding the closure of Simple Wikibooks thats occuring right now. As we both know, the tally is at 45 yeas to 17 nos, the same as it was when the proposal for closure was finished. You voted after the discussion had been closed. I'm sorry but after the discussion is closed, no one else can vote. '''You are entitled to your opinions, but you cannot deliberately change the situation to satisfy what you want.''' You don't control Wikimedia and MediaWiki, only a community consensus can rule the outcome. You claimed that there was no consensus, however a 45-17 vote is a 72.5% support for closure, a firm consensus in most cases. I want to hear your side of your opinions so we can work this out. I always [[WB:AGF|assume good faith]] in other users, but saying ''&quot;allowing rabbits to vote for the slaughter of beetles&quot;'' isn't very constructive or civil. I'm sorry if you're not happy with the results, but what was done is done. Regards, [[User:Slipknot1|Slipknot1]] ([[User talk:Slipknot1|talk]]) 05:52, 16 January 2010 (UTC)

=== No consensus ===
:''The following discussion has been transfered from [[meta:User talk:Snake311|meta]] to a more appropriate talk page.''

You closed the vote on Simple English Wikibooks.  There is no consensus in this vote.  The vote hasn't been publicised on other Simple English projects and opinions against the closure have been ignored yet no further reasoning has been asked from those voting in support of the proposal.--[[User:Xania|Xania]] 23:47, 14 January 2010 (UTC)
:The other Simple English projects have been notified when the proposal was started. [http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Simple_talk&amp;diff=1611187&amp;oldid=1610919 See here,][http://simple.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:Simple_talk&amp;diff=82675&amp;oldid=82481 here,][http://simple.wikiquote.org/wiki/Wikiquote:Simple_talk/Archive_3#Simple_English_Wikibooks_proposed_closure and here.] Additionally many users who edit simple wikibooks are regulars in all the Simple english projects, and they are well aware of the proposal for closure. Some of the users who supported the project's closure are former or current admins/crats from simple wikibooks. If you are asking about consensus it seems pretty obvious. 45 users supported its closure, and 17 opposed. Mathematically that would be 72.5% in support. So the consensus would be leaning in favor for closing. Before I closed the discussion, two former admins of the project commented why the proposal has not been closed yet. I decided to make a bold move in good faith and did the honors for them. If you feel that you might want to discuss this with other users, you may voice your opinion in the comments section. Thanks, —[[Special:Emailuser/Snake311|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;§&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User:Snake311|stay]] ([[User talk:Snake311|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''sic'''&lt;/span&gt;]])! 01:10, 15 January 2010 (UTC)
:I voiced my opinion in the comments part of the vote page and then you reverted me stating 'discussion is closed'!!! Are you having a laugh?  In your post above (4 lines above) you clearly say to discuss this in the comments section yet when I did this you revert me!!  I have now reverted it back again.  Oh and consensus includes considering all opinions and not just the percentages.  People supporting a deletion of a project with the comment that &quot;it can always be restarted in the future&quot; when this is clearly not possible because Simple language will no longer be approved is a serious flaw in that persons vote for the project's deletion.--[[User:Xania|Xania]] 02:16, 19 January 2010 (UTC)
::First and foremost, that is not the comments section. That is the lead where the nominator explains his/her reasons for requesting closure. What you are looking for is [[meta:Proposals for closing projects/Closure of Simple English Wikibooks (3)#Comments|down here]]. LOL. Also your comments sounded more like a biased speech directed to a developer demanding not to close the project rather than providing reasonable explanations to why it shouldn't be closed. However since you deeply insist that it remain there, I'll leave it. The discussion is over and pretty much people have or will start to forget about it. I have monitored and watched that discussion progress since Day 1 it was opened and read all the supports and opposes there were. There is no doubt that the project will never be reopened once closed, but I'm afraid it is too late to change that. Just because you don't agree with someone's vote doesn't mean it is invalid (unless voting after the discussion has been finished). All registered users are allowed to vote. —[[Special:Emailuser/Slipknot1|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen&quot;&gt;§&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User:Slipknot1|&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple&quot;&gt;stay&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;big&gt;([[User talk:Slipknot1|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;'''sic'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/big&gt;! 09:47, 19 January 2010 (UTC)

== Your neutral vote for my stewardship ==

Hello Xania, and thanks for not opposing me so far. I just want you to know, I do not try to come out as one being able to speak many languages. As you can see from my [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stewards/elections_2010/statements/EivindJ&amp;diff=1819622&amp;oldid=1819620 original statement], I only mention &quot;no&quot; as a fluent language, and that &quot;no&quot; is mutually intelligble with &quot;da&quot; and &quot;sv&quot;. For some reason, they didn't want it to be written like that, so someone changed it later to &quot;no, da, sv&quot;. --[[User:EivindJ|EivindJ]] ([[User talk:EivindJ|talk]]) 08:34, 8 February 2010 (UTC)

== I bringing it here since the thread is huge ==
I request that you careful examine what is on the table, preserving the status quo would be worst that any change, even if I agree that the new features aren't a game changer, the softening of the impact of FlaggedRev would be beneficial.&lt;br&gt;
My initial position is that FlaggedRev should be dropped but since support for that idea wouldn't be sufficient the proposed change would address the most obvious problems.  In any case your stated position only holds a generalization not a specific reason for the objection.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:17, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

Since others have engaged you there on the same issue, please reply to them. We will not require a separated thread here...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:48, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

:I would like to second that. Your vote and your reason for the vote are irreconcilably opposite. The proposal lessens the emphasis on FlaggedRevs and paves the way for their removal. We may find the proposed configuration useful for fighting vandalism if editors and admins become a team, otherwise it will just fall by the wayside. So please change either your vote or your reason as they make no sense together. Thanks, cheers. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 01:44, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

::How would you like it if the next time you voted in a general election that some annoying person came along insisting that you change your vote?  Of course &quot;it's not a vote&quot;, etc., etc..  I voted oppose because I wanted to.  I am sick and tired of long-winded discussions which go on forever and end up being discussed by fewer and fewer people because others just can't be bothered any longer.  This is not how Wikibooks or any Wiki is supposed to be run.  Why aren't you trying to engage the readers rather than satisfying the needs of long-term, frequent editors?  I voted NO because I don't want any more discussions, no more undemocratic policies and because I refuse to be pressurized by a small minority who seem to think that they're in charge.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:25, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

:::I do think that things have changed. As for endless discussions there is nothing we can do about that, it is a requirement just to prevent an active minority decision, an attempt to compromise with fringe views must be made.&lt;s&gt; Please do look at the proposal and provide us a reason for the objection that we can work on.&lt;/s&gt;

== Muggles' Guide edit approvals ==

Hello, Xania. You may have seen me around, I'm one of the two main editors on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]].

Twice today I've found that you have approved edits in MG that should never have been approved. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Filius_Flitwick&amp;curid=55007&amp;diff=2169835&amp;oldid=2018754 This edit] answered a study question facetiously; we don't generally answer the study questions, which are left in order to foster thought in the readers, and this answer actually seems to suggest prejudice on the part of the book's characters. And [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Major_Events/Fred_Weasley%27s_Death&amp;curid=135901&amp;diff=2170063&amp;oldid=2151053 this edit] adds an ungrammatical question, totally unrelated to the page topic, and pointless to boot. You seem to have approved both of these edits. Is there a reason why? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:40, 19 September 2011 (UTC)

: I approve edits which are obviously not vandalism and check them for general grammar consistency.  I have no knowledge of Harry Potter whatsoever so any approved edits for that book are not in the context of that book and I'd expect those who contribute to the Muggles book to review edits more thoroughly.  The added questions of &quot;What's so bad about a death eater in Harry Potter?&quot; appeared to be grammatically correct on first sight especially as I have no idea what a death eater is.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:19, 20 September 2011 (UTC)

::Noted. I am not sure I agree with your policy of re-approving at the previous level, e.g. inserting a sentence with no capitalization (not &quot;What's so bad about a death eater in Harry Potter?&quot; but &quot;whats so bad about a death eater in harry potter?&quot;) into a previously &quot;good&quot; article does not necessarily leave the article at &quot;good,&quot; and it might be more appropriate to re-approve the article at the &quot;minimal&quot; level to assist other editors in tracking such changes. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:49, 20 September 2011 (UTC)
:::I DID approve the article at ''minimum'' level.  I very rarely rate anything other than minimum because I don't have the time to go through articles in enough detail.  If a page was previously rated as 'good' and then rated as 'minimum' I'm not sure what affect that has.

::::It's curious, then, that when I looked at it, it was at Good level. In my experience, if you simply approve the edit, it comes in at the same level it was before, but you do have the option to demote it as you review it, and you can re-review it later, which results in, apparently, the earlier review being lost to history, both as to what it was and who so reviewed it.
::::Harry Potter is a well-written heroic fantasy piece with a good wizard (Harry) pitted against an evil wizard (Voldemort) who is trying to take over the British, and eventually worldwide, Wizard population. Death Eaters are the cadre of wizards that Voldemort has recruited to assist him. Their strategy for world domination apparently involves murdering those who oppose them and any innocents, including non-magic-users (Muggles) who are nearby. While it is, nominally, a children's book, there is certainly enough depth in it to make it worth reading as an adult, and enough to make it worth teaching in at least a few universities, as noted in the RfDs that have been survived. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:09, 20 September 2011 (UTC)
:::::Thanks for that.  I was aware of the use of Harry Potter texts in schools and universities but just curious about something known as the death eater.  Anyway, I hadn't noticed that the default for pages previously rated as 'good' was 'good'.  I'll have to keep my eye out for that in future.  I have rated some things as 'good' but very few (probably only 5% of what I rate) however it may be more than 5% if those that were previously 'good' are rated as 'good' by default when successive edits are made.  Can't understand why HP would ever have been nominated for RfD - even if someone felt it wasn't suitable for schools or universities wouldn't make it a candidate for deletion.
::::::Apparently some people believed that the MG was copyvio; others believed it was not something that would be taught at university, because it was (shudder) popular. People have lost sight of the fact that Charles Dickens, in his day, was a popular writer, as was Shakespeare. And of course, some people felt that because it was a kid's book, it could not possibly have enough depth to make it worth study. At least, that's how I read the arguments in the two real RfD's to date. At least one additional RfD was posted by a vandal, with no supporting information, and was promptly eliminated by an admin.
::::::One of the big things about Voldemort (''fly from death'') is his fear of dying, and so everything he involves himself with has to somehow try to ridicule that fear... like whistling in the dark to prove you're not afraid. The name Voldemort gives his supporters is part of that pattern. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:12, 20 September 2011 (UTC)

== WCI 2011 Proposal :Accelerating Wikibooks. Help Needed! ==

Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thewinster|contribs]]) 08:05, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
=== Summary of the proposal ===

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]

OK, I began to write the book on the wrong place, Wikibooks instead of Wikilibros. But I can hardly believe that there exists any need at all of to delete it in a few hours, which even happen to be night hours in Spain. I could have been warned and allowed some time in order to move my text to the new site, instead of seeing it deleted after hours of work. I would say this is simply BUREAUCRATIC VANDALISM.

Does Jamaica have provinces (and by extension provencial flags)?  That could have been a legitimate edit, but more explanation by the anon would have been better.

:OK, I cleared it up.  In case you're wondering why there was a list of graphics there in the first place, it's a little complicated.  This honor has the same requirements for all countries, but each country has different answers.  I had set up a template a while back, which was intended to be &quot;subst&quot; in when starting an answer page for a new country.  It has all the requirements on it and a little formatting to suggest how the answers might be structured.  The thought that a country might not have states or provinces did not occur to me when I set up the subst template.  Oh well.  I imagine it also did not occur to the people who came up with the requirements in the first place either. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 13:51, 6 November 2011 (UTC)

Hello Xania, just wanted to say thank you for transwiking [[Canadian LGBT History]] for me.

I would like to ask your advice on an idea I've had recently. Would it be advisable to create a Project for wikibooks entitled &quot;Winter Break Backlog Elimination Drive&quot; or something of the sort? It could be in the same vein as [[w:WikiProject_Wikify/Drives/Invite|Wikification Drives]] on wikipedia. Basically, over the break I've been hoping to tackle the backlogs on wikibooks, specifically the transwikis, splitting, and stubs. I recognize that I won't make significant progress alone and therefore I was hoping to enlist others to help. It might foster a sense of community, or it might fail spectacularly.

== Acidity of alcohols and water. ==

Dear Xania
I add this topic to point out to you to have a check on your review of the edit http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Organic_Chemistry/Alcohols&amp;oldid=2199272.
That edit was on the article [[Organic Chemistry/Alcohols]] in section [[Organic_Chemistry/Alcohols#Acidity]] which deleted &lt;tt&gt;Alcohols are weak acids, even weaker than water&lt;/tt&gt; from the article saying ''water is not an acid''. However it should be noted that the term acidity is based on the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion dissociated in a particular amount of solutions. The term p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is used for comparison.

You can refer to the 'pedia article [[wikipedia:Acidity#Dissociation_and_equilibrium|Acidity]].

The statement is very clear from NCERT chemistry text book for class XII 
[http://ncertbooks.prashanthellina.com/class_12.Chemistry.ChemistryII/Unit 11.pdf]

&lt;tt&gt;Alcohols are, however, weaker acids than water. This can be
illustrated by the reaction of water with an alkoxide.&lt;tt&gt;

Thank You&lt;/br&gt;

== Reviewer ==
I'm putting this here because it is more private and Quintucket does not dissever to get dragged into the high visibility discussion about more generic issues.  
The issue of this particular attribution of the flag is not the main issue, the issue is why you and the user felt that the automation was not sufficient, as for the user he justified it on the aesthetic level, to me that simply is not a good enough reason, any Wikibookian with 8 days presence on the project can make a similar claim. I accepted even if I stated that I did not like and the reasons why, the special treatment you felt that this particular user should be granted, an exception to a normal and not particular hard process.&lt;br&gt;
To me the issue is closed since I will not propose a change to the automatic criteria, not the establishing of a guideline or policy for the attribution of the flag. I do however feel that the points I raised are important and would support anyone that would feel a need to get one of those things more clearly established, as I stated I have a high distaste about special treatments by arbitrary decisions, you have been in the project long enough to understand why and why they are problematic. They undermine future decisions...&lt;br&gt;
I have all faith in Quintucket performance and the call for respecting the automatic process has nothing to do with the Wikibookian.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:48, 1 January 2012 (UTC)
: If you look at my rights change log then you'll see that it wasn't special treatment.  Many users have requested it and I have granted it.  You will see that I don't just grant all requests as I expect them to have quite a few constructive edits, not just 2 days of edits (you'll see that the guys whose requests I opposed on the RFA pages haven't really edited since) and that they're not just making silly edits trying to increase their edit count.  I have also promoted some users even if they haven't requested it.  I am waiting to see what others Admins think.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:50, 1 January 2012 (UTC)

::I do not think anyone will get to take any positions on the subject since it is a done deal, and by itself it wouldn't even merit further discussion, unless by some unfortunate reason Quintucket abused the tool in some way. However this attribution of the flag, will establish a precedent for further requests of the tools and jeopardizes the rational in establishing the standing requirements, that is why I'm attempting to explain my point of view to you, when other intentionally or not remain silent. I have not been very actively involved in establishing the automation process itself, did participate in the vote for the activation of the review system (starting from a negative position to a non blocking), I preferred the previous system of reviewing edits and the log the showed pages that had not been paroled.
::I hope that you consider the points I have expressed especially in directing any opposition you may have to the standing requirements to a proper discussion, if you feel like and not to bypass the process in a, if not discriminatory way as a unnecessary fashion since any Wikibookian that continuously participates in the project will get the flag automatically and by accepting minor reasons to bypass the process we incentive the feel of personal discrimination, or an arbitrary judgment of value, even if it is not intended, you can understand that any negative result may have by itself a negative impact on the person making the request.
::One thing that I appreciate in your actions in the project is that you tend to think by yourself (and not necessary in line with the conventions and the supposedly majority view) and at times be able to take more controversial positions. In this case I'm only pointing to you that if a process is established only a good reason, enough to supersede the negative impacts would validate the creation of spot exceptions, that if those exceptions become common then the problem is in the process itself.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:25, 1 January 2012 (UTC)

== Wikijunior geography books ==

Hello, I notice that you are a major contributor to the Wikijunior geography books such as Wikijunior:Europe, Wikijunior:Africa, etc. I feel that books of this form could benefit from a unifying page, a page that would serve as a title page for the books and would include links to each of them. It could even have a labelled maps of the continents with links such as I have done on [[Wikijunior:Countries A-Z]]. This page could possibly be titled [[Wikijunior:Geography]], though I realize that these books also include culture and things that are not exclusively geographical, so possibly another name would be in order. What is your opinion on this? - [[User:Liam987|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;border:1px solid;background:#0055A4;text-shadow:0 5px 8px #850000&quot;&gt;'''Liam987'''&lt;/span&gt;]] 13:51, 13 March 2013 (UTC)

== [[Physics course]], [[Physics Course]] and other books ==

About a year ago, and on and off before that, we had a mass copy / paste vandalism in these books as well as a number of others in the electronics field. I put these up for RfD and the RfD was supported along with agreement that the author should be blocked if they continued to engage in the copy / paste activity. Despite numerous attempts to engage them via email and talk pages (they use two fixed IPs and three accounts) all communication was ignored. This resulted in repeated blocks, each longer than before. At the end of each block they would come back and start the copyvios again. All we were asking for was confirmation of the source so we could verify the copyright status - but every time we were ignored. Anyway, the last year long block expired last month and the vandal is back. I removed all the additions they made to [[Physics Course]] which had the same characteristics as before - clearly copy / paste with no attribution, blocked the IP again and protected the book to stop IPs editing. Their next action was to create [[Physics course]] from another IP to get round the block and the protection. It is again full of copy / paste material. I've nuked it, and protected it. Why am I telling you? To explain my actions as I see you have also tried to get the IP editor to engage in a conversation via their talk page &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:31, 28 March 2013 (UTC)
::You probably remember it all as you were involved in the discussion [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Multiple Books Created from Wikipedia Without Attribution]].

There are 2 ways for people to contact you on Wikibooks:
# They can write a message on your [[User talk:Isparetime|Talk Page]].  Usually if someone leaves you a message you will get an orange banner at the top of the screen next time you log in (or open a Wikibooks page while logged in).  If you have set up your Wikibooks account with your email address (see: [[Special:Preferences]]) you often also receive an email when someone leaves a message on your Talk Page.
# The other way is for someone to send you an email directly from Wikibooks to your personal email.  This will only be possible if you have set up a registered email address (mentioned above).

Hi Xania &lt;/BR&gt;

What about a program that can convert imperial to metric units and vice versa.&lt;/BR&gt;

--[[User:Jangirke|Jangirke]] ([[User talk:Jangirke|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jangirke|contribs]]) 21:17, 31 March 2013 (UTC)
:I'd argue against. A program will, because of the nature of computers, be precise; humans, not so much. A cup of milk should translate to 250ml; a computer program will translate it to 243ml, and I have yet to see a measuring cup in a kitchen that can measure to that precision. Also, some human interaction is really required to adjust everything so that proportions remain valid. At least one recipe book I've seen explicitly states that English units are used because the proportions involved are critical, and precise enough that translation to Metric would wreck the recipes.

::''English units''?  American units maybe but most British people would be more familiar with metric units than imperial ones and would find them less confusing especially given the different values of pints, quarts, etc. on different sides of the Atlantic.  Anyway, I agree with the above that automated conversion wouldn't be a great idea.  No automation would handle the infamous American ''cup'' whose value could mean anything depending on what's inside the cup.  Human conversion or insisting that only metric is used is the way forward.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:13, 1 April 2013 (UTC)
:::I was quoting from the book. But yes, despite the fact that only the US and Liberia have refused to standardize on SI units, the feet / pounds / degrees F system is called &quot;English units&quot;, or worse &quot;Imperial&quot;... which becomes even more confusing when you look into it a bit and see that a US gallon is not the same as a British gallon.

== Could I ask you this ? ==

Thank you for checking my article. 

I'm doing AvsA v2.0 which has a lot differences from v1.0; so I would like to re-update the current Allies vs. Axis as the guide for v2.0 but still want to keep v1.0 guide somewhere for reference. 

a) I create Allies vs. Axis_v1.0 and copy current page (v1.0) to that one and rewrite current page to v2.0

b) I re-update current page to v2.0 and leave the v1.0 inside it, which makes it becomes very long page.

c) I re-update current page to v2.0 and delete v1.0. I don't really want this option.

What should I do ? What option is easy for people to check &amp; people (who need it) to follow ? Please advice. Thank you very much.

==Implementing Easier and More Efficient Metadata Tags on Wikibooks==
Hi Xania,  

I wanted to give you an update on the previously discussed implementation of LRMI metatags on Wikibooks.  There is no longer the need to use the html tag extension as was discussed in the previous proposal, because it is now supported by core mediawiki. In addition, these changes sanction all mediawiki installations by default and increase the assurance of LRMI as a long-term standard.  If you're not familiar with  [http://schema.org/CreativeWork Schema.org], it is a shared collection of standard schemas that was developed by Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex to allow webmasters to markup their pages in ways recognized by major search providers.
[http://wikisource-dev.wmflabs.org/w/index.php/CreativeWork This] page demonstrates these features in the context of wikisource and can demonstrate the optimization within a Google search engine [http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwikisource-dev.wmflabs.org%2Fw%2Findex.php%2FMicrodata here].

To understand this implementation in simpler terms, all that would have to be done is for contributors of Wikibooks (and other educational resources) to use the Schema metatags which are already the most widely used and efficient way for content to be accurately organized by all of the big search engines.  With this said, let me know if you think it would be worthwhile to implement these metatags now that it will be done via Schema.org, or if you have further questions.

;Purpose
This template provides compatible formatting to duplicate the appearance of the monospace tables the N3V staff used when building pages for Kinds, containers and so forth. Using this template to set the style allows a wikitable to neaten up the staffs ragged efforts, and make things more readable.

;usage
*This template is meant to be used in an HTML style tag after the &lt;code&gt;'''&amp;lt;''' '...' ''' &amp;gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; so as to form HTML format commands like:
&lt;code&gt;'''{| style= &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Pseudo-table}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''&lt;/code&gt; and forms the pre-quoted string above. The raw code has over-ride parameters B,BG,CO,MW,W,P,M
&lt;pre&gt;
&quot;padding: {{{P|1em}}}; border: {{{B|1px dashed rgb(47, 111, 171)}}};color: {{{CO|black}}};
 background:{{{BG|rgb(249, 249, 249)}}}; max-width:{{{MW|{{{width|68%}}}}}};
 width:{{{W|{{{width|68%}}}}}}; align:{{{AL|left}}}; font-face:{{{F|monospace}}};
 font-size:{{{S|10pt}}}; {{{other|}}};&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
* The default width is shown above, but the template call can be given an alternative width as follows:
::form the call: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{| style={{pseudo-table|width=XX%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; '''''versus the default''''' &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{| style={{pseudo-table}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
* The format also provides for other format parameters to be included in the style block by defining the parameter ''''other''''.
** for example: '''|other=color:blue; would assert the table contents as a blue font. Other HTML/CSS formatting elements are equally valid.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
;for other examples...

;Purpose
:This template is used with {{Tl|TRScc-top}} to set off Wiki How-To {{TL|Content Creation}} pages, especially those on advanced topics where {{tl|FUN-beg}} (or -top) would be inappropriate.

* It will also auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz Content Creation]].
:* The parameter '|TA=yes' definition will cross-categorize the page as well in the Trainz Asset Management and Creation [[:category:Trainz AM&amp;C]].&lt;br
/&gt;
:* defining the parameter '|refs2=''something&lt;/i&gt;' will add the page to [[:Category:Trainz references]].&lt;br
/&gt;
* It can be given the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; default parameter to alter the sort order of the reference page as listed in that category.

* Lastly, this template closes a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot; ...&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; HTML block initiated by {{Tl|ORP-top}}. They should be used together as a pair top and bottom of each page.
 
'''Example:'''

'''''Eryx jaculus''''', known commonly as the '''Javelin sand boa''', is a species of snake in the [[Snakes of Europe/Species/Boidae|Boidae]] family.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITIS&quot;&gt;{{ITIS |id=634806 |taxon=''Eryx'' |accessdate=August 16th, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDiarmid, Roy W., Jonathan A. Campbell, and T'Shaka A. Touré, 1999. ''Snake Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference, vol. 1''&lt;/ref&gt; First described by Linnaeus in 1758, it is the type species of the genus ''[[Snakes of Europe/Species/Eryx|Eryx]]''.

[[File:Eryx jaculus.jpg|thumbnail|Eryx jaculus, the Sand Boa]]

==Geographic range==
''Eryx jaculus'' is found in eastern and south eastern Europe, the Caucasus, the Middle East, and Africa.

==Description==
The javelin sand boa may grow to 80&amp;nbsp;cm (31½ inches) in total length. Coloring varies greatly. Dorsally it may be grayish, tan, brownish, or reddish, with darker blotches or bars in an irregular network. It usually has a dark streak from the eye to the corner of the mouth. Ventrally it is whitish or yellowish. It is heavy-bodied and has a short blunt tail. The ventrals are very narrow, less than ⅓ of the width of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, E.N. and J.A. Burton. 1978. ''A Field Guide to the Reptiles and Amphibians of Britain and Europe''. Collins. London. ISBN 0-00-219318-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The rostral is large and broad with an angular horizontal edge. The eye is separated from the labials by one or two rows of small scales. There are 10-14 upper labials. The dorsal scales are in 40-50 rows, smooth anteriorly, but weakly keeled posteriorly. There are 165-200 ventrals, and 15-34 subcaudals.&lt;ref&gt;Boulenger, G.A. 1893. ''Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History), Volume I''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;
