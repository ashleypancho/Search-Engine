      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

Many commercial vegetarian ground beef replacements are sold. They all probably taste better than this recipe, but this one has the advantage of customization, and is also (nearly?) gluten-free. You always know exactly what goes into what you cook yourself.

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]]s wheat-free low-sodium [[Cookbook:tamari|tamari]]&lt;ref name=&quot;tamari&quot;&gt;I find regular soy sauce or even tamari to be too salty in the end. Wheat-free is only needed if a gluten-free result is desired.&lt;/ref&gt;
*¼ [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:yeast extract|yeast extract]]&lt;ref name=&quot;yeast_extract&quot;&gt;Some vendors sell products containing a significant amount of yeast extract (such as rice cakes with yeast extract) as gluten-free; [http://www.gicare.com/pated/edtgs06.htm this source] recommends avoiding yeast extract as containing barley. If you want to avoid the yeast extract, you might try increasing the amount of mushroom powder and beet juice.&lt;/ref&gt;
*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:beet|beet]] juice (for example, from canned beets)
*¼ powdered [[Cookbook:Mushroom#Shiitake|shiitake mushroom]] (see [[#Procedure|procedure]])
*¼ [[Cookbook:onion powder|onion powder]]
*4 [[Cookbook:ounce|ounce]]s (110g) extra-firm [[Cookbook:tofu|tofu]]

==Procedure==
All ingredient amounts are approximate.

Make mushroom powder by grinding dried shitake mushroom with a mortar and pestle until no large pieces remain (this takes some time, as the dried mushroom is slightly &quot;leathery&quot;). ¼ teaspoon is around a fifth of a small cap.

Make the [[Cookbook:marinade|marinade]] by mixing together all the seasonings in a small mixing bowl, making sure the mushroom powder and yeast extract is evenly incorporated with no lumps. Drain the tofu, pressing it to get rid of as much moisture as possible. Combine with tofu, crushing the tofu into small pieces and allowing to absorb the liquid evenly. I find that placing the tofu in a zip-top bag, pouring the marinade over it, sealing it, and then crushing the tofu with the fingers works well. You want no pieces of tofu larger than a fingernail.

Allow sufficient time for the marinade to soak completely into the tofu, such as several hours or overnight.

Heat a medium non-stick skillet over medium heat. Using a small amount of [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]]--just enough to coat the cooking surface--[[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] the tofu, browning it to a golden color. Between the marinade and heat, it will achieve a medium-brown, but won't achieve the deep brown of ground beef or commercial ground beef substitute.

Once the tofu is browned, it will still be quite soft. You can improve its texture by spreading it out in the hot pan and allowing it to cool for some time.

Store the ground tofu in the refrigerator. It can be reheated by heating it through in a skillet in whatever application you desire. It can be used as a filling for [[Cookbook:taco|tacos]], sloppy joes, meat sauces for [[Cookbook:pasta|pasta]], and the like.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Substance Abuse

==Phenomenology==

There are a number of syndromes and disorders associated with the general concept of substance abuse.  Some of the most common are:  

*'''Intoxication.'''  A reversible, substance-specific physiological and behavioral changes due to recent exposure to a psychoactive substance. 

*'''Addiction.''' A compulsion to use a drug, usually for its psychic, rather than therapeutic, effects.

*'''Tolerance.'''  The decline in potency of a drug experienced with continued use, so that higher doses are needed to achieve the same effect.  This is a receptor-mediated effect, typical of many psychoactive drugs. 

*'''Physical Dependence.'''  The development of withdrawal symptoms once a drug is stopped. 

*'''Withdrawal.'''  A physiological state that follows cessation or reduction in the amount of a drug used.  Generally, these effects are the opposite of the drug’s normal effects. 

*'''Substance Dependence.'''  In the [[w:Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)]], this is “a maladaptive pattern of substance use with adverse clinical consequences.”  

*'''Substance Abuse.'''  According to [[w:Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| DSM-IV]], this is “a maladaptive pattern of use that causes clinically significant impairment.”   Symptoms of substance abuse have not met the criteria for substance dependence and do not include tolerance and withdrawal (which can, but do not have to be, features of substance dependence).  

*'''Alcohol intoxication.'''  This refers to the physiological and behavioral response to alcohol use that includes disinhibition, emotional lability, impaired coordination, slurred speech, ataxia, coma, and/or blackouts.

*'''Alcohol withdrawal.'''  This is the physiological state that results following cessation of alcohol use; it may be uncomplicated (causing tremulousness, anxiety, and/or increased heart rate) or cause potentially serious complications such as seizures and/or delirium tremens (all of which are discussed further below).

*'''Alcoholism.'''  Though not in [[w:Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| DSM-IV]] (where the term “alcohol dependence” would be used) is remains commonly used by medical clinicians and substance abuse experts.  It can be defined as a repetitive, but inconsistent and sometimes unpredictable loss of control of drinking which produces symptoms of serious dysfunction or disability.

==Epidemiology==
Use of psychoactive substances is common in society, and is often socially acceptable, or at least tolerated.  Historically, psychoactive substances have served a variety of purposes, including medicinal, social, recreational and religious. In the US, 90% of people report some alcohol use, 80% report some caffeine use, 25% report use of tobacco products, and 37% report having used illicit substances (at least once in their lives).  Dependence and Abuse are also very common (13.6% in ECA).  

===Alcohol===

Over 10 million Americans are alcoholics; over 8 million are &quot;problem drinkers.&quot;  Only 3% of alcoholics are on skid row.  Alcoholism is reportedly more common in rural areas and in the undereducated.  It is more common in males than females, and more common in adults than teens/kids.  However, teenage alcoholism studies show that 15% of high school students are reported to have 5 or more drinks per occasion at least once a week, and 31% of high school students were intoxicated 6 or more times in the past year.

Social/economic factors are considerable in that people in low socioeconomic status are less likely to drink, but more likely to misuse if they do.  Drinking is associated with unstable work and family circumstances.  Additionally, one should not forget the effect of substance abuse on families.  Forty three percent of US adults report exposure to alcoholism in their families.  Divorced or separated adults are 3 times as likely as married persons to report having been married to an alcoholic or problem drinker.  Additionally, the cost to society is of great importance; alcohol-related deaths are the third leading cause of death in the US, after cancer and heart disease.  There are 98,000 alcohol-related deaths per year.  Furthermore, it is estimated that the medical complications and associated disability from alcohol abuse costs society $86 billion (along with $58 billion in costs from other substances).  Alcoholism is also a major cause of other medical illnesses and injuries.  Alcohol may be involved in 20-50% of hospital admissions, though these often go unrecognized.  It contributes to 18-20% of ER visits, causes 80% of liver cirrhosis, and 33% of suicides are alcohol-related.

Cultural differences are also apparent in that alcoholism rates vary in different countries.  Countries with high rates include Russia, France, Scandinavia, Ireland, and Korea.  Those with low rates include China, Islamic countries, and Mediterranean countries

===Other Substances===
The lifetime prevalence of abuse for substances other than alcohol is as follows:
*Amphetamines:  2%
*Cannabis:  4%
*Cocaine 0.2% (1981 data, probably higher now)
*Hallucinogens:  0.3%
*Opioids:  0.7%
*Sedative hypnotics:  1.1%


==Etiology==

===The reward pathway and addiction===

There is considerable research interest in the notion of a common “reward pathway” in the human brain that may be responsible for the pleasurable feelings experienced by humans in response to both natural stimuli (i.e. food, water, sex) and artificial (i.e. drugs). The major structures of this postulated reward pathway include the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the nucleus accumbens, and the prefrontal cortex.  The VTA consists of dopamine-containing neurons that project to both the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex.  Thus, it is believed that dopamine has a considerable role in addiction, and indeed, a number of illicit drugs cause increased release of dopamine at these synapses.  The most recent research indicates that the reward pathway may be important in both obtaining a reward, and in the associated craving.  Opioids, cocaine, and nicotine have been shown to potentiate dopamine release in the reward pathway, and alcohol has been shown activate this pathway indirectly through potentiation of neural activity in the globus pallidus (which in turn connects to components of the reward pathway).   

Patterns of cigarette smoking provide an interesting perspective on addiction.  It is believed that smokers work, consciously or unconsciously, to maintain blood nicotine levels within the “therapeutic window” by a process referred to as nicotine regulation.  For example, the smoker can manipulate the dose of nicotine on a puff-by-puff basis (“finger tip control”).  Evidence for this comes from studies of low tar, low nicotine cigarettes.  Research has convincingly demonstrated that smokers will compensate for low nicotine yields by smoking more effectively—blocking filter holes to prevent ventilation of smoke; smoking more of the cigarette; inhaling more rapidly and deeply; and smoking a larger total number of cigarettes.  

The route of delivery also has implications for addictive potential.  For example, with cocaine use, smoking the drug causes an increased rate of its delivery to the brain compared to snorting; hence the greater addictive potential of freebase and crack in patients with cocaine dependence.  For nicotine, compared to other forms of its administration, cigarettes offer the most efficient delivery and the fastest spike in blood nicotine levels. Likewise, the subjective effects of smoking a cigarette are greater than the subjective effects after nicotine exposure to the nicotine gum or transdermal patch (types of nicotine replacement therapy to be discussed later).  
 
===Alcoholism and genetics===

While 51% of cases of alcoholism are non-familial, genetics has been well established in alcoholism, particularly among young male alcoholics.  Any drinking carries with it a 5-10% risk of becoming alcoholic.  For children of alcoholics, having one parent with alcoholism is associated with a 20% risk of alcoholism in the child.  With two parents, the risk is 20-50%.  Sons of father are at greater risk, at 50%.  If the father is a severe alcoholic and criminal, there is a 90% risk in his son. Children of alcoholics are also at risk for other substance use disorders.  

Adoption studies and twin studies have shown that alcoholism concordance among identical twins is twice that of fraternal.  The Danish Adoption Study (1974), in which adopted sons of alcoholics were raised by non-alcoholic foster parents, showed that these children still had increased risk of alcoholism.

Sons of alcoholics show a number of physiological abnormalities, including abnormal EEG's associated with drinking compared with normal subjects and other abnormal brain wave studies (such as evoked potentials).  In addition, there exist abnormal hormonal response patterns in sons of alcoholics.

Some genetic differences may relate to inherited variations in the rate of metabolism.  For example, decreased gastric oxidation of alcohol in women causes a higher blood alcohol level (BAL) in woman than in men.  There has also been report of an association with a mutation on the D2 dopamine receptor gene on chromosome 11.  This likely acts not as &quot;causer,&quot; but rather a modifier. 

===Pathology===

Psychoactive effects relate to the direct effect of drug on receptors in the central nervous system.  Thus, it is important to understand the pharmacokinetics of a drug: its routes of administration, absorption, metabolism, binding capacity, and excretion.  Receptors have been identified for a number of substances—caffeine and cannabis, for example.  Others substances act more nonspecifically—alcohol and inhalants, for example, act by dissolving into cell membranes, particularly in the central nervous system.

Pharmacodynamics:  the following substances are listed with their receptors:
*Caffeine: adenosine 
*Cannabis: THC receptor
*Hallucinogens: serotonin, NMDA
*Nicotine: nicotinic cholinergic receptors
*Opioids: opioid receptors
*Phencyclidine: NMDA 
*Sedatives: chloride channel (GABA receptor)

===Alcohol===
Alcohol is generally thought to act by dissolving into cell membranes, specifically in the central nervous system.  There is also some evidence that alcohol may potentiate the effects at neural synapses with GABAA receptors, similar to drugs such as benzodiazepines.  Compared to benzodiazepines and other similar sedative drugs, however, alcohol use requires higher blood concentrations to achieve a comparable level of intoxication.  Blood alcohol levels represent the concentration of alcohol in the blood and are typically measured in acutely intoxicated patients presenting for medical care (such as in emergency departments).  The rate of increase in BAL is inversely related to the rate of gastric emptying; hence the reason for not drinking on an empty stomach.  About 90% of patients with a BAL greater than 0.15% will show gross intoxication (with symptoms involving speech and gait), loss of consciousness can occur at 0.30%, and respiratory depression may be seen at about 0.45% (potentially resulting in death).  Other acute effects of alcohol at the cellular level include ADH antagonism (the “happy hour diuresis”), potentiation of gastric acid secretion (increasing the risk for gastritis), increased peripheral vasodilation and flushing (a centrally-mediated effect), and increased levels of HDL, triglycerides, and uric acid.

Alcohol metabolism follows zero-order kinetics, meaning that a constant amount of the substance is metabolized per unit of time.  The steps involved in hepatic alcohol metabolism are as follows:

Ethanol  acetaldehyde  acetate

The enzymes involved in this reaction are alcohol dehydrogenase (1st step) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (2nd step).  As noted above, in women the rate of activity of alcohol dehydrogenase is lower, thus causing increased BAL levels.  Alcohol metabolism can also be modified by hepatic microsomal enzymes that use NADPH.  Acutely, alcohol use can inhibit hepatic p450 enzymes, thus transiently increasing the levels of concurrently taken drugs such as diazepam.  With chronic use, however, alcohol can induce hepatic p450 enzymes, thus causing an increase in its own metabolism along with other drugs eliminated by this route.  This may provide one cellular-based mechanism of tolerance that occurs with long-term users.

===Cocaine===

Cocaine acts in the brain by inhibiting catecholamine reuptake, thus increasing the availability of DA and NE in the synaptic cleft.  As described above, the potentiation of DA activity in regions of the brain such as the nucleus accumbens may be responsible for cocaine’s addictive properties as well as its euphoriant effects.  Dopaminergic activity is thought to also underlie the hallucinations (often tactile) sometimes seen during cocaine intoxication.  Additionally, increased NE activity in the brain may cause symptoms of psychomotor agitation, including stereotypic or repetitive behaviors such as pacing, nail-biting, and scratching.  This may be related to the binding of cocaine in areas such as the caudate nucleus.  In addition, cocaine has peripheral effects on the body, augmenting sympathetic nervous system activity and causing tachycardia, pupillary dilation, and hypertension.  Cocaine-mediated vasoconstriction can also produce angina, and in rarer instances, sudden cardiac death.  Note that the effects of other substances on the body, particularly amphetamines, can mimic cocaine intoxication.  Amphetamines enhance the release of NE and DA from the axon terminal, thus working similar to cocaine by increasing their availability in the synaptic cleft.

===Nicotine===

Receptors:  Nicotine in tobacco exerts its actions on physiology and behavior by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), ion-gated channels that are normally responsive to endogenous acetylcholine.  These receptors are found in the central nervous system and in the periphery (ANS, neuromuscular junction), and they are all involved in the physiological responses to tobacco.  Each class of receptors generally contains different subunits, and experiments using gene knockout mice have indicated that certain subunits are specifically implicated in nicotine dependence.  In time, this information may help to understand individual differences in response to nicotine and therefore nicotine dependence (e.g., those smokers with more or less of the specific nicotinic receptors), and it might help in tailoring new pharmacologic treatments which specifically target these receptors (e.g., by blocking or antagonizing their function, making nicotine less reinforcing).

It is also important to understand the dynamics of receptor function in relation to smoking and blood/brain nicotine levels. Neuroreceptors can become more sensitive for various reasons and they can also proliferate, both of which can be referred to as upregulation. Typically, one observes upregulation of receptors as a compensatory response to low levels of a neurotransmitter. Downregulation refers to the opposite, reduced sensitivity or fewer receptors, which in turn serves to compensate for excess levels of a neurotransmitter. 

In the case of nicotinic receptors, the story is a little more complicated, and can be explained as follows: upon smoking a cigarette, a small pulse of nicotine activates nAChRs that directly or indirectly induce dopamine release, thus providing a pleasurable effect.  With continued use, nicotine builds up to a slow steady-state concentration that causes significant nAChR desensitization and, over time, inactivation.  There is evidence that nicotinic receptor turnover decreases following inactivation, leading to an increased number of nAChRs. In between cigarettes, during sleep, or under conditions of abstinence while attempting to stop smoking, nicotine levels drop and a portion of the inactive nAChRs recover to a responsive state. Because of the increased number of nAChRs that have now become responsive, some cholinergic systems become hyperexcitable to acetylcholine, contributing to the drive for the next cigarette. Thus, smokers may medicate themselves with nicotine to regulate the number of functional nAChRs. Note that this is still only a theoretical model, but it explains the powerful reinforcement experienced when smoking after a period of abstinence, even overnight. Understanding receptor function can also explain the rapid development of tolerance to nicotine’s effects, which would drive continued smoking.

Effects on the body:  The effects of nicotine on the body are widespread.  In the CNS, nicotine causes direct activation of ACh receptors, which when activated in regions such as the hippocampus can improve short-term memory and cognition/attention.  Additionally, via activation of ACh receptors, nicotine can potentiate the release of dopamine (promoting its addictive properties, as described above), NE (promoting stimulation and arousal), and endogenous opioids (promoting stress-reducing and analgesic effects).  There is also evidence that a component of tobacco (not nicotine) may inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO), which normally breaks down neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.  Peripheral effects of nicotine are considerable and include increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, vasoconstriction, increased metabolic rate and lipolysis, skeletal muscle relaxation, and increased ACTH release and adrenal steroid production.  Nicotine is rapidly cleared from the brain, and has a short half-life in the blood (with p450 liver metabolism to cotinine, the active metabolite), both which are factors that could partially account for the need for constant dosing.
 
==Diagnosis==

Classes of psychoactive substances recognized in DSM-IV include alcohol, amphetamines and related drugs, caffeine, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, nicotine, opioids, phencyclidine and related drugs, and sedatives.  Polysubstance abuse occurs in which three or more categories of drug are abused (not including nicotine).  Other drugs of abuse can include steroids, nitrates, and anticholinergics, to name a few.  The criteria for diagnosis are as follows: 

===Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) Definitions=== 

DSM-IV defined Substance Dependence is a maladaptive pattern of substance use.  Criteria for diagnosis include three of following over a 1 year period:
*Tolerance
*Withdrawal
*Use in larger amounts than intended
*Persistent desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down
*Time spent in activities necessary to get substance, taking substance or recovering from its effects.
*Social, occupational or recreational activities given up as a result of the substance
*Continued substance use despite knowledge of having a problem

Note that these patients don't need to have physical dependence.  The definition of substance dependence is basically equivalent to &quot;addiction,&quot; which is not used in DSM.

DSM-IV Substance Abuse is a maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to impairment.  Criteria include one or more of following over 12 months:

*recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill role obligations (work, school, home)
*hazardous use (driving while intoxicated)
*related legal problems
*continued use despite persistent problems relating to the substance

It is important in the case of substance abuse to rule out substance dependence (which takes precedence).

DSM-IV Substance Intoxication is a reversible substance-specific syndrome due to recent exposure to a substance.  Maladaptive behaviors or psychological changes can develop due to the substance and are not due to another medical/mental condition.

DSM-IV Substance Withdrawal is a substance-specific syndrome due to cessation or reduction in substance use that has been heavy and prolonged.  Withdrawal causes distress/impairment, and is not due to another medical/mental condition.


===Alcohol===

Aside from classification according to DSM-IV criteria, other schemas of substance use/abuse exist as well.  One such schema includes alcohol patterns.  The so-called &quot;alpha&quot; pattern is one of continual excessive use when under stress, with no dependence and no loss of control.  The &quot;beta&quot; pattern is one of heavy social drinking with physical complications, such as cirrhosis, but no dependence.  The &quot;delta&quot; pattern is that of heavy daily drinking, but no loss of control.  This is the more common type in Europe, for example in France.  The &quot;epsilon&quot; pattern is defined as binge drinking, and the &quot;gamma&quot; pattern is that of physical dependence with loss of control.  This is a more common type in the US.

Diagnostic tools for detecting alcoholism include administering the CAGE Questionnaire, and collecting other relevant historical data.  

*The CAGE Questionnaire:
**Have you ever felt the need to Cut down on your drinking?
**Have you ever felt Annoyed by criticisms of your drinking?
**Have you ever had Guilty feelings about your drinking?
**Have you ever taken a morning Eye opener?


Some historical “red flags” might include (1) a pattern of unexplained job changes; (2) vague, defensive or evasive responses to alcohol-related questions; (3) DUI convictions; or (4) multiple unexplained traffic accidents.  In addition, patients with alcoholism may have a history of impulsive behavior, fighting, or falls and scrapes, blackouts, binge drinking, or delirium tremens (DT’s).  A history of drinking to relax or sleep is significant, as is a history of family chaos and instability.  Relevant physical data to collect include the obvious stigmata of alcohol or drug use.  For alcohol use, this may include spider angiomas, ruddy nose and face, peripheral neuropathies, liver disease, or cerebellar dysfunction.  Additionally, patients may experience symptoms of gastric irritation related to acute or chronic alcohol use.  For other drugs, this may be cutaneous abscesses and track marks (in IV drug abusers), or nasal lesions (cocaine).

Relevant laboratory data to collect for diagnostic purposes in alcoholism include a complete blood count and liver enzymes.  Lab abnormalities may relate to malnutrition and organ damage, and may be expressed as leukopenia, macrocytic anemia, target cells (liver damage), thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow suppression.  CAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) levels in white blood cells of alcoholics are three times normal.  Liver enzymes are abnormal in chronic alcoholism.  Substance use can be easily detected via toxicology screens, in which urinary metabolites of several drugs are measured.  It is important to observe directly the sample collection process.  In addition, it is important to note the risk of false positives.  One needs to confirm findings with a second test on the same sample using different analytic method (for example, poppy seed ingestion can cause false positive screens for opiates).  Informed consent is crucial in toxicity screens.

==Differential==
&quot;Normal use&quot; is the main component in the differential of substance abuse.  However, this brings up the question of what is normal.  Perhaps the most important differential is between those patients who are addicted to drugs, and those who are merely physically dependent.  The difference lies in the definition of addiction.  For example, a patient with chronic pain, who is using regular opioids to alleviate pain, is probably physically dependent on the opioids, in the sense that the patient is probably tolerant to opioids, and would likely go into withdrawal if the opioids were suddenly stopped.  However, such a patient does not necessarily show the compulsive behaviors associated with addiction.  Furthermore, if the patient is taking the opioids for their analgesic, rather than euphoriant effects, then one cannot really say that the patient is addicted to antidepressants.  Other differentials to consider in a patient with suspected substance abuse includes delirium along with other Axis I psychiatric conditions (which are often comorbid).

==Comorbid Disorders And Complications==

===Medical Comorbidities===

====Alcohol====

Withdrawal.  Though generally uncomplicated, alcohol withdrawal can progress to delirium tremens (DTs), 10% of which are fatal.  It is important to understand the differences between uncomplicated withdrawal and delirium tremens.  Also, note that the hallucinations found in both of the above conditions are typically visual or tactile in nature, which may be distinguished from the auditory hallucinations of a distinct entity termed alcohol hallucinosis (described later).  

Seizures.  Seizures are common with high levels of alcohol use, independent of withdrawal. 

Alcoholic Hallucinosis.  Hallucinations can occur after drinking cessation in patients with alcohol dependence.  These occur in a clear sensorium, and are not part of DTs.  They are usually auditory hallucinations with persecutory content, and they can become chronic.
Wernicke's encephalopathy:  An acute neurological syndrome associated with long term alcohol abuse, the condition consists of delirium and the following triad of symptoms: ataxia, nystagmus and opthalmoplegia.  It is thought to result from the thiamine deficiency that can result from chronic alcoholism.  The treatment is, of course, to give thiamine (typically, it is given with folate).  

Dementia.  Dementia is common in patients with alcoholism.  Most classic is the Korsakoff's Dementia (sometimes called Korsakoff's Psychosis, but that is a misnomer).   This is characterized by an extremely poor short term memory--much worse than with Alzheimer's. Often associated with the memory losses are confabulations, though this is nonspecific to any dementia.  More common is a more &quot;run of the mill&quot; type of dementia; usual called simply alcohol dementia, or dementia due to alcohol dependence.  There remains some debate as to whether the dementia associated with alcoholism is due to a neurotoxic effect of alcohol itself, or to accessory problems (e.g., malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies). 

The dementia associated with alcoholism is most likely irreversible.  In the case of Korsakoff’s, the thiamine and folate are usually given, which do generally improve the Wernicke’s syndrome, but the memory disorder generally remains. 

Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.  FAS is due to heavy alcohol use during pregnancy.  There is a high incidence in alcoholic mothers.  Seventeen percent of births to alcoholic mothers are stillborn or die shortly after birth.  Twenty percent have some defects, and 32% show fetal alcohol syndrome.  Of those children with fetal alcohol syndrome, less than 6% are able to function normally in schools, and most never hold a job.  (see is link for FAS

====Withdrawal from other drugs====

Unlike alcohol withdrawal, the course of withdrawal is generally not life-threatening in most of the other drugs of abuse described above.  However, withdrawal in these instances may be very uncomfortable for the patient.  Nicotine, for example, causes symptoms of irritability, headache, anxiety, increased heart rate, cravings, and (most concerning for many) weight gain.  Women tend to gain more weight than men do during withdrawal.  Most symptoms send to subside within two weeks on average, with considerable variability, but cravings and appetite increases may persist for much longer periods of time.  Cocaine withdrawal also produces a number of symptoms, including hypersomnolence, fatigue, depression, intense cravings, and in some cases, suicidality.   Note that the course of benzodiazepine withdrawal can mimic that of alcohol withdrawal (including seizures, DTs, or death), as both substances utilize biochemical mechanisms of action.  Thus, benzodiazepine detoxification is approached with the same vigilance as in patients withdrawing from alcohol.  

===Psychiatric Comorbidities===

ECA data suggested that 53% of those with a substance disorder had a comorbid mental disorder.  Some of these mental disorders include antisocial personality disorder (11x higher than the general public), anxiety disorders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and phobias), and depression.  Most often, depression is secondary to alcoholism.  It generally improves with abstinence, though some dysphoria may remain.  Depression affects 13% of female alcoholics.  Alcoholism is also more common in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  Attention Deficit Disorder may predispose to alcoholism, but this is a controversial topic.

==Course==
General principles dictate that alcoholism is often worse if familial.  There are probably high incidences of (unreported) spontaneous remission.  This complicates evaluation of different treatments.  Drug abuse patterns are influenced by social and cultural factors and, compared with alcohol abuse, fluctuate over time. 

Alcoholism typically has an exacerbating and remitting course, with periods of relative or complete abstinence.  2-3% of alcohol dependents become abstinent per year.  Onset of alcoholism rarely begins after 45.  Thirty percent of college problem drinkers are alcohol dependent 20 years later.  The first hospitalization for alcohol tends to occur earlier in men (age 30 to 40).  Abuse of cocaine and stimulants has a rapidly progressing course: from use to abuse and dependence.  This is particularly true when the drugs are administered by the more potent routes (injection, inhaled).  Oral and intranasal routes of ingestion show slower progression.  Cannabis use rarely progresses to abuse and dependence if used alone.  Hallucinogens very rarely progress to dependence.  Opioid dependence represents a lifelong, chronic pattern.  Abuse of sedative hypnotics can remit, either spontaneously or with treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When in trouble remain calm.  Go and buy the book (assuming that one is available, and you do not already own it) and use your resources fully. Ask mechanically inclined friends for pointers and only sometimes for help. If that is not possible try the library. They usually have auto repair manuals for many different makes and models. If you have struck out at the library you could try an internet search engine: blogs,forums and owner's clubs - be specific in terms of make, model, year of manufacture, engine size and type, even trim. Chances are somebody has the same or similar car and may have gone through similar problems or can help if you post questions. Lastly, when you finally find out what is wrong and you have to go and purchase parts, do shop around (online parts distributors, brokers and of course your local scrap yards) it is worth it. However some jobs are best left to the certified mechanic, especially if your vehicle is still under warranty. Be sure to keep all of your receipts, many new and used parts have very good warranties!!!  Okay, good luck and I hope this information helps.

'''Erlang''' is a general purpose, concurrency-oriented functional programming language suited for fault-tolerant, distributed, soft real-time systems. It features strong dynamic typing, lightweight concurrency, eager evaluation and prolog like pattern matching. Erlang was developed in the 1980s at the Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory to address a then-unfulfilled need for telecommunications programming: a high-level, expressive language suitable for rapid development that offered the error recovery, concurrency, distribution and performance features required by telecommunications equipment.

Although its roots are in telecommunications, Erlang's unique features and extensive library make it suitable as a general-purpose programming language and well-suited to programming projects such as network servers, control systems and web development.

The Erlang language, together with an extensive library of applications and modules, a virtual machine and operating system, and a set of design principles establishing standard behaviors, comprise Erlang/OTP (OTP stands for Open Telecommunications Platform). Erlang/OTP is distributed as free software (under the Erlang Public License) as well as a commercially supported version from Ericsson. Both distributions run on Microsoft 
Windows, VxWorks by Wind River, and many varieties of Unix.

==Getting Erlang==

Erlang/OTP is available as free software from [http://www.erlang.org/download.html Open Source Erlang Downloads]. Once you have downloaded the Erlang/OTP distribution, you will need to compile it (if on a Unix platform) and install it.

==Installing Erlang==

In addition to the brief instructions below, you may wish to consult the [http://erlang.org/doc/installation_guide/part_frame.html Installation Guide].

===Unix===

Unpack the source distribution. Decide where you want Erlang and its libraries installed. For our example, we will assume you want it in &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/erlang/otp_r11b&lt;/code&gt;. Create this directory, as well as a build directory for building the Erlang sources.

 mkdir /usr/local/erlang/otp_r11b

From within the top-level directory, type &lt;code&gt;./Install /usr/local/erlang/otp_r11b&lt;/code&gt;. This will configure, build and install the Erlang/OTP distribution.

Add the distribution's &lt;code&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt; directory to your path. You may wish to set this in your shell initialization file.

===Microsoft Windows===

The distribution is a self-installing &lt;code&gt;.exe&lt;/code&gt; file. Invoke it (for example, by double-clicking on its icon) and answer the prompts.

==The Erlang Shell==

Erlang comes with a shell which is used interactively when controlling the Erlang environment and developing programs. On Unix, invoke the shell by typing &lt;code&gt;erl&lt;/code&gt; on the command line. On Windows, type &lt;code&gt;werl&lt;/code&gt; on the command line, or double-click the Erlang shortcut icon.

This starts the Erlang system and provides a shell for input and evaluation of Erlang.

 Eshell V5.4.13  (abort with ^G)
 1&gt;

==Your First Erlang Code==

At the shell prompt, type &lt;code&gt;&quot;hello, world!&quot;&lt;/code&gt; followed by a dot (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;). You can follow that up with some arithmetic. Or answer the question &quot;What is six times 9?&quot; in base-13 notation:

 1&gt; &quot;hello, world!&quot;.
 &quot;hello, world!&quot;
 2&gt; 1 + 2.
 3
 3&gt; 13#6 * 13#9.
 54

When you are ready to exit, you can stop the Erlang system using the &lt;code&gt;halt()&lt;/code&gt; built-in function:

 4&gt; halt().</text>

== Quickcheck ==

Consider the following function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
getList = find 5 where
     find 0 = return []
     find n = do
       ch &lt;- getChar
       if ch `elem` ['a'..'e'] then do
             tl &lt;- find (n-1)
             return (ch : tl) else
           find n
&lt;/source&gt;

How would we effectively test this function in Haskell? The
solution we turn to is refactoring and QuickCheck.

=== Keeping things pure ===

The reason your getList is hard to test, is that the side effecting monadic code 
is mixed in with the pure computation, making it difficult to test
without moving entirely into a &quot;black box&quot; IO-based testing model.
Such a mixture is not good for reasoning about code.

Let's untangle that, and then test the referentially transparent
parts simply with QuickCheck. We can take advantage of lazy IO firstly,
to avoid all the unpleasant low-level IO handling. 

So the first step is to factor out the IO part of the function into a
thin &quot;skin&quot; layer:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- A thin monadic skin layer
getList :: IO [Char]
getList = fmap take5 getContents

-- The actual worker
take5 :: [Char] -&gt; [Char]
take5 = take 5 . filter (`elem` ['a'..'e'])
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Testing with QuickCheck ===

Now we can test the 'guts' of the algorithm, the take5 function, in isolation. Let's use QuickCheck. First we need an Arbitrary instance for the Char type -- this takes care of generating random Chars for us to test with. I'll restrict it to a range of nice chars just for simplicity:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Data.Char
import Test.QuickCheck

instance Arbitrary Char where
    arbitrary     = choose ('\32', '\128')
    coarbitrary c = variant (ord c `rem` 4)
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's fire up GHCi (or Hugs) and try some generic properties (it's nice that we can use the QuickCheck testing framework directly from the Haskell REPL). An easy one first, a [Char] is equal to itself:

&lt;pre&gt;
*A&gt; quickCheck ((\s -&gt; s == s) :: [Char] -&gt; Bool)
OK, passed 100 tests.
&lt;/pre&gt;

What just happened? QuickCheck generated 100 random [Char] values, and
applied our property, checking the result was True for all cases.
QuickCheck ''generated the test sets for us''!

A more interesting property now: reversing twice is the identity:

&lt;pre&gt;
*A&gt; quickCheck ((\s -&gt; (reverse.reverse) s == s) :: [Char] -&gt; Bool)
OK, passed 100 tests.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Great!

=== Testing take5 ===

The first step to testing with QuickCheck is to work out some properties
that are true of the function, for all inputs. That is, we need to find
''invariants''.

A simple invariant might be:
&lt;math&gt;\forall s.\; \mathit{length} (\mathit{take}5\; s) = 5&lt;/math&gt;

So let's write that as a QuickCheck property:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
\s -&gt; length (take5 s) == 5
&lt;/source&gt;

Which we can then run in QuickCheck as:
&lt;pre&gt;
*A&gt; quickCheck (\s -&gt; length (take5 s) == 5)
Falsifiable, after 0 tests:
&quot;&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Ah! QuickCheck caught us out. If the input string contains less than 5
filterable characters, the resulting string will be no more than 5
characters long. So let's weaken the property a bit:
&lt;math&gt;\forall s.\; \mathit{length} (\mathit{take}5\; s) \le 5&lt;/math&gt;

That is, take5 returns a string of at most 5 characters long. Let's test
this:    
&lt;pre&gt;
*A&gt; quickCheck (\s -&gt; length (take5 s) &lt;= 5)
OK, passed 100 tests.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Good!

=== Another property ===

Another thing to check would be that the correct characters are
returned. That is, for all returned characters, those characters are
members of the set ['a','b','c','d','e'].

We can specify that as:
&lt;math&gt;\forall s. \forall e. (e \in take5\; s) \Rightarrow (e \in \{a, b, c, d, e\}) &lt;/math&gt;

And in QuickCheck:
&lt;pre&gt;
*A&gt; quickCheck (\s -&gt; all (`elem` ['a'..'e']) (take5 s))
OK, passed 100 tests.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Excellent. So we can have some confidence that the function neither
returns strings that are too long, nor includes invalid characters.

=== Coverage ===

One issue with the default QuickCheck configuration, when testing
[Char], is that the standard 100 tests isn't enough for our situation.
In fact, QuickCheck never generates a String greater than 5 characters
long, when using the supplied Arbitrary instance for Char! We can confirm
this:

&lt;pre&gt;
*A&gt; quickCheck (\s -&gt; length (take5 s) &lt; 5)
OK, passed 100 tests.
&lt;/pre&gt;

QuickCheck wastes its time generating different Chars, when what we
really need is longer strings. One solution to this is to modify
QuickCheck's default configuration to test deeper:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
deepCheck p = check (defaultConfig { configMaxTest = 10000}) p
&lt;/source&gt;

This instructs the system to find at least 10000 test cases before
concluding that all is well. Let's check that it is generating longer
strings:

&lt;pre&gt;
*A&gt; deepCheck (\s -&gt; length (take5 s) &lt; 5)
Falsifiable, after 125 tests:
&quot;;:iD^*NNi~Y\\RegMob\DEL@krsx/=dcf7kub|EQi\DELD*&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can check the test data QuickCheck is generating using the
'verboseCheck' hook. Here, testing on integers lists:

&lt;pre&gt;
*A&gt; verboseCheck (\s -&gt; length s &lt; 5)
0: []
1: [0]
2: []
3: []
4: []
5: [1,2,1,1]
6: [2]
7: [-2,4,-4,0,0]
Falsifiable, after 7 tests:
[-2,4,-4,0,0]
&lt;/pre&gt;

== HUnit ==

Sometimes it is easier to give an example for a test than to define one from a general rule.  HUnit provides a unit testing framework which helps you to do just this.  You could also abuse QuickCheck by providing a general rule which just so happens to fit your example; but it's probably less work in that case to just use HUnit.

:''TODO: give an example of HUnit test, and a small tour of it''

More details for working with HUnit can be found in its [http://hunit.sourceforge.net/HUnit-1.0/Guide.html user's guide].

'''Mile-a-minute weed''' ('''''Polygonum perfoliatum'''''), also known as '''Devil's tail tearthumb''', '''Asiatic tearthumb''', or '''Devil Shield''', is an herbaceous, annual, trailing vine in the buckwheat family. 

==Description==
It has a reddish stem that is armed with downward pointing hooks or barbs which are also present on the underside of the leaf blades. The light green colored leaves are shaped like an equilateral (equal-sided) triangle and alternate along the narrow, delicate stems. Distinctive circular, cup-shaped leafy structures, called [[w:ocrea|ocrea]]s, surround the stem at intervals. Flower buds, and later flowers and fruits, emerge from within the ocreas. Flowers are small, white and generally inconspicuous. The fruits are attractive, metallic blue and segmented, each segment containing a single glossy, black or reddish-black seed. 

==Ecology==
Mile-a-minute weed generally colonizes open and disturbed areas, along the edges of woods, wetlands, stream banks, and roadsides, and uncultivated open fields, resulting from both natural and human causes. Natural areas such as stream banks, parks, open space, road shoulders, forest edges and fence lines are all typical areas to find mile-a-minute. It also occurs in environments that are extremely wet with poor soil structure. Available light and soil moisture are both integral to the successful colonization of this species. It will tolerate shade for a part of the day, but needs a good percentage, 63-100% of the available light. The ability of mile-a-minute to attach to other plants with its recurved barbs and climb over the plants to reach an area of high light intensity is a key to its survival.  It can survive in areas with relatively low soil moisture, but demonstrates a preference for high soil moisture. 

The first records of mile-a-minute in North America are from Portland, Oregon (1890) and Beltsville, Maryland (1937).  Both of these sites were eliminated or did not establish permanent populations of the species.  However, the introduction of mile-a-minute somewhere between the late 1930s and 1946 to a nursery site in Stewartstown, York County, Pennsylvania did produce a successful population of this plant. It is speculated that the seed was spread with Rhododendron stock. The owner of the nursery was interested in the plant and allowed it to reproduce; unfortunately, subsequent efforts to eradicate it were not successful. The distribution of mile-a-minute has radiated from the York County site into neighboring states. 55 years after its introduction, the range for this plant in the United States had extended as far as 300 miles in several directions from the York County, Pennsylvania site. 

Mile-a-minute weed is primarily a self-pollinating plant (supported by its inconspicuous, closed flowers and lack of a detectable scent), with occasional outcrossing. Fruits and viable seeds are produced without assistance from pollinators. Vegetative propagation from roots has not been successful for this plant. It is a very tender annual, withering with a slight frost, and reproduces successfully until the first frost. Mile-a-minute is a prolific seeder, producing many seeds on a single plant over a long season, from June until October in Virginia, and a slightly shorter season in more northern geographic areas. 

Birds are probably the primary long-distance dispersal agents of mile-a-minute weed. Transport of seeds short distances by native ant species has been observed. This activity is probably encouraged by the presence of a tiny white food body (elaiosome) on the tip of the seed that may be attractive to the ants. These seed-carrying ants may play an important role in the survival and germination of the seeds of mile-a-minute weed.  Local bird populations are important for dispersal under utility lines, bird feeders, fence lines and other perching locations. Other animals observed eating mile-a-minute weed fruits are chipmunks, squirrel and deer.  

Water is also an important mode of dispersal for mile-a-minute weed. Its fruits can remain buoyant for 7-9 days, an important advantage for dispersing seed long distances in stream and river environments. The long vines frequently hang over waterways, allowing fruits that detach to be carried away in the water current. During storm events the potential spread of this plant is greatly increased throughout watersheds.

==Uses==
In traditional Chinese medicine, mile-a-minute weed is known as ''gangbangui'' (杠板归), and is valued for its diuretic, anti-inflammatory, and other effects.

It may also be eaten as a sour-flavored leaf vegetable, although its relatively high content of oxalic acid means that it should be eaten in moderation, and avoided by people with kidney disorders, gout, or rheumatoid arthritis.

==L'esclavage sous Napoléon==

Napoléon est aussi celui qui rétablit l'esclavage, aboli par la République en 1794. En mai 1802, après la signature d'un traité avec le Royaume-Uni restituant la Martinique à la France, « l'esclavage ainsi que la Traite des Noirs et leur importation dans les dites colonies auront lieu conformément aux lois et règlements antérieurs à 1789 ».

Début juin, il fait arrêter et déporter Toussaint Louverture, qui avait pris la tête de la révolte des esclaves noirs de Saint-Domingue onze ans plus tôt, et qui, s'appuyant sur les idéaux de la Révolution et confiant dans les hommes censés les représenter, avait rallié l'île à la France. Il devait mourir un an plus tard au Fort de Joux, dans le Doubs. Quant aux armées napoléoniennes, elles provoquent bien des massacres lors de la deuxième révolte des esclaves de Saint-Domingue, avant que ceux-ci en sortent victorieux et créent la première République Noire indépendante en janvier 1804.

La Guadeloupe se révolte aussi en 1802 mais la rébellion conduite par Louis Delgrès échoue et se termine par le suicide collectif des insurgés. De retour de l'île d'Elbe, Napoléon décrète une abolition immédiate de l'esclavage. Sa décision est confirmée par le traité de Paris le 20 novembre 1815. Néanmoins, à la Restauration, celle-ci reste lettre morte.
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Questions de compréhension==
'''Répondez en français:'''&lt;br&gt;
1. Napoléon était-il pour ou contre l'esclavage ?

2. En quelle année le traité avec le Royaume-Uni est-il signé ? Quelles en sont les conséquences ?

3. Qui est Toussaint Louverture ? Que fait-il ? Sur quels idéaux s'appuie-t-il ?

4. Que se passe-t-il en janvier 1804 ?

5. Comment la rébellion en Guadeloupe se termine-t-elle ?

==Grammaire et vocabulaire==
===='Quant à' and 'lors de'====
''Quant aux armées napoléoniennes, elles provoquent bien des massacres lors de la deuxième révolte.''&lt;br&gt;
The expression ''quant à'' means 'as for' and, of course, the ''à'' contracts as normal to form ''quant au'', ''quant à la'', and ''quant aux''. 
&lt;br&gt;
'''Practice'''&lt;br&gt;
Write five sentences with ''quant à'' in them. Use the expression in the text or the examples given as models. It is important to use sentences as models to prevent the tendency to translate word-for-word. &lt;br&gt;
For example, ''Napoléon est pour l'esclavage ; Abraham Lincoln, '''quant à lui''', trouve cette idée abominable.''
&lt;br&gt;
The expression ''lors de'' means 'during' and once again, we have ''lors du, lors de la'' and ''lors des''.&lt;br&gt;

====Ceux-ci====
[...] avant que ceux-ci en sortent victorieux
''Ceux-ci'' (and of course, ''celui-ci, celle-ci'' and ''celles-ci'') refer to (an) object(s) or person(s) that have just been mentioned. By using ''ceux-ci'', we can avoid mentioning the name again.  Therefore: ''Nos armées ont battu les armées anglaises, mais les armées anglaises étaient quand même fortes'' becomes ''Nos armées ont battu les armées anglaises, mais '''celles-ci''' étaient quand même fortes.''&lt;br&gt;
In this phrase, the ''en'' refers to the clause ''la deuxième révolte.'' This is because the implied sentence is: ''“[...] avant que ceux-ci sortent de la deuxième révolte.”'' Since it is a clause introduced by ''de'', we can replace it with ''en''.
&lt;br&gt;
 
'''Practice''' &lt;br&gt;
Write five  sentences with ''en'' that are used in the way described above: that is, that REPLACE a clause introduced by ''de''. For example, ''Elle a réussi son examen, elle en est fière'' (''elle est fière de sa réussite''). 
Here are some verbs followed by ''de'':&lt;br&gt;
''sortir de'' &lt;br&gt;
''descendre de'' &lt;br&gt;
''avoir peur de'' &lt;br&gt;
''avoir honte de'' &lt;br&gt;
''avoir besoin de'' &lt;br&gt;
''prier de'' &lt;br&gt;
''être content de'' &lt;br&gt;
''être heureux de'' &lt;br&gt;
''s'excuser de'' &lt;br&gt;
''féliciter de'' &lt;br&gt;
''manquer de'' &lt;br&gt;
''se souvenir de'' &lt;br&gt;
''parler de'' &lt;br&gt;
''se méfier de'' &lt;br&gt;
''revenir de'' &lt;br&gt;
''être fier de'' &lt;br&gt;''

==Activités écrites==
1. ''Vous êtes esclave à l'époque napoléonienne. Rédigez un court extrait de votre journal intime, dans lequel vous parlerez de votre vie quotidienne. Vous pouvez également parler des rébellions mentionnées dans le texte.'' You are a slave at the time of Napoleon. Write a short extract of your personal diary in which you speak of your daily life. You can also speak about the rebellions mentioned in the text.

2. ''Vous devez présenter un discours sur l'esclavage sur Napoléon à un club de jeunes. Rédigez ce discours en vous appuyant sur le texte.'' You have to present a speech on slavery under Napoleon to a youth club. Drawing on the text, write this speech.

==Comments==
* The G/gate input on this module is not a gate at all. Were it an actual gate you would expect any update at the In port on a voice for which gate is &quot;1&quot; to trigger an update at the output. Instead it functions more like a trigger, but stranger still, it works like trigger inputs on audio modules as it triggers on a rising edge (going from 0 to 1 or presumably any other positive value). This is unlike every other event &quot;trigger&quot; input (except Event V.C. Max), which of course trigger on any event, or any positive event, but in any case do not require sending a 0 followed by a 1.

* This module also does not work properly at initialization time, perhaps a side effect of the bizarre behavior of the G input.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The '''''NEWTs (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests)''''' are final exams taken by 7th year students at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Not all students are able to proceed to take NEWTs in all subjects; teachers will accept for further study only those students who have done well enough in their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWLs]] to convince the teachers that they will benefit from more advanced study. Magical education that is designed to lead to NEWT testing is, of course, referred to as &quot;NEWT-level courses&quot;, and magic normally taught at that level is referred to as &quot;NEWT-level magic.&quot;

The NEWT exams typically determine the career of the students, so passing these exams is critical, as is obvious when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] passes his NEWTs and enters the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].

== Event Details ==

Fairly often in the books, something is mentioned as being NEWT-class or NEWT-level magic. Examples of this are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s ability to conjure a corporeal [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s ability to perform the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protean Charm|Protean Charm]]. NEWT-class spells are complicated enough that the average wizard does not expect to have to perform them for real until his NEWT exams, and thus Harry's ability, in his third year at Hogwarts, and Hermione's ability early in her fifth year, to perform magic that is not generally tested until seventh year, is exceptional.

In the same way, the courses one takes in sixth and seventh year classes, after one has achieved a sufficiently high OWL grade, are called NEWT-level courses. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] teaches advanced [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]], for instance, to sixth and seventh year students who have achieved at least an E in their Transfiguration OWL, and we see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] wondering whether he can somehow parley his Transfiguration A into NEWT-level study in McGonagall's class.

The only person we hear of receiving their NEWT grades is Percy Weasley, and while we do hear that he had received his &quot;top-grade NEWTs&quot;, we are not close enough to him to know what exams he is sitting or when. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] does mention [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 27|at one point]] that he is aware that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dawlish|Dawlish]] had received top grades in his NEWTs.

'''Passing Grades'''

*O - Outstanding
*E - Exceeds Expectations
*A - Acceptable

'''Failing Grades'''

*P - Poor
*D - Dreadful
*T - Troll

== Notable Consequences ==

Presumably, it is because of Percy's top-grade NEWTs that he is able to gain employment with the Ministry. Harry is told that in order to become an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]], he must manage to achieve at least five Exceeds Expectations grades in his NEWTs.

== Analysis ==

Similarly to the OWL exams, which are the analog of the Muggle GCSE or O-Level exams, the NEWT exams are analogous to the Muggle A-level exams, which are generally required for proceeding to university. There is no mention of a Wizarding university, but the top jobs require NEWTs as a prologue to the further education that is required before starting work proper. We are told that there will be three years of study after graduation from Hogwarts before Harry will be able to start work as an Auror.

While there must be a lot of stress in the lead-up to the NEWT exams, we don't actually get to see this, as Harry does not attend Hogwarts in his seventh year.

We can see that the OWL exams are probably named after the O-levels that were standard in Muggle education, until they were replaced by GCSEs; we can guess that the author is of an age to have taken O-levels and probably A-levels as a high school student. The reason for the name NEWT is uncertain, but we can guess that, having selected one animal with Wizarding associations for the fifth-year tests, another animal with magical associations should be selected as the acronym for the seventh-year tests. It is, perhaps, unlikely that any Government body would have the necessary sense of humour to name an exam with the words &quot;nastily exhausting&quot;, so we can speculate that the official name, while retaining the NEWT acronym, may be something less droll. If so, we never hear the official name.

It is likely that the NEWT exams are taken in the two weeks of summer term following the OWL exams. We have seen that OWLs take two weeks, during which time the Great Hall will be full of fifth-year students writing their exams; presumably, the NEWT exams fill the Great Hall for the following two weeks. Given that no more than one seventh of the school population will be taking OWLs at any given time, and that significantly less that one seventh will be taking NEWTs, it is possible that theory sections of OWLs and NEWTs are taken at the same time, though care must clearly be taken to avoid collisions between the practical exams.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Because Harry, Hermione, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] do not attend Hogwarts in their seventh year, we do not actually experience NEWT exams. We could possibly have seen [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] taking these exams, but they elected to leave school dramatically in the middle of their seventh year. (In an interview following the publication of the seventh book, the author has said that Hermione returned to school to complete her seventh year, and presumably sat her NEWT exams at that time, but no mention of this is made in the books.)

Despite Harry's being told that he must have at least five Exceeds Expectations NEWT results to become an Auror, the author has implied that he entered the Aurors in the year that would have followed his seventh year at school. As he neither attended Hogwarts that year, nor sat NEWTs, we must assume that the Aurors accepted his year of unsupervised work as being equivalent to the necessary studies and exams.

===Physical Properties===

1)Silvery white soft solid, can be cut with a knife except Li&lt;br&gt;
2)Highly malleable and ductile&lt;br&gt;
3)Silver lusture is due to the presence of highly mobile electrons of the metallic lattice&lt;br&gt;
4)Large size in their respective periods; size increases down the group&lt;br&gt;
5)IE(ionisation enthalpy) decreases down the group&lt;br&gt;
6)They show +1 oxidation state&lt;br&gt;
7)Reducing charecter increases from Na to Cs, however Li is strongest reducing of them all&lt;br&gt;
8)They have very low melting points due to weak metallic bonds&lt;br&gt;
9)Density increases from Li to Cs(except K being lighter than Na)&lt;br&gt;
10)Ionic character increases from Li to Cs&lt;br&gt;
11)They are good conductors of heat and electricity

==1. List ten benefits of being physically fit.==
#You will have more energy
#Effective weight control
#Less likely to suffer from constipation
#Improved brain function and concentration
#Less depression
#Better self-image &amp; self-confidence
#Better sleep
#Greater bone strength
#Fewer 'aches and pains' and other physical complaints
#Improved ability to handle stress
#More leisure opportunities available to you
#Easier pregnancy and childbirth

==2. Know how the following help to achieve a balance for your body:==
===a. Exercise===
Exercise, especially aerobic exercise, improves the function of the heart and lungs.  It also improves the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. These are all important for avoiding heart disease and clogged arteries (which can cause early death).  Exercise also consumes calories, which helps control weight.  When exercise and diet are in balance, the calories taken in equal the calories expended, and weight is maintained.

Exercise also alters the chemical balance in your body, producing mood-lifting endorphins which make a person feel happier.

Our bodies were designed for regular activity, but sadly, people in modern times are mostly sedentary.  Exercise is a great way to restore the body's natural need for activity, making it function the way it was intended to by our Creator.

===b. Proper eating===
A good diet improves your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being.  If you take in more calories each day than you expend, you will gain weight.  This is true whether you are under-weight, over-weight, or at a healthy weight.  Conversely, if you take in fewer calories than you expend, you will lose weight, and again, this is true regardless of how much you currently weigh.  

Proper eating means that your vitamin and mineral intake is sufficient to prevent disease, that your caloric intake is equal to your caloric needs, and that the ''types'' of food you eat are well balanced.  It means that the amount of carbohydrates, proteins, and fat in your diet is also balanced.

If your diet is not well-balanced, your health will suffer.  For instance, if your diet does not provide you with enough calcium, your body will &quot;steal&quot; calcium from your bones (calcium is needed in order for your muscles to function).  This will weaken your bones which will make them more fragile and susceptible to fractures.  If your diet does not provide you with sufficient vitamins, you will get a disease - indeed, that is the very definition of ''vitamin''.  Any nutrient whose lack causes a disease is a vitamin.  It is also possible to take too many vitamins and get vitamin poisoning.  So it is important that your vitamin intake is also balanced.

If your diet contains too much fat, it will build up under your skin and in your arteries.  This is bad for your heart, as it constricts the passage through which the heart must pump your blood.  In other words, it makes your heart have to work harder to achieve the same results.

===c. Emotional stability===
Emotional stability helps us to positively deal with stress in our lives.  Exercise and diet both play an important part in emotional stability.  Too much (or too little) food can contribute to irritability.  Regular exercise is a great outlet for stress, and sticking with a regular exercise program tends to help people stick with other things as well, enabling them to solve difficult problems at work or in school.

==3. Define the following exercises:==
;a. Isometric: 
Isometric exercise is a form of physical exercise in which the muscles flex and hold a stationary position. No movement of a load takes place, and the exercises require little in the way of equipment. An example of an isometric exercise is placing the palms of the hands against each other and pushing. Isometric exercises are primarily used in physiotherapy and injury rehabilitation because the intensity can be rapidly and precisely adjusted, which makes them very safe. They are now rarely used outside this context. 
;b. Isotonic: 
Isotonic exercise is a form of strength training in which each effort is performed against a specific opposing force. Exercises are isotonic if a body part is moving against the force. Exercises are isometric if a body part is holding still against the force. Resistance exercise is used to develop the strength and size of skeletal muscles. Properly performed, resistance training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being, though it does very little for the cardiovascular system.  The classic example is weight lifting.
;c. Isokinetic:
Isokinetic exercise is similar to isotonic exercise, except that motion is resisted through an entire circuit.  In weight lifting, resistance is present only when lifting - gravity lowers the weights.  In isotonic training, the downward motion is also resisted. 
;d. Anaerobic:
Anaerobic exercise requires very little oxygen uptake.  An example would be sprinting, as a sprinter can run the 100 yard dash while holding his breath.  Short bursts of exercise fall into this category. 

;e. Aerobic:
Aerobic exercise is the most beneficial of all the types listed here, as it requires the body to use large amounts of oxygen over an extended period of time.  This improves cardiovascular health.  Examples include jogging, swimming, skating, and many other activities.

==4. Know the meaning of the principles involved in the following exercise program:==
;a. Warm up: There are two purposes for warming up before exercising.  The first is that it stretches and warms the muscles, decreasing the likelihood of an injury.  The second is that it gradually increases the heart rate in preparation for the workout.  Warming up can be as easy as doing leg stretches for a few minutes.  Slowly warming up can help people do even more aerobic exercise than if they had not warmed up at all.
;b. Aerobic exercises: This is the main part of an exercise program, and the part from which most of the benefits of exercise are derived.  Any exercise that increases oxygen intake and increases the heart rate past the target rate and is performed for at least 20 minutes can be considered aerobic.  
;c. Cool down: The cool down phase should last for about five minutes after the aerobic phase.  It allows the heart to gradually slow down.  If you were jogging, walk around for five minutes.  If you were swimming, walk around in the shallow end of the pool.  If you were bicycling, get off the bike and walk it around for five minutes.  Most heart attacks that happen in conjunction with an exercise program occur ''after'' the aerobic phase.  Allowing the heart to gradually slow protects it and lessens the chance of an incident.
;d. Calisthenics:  This portion of the program should last ten minutes.  It builds up muscle strength which decreases the chance of injury during future aerobic activities.

==5. Know how to determine your heart rate at rest and after exercise.==
First you'll need to find your pulse.  You can do this by placing a finger on your wrist just below the thumb joint, or by placing your hand over your heart.  If you have just exercised, you can often ''hear'' your heart beat, and feel it as well.  If you cannot, then you'll need to take your pulse the same way as when you are at rest.  The only problem with determining your heart rate after exercise is that what you ''really'' want to do is determine what it was ''when'' you were exercising, and when you stop exercising, the heart slows.  It takes a few seconds to find your pulse, and then at least 15 seconds to measure it, and in that time, the heart can slow significantly.  Therefore, you should add 10% to whatever number you measure.

If you have a stethoscope, you can hear your heart even when you are rested.  You can also find your pulse by placing a finger on the neck below the jaw, but this is not recommended as placing pressure there can alter your heart rate.  

Once you find your pulse, count the heartbeats over a 15 second interval.  Then multiply by four.  You can also count the heartbeats over a 20 second period and multiply by 3, or over a 30 second period and multiply by 2.  Do not use a period shorter than 15 seconds though, as any errors are also multiplied, and it is better to multiply them by a small number than by a large one.  For instance, if you count 7 pulses over 6 seconds when you should have counted 8, you will miscalculate your heart rate by 10 beats.

==6. Know how to determine the minimum rate at which your heart should be beating to obtain the best aerobic conditioning effect.==
===Men===
Use the following formula for men:

&lt;math&gt;rate = (205 - \frac{age}{2}) \times 80%&lt;/math&gt;

In words, you subtract half your age from 205 and then multiply by 80%.  Let's run through this for an 18 year-old man.

First take half of 18 which is 9.  Subtracting that from 205 gives us 196.  Multiplying 196 by 80 and dividing by one hundred (to get 80%) gives us 156.8 which we can round to 157.

===Women===
Use the following formula for women:

&lt;math&gt;rate = (220 - age) \times 80%&lt;/math&gt;

In words, you subtract your age from 220 and then multiply by 80%.  Let's run through this for an 18 year-old woman.

First subtract 18 from 220 which gives us 202.  Multiplying 202 by 80 and dividing by one hundred (to get 80%) gives us 161.6 which we can round to 162.

==7. Using the four steps given in requirement 4, do a regular exercise program at least four times a week for three months. For each exercise period, maintain the minimum heart rate determined in requirement 6 for a period of at least 20 minutes.  Keep a chart of the following:==
;a. Type of warm-up exercises performed:
;b. Type of aerobic exercises performed:
;c. How long aerobic exercises were performed:
;d. Type of calisthenics performed:

If you are over the age of 35, you should have a medical examination (including a stress test) before starting any exercise program.

The warm-up should last for two or three minutes, and should be something easy like stretches. 

Choose an exercise that you enjoy, as this will make it a lot easier to stick with it.  Any activity that raises your heart rate above the rate determined in requirement 6 for at least 20 minutes will do.  Suggestions include cross-country skiing, swimming, running, and jogging.  You can also skate or ride a bicycle, but be careful that you are exercising the whole time and not just &quot;coasting&quot;.  It is also possible to get your heart rate up by walking, but you will have to walk vigorously, and it may take a little while to get your heart rate up to the minimum.  Don't start counting the 20 minutes until the heart rate reaches the target.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Windows Vista?==
Windows Vista is the latest edition of Windows released in 2006. Windows is Microsoft's worldwide famous Operating System for use at home, at work, at college and in schools, for presentations and documents, and for the world to use. Windows Vista has suffered criticism, as the Operative System have an unusual high level of bugs, problem with drivers, it incorporates DRM and is very resource hungry. Microsoft has addressed some of the criticisms, releasing Windows Vista Service Pack 1.

Since 2006, many changes are being considered for Microsoft's next system, ''Vienna'', which were not released in Vista, making Vista a sort-of test run for Windows 7 (codenamed Vienna). If you have bought Windows Vista, you may experience faults at times, but Microsoft are building on them for their next system.

Vista has introduced software which no other version of Windows has had, including DVD Maker, Defender, Speech Recognition and Internet Explorer 7, giving us the back drop for our next chapter.

==Why a new OS?==
There are three primary reasons to consider the new Windows Vista OS: security, manageability, and end user productivity. Windows Vista security features include Windows Services Hardening, IE 7 Protected Mode and Full Volume disk encryption.

[[Image:Demerara sugar-1.JPG|thumb|right|Demerara Sugar.]]
Demerara is a large-grained, yellowish brown [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] with slightly sticky crystals and a relatively low molasses content - hence its paler color and milder flavor. Said to be a more natural product (fewer or no chemicals used in its manufacture) than [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]], it's a popular product for tea and coffee in England, Australia and Canada, but not very well known in the U.S. It makes an excellent table sugar and can be used for decorating cookies or as the caramelizing sugar on creme brulee.</text>

'''Heart of palm''', also called palm heart, palmito, or swamp cabbage, is a vegetable harvested from the inner core and growing bud of certain palm trees (notably the coconut (Cocos nucifera), Palmito Juçara (Euterpe edulis), Açaí palm (Euterpe oleracea), sabal (Sabal spp.) and pejibaye (Bactris gasipaes) palms). It is costly because harvesting kills the tree. It is eaten raw, usually in [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]], and has a mild, slightly sweet nutty flavor and a pleasant texture. In appearance it is off-white and usually sold as round stalks about an inch in diameter and 4-5 inches long, in jars or cans with salt water.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The personality disorders are not disorders in the same sense as the other psychiatric disorders, and to reflect this, the [[w:Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)]] lists them under a separate axis, Axis II.  For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as “Axis II Disorders.”  Rather than discrete disorders in the sense of major depression or schizophrenia, they are more patterns of maladaptive behaviors.  They are disorders, however, in the sense that they do represent somewhat consistent clusters of symptoms, have a predictable course, and predictable responses to treatment.  In addition, the disruptions they can cause in a person’s social and/or occupational functioning legitimizes their status as true disorders.  

==Working Definitions==
*'''Personality Trait.'''  A stable, recurring pattern of human behavior.

*'''Personality Type.'''  A constellation of personality traits recognizable as a frequent and familiar combination – e.g. the compulsive personality, characterized by preoccupations with work, detail, order, time, money, and cleanliness.

*'''Personality Disorder.''' A constellation of personality traits, which are inflexible and maladaptive.  These traits lead to difficulties in work or interpersonal relations, and can cause subjective distress.

*'''Neurosis.'''  An unfashionable term for a non-psychotic mental disorder that causes the patient unpleasant feelings (including anxiety, depression, pathological shame or guilt).  Many disorders formerly called neuroses are now incorporated into more major mood disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, dysthymia, adjustment disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, etc.

==Speculations on Etiology==

Personality is formed through an interaction of genetic and developmental influences. Severe personality disorders generally imply a mood disorder, mild neurological abnormality (such as attention deficit disorder or learning disability), or a family history of alcoholism or personality disorder, plus some kind of early loss, trauma, or abuse. If the developmental history is apparently benign, the likelihood of an affective or organic factor is even greater.

Personality traits that are maladaptive in adulthood may have been more adaptive in childhood. In some cases, it is possible to see how troublesome personality traits were reinforced by the family environment. However, it may happen that initially adaptive behaviors become counterproductive in adulthood, particularly if the environment has changed.  
Appreciation of the Role of Early Trauma in Severe Personality Disorders

Several studies show increased prevalence of childhood abuse, incest, or neglect, early loss, or family alcoholism in hospitalized patients with severe personality disorders.

Chronic post-traumatic stress disorder may produce symptoms that aggravate the personality disorder. Developmental histories of patients with severe personality disorder must attend to potential trauma, abuse, and neglect. Specific therapeutic attention to traumatic events may be crucial to success of treatment.

==Diagnosis==
===Making a Personality Diagnosis===

Making a diagnosis of a personality disorder can be difficult.  It generally requires observing an individual over time, and the reliability of cross sectional diagnosis of a personality disorder is poor.  Under sufficient stress, most individuals have the capacity to “regress” to a less mature state.  For example, a patient diagnosed with a serious mental illness, can begin to have difficulties coping with this new stress, and can appear at that time like a person with a personality disorder.  

In addition to longitudinal evaluations, the reliability of a diagnosis is enhanced by interviewing collateral sources such as family members.

Taking a full history is important as well.  It is tempting to rely on certain key behaviors (for example, wrist cutting) as if they were pathognomonic for a disorder, however this is rarely the case.  Of greatest importance is a full and accurate social and development history, in order to demonstrate the individual’s behaviors over time and in different situations.  

Personality tests, such as the [[w:Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] complement the clinical interview and are a useful preventive against a clinician’s biases and blind spots.  They are not in themselves diagnostic. 

For the acute management of a patient with a suspected personality disorder, an assessment of current strengths and weaknesses is often more pertinent than precise categorical diagnosis.

===Approaches to Describing Personality===

*'''Categorical.'''  In this approach, specific personality disorders are defined by diagnostic criteria in a manner similar to other mental.  The advantages of such an approach are that this approach is consistent with the approach used by psychiatrists (in DSM-IV) to describe all other mental disorders.  This approach is useful in research, as it presents a consistent approach to case identification, and thus is convenient for the types of empirical research that require large, homogeneous groups of patients (for example, treatment studies). There are disadvantages to approach, however.  A categorical approach must draw a potentially arbitrary line between the normal and pathological:  either people have the disorder or they do not.  Furthermore, though groups of patients may be superficially linked by common symptoms, they may in fact have heterogeneous pathologies, in which case the diagnoses attached may not have predictive value.   Finally, the use of these disorders in too superficial a manner can invite “labeling” and stigmatization of the individual.  

*'''Dimensional.'''  In the dimensional approach, personalities are seen on a continuum from “normal” to ‘deviant.”  Generally, personality is divided into specific traits, which are then scaled.  In this approach, a disorder is defined in terms of a statistical deviance from the normal range of behaviors.  This approach may be more valid than a categorical approach, as it avoids seemingly arbitrary all-or-none decision.  Furthermore, it has the capacity to permit a greater appreciation of individual differences.  Disadvantages lie in the implementation of a dimensional approach.  Defining normal behavior requires a normative sample; collecting a true normative sample that represents the actual range of adaptive behaviors can be illusory.  Furthermore, the dimensional ratings obtained are based on standardized tests, which vulnerable to biases in design.  

*'''Prototypical.'''  Patients’ personalities are compared with typical examples of well-recognized personality types, such as the compulsive, the hysterical, the antisocial, etc.   The advantage of such an approach is that this approach models the way the way that clinicians think about disorders (comparing an individual to idealized forms of health and disease).  It also facilitates recognition of certain patterns.  Disadvantages to this approach include is vulnerable to bias, the subjectivity of the approach which makes inter-rater reliability difficult.   This in turn makes research on the disorders difficult.

*'''Structured Assessments Of Adaptive Strengths And Preferred Defense Mechanisms.'''  This approach avoids defining a disorder altogether, and simply describes a persons personality in terms of t psychological strengths and weaknesses.  The appraisal is done in a structured, albeit qualitative manner.  This approach is useful as a complement to other forms of diagnosis, and can be helpful in planning a patient’s management and treatment.  However, a person’s strengths and weaknesses may fluctuate with time, and may be less stable than the personality traits assessed by other approaches.  Furthermore, strength and weakness assessments may depend greatly on the clinician’s interviewing skill

===The DSM-IV Personality Disorders===

The personality disorders are divided into three clusters, organized alphabetically:  Types A, B and C.  Type A is called the “Odd Cluster”, Type B the Dramatic Cluster, and Type C the Anxious Cluster.   

====A.  The Odd Cluster====

*'''Paranoid Personality.'''  This is defined by the person’s high level of suspiciousness.  Persons with disorder are mistrustful of everyone.  This distrust does not reach the level of a delusion, however. [[w:Paranoid personality disorder|More on this disorder]]

*'''Schizoid personality.'''  This disorder is defined by the individual’s lacks of intimate relationships, and their tendency to be frightened by closeness.  They seem to be virtually incapable of personal warmth, and are anxious when others try to be close (due to the fear of the intimacy of socialization). [[w:Schizoid personality disorder|More on this disorder]]

*'''Schizotypal personality.'''  This disorder is defined by the presence of odd and eccentric ideas.  These ideas seem outside the norm, may influence daily behavior, but are not psychotic. [[w:Schizotypal personality disorder|More on this disorder]]

====B. The Dramatic Cluster====

*'''Antisocial personality.'''  This disorder is defined by the individuals disregard for rules, laws and social conventions.  Sometimes referred as “psychopaths” they are dishonest, and unconcerned about the effect of their behavior on others. [[w:Antisocial personality disorder|More on this disorder.]]

*'''Narcissistic personality.'''  Persons with this disorder are grandiose, needing constant attention.  They have a lack of empathy for others, and an exaggerated sense of self-importance. They tend to act as if they are superior to unique from others.[[w:Narcissistic personality disorder| More on this disorder]]

*'''Borderline personality.'''  These individuals are emotionally intense and unstable, with impulsive behavior, self-destructiveness, an inner emptiness and an intolerance of being alone.[[w:Borderline personality disorder|M ore on this disorder]]

*'''Histrionic personality.'''  Individuals with this disorder are dramatic, with attention-seeking behavior.  They often present as a caricature of femininity or masculinity.[[w:Histrionic personality disorder| More on this disorder]]

====C.  The Anxious Cluster====

*'''Avoidant personality.'''  Persons with this disorder avoid social situations because of fears of rejection, criticism, or disappointment.  They tend to avoid occupational or social challenges and are seen as “underachievers.” .[[w:Avoidant personality disorder| More on this disorder]]

*'''Dependent personality.'''  Persons with this disorder cling to a stronger person, sometimes submissively.  They rely on that person for help and advice, and are anxious when faced with the need for an independent decision.[[w:Dependent personality disorder| More on this disorder]]

*'''Obsessive-compulsive personality.'''  Persons with this disorder (sometimes called OCPD) have a preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility.  They may be described as being preoccupied with work or duty, not enjoying life, and being rigid and inflexible.   This disorder is different from Obsessive-Compulsive disorder (OCD), an Axis I diagnosis in that OCPD people do not have clear rituals or intrusive thoughts, and rarely see their habits as being alien to themselves (or “ego dystonic” which is common in OCD, but not OCPD).[[w:Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder| More on this disorder]]

==How Personality Disorders Present==

*'''In Medical Settings.'''  Personality disordered patients are often very challenging for doctors.  They are more likely to have interpersonal problems in the doctor-patient relationship.  They may be more prone to being noncompliant with their medical care.   They can have particular difficulty in coping with any restrictions on their normal function:  hospitalization, disability or medical regimens (e.g. dietary restrictions) can be particularly trying for these patients.   Professionals may find that these patients bring out the worse in them, and unprofessional behaviors are more likely with such patients. 

*'''In The Family.'''  Patients with personality disorders are more likely to have marital conflicts (including violent conflicts), and problems with child rearing.  The risk of divorce is high in this group of patients. 
*Within The Individual.  Patients with personality disorders can experience multiple losses resulting from their behaviors:  divorce, job losses are all common.  Their difficulties in the medical setting can result in poorer outcomes from medical conditions.   Specific personality disorders can have very particular difficulties when they are not able to live according to their usual style (for example, when a dependent person is removed from the object of their dependency).  

==Comorbidity==

Personality disorders are often of high risk for various disorders.  They have high rates of Axis I psychiatric disorders, particularly mood disorders, anxiety disorders and substance abuse.  They may have higher rates of medical illnesses as well, for the reasons described above.  

Some specific concerns: 

*Antisocial, borderline, and histrionic personalities are vulnerable to alcohol and drug abuse.
*Borderline personalities are vulnerable to brief reactive psychosis and to major depression.
*Schizotypal and schizoid personalities are vulnerable to schizophrenia.
*Dependent personalities are vulnerable to agoraphobia.
*Compulsive personalities are vulnerable to obsessive-compulsive disorder.

      <comment>/* getKey */ used not-equals symbol in place of !=</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== getKey ==

&lt;tt&gt;getKey&lt;/tt&gt; stores the numerical value of a key press, at the instance of the instruction execution, in a variable.  Its general form is &lt;tt&gt;:getKey &amp;rarr; &lt;i&gt;variable&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.  This command is very useful in conditional statements.

Key Value Diagram:

[[Image:Ti-83_plus_keys.JPG]]

'''ON''' doesn't have an accessible numerical value (theoretically it should be 101; however, it acts as the program break button).

The reason for the numbering is as follows.  Each key has a two (or three) digit number assigned to it.  The first digit (or two digits) is the key's ''row number'' (how far down on the calculator the key appears) and the last digit is the key's ''column number'' (how far across on the row the key appears).  Thus the SIN key is in the 5th row and the 2nd column, so its code is 52. The only slight exception to this is the arrows keys.  Left, right and up are all considered part of the second row and are numbered as such.

An example of usage is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
:Lbl X
[...]
:getKey→A
:If A=105
:Stop
:Goto X
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example, the program will terminate when key 105 (Enter) is pressed; otherwise it will continue to the Goto statement and loop back to a predefined point.

Labels are NOT recommended in advanced coding.. Instead, try nested loops.

For Example.

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]            // Program code.
:Delvar Z        // You don't need a new line here.  
:Repeat Z=1      // Ex. :DelvarZRepeat Z=1
[...]            // Program code to repeat (Like the previous label as stated above.)
:Repeat Ans
:getKey          // This will wait until a keypress is made. 
:End             // End of :Repeat Ans loop.
:Z+(Ans=105)→Z   // Test for keypress 105 (Enter) adds 1 to Z if true 0 if false.
:End             // End of :Repeat Z=1 loop.
&lt;/pre&gt;


In this example there are no labels.
The loop waits for key to continue and will end if enter key is pressed.
If any other key is pressed it will loop back just as the label program would.


&lt;pre&gt;
:While Ans≠105
:Repeat Ans
:getkey
:End
:End
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example, the program will wait for user input 105 (Enter) before ending the continuous loop.
This is a very useful technique.
The following program will display the id of the key pressed (useful if you do not have a chart handy):
&lt;pre&gt;
PROGRAM:GETKEY
:While 1
:Repeat Ans
:getKey
:End
:Disp Ans
:End
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run this program and hit any key. The pressed key's ID will show up.

'''Organizational Behavior''' is the study of individual behavior and group dynamics in organizations.

==Flexible Working Conditions==
A recent review by the Cochrane Collaboration has found that flexible working arrangements, such as [[w:flextime|flextime]] and [[w:telecommuting|telecommuting]] can have positive effects on health, but the effects are primarily seen when employees have some control over their new schedules.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joyce2010&quot;&gt;Joyce, K, R. Pabayo, J.A. Critchley, and C. Bambra. 2010. “Flexible Working Conditions and Their Effects on Employee Health and Well-Being.” The Cochrane Collaboration: Cochrane Reviews. http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab008009.html (Accessed February 19, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, individuals who telecommute to work most of the work week are more satisfied with their jobs than are traditional employees who commute into a physical office location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fonner2010&quot;&gt;Fonner, Kathryn L., and Michael E. Roloff. 2010. “Why Teleworkers are More Satisfied with Their Jobs than are Office-Based Workers: When Less Contact is Beneficial.” Journal of Applied Communication Research 38:336.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversity in the Workplace==
Gender and racial diversity in the workplace actually increases sales revenue, brings more customers, results in greater market share, and greater relative profits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herring2009&quot;&gt;Herring, Cedric. 2009. “Does Diversity Pay?: Race, Gender, and the Business Case for Diversity.” American Sociological Review 74:208-224.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this fact, racial and ethnic minorities and women are still under-represented in management in U.S. corporations.&lt;ref name=&quot;dobbin2007&quot;&gt;dobbin, frank, alexandra kalev, and erin kelly. 2007. “diversity management in corporate america.” Contexts 6:21-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The figure below illustrates their under-representation:

[[File:Percentofmanagersbyraceethnicity2002.png|center|600px|thumb]]

The blue bars indicate the actual percentage of managers made up by that group.  The red bars indicate the percentages of those people in the U.S. population.  If the blue bar is larger than the red bar, than people in that group are over-represented among managers.  If it is smaller, than that group is under-represented.  One group is substantially over-represented, white males, while almost all other groups are under-represented, particularly black and Hispanic females.

Current research suggests that two factors contribute to the under-representation of racial, ethnic, and gender minorities in the workplace: small social networks and lack of mentors.&lt;ref name=&quot;dobbin2007&quot;/&gt;  Providing mentors for minorities is probably the best solution to address this problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;dobbin2007&quot;/&gt;

==Job Insecurity==
Job insecurity has a deleterious effect on social capital and social involvement of workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brand2008&quot;&gt;Brand,  Jennie  E.  and  Sarah  A.  Burgard.  2008.  “Job  Displacement  and  Social  Participation over the Life Course: Findings for a Cohort of Joiners.” Social Forces 87(1):211‐242.&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals who have experienced an involuntary job loss (through layoff, downsizing, etc.), are 35# less likely to be involved in their communities than are individuals who have never experienced an involuntary job loss.

==Personality, Perception, and Attribution==

===Individual Differences and Organizational Behavior===
T.A. Judge and R. Ilies links the five factor model of personality in the workplace to the individual and overall satisfaction in the workplace.  The “Big Five” personality traits; extraversion (assertiveness), agreeableness (cooperative),  conscientiousness (dependable), emotional stability (self-confident), and openness to experience (curious), make up the basic framework as a model of behavior in the workplace.  Judge and Ilies performed extensive research at the universities of Florida and Iowa finding all the correlations these five factors have on the overall job satisfaction of a given professional environment.  Although the control factors, methods, and results that Judge and Ilies came up with were impressive, there are many more studies that have produced varying results. 

===Social Perception===
Perception is used everyday.  Perception is how we, as individuals, asses situations.  A burning stove top is perceived to be hot.  Traffic is perceived to be speeding up or slowing down.  People are perceived to be friendly or threatening.  Yet when it comes to perceiving people, there are many more perceptions that are made.  These social settings and environments are what make up social perception.  The same settings can be applied to a smaller scale.  This scale can be school, family, or the work force.  The work setting can be one of many challenging social perceptions.  From the job interview, to leaving the company, and everything in between, employers are evaluating their employee’s job performances, and employees are not only assessing one another, but their employer as well.

Perhaps the most important part of social perception is the first meeting of a person, or the first impression.  When two people meet for the first time, an instant anchor is dropped.  This is a mental anchor that gives a brief, and very general, view of the new individual.  Clothes that are worn, the way the hair is combed, the way the person stands or sits, all create the impression a person gets when they are met for the first time.  From this impression, an individual makes instant reactions to whether the person is friendly, outspoken, quite, etc.  It allows one to make a brief judgment on the personality of an individual.  This is necessary in order to be able to interact with people.  Although a first impression does not provide an in depth characterization of an individual, it does allow one to be able to initially interact with them.  This process allows employers in a job interview to make quick decisions that will either be positive or negative for both the employer and the employee.  Mentally the decision is made in the first few moments of contact.  As time goes on the employer can justify further, with continuous questions, that the interviewee will be good for the company, or if they employer needs to search for a new candidates.  

First impressions can be slowly swayed over time.  It is not easy to change someone’s first impression, nor is it ever changed much.  The anchor can only be pulled in one direction or another so far, and after much effort, in this case continuous interactions.  Familiarity is the only way to obtain the truest sense of who a person really is.  By learning the personality and tendencies of a person, one can better understand that person’s behaviors and actions.

===Personality===
Each individual has their own unique personality.  This personality can show how a person behaves and reacts to certain situations.  There are many different factors to consider when determining personality, like environment settings and heredity traits.  A person’s personality can also have an effect on self-esteem, which is an individual’s general feeling of self-worth, as well as self-monitoring, the ability to base behavior on social cues.  Different theories are used today to help measure a person’s personality such as trait theory, psychodynamic theory, humanistic theory, and integrative approach.

In measuring self-esteem, Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale can be used to help measure the trait self-esteem of individuals in a given environment or situation.  This will help determine who could have high or low self-esteem and what caused them to have it.   “…persons low in self-esteem are less likely to make effective use of self-protection strategies, we hypothesized that this strategy of deflecting the threat involved in upward comparison would be used primarily by persons who are characteristically high in self-esteem.”  (Musssweiler, Gabriel, Bodenhausen, 2000)  According to the social comparison research by Mussweiler, Gabriel, and Bodenhausen, the majority of the individuals tested used the gender and ethnicity to either separate themselves from another or to use this factor to help them achieve a higher self esteem, or it could have the opposite effect of putting down one’s own self-worth.  The overall outcome in all situations is that people will develop different methods to block out unpleasant feelings of being outperformed, the experience of inferiority.

===Application of Personality Theory in Organizations: The Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator Instrument===
As a follow up to Carl Jung’s theory that every individual is fundamentally different, the Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator Instrument, the MBTI, measures an individual’s personality preferences in a variety of organizational settings, including: team building, management, decision making, leadership, career counseling, and many more. The MBTI examines four dichotomies: Extroversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. Each dichotomy has an explanation about the characteristics associated with each type. 

The MBTI is based on the Jungian theory of personality; meaning, it can be used in all populations, including non-clinical settings. Meyers and Briggs, authors of the MBTI, used Jung’s theory to predict people’s patterns of behavior. “Because the results of the MBTI are subject to a variety of environmental influences, such as work tasks and organizational climates and values, interpretations have to be treated with caution and individually verified” (Michael, 2003). Many people use the MBTI test in a rigid fashion causing the results to be an inaccurate assessment of people’s personalities. If the weaknesses of the test were considered, and people would use the test with caution, adjustments can be made to determine an accurate assessment of any changes in an individual’s behavior.

===Attribution in Organizations and Managerial Implications: Using Personality, Perception, and Attribution at Work===
The attribution theory explains how individuals pinpoint the causes of their own behavior and that of other people. There are two sources of “power” that human beings believe are responsible for the outcome of their own actions. One source is internal; we normally relate success and elements under our control as an internal attribution. The second source is external: we normally relate failure and elements out of our control as an external attribution. Success in the workplace can simultaneously alternate between internal and external. You might have been prepared and researched for a project and believed your success was internal. On the other hand, you may believe you were lucky to have done such a great job on a project, attributing your success to external forces. 

Perception of internal and external forces has resulted in the fundamental attribution error. The fundamental attribution error occurs when one views the bad behavior of others as internal and their own bad behavior as external. It is much more difficult for others to see the external forces surrounding the individual conducting the bad behavior, where as, it is clear to the individual conducting the bad behavior, to relate their own behavior to their surrounding forces. Managers who acknowledge the personality differences between themselves and other employees can begin to appreciate those personality differences and create a more effective communication environment.

==Communication==
Everyday, we use communication to express our thoughts and feelings.  There are many different types and styles of communication.  From verbal to nonverbal communication and from face-to-face to electronic, every word said and move made is communicating different emotions and ideas to those around us.

===Interpersonal Communication===
Interpersonal Communication contains four key elements: the communicator, the receiver, perceptual screens, and the message. 
The communicator is the person speaking or sending the message. 
The receiver is the person listening or receiving the message.  Perceptual screens are window through which we interact with people in the world.  They are the specifics rather: age, race, religion, value, beliefs, etc.  These specifics have a large impact on how to send and receive messages.  
The message should have two working components.  Perceptual components are the words and concepts used to deliver the message and the emotional component is the demeanor in which the individual receives the message.
Feedback is also important in communication so the two parties are clear that they sent and received the same message and that one party is not under the wrong impression.  
Language has become increasingly important due to growing global relations in organizations.  Because of language barriers, it is difficult to send and to receive messages.
Data is the information intended to communicate a message to someone and the information is the data translated in the message already.

====Reflective Listening====
Reflective Listening focuses on personal elements of the communication and not the abstract ideas. Reflective listening should be feeling oriented and responsive. The listener should show empathy and concern for the person communicating.  A good reflective listener would concentrate on the discussion at hand and worry about the main components of focus while allowing the speaker to lead you in the communication.  Verbal response is primary in reflective listening and there are four important parts of verbal response.

===Affirming Contact===
When responding to the communicator, making contact is affirming contact.  For example, use simple phrases such as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;I understand.&quot;

===Paraphrasing the Expressed=== 
Paraphrase expressed thoughts and feelings by waiting for the appropriate time to tell them your thoughts and feelings about them and the message you received.

===Clarifying the Implicit===
Clarify implicit thoughts and feelings by assuring your assumptions are correct and you received the implicit message accurately.

===Reflecting &quot;Core&quot; Feelings===
Reflect core feelings with caution knowing that the core feelings could bring new awareness to the speaker they were not aware prior.  When reflecting core feelings, be precise and assertive without being overly pushy.

===Silence=== 
Long silences may cause awkward feelings for both the communicator and receiver but shorter silences can be good for both parties to have time to think and sort out what is going on and what they want to say next.

===Eye Contact===  
Eye contact can also play a part by letting the other person know you can focused, listening, and want to communicate with them.

===One-Way Versus Two-Way Communication===
These four levels of verbal response will help to insure two-way communication where both the communicator and the receiver are active in the communication.  One-way communication can be good in the right circumstances.  If someone needs to state a lot of information and a response is not necessary, then one-way would be a good form of communication.

===Five Keys To Effective Supervisory Communication===

====Expressive Speakers====
It is important that both managers and supervisors are open communicators.  They should feel comfortable in communicating to others their personal thoughts and feelings in relation to a subject so their employees, in turn, are fully educated on their total outlook.

====Empathetic Listeners====
Active listening is a key trait in many successful supervisors.  Included in active listening are insightful listening skills.  In other words, responding to problems brought to their attention by all individuals for and with which they work.  Additionally, it is important the supervisors react to the worries of the individuals in a timely manner.
  
====Persuasive Leaders====
In order to attain goals, successful supervisors must be persuasive leaders.  In other words, they are much more likely to obtain others to follow their ideas and beliefs if they can successfully persuade them to do so.

====Sensitive to Feelings====
When an employee needs to be corrected, it is important the supervisor does so while taking into consideration the feelings and esteem of the employee.  Sometimes, an individual will seek correction when they know they have performed less than adequately; however when employees perform less than adequately and do not seek correction it is then the employee is trying to “not only preserve their self-images, but also mange their impressions on others” (Moss).  A successful supervisor is both secure and positive in their feedback; never scolding in public, for public scolding does not reserve the esteem of the employee.  Instead, a successful supervisor will use public areas in times of praise.
  
====Informative Managers====
Successful managers take the time to inform properly all employees in areas related to their job.  Before a manager gives information, however, a successful one will be sure to sift through the information.  As a result, the employee remains informed but not overwhelmed.

===Barriers and Gateways to Communication===
There are five types of barriers of communication. These include Physical Separation, Status Differences, Gender Differences, Cultural Diversity, and Language.

====Physical Separation====
Physical Separation differs with technology but works best face-to-face. 

====Status Differences====
Status Differences can vary if you are a low-income person talking to someone that looks wealthy, which occurs in a manager-employee situation.

====Gender Differences====
Gender Differences can be difficult because women and men communicate in different ways. 

====Cultural Diversity====
Cultural Diversity can be a barrier of communication because other cultures have different morals and ways of life.  In addition, dealing with stereotypes can be completing as well.

====Language====
Languages can be hard to get over if someone is speaking a different language that you do not understand.

===Defensive and Nondefensive Communication===

====Defensive Communication==== 
Defensive communication is that which can be aggressive and attacking or passive and withdrawing.  This form of communication will usually elicit a defensive response.  Defensive communication can create barriers and conflicts within an organization and make it difficult to accomplish tasks

====Subordinate Defensiveness====
Subordinate defensiveness is withdrawing behavior and the attitude of the individual is commonly &quot;you are right, and I am wrong.&quot;  These individuals do not accurately show their thoughts and feelings and can have a low self-esteem.  This kind of behavior can seem passive on the outside; however, the behavior fuels with hostility on the inside.  Passive aggressive behavior for example is a form of defensiveness that begins as subordinate defensiveness and ends up as dominant defensive.

====Dominant Defensiveness====
Dominant defensiveness is an offensive behavior pattern with aggression and attacking attitudes.  For example, people who are higher up on the ladder often want to get their point across but fail to do it accurately.  Instead, they resort to telling people how to accomplish something with no room for support or advice.  The attitude of the individual is commonly, &quot;I am right and you are wrong.&quot;

====Defensive Tactics====
To act out the defensive communication, defensive tactics are used.  Examples are labeling, put downs, deception, or hostile jokes.  Not only are these defensive tactics but they will receive defensive responses.

====Nondefensive Communication====
Non-defensive communication is an assertive, direct, and powerful form of communication.  It can open communication lines and help achieve goals quickly and appropriately.  This kind of communication shows self-control, helps others to understand you in working situations, and helps to reduce negative responses.  Assertiveness is a key aspect in non-defensive communication because it is an accurate and informative statement.  Additionally, it is self-affirming and gets your point across without seeming demanding. 

===Nonverbal Communication===
Nonverbal communication includes all the elements of communication that do not involve words or speech.  It involves how you move your body, eyes, mouth, the expressions that you make, and all other ways of communicating without speaking.  Nonverbal communication varies greatly with culture.

====Proxemics====
Proxemics deals with our territory, and the space around us.  We form barriers and need a certain amount of space between us and other people in order to feel comfortable.  We will be very close with our loved ones- with whom we have an intimate or personal relationship.  Next, our friends will be farther away, followed by associates and acquaintances, and finally strangers or the public will be held at the farthest distance.

====Facial and Eye Behavior====
Facial and Eye Behavior is how we convey messages or feelings with our face and eyes.  Many times we convey our feelings or true intent through our facial expressions, giving others cues as to what we are truly thinking or feeling.  As humans, we tend to be much more observant and aware of emotions conveyed through the face than by other means, such as leg movements and arm movements (Frank and Ekman)

====Paralanguage====
Paralanguage are the variations that we put into our speech.  For example, talking fast means we are in a hurry, yelling that we are angry, and using interruptions or interjections such as “hey” to convey that we want to say something.

====How Accurately Do We Decode Nonverbal Cues?====
Through study, general understandings of nonverbal cues were developed and interpreted with a decent amount of accuracy.  Understanding nonverbal cues can be useful and important in an organization when trying to understand the full meaning of an interaction.  Nonverbal cues are only a portion of the message; one should consider every aspect of the interaction.

===Positive, Healthy Communication===
Communicating head-to-heart dialog and emotional competence is the way to achieve a positive and healthy communication.  When we communicate it is suggested that we try to be heartfelt it shows well-being and a healthy way to express yourself.  When not using this method one may tend to isolate and be lonely.  In the work environment working together is it important to use positive and healthy communication because when speaking your ideas, feelings, and emotions it displays positive behaviors.  In addition, this open communication shows a base for trust and truth.  When honest it can bring out the best in the people when working together.  When working together talking through challenging issue, personal or professional.  We will be able to have a wider range of human relationships.  “The need to communicate through his or her various formal roles, the executive has a deeper interpersonal need for communication and relationship that is seated at the limbic or emotional level of the brain.  This deep interpersonal communication is the target of our coaching model as it reaches beyond the superficial mask of control, drive, and competition and develops within the executive awareness, understanding, and management of the emotions that are fundamental to his or her being”(Quick and Macik-Fray).  Finally, in positive and healthy communication is a display that you are ethical and have integrity.

===Communication Through New Technologies===

====Written communication====
In written communication, we use letters outside the organization and inside the organization.  We use memos, forms, manuals, and reports, which are important to the office.
 
====Communication Technologies====
With communication technologies, we have database, electronic mail, voice mail, faxes, and cell phone.  With any organization you will need to use at least one of these on a day-to-day base, it is fast and easier.  Technologies affect our behavior because there is not any real face-to-face communication and no emotion is involved.  It will be hard to have a relationship that has trust. When using these methods of communication we are able to say anything.

==Attitudes, Values, and Ethics==

===ABC Model of Attitude===
An attitude is a psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating an entity with some degree of favor or disfavor. (dictionary.com)  Our attitude affects the way we behave and react towards people.  The ABC model breaks down the meaning of an attitude in three different components.  The components are affect, behavioral intentions, and cognitions.  All of these components greatly affect our attitudes.  Affect has to do with how a person feels.  Behavioral intentions are how a person acts, and cognition is how a person thinks.  Attitudes are formed through life lessons, the people around, and personal experience.

===How Attitudes Are Formed===
Cognitive dissonance is the tension that is produced when there is a conflict between attitudes and behavior. (Dictionary of the English Language)  It motivates a person to change there attitude and behavior.  The experimenter pressures or offers a reward to a person to persuade them to be part of an experiment.  An example of this theory is, a professor persuades a student to be part of an experiment, and offers them twenty dollars.  When the student hesitates the professor says “It will only take a few minutes.  The regular person that does it, is usually reliable.  This is the first time she missed the experiment.  If we need you we will call you in advance, and if you can’t make if we won’t expect you to come.” (Cognitive Dissonance)  Their point is to see how much of and effect they have on a person’s thoughts, opinions, and behavior.

===Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment===
Job satisfaction is a very important aspect into the amount of work and time a person is willing to put into a job.  The five measurements to insure job satisfaction are: pay, the work itself, promotion opportunities, supervision, and coworkers.  Different aspects are more important to different types of people.  Managers in an organization can you different methods to test job satisfaction.  Two possible ways are the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) or the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ).  There is a common thought that satisfied employees are more productive workers.  Whether satisfied employees have better performance, or employees with good performance will have satisfaction, there has been no proven links between the two.  There are plenty of high performers who are not satisfied with their jobs to prove these theories to be true.  Rewards that are contingent on performance can also enhance satisfaction in a job.  
When a person goes above and beyond their call of duty to help a coworker out, it can be called an Organizational Citizenship Behavior (or OCB; see Bommer, Miles, and Grover 2003).  “Social information processing is predicated on the notion that people form ideas based on information drawn from their immediate environment, and the behavior of coworkers is a very salient component of an employee’s environment.  Therefore, observing frequent citizenship episodes with in a workgroup is likely to lead to attitudes that such OCB is normal and appropriate.  Consequently, the individual is likely to replicate this ‘normal’ behavior.”  This is according to an article in the Journal of Organizational Behavior.  This shows that people learn from their environments.  Culture also has a big part to play in job satisfaction.  People from different parts of the world may have a different view on the importance of work compared to family.  In America, people tend to have their jobs as a central part of their life, as to Koreans who put family first.

===Source, Target, and Message===
Organizational commitments are what will influence a person to remain at a job.  There are three different types of organizational commitment: affective, continuance, and normative.  The affective commitment has to do with a person’s loyalty to their place of work.  Continuance commitment is when a person might stay at a job because they have put so much into it, and feel that they might loose a great deal of investments if they leave.  A normative commitment is when an employee feels obligated to stay with the company.  When an employer involves their employees in decision making, and makes them feel needed, the chances of them leaving is less than if they did not.  Affective and normative commitment people tend to have a lower absence at work.  Employees want to know that their employers do care about their well being, and that they share their same values.  The best way to make sure that employees are satisfied and committed is to talk to them, or give them job satisfaction tests, then change things in the organization accordingly.

===Instrumental and Terminal Values===
There are two states of values, Instrumental and Terminal values. Instrumental values are different behaviors that are used to achieve a goal or end; Honesty, ambition, obedience, politeness and etcetera. Terminal values would be the end states attained through; ambition, quality, liberty, prosperity, social respect.

===Managing in Globalization===
Just as there are different countries throughout the world, there are many different value systems.  In today’s world, globalization is taking a bigger and bigger role, making it very important for these different groups to recognize and thoughtfully respect those values of their customers or associates even though they do not have the same values. Managers must learn that when working with these adverse values in their company, to avoid pre-judging the adverse values that they come into contact with throughout the course of their work. Values are culturally based.  In a global society, tolerance is one of the most important aspects.  When tolerance is not thoughtfully recognized it has the potential to divide societies from one another.

===Ethical Behavior===
First, ethics is the concept of having moral values and behaviors.  Ethical behavior is conducting ones self in a way that is common with a certain set of values whether personal or institutional.  Businesses are dependent on their reputations, so when a company withholds strong ethical values it brings positive results.  One effect of ethical behavior is the retention and attraction of employees.  Employee turnover tends to be lower as well as an increase in applicants resulting in higher qualified employees.  Unethical behavior can hurt a company, so through technology businesses are able to monitor Internet content.

In a business, there are individual and organizational influences that affect ethical behavior.  The individual influences are value systems, which is a persons own set of moral values, locus control, which is a personality trait distinguishable between personal responsibility and fate or by chance, Machiavellianism, which is another personality trait where a person will do whatever it takes to get their way, and finally, cognitive moral development, which is a person stage of maturity.  The organizational influences are a businesses own code of conduct, an ethics committee or officers, training programs, an ethics communication system, norms amongst the business, modeling, and a rewards and punishment system.

The individual influences of a company are extremely important for running a business with ethical behavior.  Value systems are vital because ones ethics may be different that that of the company.  This could be a serious conflict of interest.  For example is a dishonest person is presented with a situation to lie for financial reasons will he follow his own ethical behavior or the organizations?  The individual might think why be honest if honesty doesn’t pay? (A. Bhide &amp; H. H. Stevens, 121)  External locus of control where a individual believes that their actions are a result of an unknown force or chance can be damaging to ethical behavior because the individual doesn’t accept responsibility like internal locus control.  Machiavellianism is not a standard of ethical behavior because the main method is being able to manipulate others around you for your own benefit rather than the organization.  Cognitive moral development affects ethical behavior amongst an organization depending on the level an individual is at.  Level 1 or premoral level, the individual bases their judgments on rewards and punishments.  Level 2 is where the individual follows policy only if it is in their best interests.  Level 3, people just perform to impress those close to them.  Level 4 is where the individual starts to realize what the organization wants from them so they start to contribute in an all around positive way.  Level 5, people are aware that others have different ways of thinking but hold onto their own.  Finally, level 6, an individual will choose their own ethical behavior over a policy or law.

==Stress==

===What is Stress?===
Stress does not have an exact meaning. There are many different ways to look at it. Stress or the response to stress is defined as,” the unconscious preparation to the flight or fight that a person experiences when faced with any demand” (Peterson 1995). The demand on your body is known as the stressor. Once the stressor is applied there are many reactions, psychologically, physically, behaviorally, and organizationally.

===The Four Approaches to Stress===
'''Homeostatic'''  (also known as the medical approach) was researched by Walter B. Cannon. He determined that our bodies have an emergency response, the flight or fight. He found that when aroused, the body goes out of homeostasis, the balanced state.

'''Cognitive''' Richard Lazarus emphasized that stress was caused by the environment that the person is in rather than the body itself. He found that people differ greatly in that respect.

'''Person''' Environment Fit approach-Robert Kahn focused on how expectations in a person’s life and their conflicting roles. The person becomes stressed when they aren’t able to meet the demands.

'''Psychoanalytic''' Harry Levinson took that Freudian approach. He believed that there were two parts being: #1 Ego-ideal, how they feel about their perfect self. #2 Self image, how they feel about themselves in respect to their perfect self. If there is any wrong thinking then there is stress because they feel that they cannot obtain that.

===The Stress Response===
What happens to the body when it is stressed?  These are the steps that your nervous system goes through and how your body and mind are involved.

1. Blood from the skin, internal organs, and extremities, is directed to the brain and large muscles.

2. Your senses are heightened: vision and hearing.

3. Glucose and fatty acids are forced into the bloodstream for energy.

4. The immunes system and digestive system are virtually shut down to provide all the necessary energy to respond.

===Work Stress===
Work stress is caused by demands and pressure from inside and outside the workplace.

====Four Categories of Work Demands====
1. '''Task Demands''' - the sense of not knowing where the job will lead you and if the activities and tasks will change. The uncertainty will cause stress: lack of control, concern of career progress, new technology, time pressures, are just some of the many that could cause stress.


2. '''Role demands''' -role conflict happens when there are inconsistent or difficult expectations put on the person resulting in:

A. Interole conflict-when there are two or more expectations or separate roles: parent and employee.

B. Intrarole conflict-more expectations of one role: fast paced and quality work.

C. Person-role conflict-ethics are involved: challenging personal beliefs or principles.

Role ambiguity occurs when a person is confused about their experiences in relation with the expectations of others.


3. '''Interpersonal Demands'''

A. Emotional issues-abrasive personalities, offensive co-workers.

B. Sexual Harassment-directed mostly toward women

C. Poor Leadership-management, lack of experience, poor style, cannot deal with all the power


4. '''Physical Demands''' many environments offer physically demanding jobs and work.

A. Strenuous activity

B. Extreme working conditions

C. Travel

D. Hazardous materials

E. Working in an office-tight quarters, loud, cramped

===Non-Work Demands===
Creates stress for work and the other way around creating stress outside of work.

'''Home Demands'''
Marriage children and other family relationships can add stress and overload making it a role overload according to the Academy of Management Journal
they state that when this happens this is,” an individual’s lack of personal resources needed to fulfill commitments obligations or requirements.”

'''Personal Demands'''
These are demands brought on by the person themselves. When the person takes on too much outside of work or just brings on too much work.

===Stress-Strain Relationships===

====Individual Differences in the Stress-Strain Relationships====
Individual differences play an important role in the stress-strain relationships.  Different individuals respond differently to types of stress, there are both eustress (good stress) and distress (bad stress).

====Gender Differences====
Life expectancy for American women is approximately seven years longer than men, which suggests that women may be more resiliant to stress than men.  Research (House, Landis, and Umberson 1988) has led to the suggestion that women not only respond to stress in a completely different way than men, they also encounter more stress - and are able to deal with it better.

====Type A Behavior Pattern====
Type A behavior are characteristics of personalities who are more affected by the stress-strain relationships than other personality types.  Type A behavior includes; sense of urgency, quest for numbers, status insecurity, and aggression and hostility.

====Personality Hardiness====
Personality Hardiness is a personality trait that is hesitant to distress and characterized by commitment, control, and challenge.  They are more capable to resist stressful events as opposed to those who are not hardy. Transformational Coping is an act used by hardy people that helps to change unhealthy stressful events, into ones that are less harmful to their life.

====Self-Reliance====
Self-reliance is a personality attribute that is an interdependent pattern of behavior related to how people form and maintain attachments with others.  Two insecure patterns of attachment are counterdependence, and overdependence.  Both of these patterns of attachment are unhealthy, and impair creating healthy relationships with others.  Through self-reliance, individuals are able to gain understanding with themselves, which helps them in their relation to their coworkers.

===Consequences of Stress===
Stress to the average person is usually looked at in a negative light.  However, all stress is not bad stress.  There are two very different forms of stress;  distress and eustress.  Some people thrive under pressure.  That is because they have figured out how to condition themselves for “stressful” situations.  This conditioning requires recovering energy.  When one practices what they know frequently, they most often perform well on a “stress test”.   Distress and eustress are the consequences of how one responds to and uses the stress that is applied to them.  There are benefits to eustress and there are costs to distress.  A healthy person would exude eustress.  The opposite would be true of an unhealthy person.  (Loehr and T. Schwartz 2001)

===Performance and Health Benefits===
A person’s overall performance with a any given task will have an optimum.  A point where the individual is most productive while still performing at a comfortable level.  In order to attain this optimum performance a certain level of stress must be applied.  Any amount of stress level leading up to the optimum point would be eustress.  Stress that would cause the person to overload and their productivity to drop would be distress.  If a person is training their body by lifting weights, they can only grow their muscles so fast before they reach their growing limit.  Once past that limit, an injury is bound to take place. 

===Individual Distress===
Individual distress manifests in three basic forms known as Psychological disorders, Medical illnesses, and Behavioral problems.  A person’s extreme involvement with their work could reap an acute individual distress.  Work - Related psychological disorders can lead to depression, burnout, and psychosomatic disorders.  Psychosomatic disorders are physical problems that stem from a psychological root.  A person could have a problem with public speaking; that problem would then be caused by so much stress that the persons brain would not allow the person to even speak.  An individual’s stress can manifest itself in other more physical manners.  Back aches, strokes, heart disease, and peptic ulcers are just a few ways that surface when too much stress is applied.  A person can also show behavioral problems as a sign of distress.  Some examples include aggression, substance abuse, and accidents.  This behavior could be cause by conflicts with others or with work.  It could also be brought on by variables outside of the workplace.  Psychological disorders, medical illnesses, and behavioral problems are extremely burdensome to the individual.  And when not taken care of will result in organizational distress.

===Organizational Distress===
Participation problems, Performance decrements, and compensation awards all have the ability to have very opposite affects upon an organization.  Participation problems such as absenteeism, tardiness, strikes and work stoppages, and turnover bring serious costs to a company.  Turnover, for example, can help or costs a company in a big way.  An employee is not performing up to par.  As a result he is fired and replaced with a more productive employee.  Unfortunately, the new employee was hired on at a higher pay rate than the previous.  The company has the productivity it needs, but at a cost.

==Motivation==

=== Expectancy Theory of Motivation ===
The basis of the expectancy theory of motivation is that people desire certain outcomes of behavior and performance, and that they believe there are relationships between the effort, performance and outcomes. The key points in the expectancy theory of motivation are the valence which is the value or importance someone places on a reward. The expectancy which is the belief that effort leads to performance and instrumentality which is the belief that performance is related to rewards. These are all important to a person’s motivation. Motivation problems came from the expectancy theory. The causes are a disbelief in a relationship between effort and performance, a disbelief in a relationship between performance and rewards and an overall lack of desire for the offered rewards. If a problem is with the person’s effort or performance, the persons belief should be changed. If the problem is with the reward, then the value of the reward or the reward itself should be changed.  “The Expectancy theory has held a major position in the study of work motivation.” (Van Eerde)

=== Theory Social Exchange and Equity===
This takes a look at what is behind our behavior, why are we motivated and why do we act the way we act.  When studying behavior, it is important to study exchange. There are three types of exchange relationships that people have with organizations.  

The first type is a committed relationship, such as a club or a religious gathering.  It is a relationship held together by moral obligation.  A committed relationship is a high positive intensity.  The second type of relationship, calculated, is a low positive intensity.  These are relationships based on demands and contributions.  A prime example would be business corporations who have a relationship based on their commercial and financial agreements.  Each organization in this type of relationships makes demands.  Demands are placed on the other organization in order to achieve an desired result.  However, in most cases, a demanding organization must also contribute, therefore intertwining the responsibilities, thus making it a team effort.Finally, the third type of relationship, alienated, is of high negative intensity.  

Within these relationships is inequity.  Inequity is roughly defined as a situation when a person thinks that they are receiving less than they are giving or vise versa.
According to Adams’s theory of Inequity, there are seven approaches to restore equity.  1) alter the person’s outcomes, 2) alter the person’s inputs, 3) alter the comparison other’s outcomes, 4) alter the comparison other’s inputs, 5) change who is used as a comparison other, 6) rationalize the inequity, and 7) leave the organizational situation. 
  
There are three types of people when categorizing them into their preferences for equity.  Equity sensitive people prefer an equity ratio equal to their own comparison other.  A benevolent person is content when the equity ration that is less than that of their comparison other.   Lastly, an entitled person is content with a ration that is more than that of their comparison other.

=== McClelland’s Need Theory ===
McClelland was intrigued by the thought of human needs and the reasons why one is successful. Before him though, Henry Murray had laid out most of the groundwork and made lists of motives and manifest needs. (H.A. Murray, 1938). McClellan took those ideas and organized them into three main categories of learned human behavior, which were called the manifest needs. The three main needs are the need for achievement, the need for power, and the need for affiliation. Each need is different for each person and varies throughout individuals. Sometimes it’s for the better and sometimes for the worse. 

The need for '''achievement''' is important in the fact that those with a higher need for it will ultimately become more successful. People with this high need are very concerned with doing their best work and setting goals to help them get there. If one does not have a high need for achievement, there is usually a lack in motivation which can be detrimental not only in the workplace, but also in ones’ personal life as well.

Next is the need for '''power'''. McClelland makes a very important distinction between socialized power and personalized power. Socialized power is normally benefiting to a group of people, benefiting to others, while personalized power is selfish and can be very destructive and self-consuming. With that in mind socialized power can be very helpful in the business area, specifically with managers. When a manager craves socialized power he is looking out for the benefit of the company and wants everything to be done correctly and quickly and in turn success is achieved. These type of managers themselves are also more likely to be promoted when a higher up member of the organization sees the hard work and influence the manager has made on employees.

Last is the need for '''affiliation'''. The need for affiliation mostly deals with interpersonal relationships. People with a high need for it expect a more personalized relationship with everyone; such as people sharing their wants needs and feelings while the person will do the same. This high need can be good in relationships, for example, if there is some type of conflict between a person with a high need and another, than the person with the high need if more inclined to work through the problem until it is solved and everything is good in the relationship. “Managers frequently commented that consistent definitions and formats are important aids to communication, especially between people in different organizational units such as divisions or departments.” (McClelland)

=== Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory ===
Frederick Herzberg conducted a study that describes the experiences that satisfy and dissatisfy people in the work place.  He wanted to know what motivates people to do well at work.  The two-factors that he found in this study were motivation and hygiene.  

He found motivation factors to be things like achievement, responsibility, advancement and growth.  He also described the hygiene factors to be things such as working conditions, status, technical supervision, policy and administration.  The one thing that he did find in common with the two factors was salary, which makes perfect sense.  With the two-factors combined in the work place it results in four different types of behavior.  When both factors are high there is nothing to complain about and the motivation is very good.  When both factors are low the person becomes very unmotivated and complains about everything.  The two-factors are not always on the high or low at the same time.  So, even if the motivation is high, there may still be a lot of complaining going on and vice versa (Herzberg).

==The Concept of Power==

===Symbols of Power===

When thinking about power one doesn't think about what represents power but, in every organization there are certain symbols of power. Bellow is some ideas of power and powerless symbols. Also, if someone that wants to over coming powerlessness the person that has power needs to share the power. The meaning of symbols, include an object or image that an individual unconsciously uses to represent repressed thoughts, feelings, or impulses. Power means, the possession of control or command over others. There are two different approaches associated with symbols of power.

[[Image:George-W-Bush.jpeg|right|thumb|200px|George Bush has power; what that means is that he can call us at anytime of the day and we will answer. Along with if he wants to meet us and we have a very important engagement we will drop it and see him. The power symbols are all there too.]]

One approach                  

'''Power'''
*A person that helps someone else in distress has power
*Giving someone a better procession in the organization constitutes a sign of power
*A person that can go greater than budget limitations without warning
*A manager acquires raises beyond standards for employee's 
*Raise issues for action
*Having information before anyone
*Top manager asking questions to lower level managers, hence The lower manager has power
*In doing something for someone else, one receives power

'''Powerless'''
*Excessively close administration
*Firm loyalty to regulations
*Doing a job themselves and not training an employee to do it
*People that have high profile positions
*Opposes change
*Safeguard their territory
*Focuses on cutting cost
*Penalizing others 
*Overbearing others
*Better than communication
*Negative events result in accusations against others

“Making external attribution of negative events, though often considered “self- serving”, also implies that the attributor is not in control of critical resource. We hypothesized that making external attributions for negative events will lead to impressions of powerlessness.” (Lee and Tiedens 2001)

The other approach 

'''Three symbols of power'''

Michael Korda has ideas of what power looks like; he writes about three of them. Objects in organizations such as furniture, clocks, watches, cell phones, and pagers are all symbols of power. 

The proposal that he give on &quot;Furniture&quot; is that a manager that has filing cabinets that are locked, confirm a critical and restricted files in the office. Conference tables that are rectangular demonstrate that the most important person sits at the head of the table, instead of a round table. Also, desk size displays the quantity of ones power; most executives have large expensive desks.

The second approach, he calls it “Time power” what this suggest is that if an executive and or manager that removes their watch and puts it on your desk face down illustrates that he or she has their time. As well as managers that do not wear watches shows that no one will start anything with out them. If we look at this the other way by, a manager always wears a watch shows that they feel less powerful. Also, a full calendar is proof of power, along with a planner displayed on the desks.

The third approach is call “Standing by,” what Korda proposes is that cell phones, and pagers, along with other communicating devises, explains that if a high top person can inflict on your time at any time of the day has power. In addition people that cause inconvenience to others; such as doing simple tasks for them.

===Sharing Power: Empowerment===
Empowerment is a positive aspect within an organization that promotes shared power. In order to grasp the complete essence of empowerment, there are four separate necessities that must be met.  
*Meaning suggests that one must have a sense of passion put into their work in order to feel empowered. 
*Competence is a component in the work place that keeps an employee confident with the ability to do a job well done. 
*Self-determination gives employees a certain trust-worthiness to handle the job independently. 
*Impact is a contributing factor that enables the workers to believe that their job has a meaningful purpose. Without these four dimensions present, one cannot feel empowered. 
	
Leaders within an organization can play a strong role in encouraging employees to put empowerment into practice. If leaders want to examine the possibility of an empowerment based company they need to have confidence in employees. This action should take place in order to set the bar at a high enough level. Employees should also be given the opportunities to make decisions. Rules and policies that get in the way of self-management need to become more lenient for a successful empowerment based organization. As well, leaders must set goals that can make one feel inspired.

One particular example of an empowered company is run by David Zipper and Peter Murray. Their organization began as a small painting business in run down areas of Philadelphia started by the two former economics students in 1999. The idea of the company is to empower its employees to the point where they own the company themselves. Since the renowned success of Empowered Painters, Peter Murray was awarded the Eli Segal Entrepreneurship award, and David Zipper received the Truman Scholarship.(Natsu, Furuichi, 2000)

Though the idea of empowerment can produce very successful results, the risks involved can be devastating. It is always safe to keep in mind, when giving up responsibility, there is a very real possibility of failure.

===Political Behavior in Organizations===
Political behavior and organizations doesn't always have to be negative.  However, most the time it is looked upon as such. It has been said that organizations are arenas in which people have competing interest. It is the manager's responsibility to be effective in reconcile competing interest.  Political behavior refers to actions not officially sanctioned by an organization that are taken to influence others in order to meet one person's goals.

Many people at the organizations are able to recognize and spot political behavior by their supervisor and at the top level of organizations. Many organizations encourage political activity these include unclear goals, autocratic decision making, ambiguous lines of authority, scarce resources, and uncertainty. Activity is often involved politics which includes performance appraisal process. Individuals who use power and organizations are organizational politicians.  Political behaviors can way on the negative side when used to maximize self interest which can lead to being inattentive to the concerns of others. We the employees feeling as if the workplace are less helpful and more threatening.

Several personal characteristics of effect of political actors; here are four of thirteen.   
*Articulate, must be able to clearly communicate ideas
*Popular, must be liked or admired by others at organization
*Extroverted, must be interested in what happens outside of his or her.
*Logical, must be capable of recently

Political organizational politicians can see the difference between ethical and unethical behavior.  They understand that relationships drive the political process and use power with a sense of responsibility.

;Influence tactics

There are three types of influence, upward referring to a boss, downward referring to an employee and lateral influence which refers to a coworker. Also, there are eight basic types of influence tactics.  The four most frequently used are consultation, rational persuasion, inspirational appeals, and ingratiation.  
Consultation, the person seeks your participation in making a decision or planning how to implement a proposed policy, strategy, or change.
Rational persuasion, the person uses logical arguments and factual evidence to persuade you that a proposal or requests is viable and likely to result in attainment of task objectives. 
Inspirational appeals, the person makes an emotional request for proposal that arouses enthusiasm by appealing to your values and ideas or by increasing your confidence that you can do it.
Ingratiation, the person seeks to influence you with a good mood or to think favorably of him or her before asking you to do something.

There is proven evidence that men and women view politics that influence attempt differently. The intended geopolitics behavior were federally that women do with both men and women witnessed political behavior they view it more positively if the agent is of their gender and the target is of the opposite gender. Not all tactics have negative affects there are some positivist be found. One example would be how small retailers often have incentive programs read get points for an amount of certain items you sell during that time. The person who sells the most usually wins a small gift or some type of bonus.  
“For example, research has shown that various aspects of performance-appraisal process itself can influence the mood states of the raters, and in turn, their ratings of employee.” (Hochwater)

=== Effective Power===
There is a fine line between using power effectively, over using the power, and being dependent upon power within an organization.  A manager must maintain positive relationships with everyone involved with the given company yet cannot become dependent on them; superiors, subordinate, peers, outside suppliers, customer competitors, unions, regulating agencies, the list goes on.  Being overly dependent can create vulnerabilities, and weaknesses, causing the organization to not run as smooth, or worse.  The entire above list has their own agenda and their own behaviors which it is the managers job to be able to adapt to them, which may in fact be the cause for dependency on people on that list. Dependency should not be associated as a negative term; dependency simply needs to be in moderation.  Managers should make sure all involved subordinates know exactly their roles, so he or she need not use generally ineffective tactics such as persuasion. Successful managers are sensitive cope with dependence by being sensitive to, avoiding unnecessary dependence, and establishing power. That power thus equals plans, organization, good staff, budgets, etc., etc. which good evaluations.  Effective management essentially comes down to the manager feeling a sense of obligation which trickles all around the company, and there should be a defined trust in the expertise of the manager, that his decisions are the correct ones.

==Leadership and Followership==

===Cultural Differences in Leadership===
With different culture every where, leaders need to be aware of these always so that they are combatable for what ever organization. Also, for an effective leader one needs to understand the culture he or she is about to venture into. Here is an example of cultural differences with diversity.
“Cross-cultural researchers and international managers concur with the view that a
diversity of management systems exist across contemporary Europe. In respect to
predicting future developments, Calori and de Woot interviewed 51 chief
executives of 40 large international organizations and concluded,that no advocate
of diversity denied the existence of some common characteristic and no advocate
of European identity denied some degree of diversity. On the basis of such
observations, it would appear that Europeans will have to live with at least some
diversity in management systems in the foreseeable future. Equally important to
note is the fact that societal cultural diversity in Europe remains unquestioned.
Indeed, it is frequently perceived to be preserved as much as possible.” (F. C. Brodback ''et al'')

==Conflict and Negotiation==
===Forms of Conflict in Organizations===
There are several different forms of conflict that can occur in an organization.  These forms include interorganizational, intergroup/intragroup, and interpersonal/intrapersonal.  One of these forms of conflict is very interesting, intergroup conflict.  This is considered conflict that occurs within a group.  This kind of conflict can have positive and negative outcomes.  Some of the positives are increased loyalty and group cooperation.  One negative to this form of conflict is that groups tend to be more competitive than individuals.  When a group is formed, as a whole the group tends to be more hostile than than just one of the individuals may be alone.  There have been two experiments done to delineate the domain of discontinuity.  The first was done by demonstrating its occurrence in a non-matrix situation.  This experiment, when implemented, did not show a significant difference than a matrix-only situation.  The second experiment used an analysis of degree of noncorrespondence of outcomes.  This experiment showed that as noncorrespondence increased, the rate of competitive responding by groups increased as well.  Individuals, however, did not increase.(Schopler, 2001)

===Conflict Management Strategies and Techniques===
Inevitably there will be conflicts surrounding and within an organization and 
how they are resolved can have a negative or positive effect.

'''Ineffective Techniques'''

''Nonaction''- This is when people do nothing in hopes that it will someday 
dissapear.

''Secrecy''- This is when a certain group of the organization try to hide the 
problem from the majority.

''Administrative orbiting''- This happens when people delay the conflict and tell others not to worry because it's being worked on.

''Due process nonaction''- This happens when a problem is too costly, or it will take to long, or is a big risk.

''Character assassination''- This action is to diminish an individuals/groups 
reputation and often leads to slander.

'''Effective Techniques'''

''Superordinate goal''- This is an organization goal that should be focused on by the conflicting parties rather than individual goals.

''Expanding resources''- This is where the conflict is limited resources, so the simple solution is to provide more.

''Changing personnel''- This happens when the conflict is pinpointed to an 
individual commonly with a low level emotional intelligence.

''Changing structure''- this is when the organization restructures and creates an integrator role, which becomes a moderator between the two conflicting parties.

''Confronting and negotiating''- this is when the parties confront and engage in an open discussion. there are negotiations in hopes of a mutually agreed upon compromise. 

'''2 major negotiating approaches'''

1)''Distributive bargaining''- Approach in which the goals of the parties are in conflict, and each party seeks to maximize its resources.

2)''Integrative negotiation''- This is when both parties want the outcome to be a win-win situation because both parties have wants.(Lewicki)

==Career Management==

===Ways To Manage Conflicts Between Work and Home===
Chapter seventeen, part six, discusses ways to manage conflicts between work and home. This section discusses how to manage a dual-career partnership. It talks about how difficult it is for a couple who both have important career goals, and who have the responsibility of taking care of children. When things get too hard for those in a dual-career partnership the text suggest that they ask family, friends, or professional help with childcare, or any other responsibility that they can not take care of themselves. When things get really complicated at work and home, like dealing with a mean boss or a sick child at home, the stress has a big effect on a person when they are at work and at home. It is very important for people who are in a dual-career partnership to have a flexible work schedule in order for them to be able to be there for there child when they are sick, or need to be picked up from school. “We are making it less likely for people to have families. It is just too punitive. There is no formal childcare. There is no structural support. It is highly expensive.”(Barnett, (p.2) it is almost impossible for both parents to manage a good career and to have a family.    

===The Psychological Contracts===
The psychological contract is an implied agreement between the employee and organization.  The employee expects certain things from the organization like salary and advancement within the company.  And the organization expects things like time and loyalty to the company.  This is not a written contract, they exist between individuals.  The psychological contract is important for newcomers in an organization.  They need to work out something effective in order to make good relationships in the company

===Occupational Excellence===
Years ago, many workers were able to begin working at a job at a young age and expect to remain in that career until retirement. Unfortunately, nowadays it sometimes takes many jobs until one can settle into a final career.  This specified method of “job hunting” is most commonly referred to as occupational excellence.  The text Organizational Behavior: Foundations, Realities and Challenges defines occupational excellence as “continually honing skills that can be marketed across organizations.”  Businesses used to frown on job histories littered by frequent job hopping, but it can now be considered a part of an individual’s personal training.  According to Lee (1998): “Career professionals agree that in terms of jobs, there are lots of opportunities worth taking risks for.” However, one is advised by business professionals to have a specified plan and reason for job hopping that will lead to a final and fruitful career.
By practicing organizational excellence, one can also help in their company’s organizational empowerment.  Organizational empowerment comes when an organization depends on and gives power to its employees to help remain competitive by being innovative and creative.  When an employee has experience outside of a company doing a similar task or job, they can offer possible different methods that can help keep a business both competitive and innovative.

==Organizational Design and Structure==

===15.1 Key Organizational Design Processes===
To eliminate confusion and to successfully complete the goals within an organization one has to use a design process which with bring together tasks, enhance communication and superior relationships among employees in departments. Differentiation and Integration are essential in the foundation of an organizational design process. Differentiation has many dimensions which permit a decision on how to decide work loads. There are three different forms of differentiation; horizontal, vertical and spatial horizontal. Large organizations commonly use these methods to create departments and specialized jobs. 

Integration is a process in which helps keep a dynamic balance within the organization. Integration has a vertical line which enables an individual to go up the hierarchical chart to get answers and find solutions to a problem. Vertical linkages will provide meaning and understanding to the individual and their job. Management information systems use vertical linkage between employee and manager to provide faster and more efficient communication. Information systems can definitely decrease the number of miscommunications and will allow the organization to focus more strongly on individuals, groups, departments and divisions to complete their tasks and goals. Horizontal integration provides links in organizations departments. Integration increases teams, roles and other integrator positions. Spatial differentiation gives organizations political and legal advantages within their country. In all horizontal, vertical, and differentiation are important structures for an organization because it shows the width, height, and breath or organization needs.

===15.2 Basic Design Dimensions===
There are six basic design dimensions of an organization. These are a way to establish a level of structural dimension from high to low and also develop a form of structure that is desired. One of these six basic designs is formalization. This is basically an employee’s role that is written down, such as a job description. Second of these six basic designs is centralization. Centralization is a form decision-making through out an organization. Third of these six basic designs is specialization.  Meaning, when tasks are turned into separate jobs making job titles spell out the job description. Forth of these six basic designs is Standardization. When this is used, a job is the same thing everyday with little change. Fifth of these six basic designs is Complexity. This happens when there are multiple activities going on within the organization and the job force is more complex. Lastly, the sixth basic design is hierarchy of authority. Hierarchy of authority are the different levels of management throughout an organization.

===15.3 Five Structural Configurations===
Organizational Structures are classified into 5 categories that were proposed by Mintzberg.  The 5 Structural configurations proposed by Mintzberg are:
Simple Structure- centralized form of organization that emphasizes the upper echelon and direct supervision. Most small business is run this way. 
Machine Bureaucracy – a form of organization that emphasizes the technical staff and standardization of work processes.
Professional Bureaucracy- decentralized form of organization that emphasized the operating core and standardization of skills. Hospitals are an example.
Divisionalized form – moderately decentralized of organization that emphasizes the middle level and standardization of outputs. This configuration is composed of divisions that have their organizations structure. 
Adhocracy – a selectively decentralized form of organization that emphasizes the support of staff and mutual adjustment among people.

===15.4 Contextual Variables===
There are four contextual variables in the design process of an organization. The number of employees is considered to be the size of the organization. Size is an integral part in design process of an organization. The second variable that is technology is anything an organization can use to make the outputs of the organization less complicated. Organizations must be careful with the installation of technology because it usually increases the complexity of the organization and the difficulty of the task at hand. Third is everything outside of the organization is considered to be the environment. Situations where circumstances are directly and indirectly associated with organization are also considered to environment. Last there are strategy and goals which are the plans and objectives of the organizational design. No one variable appears to be more important than the other but they must all be utilized together in the design of an organization.

Can procedures have no in/out parameters?  How is this coded?  (I think it doesn't need empty parentheses in the spec.  Is that right?  What about the body?).  Thanks!  [[User:150.203.2.85|150.203.2.85]] 00:33, 22 September 2006 (UTC)(User:Samwilson; not signed in, sorry.)

      <comment>/* PONG Demonstration */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">To begin programming games, a firm basis in the fundamentals of TI-Basic is needed. The explanations for the examples given here are meant to be a simple explanation, not a technical guideline. It is assumed that you will have enough understanding of TI-Basic to follow along with the simple explanation provided.

== PONG Demonstration ==

The following program is a simple game of Pong programmed in TI-Basic. I will explain every line afterwards, followed by a (more confusing) version optimized for size. Note that &quot;≤&quot; should be replaced with the less-than-or-equal-to sign (in the TEST menu), as well with the &quot;≥&quot;.&lt;!--Clarification needed:I'm not sure what this last sentence refers too; unless I'm mistaken, the less-than-or-equal-to sign is &quot;≤&quot;--&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
PROGRAM:PONG
:DelVar C
:DelVar G
:7→A
:8→B
:1→D
:-1→E
:6→F
:While not(C
:ClrHome
:Output(A,B,&quot;.&quot;)
:Output(8,F,&quot;--&quot;)
:If A=1
:-D→D
:If A=7
:Then
:If B≥F and B≤F+1
:-D→D
:End
:If B=1 or B=16
:-E→E
:(A=8)→C
:A+D→A
:B+E→B
:getKey→K
:F+(K=26 and F&lt;13)-(K=24 and F&gt;1)→F
:End
:Pause &quot;U LOSE&quot;
:ClrHome
:Output(1,1,&quot;&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Ok,  if you are totally lost right now, then just read on. The explanation:

&lt;pre&gt;
:Delvar C
:Delvar G
:7→A
:8→B
:1→D
:-1→E
:6→F
&lt;/pre&gt;
These first lines basically set all our variables to where they need to be before the program starts. Our &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; variables are the coordinates for our &quot;ball&quot;. The &quot;C&quot; variable is what keeps the entire loop running. The &quot;D&quot; variable and &quot;E&quot; variable are the variables that will change our ball coordinates. They allow us to use more efficient coding than using 1 and -1. The &quot;F&quot; coordinate is our horizontal coordinate for our &quot;paddle&quot;, so that it can move back and forth.

&lt;pre&gt;
:While not(C
&lt;/pre&gt; 
The not( command returns 1 (true) if the conditional is equal to 0.&lt;br&gt;
Same as using While C=0 (Only smaller).

&lt;pre&gt;
:ClrHome
&lt;/pre&gt; 
Refreshes the screen each time something moves (or at least each time the loop repeats).

&lt;pre&gt;
:Output(A,B,&quot;.&quot;)
:Output(8,F,&quot;--&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
This is the stuff you see. It tells the ball and the paddle to appear.

&lt;pre&gt;
:If A=1
:-D→D
&lt;/pre&gt;
tells the ball to &quot;bounce&quot; off the ceiling.

&lt;pre&gt;
:If A=7
:Then
:If B&gt;=F and B&lt;=F+1
:-D→D
:End
&lt;/pre&gt;
This step right here does a bunch of stuff in a little space. The first line checks if the ball is at the bottom of the screen. If the ball is, then it checks if the ball is on the paddle. If the paddle is there, then the ball bounces off.

&lt;pre&gt;
:If B=1 or B=16
:-E→E
&lt;/pre&gt;
This basically tells the ball to bounce off the right and left walls.

&lt;pre&gt;
:If A=8
:1→C
&lt;/pre&gt;
This is what makes you lose. This checks if the ball has hit the bottom of the screen. If it has, then the program terminates the loop.

&lt;pre&gt;
:A+D→A
:B+E→B
&lt;/pre&gt;
This step makes the ball move around the screen, by changing the coordinates.

&lt;pre&gt;
:getKey→K
:F+(K=26 and F&lt;13)-(K=24 and F&gt;1)→F
&lt;/pre&gt; 
This stuff is what makes the game tick. It is the user input step. I'll go a bit in depth about this, because its cool how compact this step is. the &quot;getkey→K&quot; stores the user keypress into K. Then, in the next line, F (the horizontal coordinate for the paddle) gets one added to it if the user presses 26 (right) and is less than 13 (right side of the screen = 16 - 3 (for the size of the paddle))&lt;br&gt;
an equality equation always becomes a &quot;one&quot; if it is true, and a &quot;zero&quot; if false, therefore if it is true, then it will move one in that direction, and if the user presses 24 (left) the same principle applies.


&lt;pre&gt;
:End
&lt;/pre&gt; 
This line is the line that defines the end of the loop that the main part of the program is running in.

&lt;pre&gt;
:Pause &quot;U LOSE&quot;
:ClrHome
:Output(1,1,&quot;&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt; 
These lines are what happens if you lose- it will display a message, clear the screen and of course prevents &quot;Done&quot; from being displayed. 

----

Here is the more optimized version:
&lt;pre&gt;
PROGRAM:PONG
:7→A:8→B
:DelVar C1→D
:-1→E:6→F
:Repeat C
:If A=1
:-D→D
:E-2Emax({A=7,B&gt;=F,B&lt;=F+3→
:E-2E(B=1 or B=16)→E
:A=8→C
:Output(A,B,&quot; //&quot;)1 space
:A+D→A
:B+E→B
:Output(A,B,&quot;.&quot;
:getKey
:F+(Ans=26)-(Ans=24
:If 15&lt;=Ans
:1
:If 0&gt;=Ans
:13
:Output(8,F,&quot;    //&quot;)4 spaces
:Ans→F
:Output(8,F,&quot;--&quot;)
:End
:ClrHome
:Output(1,1,&quot;U LOSE&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

That concludes our &quot;Pong&quot; demonstration, I hope you've learned something.

=== Note ===
A scoring system and other features can be added, but will be explained in later articles.
This program works very well, except that the cursor doesn't move fast enough.
In order to make the platform move faster, change:

:getKey→K
:F+(K=26 and F&lt;13)-(K=24 and F&gt;1)→F

to:

:getKey→K
:If (K=26 and F&lt;13)
:F+2→F
:If (K=24 and F&gt;1)
:F-2→F

This will make the platform skip over one more space, making the platform faster.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Geometry/Chapter 3''' is about logical arguments. 

==Symbolic logic==
An '''if-then statement''' or '''conditional statement''' is a statement formed when one thing implies another, but not necessarily the other way around. For example, ''if'' the electrical power goes out ''then'' you will not be able to use your computer. (When given premises like this, always assume they are true — conveniently ignore the fact that your computer may be a laptop with a battery). However, if you are unable to use your computer, that does not automatically mean that the power went out. It only means that the power ''may'' have gone out.

But what if your computer ''is'' usable? Then we know that there is power—after all, if there wasn't, you wouldn't be able to use the computer. This is known as a contrapositive. A '''contrapositive''' is formed by turning an if-then statement around and negating both parts, and it is always true given the truth of the original statement.

In order to understand contrapositives on a mathematical level, you need to know about implication. '''Implication''' is a way to phrase if-then statements to indicate that one thing implies another. It is represented by an arrow, here typeset as &quot;→&quot;. A statement using this arrow is known as a conditional statement, because the truth of the second value is conditional on the truth of the first. Not having electricity ''implies'' not being able to use your computer. Implication statements are only false when the first condition is true and the second condition is false. If both are true, it holds. If the first condition is false, the statement is considered [[w:vacuously true|vacuously true]] no matter what the second condition is.

You also may notice that both the conditions are negated. '''Negation''' is used to show that a condition is not true (also known as false), and is indicated by the &quot;~&quot; ([[w:tilde|tilde]]) symbol in front of the variable. Whether a given condition is true or false is known as its '''truth value'''. Note that a condition, represented by a variable, cannot be true and false at the same time. Anything that is always false is called a '''fallacy'''. Something that is always true is called a '''tautology'''. So not having electricity implying not being able to use your computer translates into symbolic logic as ~E → ~C. '''Symbolic logic''' is a system of logic using variables to represent conditions and symbols to represent the way the conditions are related. Now that we have put our conditional statement into symbolic logic, it is easy to see that the contrapositive is C → E.

You may also notice that there are other ways you can rearrange the variables and the tilde (&quot;not&quot; sign). One is to take the original expression and negate both sides, like you would an equation. Note that negating an already negated variable results in the removal of the not sign. This gives you E → C. This is known as the '''inverse'''; it inverts the truth values of the original statement. You also can switch both sides around, and not negate them like you would in a contrapositive. This gives ~C → ~E. This is known as the '''converse'''; it switches the values around. It's easy to see that these are contrapositives of each other, but are they the same as the original statement? No. This will be demonstrated by a truth table. A '''truth table''' is a table that accounts for all possible values (true or false) of all variables, and then gives results about whether a statement is true or false, given specific values for the variables.

First, let's review the nature of conditional statements, in table form. The truth tables we'll be using will use &quot;F&quot; to denote a false truth value and &quot;T&quot; to indicate a true truth value. We'll also use the generic conditional statement, p → q.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;8&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;background:lightcyan; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; width:45%&quot;
|+ '''Logical Implication'''
|- style=&quot;background:paleturquoise&quot;
! style=&quot;width:15%&quot; | p
! style=&quot;width:15%&quot; | q
! style=&quot;width:15%&quot; | p → q
|-
| F || F || T
|-
| F || T || T
|-
| T || F || F
|-
| T || T || T
|}
&lt;br&gt;

Now let's look at the truth table for the original statement, inverse, converse, and contrapositive. For clarity, we'll include the negated forms of both variables.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;8&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;background:lightcyan; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; width:65%&quot;
|+ '''Conditionals, inverses, converses, and contrapositives'''
|- style=&quot;background:paleturquoise&quot;
! style=&quot;width:10%&quot; | p
! style=&quot;width:10%&quot; | ~p
! style=&quot;width:10%&quot; | q
! style=&quot;width:10%&quot; | ~q
! style=&quot;width:15%&quot; | p → q
! style=&quot;width:15%&quot; | ~p → ~q
! style=&quot;width:15%&quot; | q → p
! style=&quot;width:15%&quot; | ~q → ~p
|-
| F || T || F || T || T || T || T || T
|-
| F || T || T || F || T || F || F || T
|-
| T || F || F || T || F || T || T || F
|-
| T || F || T || F || T || T || T || T
|}

Since the original statement and the contrapositive have the same truth values in all the rows, they are proven to be equal. The same applies to the inverse and the converse, which are equal to each other, but not the other two. A truth table is one way to prove a concept, and it is the only way to prove something in symbolic logic (though you don't always have to write the whole thing out). Notice, however, that if we know p and q have the same truth value (which value doesn't matter), both the original statement/contrapositive and the inverse/converse are true. That is, p → q and q → p. This can be simplified into a biconditional. A '''biconditional''' is when both a conditional statement and its converse are true, and it can be written p ↔ q. If you know a biconditional is true, you can also use one or both of the conditional statements that go into it. A truth table is one way to prove a concept, and it is the only way to prove something in symbolic logic.

We have just completed our first proof. In mathematics, '''proof''' uses logic, rather than observation, to state definitively that something is always true. (You can also prove something impossible and it's still considered proof). Something that is proved false is said to be &quot;disproved&quot;. This most often happens when someone finds a counterexample, which is where an exception is found and the formula does not hold, or work. The standards for proof in the mathematical community are very high, but anything that is proven is known to be true beyond a doubt. Anything that is proven is considered a '''theorem''', and may be used in the proof of other theorems. Anything that is not proven is known as a '''conjecture'''.

===Vocabulary===
* '''Implication''' - When one condition is deducible based on another.  Can be written p → q, and pronounced &quot;If P then Q&quot;.
* '''Truth Table''' - A way of visually representing a conditional for all values of the variables in that conditional.
* '''Contrapositive''' - The conditional created when negating both sides of an implication.  Can be written ~q → ~p, and said &quot;If not Q then not P&quot;.
* '''Fallacy''' - Incorrect reasoning in argumentation resulting in a statement that is not necessary true in all situations.
* '''Contradiction''' - Something that is always false (e.g. caused by contradicting assumptions)
* '''Tautology''' - Something that is always true.

==Exercises==
&lt;b&gt;1)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;If it is raining, then the dog is inside.&lt;/i&gt;  Create a truth table for this statement.

&lt;b&gt;2)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;If A, B, and C are the angles formed by a triangle, then A + B + C = 180°&lt;/i&gt;  Create a truth table for this statement.  &lt;i&gt;(Advanced students will note that this isn't always true for non-euclidean geometries)&lt;/i&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the reefkeeping hobby, many people take great pride in being able to bring in the ocean's denizens and have them living happily in their own homes. All the time, hobbyists strive to make their aquariums as natural as possible to mimic the natural habitat. However, one can never forget that you are keeping organisms in a place that is unnatural to them. The only way we are able to do this effectively is through the range of gizmos and gadgets invented to help make the job easier. In this section we shall discuss the technology and equipment that should be considered.

Keep in mind that the title of &quot;equipment&quot; is a vague one; this section will also discuss other non-living elements such as decor.

== Housing ==

There are a number of options to house your planned occupants in. Throughout the ages, fish have been kept in bowls, aquariums, ponds, and just about anything else that can hold any bit of water. Choosing what sort of container you wish to house your fish in is an important decision. However, for the purposes of marine aquaria, the aquarium is the most common choice.

=== Aquariums ===

'''Aquariums''' come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. What's the right one for you? There are a number of things to consider, such as volume, shape, footprint and surface area, and material. All of these variables play a role in deciding what sort of aquarium you should get, as well as others such as cost.

In terms of '''volume''', bigger is almost always better. In the ocean, mobile organisms are not restricted by having walls around them, and are free to move just about wherever they please. Fish, just like you and me, feel stressed in an environment that is too small for them; especially if you wish to keep more fish or larger species of fish, a larger tank gives you more space to work with. It is easy to overcrowd an aquarium that is too small. Another point about volume is that the more water there is, the more water exists to dilute any substances in the water. These substances may be waste products from your organisms, uneaten food left over, or some sort of accident. Having more water in your aquarium gives you more leeway in a lot of respects. In many ways, having a larger tank makes it easier as you can make a few more blunders and not have disastrous consequences. For this reason, small marine aquariums are actually more difficult to maintain; such aquariums are known as &quot;Nano&quot; Tanks or Reefs. There is no black-and-white division between &quot;Nano&quot; Tanks and your standard sizes, but beginners should avoid an aquarium of 20 gallons or lower. The beginner reefkeeper should consider a mid-sized aquarium of around 55 gallons. In the situation of aquarium size, there are very few situations where bigger is not better for your fish.

Aquariums come in all sorts of '''shapes'''. The standard aquarium shape is rectangular. However, other shapes exist as well. The most common other styles seen are hexagonal, where the base is a hexagon rather than a rectangle, and bowfront, where the front pane of the aquarium bows outward. Of course, the aquarium can also be custom-built to any shape specification. For the most part, shape of the aquarium is merely aesthetic, but the footprint, or surface area, is also an important factor.

'''Footprint''' and '''surface area''' are important to consider. The footprint is the amount of space that the tank's stand will take up on the floor. The surface area in this situation means the surface area of the water in the aquarium. In most aquariums, these two are just about the same. Of course, the footprint must be considered for looking for a proper location in the house to see if a fish tank will fit. However, the surface area is also important for two reasons. One, the surface is how gases such as oxygen enter and leave the water. Therefore, with more surface area, you get better gas transfer and therefore you can house more animals. Another reason is that many fish spend more time swimming horizontally than vertically; this means that the more surface area you have, the more swimming space is available. Because of these reasons, if you are comparing two aquariums of the same volume, you should opt for the one that has more surface area, as it will provide better gas transfer and more capacity for organisms overall. 

'''Material''' of the aquarium can make a difference as well. Today's aquariums are normally built out of either '''glass''' panes bonded with silicone or '''acrylic'''. Both types have their advantages and disadvantages. 

Glass is cheaper, more common in many standard shapes, and does not scratch as easily as acrylic. However, acrylic does not bend light in the same way as glass, giving a much better view of the inhabitants; for this reason, acrylic is common in many public aquariums where the aquarium wall must be very thick and so the bending of light would make it more difficult to see the organisms. Also, acrylic is less prone to leaking. This is because glass is bonded together by silicone (and visibly so, if you find silicone an eyesore). However, the seams of acrylic aquariums are bonded together by acrylic; in effect, an acrylic aquarium can be a single piece of acrylic, making it stronger. Acrylic is also lighter than glass. Acrylic also can insulate the water better than glass can. On the other hand, acrylic is often more expensive and scratches more easily (though the scratches on acrylic are much easier to fix than scratches on glass). Also, though acrylic is less prone to leaking and breaking than glass, water will cause acrylic to bow out; the stand must support the entire bottom surface of the aquarium, instead if just the edges for a glass aquarium. The choice is up to the hobbyist.

=== Ponds ===

''Ponds'' are much rarer in the marine hobby, but they do exist. A pond is usually considered to be housing that is on or sunk into the ground; usually, you are not able to see through the sides of a pond. Therefore, for a larger volume of water, a pond can be cheaper and more feasible than an aquarium. For species of animals such as stingrays or sharks that can be viewed well from above, a pond is a possible choice.

== Water Quality ==
=== Filtration ===
'''Filtration''' is a method or process by which system inputs are transformed or exported from the reef tank to help maintain livestock viability. There are many types of filtration methods, including '''Mechanical''', '''Biological''', and '''Chemical'''. 

Mechanical filtration refers to passing water through some sort of filtration media that will strain particles out of the water. Chemical filtration refers to using some sort of chemical or substance such as activated carbor to pick up or remove substances from the water. Biological filtration refers to using bacteria, like those important to the Nitrogen Cycle, to help remove some substances from the water. Many filtration systems have some combination of two or all three of these methods.

=== Protein Skimming ===
'''Protein Skimming''' is a water purification method where large molecules such as proteins are actually removed from the aquarium before they have the chance to break down. It works by creating a foam or a froth, similar to the action of waves at the shore.

=== Deep Sand Bed ===
A '''Deep Sand Bed''', sometimes shortened DSB, is a form of biological filtration. A sand bed that is at least 4&quot; deep is considered a deep sand bed. It functions by having an extremely high surface area near the upper layer of sand, which serves as a living space for aerobic bacteria that will convert ammonia to nitrites and then to nitrates. However, because the sand is deep, oxygen will not reach the lower layers, forming anaerobic pockets. In these pockets, anaerobic, denitrifying bacteria will form that allow for the conversion of nitrates into nitrogen gas.

=== Reverse Osomosis, Deionized, and Diatomaceous Earth ===
All of these are different ways of purifying water before you even mix the salt. Tap water is relatively impure, and to make sure we have the very best water, there are several purification methods available. Many people actually swear by using such pure water to mix their salt with, as it can help prevent many problems.

== Water Movement ==

Although often filtration provides a source of water movement, in the case of marine aquaria it is often not enough. Proper water movement is accomplished through the use of either '''powerheads''' or special machines that simulate waves.

== Temperature Control ==

Most of the organisms in the hobby do not live in room temperature conditions. The general majority of organisms originate from tropical locations, and a minority come from coldwater habitats. It is important to maintain the correct temperature so that your aquarium inhabitants are comfortable. 

=== Heaters ===

The '''aquarium heater''' is necessary to maintain an aquarium at tropical conditions of about 75 degrees Fahrenheit to 82 degrees Fahrenheit (24 °C to 28 °C). It is a simple glass or plastic tube containing coils of metal wire that heat up when electricity runs through it. A thermometer is built into the heater so that it shuts off at the appropriate temperature. Aquarium heaters are labeled for wattage. A general guideline is 5 watts per gallon; this can be achieved with either one heater or with multiple heaters. For many smaller aquariums, one is enough. However, having multiple heaters is a good idea in many situations, especially for larger aquariums. One, it allows you to spread out the sources of heat in the aquarium so it is not concentrated all in one spot. Secondly, in the event a heater fails or malfunctions in some way, there are other heaters to back it up.

When placing the heater in the aquarium, one should try to place them horizontally or angled in some way near the bottom of the aquarium, rather than vertical. To understand why, think about convection, or the phenomena of warm substances rising. If a heater is placed vertically, warm water at the bottom of the heater rises up and stays next to the heater. However, if the heater is placed horizontally, warm water will rise up away from the heater, allowing the heater to be more efficient. Because it is better to have the heater placed horizontally in this way, submersible heaters are a better choice than heaters that hang onto the edge of the aquarium.

Something else to consider is safety for your organisms. As a heater, one should expect this apparatus to get hot. However, sometimes organisms will touch the heater for just a little to long and burn themselves. This is especially a problem for softer-skinned organisms such as stingrays. There are some options for this. One is to purchase a heater guard; you merely put the heater guard on the heater tube so that the organisms can't touch the tube directly. Another option is to place the heater in the sump. Having the heater in the sump has the advantage of not only being out of the way of your aquarium inhabitants, but also being out of sight.

=== Chillers ===

Unlike the commonplace heater, the ''chiller'' is a more expensive piece of equipment, but necessary if one is considering keeping coldwater species.

== Lighting ==
===Flourescent===
====Normal Output====
====Very High Output====
===Metal Halide===
== Monitoring Gadgets ==
=== Thermometer ===
Temperature is one of the many important factors that needs to be monitored. A thermometer can be placed anywhere in the tank, but keep in mind that if circulation is slow, the temperature is likely to be different in some areas of the aquarium. The thermometer can also be placed in the refugium.

Thermometers can come as a sticker that attaches to the outside of the aquarium. Though convenient, these thermometers can be more inaccurate.

=== Hydrometer ===
=== Refractometer ===
=== Test Kits ===
== Decor ==
=== Substrate ===
One of the considerations for the marine aquarium is what to put on the bottom of the tank. In some cases, some people opt for a bare-bottom tank without a substrate, as this can be easier to clean. However, such a set-up is less natural, and so most aquarists decide to put some sort of substrate in.

==== Crushed Coral ====
Crushed coral has been the traditional substrate for marine aquariums for years. The degree to which the coral is actually crushed can vary, but otherwise they are the same. Because crushed coral is made up of the limestone skeleton of coral, it has the advantage of raising the hardness of the water, which helps resist pH decrease.

==== Coral Sand and Aragonite-based Sand ====
Coral sand and aragonite sand are both about the same. Like crushed coral, they both contain elements that help raise the hardness of water. Unlike crushed coral, though, the sands are much finer. Hey

==== Live Sand ====
Sand sold as Live Sand is usually a coral sand that supposedly contains bacteria or other living organisms in it, similar to rocks sold as Live Rocks. The sand itself is not alive, but it contains living organisms. It has the advantage of already harboring the bacteria necessary for good biological filtration on top of being able to raise the hardness of water.

=== Rocks ===
==== Live Rock ====
== Maintenance Equipment == 
There are times when the aquarist themself has to get down and dirty to keep the tank running smoothly, and here are some of the tools of the trade.

=== Gravel Vac ===
The gravel vacuum is a contraption that uses the concept of siphoning. By starting a siphon of water from the tank to another location, the gravel vac begins to suck up water and whatever is nearby. This is useful to help clear the substrate of particulate matter.

Gravel vacs come in numerous styles. One of the most common forms is a gravity-driven siphon, in which water is pulled from the tank to a bucket or something else that is lower than the aquarium. Another is a Venturi-driven siphon, which works by hooking up to the sink with a special attachment; by turning on the sink, a vacuum is created in the tube which sucks the water from the aquarium. Other, less common forms include hand-pumped or even battery-powered.

Gravel vacs, as somewhat hinted by the name, are mostly only effective in mid-sized substrates. Sand can be sucked away by a gravel vac, making them less effective if the substrate is sandy. Also, if there are a large number of rocks, the gravel vac can have a hard time reaching around to tighter corners.

=== Algae Scraper ===
Algae scrapers are items used to scrape away algae, usually off of the aquarium glass.

Algae scrapers also can come in a variety of forms. One form is a scraper on the end of a long stick, slightly reminiscent of a window squeegee and serves approximately the same purpose: to clean glass. However, the other option is the magnetic algae scraper, in which the aquarist handles a magnet on the outside, and another magnetic scraping piece follows inside the aquarium. There are even magnetic algae scrapers that float in case the magnets somehow get too far away from each other, making retrieval much easier.

One must be careful with algae scrapers and acrylic, as particulate matter such as sand caught in the scraper can cause scratches.

== Extras ==
Tried and true, here are a few things that aren't sold at your local fish store that just might come in handy.

=== Eggcrate ===
In the marine hobby, when we say eggcrate, we're not talking about the cartons eggs actually come in, nor are we talking about bumpy foam pads. What we mean by eggcrate are eggcrate grilles that are often used for air vents and fluorescent lights; plastic that forms criss-crossing lines. 

So what does eggcrate have anything to do with marine aquaria? Well lots. In fact, it can be the very foundation of a reef, pun intended. Eggcrate is placed underneath the rocks and buried in the substrate. By having eggcrate, you spread out the weight of the stones over the bottom pane of the glass.

You can purchase eggcrate at a hardware store.

=== Turkey Baster ===
No, it's not Thanksgiving. A Turkey Baster is actually a useful tool in the hobby. Using a turkey baster, you can suck up some small stuff without disturbing too much of the tank. On the other hand, you're able to target food or anything else at a certain organism without it having to float all over the tank. The ability to target with a turkey baster can actually become quite handy. Of course, don't use a turkey baster you're going to use for food with your aquarium, and vice versa.

=== Toothbrush ===
The quintessential cleaning tool, a toothbrush lets you get into those small places that is difficult to reach with just about anything else. Keeping an old toothbrush handy can help you out in a tight spot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To be a smart reefkeeper and make intelligent decisions, it is quite helpful to have a good understanding of some of the science involved. This section will give an introduction to some of the science to help give a better understanding to reefkeeping.

== Water Chemistry ==

When you look at clear water, do you ever stop to think about what's in it? Even that bottled distilled water or spring water isn't pure; there's usually something else in there. Having a good understanding of what's in water will help you understand better the environment within which aquatic organisms inhabit. 

=== pH ===

'''pH''' is a variable that measures how '''acidic''' or '''basic''' (also called '''alkaline''') a solution is, in terms of Hydrogen ions (hence the H in pH). The deep science of pH is not particularly important, but an aquarist should at least understand the basics (pun not intended), as the pH of the environment has a great effect on the organisms.

pH is a scale usually from 1 to 14. The lower the number, the more acidic. Conversely, the higher the number, the more basic. A pH of 7 is said to be neutral; this is the pH of pure water. Seawater is approximately a pH of 8.0-8.3, so it is basic. 

The pH of a solution can change. If a substance makes the pH become lower, it is said to be an acid. As you have probably guessed, a substance that makes the pH higher is called a base. If your pH is changing in some way, you can bet that some sort of acid or base is playing a role, depending on which the direction your pH is changing. We can use this very same property of being able to change pH to help control it and stabilize it at a pH we want.

=== Salinity ===

'''Salinity''' is the measure of the amount of salt in water. Of course, in the marine hobby, salinity is quite important. Salt balance is very important to all organisms; if you've ever seen salt put on a slug, you'll know why. Fluctuations in salinity can be quite dangerous, especially to simpler organisms that are not able to regulate their own salt balance. However, even fish can only take changes in salinity to a certain point.

The salinity of seawater is measured in a number of ways, including percent or ppt (parts per thousand). However, in the aquarium hobby, the most common way to express salinity is by specific gravity, which compares the density of substances to freshwater. Because density is temperature dependent, specific gravity readings are usually given for 25°C. Freshwater has a specific gravity of 1.000, while saltwater is about 1.021-1.025.

One final note is that salt does not evaporate. Therefore, as water evaporates over time from your aquarium, the salt remains, and therefore the salinity of your aquarium will increase slightly. It is important to keep adding freshwater to the aquarium to make up for evaporation.

=== Hardness ===

'''Hardness''' is a measure of mineral content. There are two types, '''General Hardness''' (GH) and '''Carbonate Hardness''' (KH). These systems were developed by the Germans, which is why these acronyms only loosely correspond to the words. If water is high in these dissolved minerals, it is called hard. If the concentrations of minerals are low, it is soft.

General Hardness is a measure of calcium or magnesium ions in the water, and its units are '''dGH''', or degrees of General Hardness. 1 dGH corresponds to 10 mg of calcium oxide or magnesium oxide in 1 L of water.

Carbonate Hardness is a measure of carbonate or bicarbonate ions in the water, and its units are '''KH'''. A degree of KH corresponds to 17.83 mg of (usually) calcium carbonate per 1 L of water. The units are in terms of calcium carbonate, but calcium bicarbonate also exists in water commonly, though each ion only counts half as much towards hardness as carbonate does.

Hardness can have an effect on the ability of pH to change; both carbonate ions are effective as buffers to keep pH basic. With a good level of hardness, the aquarium will resist shifting towards acidity. It is also important to keep the hardness steady and high as many shelled organisms such as molluscs build their structures from the hardness in the water. Soft water means that their shells will not be very well developed.

=== Dissolved Oxygen ===

As most of the organisms we care about keeping are indeed dependent on oxygen, '''dissolved oxygen''' is important. 

Oxygen moves between the water environment and the atmosphere through the surface. Therefore, the more surface area your aquarium has, the better. Oxygen transfer can be improved even further by water movement.

=== Nitrogen ===

Nitrogen refers to the '''nitrogenous wastes''' given off by organisms. The main ones of concern to us are '''Ammonia''' (NH3), '''Nitrites''' (NO2), and '''Nitrates''' (NO3). Ammonia is the most toxic, nitrites are the second-most toxic, and nitrates are much less toxic. In the marine aquarium, ammonia and nitrite should not be present at all. Nitrates may be present in Fish Only tanks as many fish are not as sensitive to nitrates, but the best would be to have very little or not to have any nitrates, especially in aquariums containing invertebrates.

See more about Nitrogen in the Nitrogen Cycle below.

=== Phosphates ===
'''Phosphates''' are a necessity of all organisms and are a basic part of many important molecules. However, the problem arises when there are excess phosphates in the water, which may lead to unwanted algae growth. This algae can be unsightly, but it can also grow other surfaces and grow over organisms which you may want. If the algae dies in the tank and decomposes enough, there will be less oxygen available due to the effect of this decomposition.

=== Total Dissolved Solids ===

== Ecology ==

=== Nitrogen Cycle ===

The '''Nitrogen Cycle''' describes the changes in nitrogenous compounds in the environment. Because many nitrogen compounds are toxic, it is important to know something about this cycle. Luckily, these nitrogenous compounds are converted to less and less toxic forms through this Nitrogen Cycle. We shall simplify the Nitrogen Cycle. 

If you start with your organisms, they release a compound known as '''ammonia''' as waste product or a product of decomposition. Ammonia is quite toxic and quite dangerous. Luckily for us, there exists a process known as '''nitrification''' by bacteria convert these waste products to less toxic forms. These bacteria live in aerobic conditions and benefit from the presence of oxygen. First the ammonia is converted to nitrites by ''Nitrosomonas''; this compound is still toxic. Next, nitrites are converted to nitrates by ''Nitrobacter'' or ''Nitrospira''. Nitrates are much less toxic compared to ammonia and nitrite. In an environment with a healthy colony of these nitrifying bacteria, ammonia and nitrites will reach 0.

However, as you guessed it, this leads to a build-up of nitrates. When it reaches higher levels, nitrates can become dangerous as well. The best way to remove nitrates is through water changes. In some aquariums though, another process exists as part of the Nitrogen Cycle to help reduce nitrates.

'''Denitrification''' is the process by which nitrates are converted back to nontoxic Nitrogen gas. This is also done by bacteria, but unlike nitrifying bacteira, denitrifying types of bacteria only live in anaerobic conditions without oxygen. In the marine aquarium, this means either a '''Deep Sand Bed''' or a '''Live Rock''', both which shall be discussed in further detail later. Both of these house anaerobic pockets that allow these bacteria to survive in your aquarium. They can contribute to removing nitrates from the water.

Plants are also able to take up nitrogenous compounds, removing them from the water. Plants are not generally popular in the marine aquarium hobby, however types of '''macroalgae''' are available for this job. In using macroalgae to reduce nitrates, to actually remove the nitrogenous compounds from the aquarium means to &quot;harvest&quot; the algae every so often.

=== Carrying Capacity ===
No matter what the environment is, there is a limit to the number of organisms that can live there. In ecology, the maximum number of animals a region can maintain is called the '''carrying capacity'''. This holds true for aquariums as well.

You cannot put too many animals into too small of a space. Eventually, the point will be reached where the animals produce too much waste or use up the resources available. In the aquarium, this usually shows itself as producing too much waste, as resource availability is less of an issue as food and such can be added daily. When too much waste is produced, the tank will be polluted and certain other organisms, usually unwanted, may start to grow, such as algae.

The environment is also limited by the amount of physical space available. You can only squeeze so many animals into a space before they begin to feel uncomfortable from not having enough room. This is especially true for fish, and less true for some of the invertebrates such as corals, which in their natural environment often live relatively close to each other. By not having enough room to itself or not having enough room to swim, an animal may become stressed. Some animals may be territorial, reducing the number of other animals that can be kept in the aquarium.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== For the new Marine Aquarist ==

So you are thinking about the hobby of marine aquaria? Obviously &quot;marine aquaria&quot; is somewhat ambiguous considering that there are many configurations that may still fall under the category of reef tanks. From the miniature &quot;Nano&quot; set-ups to massive systems in excess of one-thousand gallons, there are as many variations in the hardware and technique as there are in types and configurations of the livestock that are kept.

That being said, it should be a primary concern of yours to determine up front what your intentions are in the mid to long term with your aquarium. Unless you have a surplus of time or money, deciding up front and planning how to build your aquarium can make the difference between success and failure and, by extension, satisfaction or frustration. Simple decisions like whether to choose a particular type of protein skimmer or test kit can make massive differences over time in your enjoyment of the hobby.

It is important to study up so you can make knowledgeable decisions. Many mistakes can be made simply by not knowing any better. By doing a little research into the hobby you can avert disaster. This book gives an introduction to the marine hobby.

== Types of Marine Aquaria ==

Strictly speaking, a marine aquarium is purely defined by the amount of salt in the water. If your aquarium has water as salty as the ocean, it can be considered marine. There is no other prerequisite for the aquarium to be considered marine. You can have fish from a single region of the sea or you can have fish from all over the world. It makes no difference. Obviously, the term marine in the aquarium hobby is still quite a broad term. There are a number of configurations of marine aquariums, including Fish Only, Fish Only With Live Rock, Reef, and Nano.

'''Fish Only''', shortened '''FO''', refers to keeping an aquarium with only fish. Perhaps there may be some sort of decoration, but you are only keeping fish. FO is often the set-up for fish that will eat invertebrates, damage coral, or do not live in reef habitats. This set-up is by far the cheapest way to go.

'''Fish Only With Live Rock''', shortened '''FOWLR''', is a set-up where fish are kept with what is known as Live Rock. Live Rock will be discussed in further detail later, but it is basically rock with living organisms on it. Because of this, technically you are not keeping Fish by themselves. In a FOWLR aquarium, the aquarist may also add some other invertebrates. However, Live Rock has a price tag, and so FOWLR is generally more expensive.

A '''Reef''' refers to housing coral. This may or may not include fish. Keeping a reef is by far the most expensive configuration of marine aquaria. Many extra costs go into housing corals besides the corals themselves. On the other hand, housing a reef can be extremely rewarding as it is an extremely beautiful way in which we can mimic nature on our own homes.

The '''Nano''' configuration only refers to the size of the aquarium and nothing more; a Nano can be an FO, an FOWLR, or a Reef. There is no solid distinction, but a Nano aquarium is a relatively small aquarium. Because of their small size, Nano aquariums are more difficult to maintain and are virtually an experts-only area. 

Still, there are other categories.

A '''species''' aquarium refers to having only one species in the aquarium. This may be optimal in many cases, either if the species of interest is extremely delicate or requires very specific parameters, which is the case for housing most seahorses. On the other hand, a species tank may be the set-up if the species poses a danger to most other organisms that would be placed with it, such as sharks. 

A '''community''' aquarium refers to having a range of species in an aquarium, and is much more common than a species aquarium. It adds another layer of difficulty in having to figure out what organisms are compatible with each other, but it can also be more rewarding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Barachiel Arceneaux, I am a stutterer, I have been since I was a child. I remember the hardest words for me was anything with an &quot;I&quot; or a &quot;K&quot;. I eventually progressed with it all, stuttering only every now and then, but it came back. I am not ashamed of it, or embarrassed by it. It makes me who I am, and you should never be ashamed of who you are or what makes you an individual.

I can remember as a kid trying to get certain words out and how people would stare, just waiting for the finished product of my thoughts to present themselves vocally. I can also remember the other kids, listening to them talk without a problem and being jealous of them, and how I would revel when one of them got hung up on a letter sound, when that happened I suddenly felt as if I was no longer alone. Only a very few of the kids in my small catholic school ever made fun of me though, which I guess is a blessing, we were taught very stoutly that people should respect other people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==substitution cypher section inadequate==
This section is rather too informally written, makes some inaccurate statements (eg, about THE classical sub cypher being something and that that the same something was state of the art or thought unbreakable for a time). It requires revision accordingly. See the article on Wikipedia regarding polyalphabetic cyphers, and on substitution cyphers for more information.

As for Navaho code talking, it was in the tradition from WWi of using Native American languages for battlefield communication. Navaho was, linguistically, obscure and Hitler's attempt to send linguists to the US to anticipate such as use in a prospective War didn't work very well, as apparently few studied Navaho. It is also not a langauge easy for an IndoEuropean (ie, German or English) speaker to learn, or for that matter for a Uralic-Altaic language speaker to learn (ie, Japanese). In any case, the code-talkers superencrypted their communications with a voice code (including an alphabetic spelling code for words without an entry in the codebook) which made captured Navaho servicemen useless when set to interpreting the code-talker transmissions. Navaho has had a written representation for some time, but I don't know quite how far back it goes. In any case, the navaho population is large and widely distributed across a largely infertile region and illiteracy in any langauge has been a difficult problem. In the decades before WWII, the problem was worse. [[User:67.86.175.54|67.86.175.54]] 17:43, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{LaTeX/Top}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

LaTeX has to be configured and used appropriately when it is used to write documents in languages other than English.  This has to address three main areas:

# LaTeX needs to know how to hyphenate the language(s) to be used.
# The user needs to use language-specific typographic rules. In French for example, there is a mandatory space before each colon character (:).
# The input of special characters, especially for languages using an input system (Arab, Chinese, Japanese, Korean).

It is convenient to be able to insert language-specific special characters directly from the keyboard instead of using cumbersome coding (for example, by typing &lt;tt&gt;ä&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;\&quot;{a}&lt;/tt&gt;). This can be done by configuring input encoding properly. We will not tackle this issue here: see the [[LaTeX/Special Characters|Special Characters]] chapter.

Some languages require special fonts with the proper font encoding set. See [[LaTeX/Fonts#Font encoding|Font encoding]].

Some of the methods described in this chapter may be useful when dealing with non-English author names in bibliographies.

Here is a collection of suggestions about writing a LaTeX document in a language other than English. If you have experience in a language not listed below, please add some notes about it.

== Prerequisites ==

Most non-english language will need to input special characters very often. For a convenient writing you will need to set the input encoding and the font encoding properly.

The following configuration is optimal for many languages (most latin languages). Make sure your document is saved using the UTF-8 encoding.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
}}

{{Warning|In the following document we will assume you are using this configuration unless otherwise specified.}}

For more details check [[LaTeX/Fonts#Font encoding|Font encoding]] and [[LaTeX/Special Characters|Special Characters]].

== Babel ==

The {{LaTeX/Package|babel}} package by Johannes Braams and Javier Bezos will take care of everything (with XeTeX and LuaTeX you sould consider {{LaTeX/Package|polyglossia}}). You can load it in your preamble, providing as an argument name of the language you want to use (usually its English name, but not always):

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[language]{babel}
}}

You should place it soon after the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\documentclass&lt;!----&gt;}} command, so that all the other packages you load afterwards will know the language you are using. Babel will automatically activate the appropriate hyphenation rules for the language you choose. If your LaTeX format does not support hyphenation in the language of your choice, babel will still work but will disable hyphenation, which has quite a negative effect on the appearance of the typeset document. Babel also specifies new commands for some languages, which simplify the input of special characters. See the sections about languages below for more information.

If you call babel with multiple languages:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[languageA,languageB]{babel}
}}

then the last language in the option list will be active (i.e. languageB), and you can use the command
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\selectlanguage{languageA}
}}
to change the active language. You can also add short pieces of text in another language using the command
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\foreignlanguage{languageB}{Text in another language}
}}

Babel also offers various environments for entering larger pieces of text in another language:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{otherlanguage}{languageB}
Text in language B. This environment switches all language-related definitions, like the language 
specific names for figures, tables etc. to the other language.
\end{otherlanguage}
}}

The starred version of this environment typesets the main text according to the rules of the other language, but keeps the language specific string for ancillary things like figures, in the main language of the document. The environment &lt;tt&gt;hyphenrules&lt;/tt&gt; switches only the hyphenation patterns used; it can also be used to disallow hyphenation by using the language name 'nohyphenation'.

The [http://ftp.snt.utwente.nl/pub/software/tex/macros/latex/required/babel/base/babel.pdf babel manual] provides much more information on these and many other options.

== Multilingual versions ==

It is possible in LaTeX to typeset the content of one document in several languages and to choose upon compilation which language to output. This might be convenient to keep a consistent sectioning and formatting across the different languages. It is also useful if you make use of multiple proper nouns and other untranslated content.

=== Preamble ===

Add this into the preamble. Since you cannot do this easily in LaTeX, we are going to write it in Plain TeX.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
%% Required package.
\usepackage{ifthen}

%% TeX function that generates the language commands.
\def\localedef#1#2{
\ifthenelse{ \equal{\locale}{#1} }{
  \selectlanguage{#2}
  \expandafter\def\csname#1\endcsname ##1{##1}
  }{
  \expandafter\def\csname#1\endcsname ##1{}
  }
}

%% Selected language. Can be placed anywhere before the language commands.
\providecommand\locale{fr}

%% Language commands.
\localedef{de}{ngerman}
\localedef{en}{english}
\localedef{fr}{frenchb}
%% ...
}}

You can use as many {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\localedef}} as you want. You are free to choose the language command names. Keep it short since you are going to use it often.

For an explanation on the Plain TeX code, see [[LaTeX/Macros|Macros]].

===Usage===

Very simple: enclose the desired content in the appropriate language command.
Example:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\de{Guten Tag}
\en{Good day}
\fr{Bonjour}
}}

===Language choice on compilation===
You can choose the language on compilation, which might come in handy, especially if you want to generate different version of the document automatically.

Remove the language selection from the source and compile with
 latex '\providecommand\locale{en}\input{mydocument.tex}'
to output the english version of your document.

See [[LaTeX/Macros#Command-line LaTeX|Command-line LaTeX]] for more details.

===Alternative choice using iflang ===
The current language can also be tested by using the {{LaTeX/Package|iflang}} package by Heiko Oberdiek (the built-in feature from the babel package is not reliable). Here comes a simple example:
 \IfLanguageName{ngerman}{Hallo}{Hello}
This allows to easily distinguish between two languages without the need of defining own commands.
The babel language is changed by setting
 \selectlanguage{english}
== Specific languages ==
&lt;!-- please keep the list in alphabetical order--&gt;

===Arabic script===

For languages which use the Arabic script, including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Pashto, Kurdish, Uyghur, etc., add the following code to your preamble:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{arabtex}
}}
You can input text in either romanized characters or native Arabic script encodings.  Use any of the following commands and environments to enter in text:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\&lt; ... &gt;
\RL{ ... }
\begin{arabtext} ... \end{arabtext}.
}}

See the [[w:ArabTeX|ArabTeX]] Wikipedia article for further details.

You may also use the {{LaTeX/Package|Arabi}} package within Babel to typeset Arabic and Persian

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{cmap}
\usepackage[LAE,LFE]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[farsi,arabic]{babel}
}}

You may also copy and paste from PDF files produced with Arabi thanks to the support of the {{LaTeX/Package|cmap}} package.
You may use Arabi with LyX, or with tex4ht to produce HTML. 

See [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/arabic/arabi/ Arabi page on CTAN]

===Armenian===

The Armenian script uses its own characters, which will require you to install a text editor that supports [[w:Unicode|Unicode]] and will allow you to enter UTF-8 text, such as [http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/ Texmaker] or [http://www.winedt.com/ WinEdt]. These text editors should then be configured to compile using XeLaTeX.

Once the text editor is set up to compile with XeLaTeX, the {{LaTeX/Package|fontspec}} package can be used to write in Armenian:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{DejaVu Serif}
}}

or

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Sylfaen}
}}

The Sylfaen font lacks italic and bold, but DejaVu Serif supports them.

See [[:hy:ԼաՏեԽ/Բարև աշխարհ|Armenian Wikibooks]] for further details, especially on how to configure the Unicode supporting text editors to compile with XeLaTeX.

===Cyrillic script===

Version 3.7h of {{LaTeX/Package|babel}} includes support for the &lt;tt&gt;T2*&lt;/tt&gt; encodings and for typesetting Bulgarian, Russian and Ukrainian texts using Cyrillic letters&lt;ref name=&quot;notSoShortIntro&quot;&gt;[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX], 2.5.6 Support for Cyrillic, Maksym Polyakov&lt;/ref&gt;. Support for Cyrillic is based on standard LaTeX mechanisms plus the {{LaTeX/Package|fontenc}} and {{LaTeX/Package|inputenc}} packages. AMS-LaTeX packages should be loaded before {{LaTeX/Package|fontenc}} and {{LaTeX/Package|babel}}. If you are going to use Cyrillics in mathmode, you also need to load {{LaTeX/Package|mathtext}} package before {{LaTeX/Package|fontenc}}:&lt;/tt&gt;

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{amsmath,amsthm,amssymb}
\usepackage{mathtext}

\usepackage[T1,T2A]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[english,bulgarian,russian,ukrainian]{babel}
}}

Generally, {{LaTeX/Package|babel}} will automatically choose the default font encoding, for the above three languages this is &lt;tt&gt;T2A.&lt;/tt&gt; However, documents are not restricted to a single font encoding. For multilingual documents using Cyrillic and Latin-based languages it makes sense to include Latin font encoding explicitly. Babel will take care of switching to the appropriate font encoding when a different language is selected within the document.

On modern operating systems it is beneficial to use Unicode ({{LaTeX/Parameter|utf8}} or {{LaTeX/Parameter|utf8x}}) instead of KOI8-RU ({{LaTeX/Parameter|koi8-ru}}) as an input encoding for Cyrillic text.

In addition to enabling hyphenations, translating automatically generated text strings, and activating some language specific typographic rules (like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\frenchspacing&lt;!----&gt;}}), {{LaTeX/Package|babel}} provides some commands allowing typesetting according to the standards of Bulgarian, Russian, or Ukrainian languages.

For all three languages, language specific punctuation is provided: the Cyrillic dash for the text (it is little narrower than Latin dash and surrounded by tiny spaces), a dash for direct speech, quotes, and commands to facilitate hyphenation:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Key combination !! Action
|-
|| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;{{!}}&lt;!----&gt;}} || No ligature at this position.
|-
|| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;-&lt;!----&gt;}} || Explicit hyphen sign, allowing hyphenation in the rest of the word.
|-
|| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;---&lt;!----&gt;}} || Cyrillic emdash in plain text.
|-
|| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;--~&lt;!----&gt;}} || Cyrillic emdash in compound names (surnames).
|-
|| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;--*&lt;!----&gt;}} || Cyrillic emdash for denoting direct speech.
|-
|| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;&quot;&lt;!----&gt;}} || Similar to {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;-,&lt;!----&gt;}} but it produces no hyphen sign (used for compound words with hyphen, e.g. {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=x-&quot;&quot;y&lt;!----&gt;}} or some other signs as “disable/enable”).
|-
|| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;~&lt;!----&gt;}} || Compound word mark without a breakpoint.
|-
|| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;=&lt;!----&gt;}} || Compound word mark with a breakpoint, allowing hyphenation in the composing words.
|-
|| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;,&lt;!----&gt;}} || Thinspace for initials with a breakpoint in a following surname.
|-
|| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;‘&lt;!----&gt;}} || German opening double quote (,,).
|-
|| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;’&lt;!----&gt;}} || German closing double quote (“).
|-
|| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;&lt;&lt;!----&gt;}} || French opening double quote (&lt;&lt;).
|-
|| {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;&gt;&lt;!----&gt;}} || French closing double quote (&gt;&gt;).
|-
|}

The Russian and Ukrainian options of {{LaTeX/Package|babel}} define the commands
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\Asbuk
\asbuk
}}
which act like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Alph&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\alph&lt;!----&gt;}} (commands for turning counters into letters, ''e.g.'' {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=a, b, c...&lt;!----&gt;}}), but produce capital and small letters of Russian or Ukrainian alphabets (whichever is the active language of the document).

The Bulgarian option of {{LaTeX/Package|babel}} provides the commands
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\enumBul
\enumLat
\enumEng
}}
which make {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Alph&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\alph&lt;!----&gt;}} produce letters of either Bulgarian or Latin (English) alphabets. The default behaviour of {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Alph&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\alph&lt;!----&gt;}} for the Bulgarian language option is to produce letters from the Bulgarian alphabet.

See the Bulgarian translation of &quot;The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;notSoShortIntroBg&quot;&gt;[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/bulgarian/lshort-bg.pdf The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX], Bulgarian translation&lt;/ref&gt; for a method to type Cyrillic letters directly from the keyboard using a different distribution.

=== Chinese ===

One possible Chinese support is made available thanks to the {{LaTeX/Package|CJK}} package collection. If you are using a package manager or a portage tree, the CJK collection is usually in a separate package because of its size (mainly due to fonts).

Make sure your document is saved using the UTF-8 character encoding. See [[LaTeX/Special Characters|Special Characters]] for more details.
Put the parts where you want to write chinese characters in a {{LaTeX/Environment|CJK}} environment.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{CJK}

\begin{document}

\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{gbsn}
你好
You can mix latin letters and chinese.
\end{CJK}

\end{document}
}}

The last argument specifies the font. It must fit the desired language, since fonts are different for Chinese, Japanese and Korean. Possible choices for Chinese include:
* gbsn (简体宋体, simplified Chinese)
* gkai (简体楷体, simplified Chinese)
* bsmi (繁体细上海宋体, traditional Chinese)
* bkai (繁体标楷体, traditional Chinese)

=== Czech ===

Czech is fine using
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[czech]{babel}
}}
UTF-8 allows you to have „czech quotation marks“ directly in your text. Otherwise, there are macros ''\clqq'' and ''\crqq'' to produce left and right quote. You can place quotated text inside {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\uv&lt;!----&gt;}}.

=== Finnish ===

Finnish language hyphenation is enabled with:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[finnish]{babel}
}}
This will also automatically change document language (section names, etc.) to Finnish.

=== French ===

You can load French language support with the following command:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[frenchb]{babel}
}}

There are multiple options for typesetting French documents, depending on the flavor of French: {{LaTeX/Parameter|french}}, {{LaTeX/Parameter|frenchb}}, and {{LaTeX/Parameter|francais}} for Parisian French, and {{LaTeX/Parameter|acadian}} and {{LaTeX/Parameter|canadien}} for new-world French. If you do not know or do not really care, we would recommend using {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=frenchb&lt;!----&gt;}}.

All enable French hyphenation, if you have configured your LaTeX system accordingly. All of these also change all automatic text into French: {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\chapter&lt;!----&gt;}} prints ''Chapitre'', {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\today&lt;!----&gt;}} prints the current date in French and so on. A set of new commands also becomes available, which allows you to write French input files more easily. Check out the following table for inspiration:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!input code
!rendered output
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\og guillemets \fg{}&lt;/tt&gt;

You may want to typeset guillemets and other French characters directly if your keyboard have them. Running Xorg (*BSD and GNU/Linux), you may want to use the &lt;tt&gt;oss&lt;/tt&gt; variant which features some nice shortcuts, like

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Key combination
!Character
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;Alt Gr + w&lt;/tt&gt; || «
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;Alt Gr + x&lt;/tt&gt; || »
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;Alt Gr + Shift + é&lt;/tt&gt; || É
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;Alt Gr + Shift + è&lt;/tt&gt; || È
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;Alt Gr + Shift + ç&lt;/tt&gt; || Ç
|-
|}

You will need the T1 font encoding for guillemets to print properly.

For the degree character you will get an error like
 ! Package inputenc Error: Unicode char \u8:° not set up for use with LaTeX.

The {{LaTeX/Package|textcomp}} package will fix it for you.

The great advantage of Babel for French is that it will handle some elements of French typography for you, especially non-breaking spaces before all two-parts punctuation marks. So now you can write:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
Il répondit: «Ce pain coûte-t-il 2~€?»
}}

The non-breaking space before the euro symbol is still necessary because currency symbols and other units or not supported in general (that's not specific to French).

You can use the {{LaTeX/Package|numprint}} package along Babel. It will let you print numbers the French way.
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\usepackage[frenchb]{babel}
\usepackage[autolanguage]{numprint} % Must be loaded *after* babel.

% ...

\nombre{123456.123456 e-17}
|render=
&lt;math&gt;123~456,123~456\cdot 10^{-17}&lt;/math&gt;
}}


You will also notice that the layout of lists changes when switching to the French language. This is customizable using the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\frenchbsetup&lt;!----&gt;}} command. For more information on what the {{LaTeX/Parameter|frenchb}} option of {{LaTeX/Package|babel}} does and how you can customize its behavior, run LaTeX on file &lt;tt&gt;frenchb.dtx&lt;/tt&gt; and read the produced file &lt;tt&gt;frenchb.pdf&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;frenchb.dvi&lt;/tt&gt;. You can get the PDF version on [http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/babel-contrib/frenchb/frenchb.pdf CTAN].

=== German ===

You can load German language support using ''either one'' of the two following commands.

For traditional (&quot;old&quot;) German orthography use
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[german]{babel}
}}

'''or''' for reform reform (&quot;new&quot;) German orthography use

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[ngerman]{babel}
}}

This enables German hyphenation, if you have configured your LaTeX
system accordingly. It also changes all automatic text into German, e.g.
“Chapter” becomes “Kapitel”. A set of new commands also becomes available,
which allows you to write German input files more quickly even when
you don't use the inputenc package. Check out the table below for inspiration.
With inputenc, all this becomes moot, but your text also is locked in a
particular encoding world.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+German Special Characters.
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;&quot;A &quot;O &quot;U&lt;/tt&gt; || Ä Ö Ü
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;&quot;a &quot;o &quot;u &quot;s&lt;/tt&gt; || ä ö ü ß
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;&quot;`&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;\glqq&lt;/tt&gt; || „ 
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;&quot;'&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;\grqq&lt;/tt&gt; || “
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\glq \grq&lt;/tt&gt; || 
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;\flqq&lt;/tt&gt; || «
|- 
|&lt;tt&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;\frqq&lt;/tt&gt; || »
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\flq \frq&lt;/tt&gt; || ‹ ›
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\dq&lt;/tt&gt; || &quot;
|-
|}

In German books you sometimes find French quotation marks («guillemets»). German typesetters, however, use them differently. A quote in a German book would look like »this«. In the German speaking part of Switzerland, typesetters use «guillemets» the same way the French do. A major problem arises from the use of commands like {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\flq&lt;!----&gt;}}: If you use the OT1 font encoding (which is the default) the guillemets will look like the math symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\ll&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, which turns a typesetter's stomach. T1 encoded fonts, on the other hand, do contain the required symbols. So if you are using this type of quote, make sure you use the T1 encoding.

Decimal numbers usually have to be written like &lt;tt&gt;0{,}5&lt;/tt&gt; (not just 0,5). Packages like &lt;tt&gt;ziffer&lt;/tt&gt; enable input like &lt;tt&gt;0,5&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Greek ===

This is the preamble you need to write in the Greek language. Note the particular input encoding.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[english,greek]{babel}
\usepackage[iso-8859-7]{inputenc}
}}

This preamble enables hyphenation and changes all automatic text to Greek. A set of new commands also becomes available, which allows you to write Greek input files more easily. In order to temporarily switch to English and vice versa, one can use the commands {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textlatin{english text}&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textgreek{greek text}&lt;!----&gt;}} that both take one argument which is then typeset using the requested font encoding. Otherwise you can use the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\selectlanguage{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} described in a previous section. Use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\euro&lt;!----&gt;}} for the Euro symbol.

=== Hungarian ===

Use the following lines:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[magyar]{babel}
}}

More information [http://www.math.bme.hu/latex/ in hungarian].

=== Icelandic and Faroese ===

The following lines can be added to write Icelandic text:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[icelandic]{babel}
}}

This changes text like ''Part'' into ''Hluti''. It makes additional commands available:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+Icelandic special commands
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;&quot;`&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;\glqq&lt;/tt&gt; || „ 
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\grqq&lt;/tt&gt; || “
|- 
|&lt;tt&gt;\TH&lt;/tt&gt; || Þ
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\th&lt;/tt&gt; || þ
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\DH&lt;/tt&gt; || Ð
|-
|&lt;tt&gt;\dh&lt;/tt&gt; || ð
|-
|}

=== Italian ===

Italian is well supported by LaTeX. Just add 
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[italian]{babel}
}}
at the beginning of your document and the output of all the commands will be translated properly.

=== Japanese ===

One possible way to write in japanese is to use Lualatex and the luatex-ja package. An example from the Luatexja documentation :
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{ltjsarticle}
\usepackage{luatexja} % ltjclasses, ltjsclasses を使うときはこの行不要
\begin{document}
\section{はじめてのLua\TeX-ja}
ちゃんと日本語が出るかな？
\subsection{出たかな？}
長い文章を入力するとちゃんと右端のところで折り返されるかな？
大丈夫そうな気がするけど．ちょっと不安だけど何事も挑戦だよね．
\end{document}
}}

You can also use capabilities provided by the Fontspec package and those provided by Luatexja-fontspec to declare the font you want to use in your paper. Let us take an example :
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
% **********************************
% Basic setup
\documentclass[10pt,a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{luatextra}%this package calls fontspec, luatexbase, lualibs, metalogo, luacode and fixltx2e
\setmainfont[Ligatures=Rare,Numbers=OldStyle]{Arno Pro} %setup of western font
\usepackage{luatexja}
\usepackage{luatexja-fontspec}%needed to call \setmainjfont bellow
\setmainjfont[BoldFont=KozGoPr6N-Bold]{KozGoPr6N-Regular} %setup of japanese font
%***********************************
\begin{document}
It is a test to show japanese and english mix. テスト中です。どうですか皆さん。
\end{document}
}}
Use UTF-8 as your encoding. In case you don't know how to do this, take a look at Texmaker, a LaTeX editor which use UTF-8 by default.


Another (but old) possible Japanese support is made available thanks to the {{LaTeX/Package|CJK}} package collection. If you are using a package manager or a portage tree, the CJK collection is usually in a separate package because of its size (mainly due to fonts).

Make sure your document is saved using the UTF-8 character encoding. See [[LaTeX/Special Characters|Special Characters]] for more details.
Put the parts where you want to write japanese characters in a {{LaTeX/Environment|CJK}} environment.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{CJK}

\begin{document}

\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{min}
こんにちは
You can mix latin letters as well as hiragana, katakana and kanji.
\end{CJK}

\end{document}
}}
The last argument specifies the font. It must fit the desired language, since fonts are different for Chinese, Japanese and Korean. {{LaTeX/Parameter|min}} is an example for Japanese.

=== Korean ===

The two most widely used encodings for Korean text files are EUC-KR and its upward compatible extension used in Korean MS-Windows, CP949/Windows-949/UHC. In these encodings each US-ASCII character represents its normal ASCII character similar to other ASCII compatible encodings such as ISO-8859-x, EUC-JP, Big5, or Shift_JIS. On the other hand, Hangul syllables, Hanjas (Chinese characters as used in Korea), Hangul Jamos, Hiraganas, Katakanas, Greek and Cyrillic characters and other symbols and letters drawn from KS X 1001 are represented by two consecutive octets. The first has its MSB set. Until the mid-1990's, it took a considerable amount of time and effort to set up a Korean-capable environment under a non-localized (non-Korean) operating system. You can skim through the now much-outdated http://jshin.net/faq to get a glimpse of what it was like to use Korean under non-Korean OS in mid-1990's. 

TeX and LaTeX were originally written for scripts with no more than 256 characters in their alphabet. To make them work for languages with considerably more characters such as Korean or Chinese, a subfont mechanism was developed. It divides a single CJK font with thousands or tens of thousands of glyphs into a set of subfonts with 256 glyphs each.

For Korean, there are three widely used packages.
* HLATEX by UN Koaunghi
* hLATEXp by CHA Jaechoon 
* the CJK package by Werner Lemberg

HLATEX and hLATEXp are specific to Korean and provide Korean localization on top of the font support. They both can process Korean input text files encoded in EUC-KR. HLATEX can even process input files encoded in CP949/Windows-949/UHC and UTF-8 when used along with Λ, Ω.

The CJK package is not specific to Korean. It can process input files in UTF-8 as well as in various CJK encodings including EUC-KR and CP949/Windows-949/UHC, it can be used to typeset documents with multilingual content (especially Chinese, Japanese and Korean). The CJK package has no Korean localization such as the one offered by HLATEX and it does not come with as many special Korean fonts as HLATEX.

The ultimate purpose of using typesetting programs like TeX and LaTeX is to get documents typeset in an ''aesthetically'' satisfying way. Arguably the most important element in typesetting is a set of welldesigned fonts. The HLATEX distribution includes UHC PostScript fonts of 10 different families and Munhwabu fonts (TrueType) of 5 different families. The CJK package works with a set of fonts used by earlier versions of HLATEX and it can use Bitstream's cyberbit True-Type font.

To use the HLATEX package for typesetting your Korean text, put the following declaration into the preamble of your document:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{hangul}
}}
This command turns the Korean localization on. The headings of chapters, sections, subsections, table of content and table of figures are all translated into Korean and the formatting of the document is changed to follow Korean conventions. The package also provides automatic ''particle selection''. In Korean, there are pairs of post-fix particles grammatically equivalent but different in form. Which of any given pair is correct depends on whether the preceding syllable ends with a vowel or a consonant. (It is a bit more complex than this, but this should give you a good picture.) Native Korean speakers have no problem picking the right particle, but it cannot be determined which particle to use for references and other automatic text that will change while you edit the document. It takes a painstaking effort to place appropriate particles manually every time you add/remove references or simply shuffle parts of your document around. HLATEX relieves its users from this boring and error-prone process. 

In case you don't need Korean localization features but just want to typeset Korean text, you can put the following line in the preamble, instead.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{hfont}
}}
For more details on typesetting Korean with HLATEX, refer to the HLATEX Guide. Check out the web site of the [http://www.ktug.or.kr/ Korean TeX User Group (KTUG)].

===Persian script===

For Persian language, there is a dedicated package called XePersian which uses XeLaTeX as the typesetting engine. Just add the following code to your preamble:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{xepersian}
}}

See [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/xetex/latex/xepersian/ XePersian page on CTAN]

Moreover, Arabic script can be used to type Persian as illustrated in the [[#Arabic|corresponding section]].

=== Polish ===

If you plan to use Polish in your UTF-8 encoded document, use the following code
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{polski}
\usepackage[polish]{babel}
}}

The above code merely allows to use Polish letters and translates the automatic text to Polish, so that &quot;chapter&quot; becomes &quot;rozdział&quot;.
There are a few additional things one must remember about.

==== Connectives ====

Polish has many single letter connectives: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, etc., grammar and typography rules don't allow for them to end a printed line.
To ensure that LaTeX won't set them as last letter in the line, you have to use non breakable space:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
Noc była sierpniowa, ciepła i~słodka, Księżyc oświecał srebrnem światłem wgłębienie, tak,
że twarze małego rycerza i~Basi były skąpane w blasku.
Poniżej, na podwórzu zamkowem, widać było uśpione kupy żołnierzy, a~także i~ciała zabitych
podczas dziennej strzelaniny, bo nie znaleziono dotąd czasu na ich pogrzebanie.
}}


==== Numerals ====

According to Polish grammar rules, you have to put dots after numerals in chapter, section, subsection, etc. headers.

This is achieved by redefining few LaTeX macros.

For books:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\renewcommand\thechapter{\arabic{chapter}.}
\renewcommand\thesection{\arabic{chapter}.\arabic{section}.}
\renewcommand\thesubsection{\arabic{chapter}.\arabic{section}.\arabic{subsection}.}
\renewcommand\thesubsubsection{\arabic{chapter}.\arabic{section}.\arabic{subsection}.\arabic{subsubsection}.}
}}

For articles:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\renewcommand\thesection{\arabic{section}.}
\renewcommand\thesubsection{\arabic{section}.\arabic{subsection}.}
\renewcommand\thesubsubsection{\arabic{section}.\arabic{subsection}.\arabic{subsubsection}.}
}}


Alternatively you can use dedicated document classes:
* the {{LaTeX/Environment|mwart}} class instead of {{LaTeX/Environment|article}},
* {{LaTeX/Environment|mwbk}} instead of {{LaTeX/Environment|book}}
* and {{LaTeX/Environment|mwrep}} instead of {{LaTeX/Environment|report}}.
Those classes have much more European typography settings but ''do not'' require the use of Polish babel settings or character encoding.

Simple usage:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{mwart}
\usepackage[polish]{babel}
\usepackage{polski}
\begin{document}
Pójdź kińże tę chmurność w głąb flaszy.
\end{document}
}}

Full documentation for those classes is available at http://www.ci.pwr.wroc.pl/~pmazur/LaTeX/mwclsdoc.pdf (Polish).

==== Indentation ====

It may be customary (depending on publisher) to indent the first paragraph in sections and chapters:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{indentfirst}
}}

==== Hyphenation and typography ====

It's much more frowned upon to set pages with hyphenation between pages than it is customary in American typesetting.

To adjust penalties for hyphenation spanning pages, use this command:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\brokenpenalty=1000
}}

To adjust penalties for leaving widows and orphans (clubs in TeX nomenclature) use those commands:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\clubpenalty=1000
\widowpenalty=1000
}}

==== Commas in math ====

According to Polish typography rules, fractional parts of numbers should be delimited by a comma, not a dot.
To make LaTeX not insert additional space in math mode after a comma (unless there is a space after the comma), use the {{LaTeX/Package|icomma}} package.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{icomma}
}}

Unfortunately, it is partially incompatible with the {{LaTeX/Package|dcolumn}} package.
One needs to either use dots in columns with numerical data in the source file and make {{LaTeX/Package|dcolumn}} switch them to commas for display ''or'' define the column as follows:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\begin{tabular}{... D{,}{\mathord\mathcomma}{2} ...}
}}

The alternative is to use the {{LaTeX/Package|numprint}} package, but it is much less convenient.

==== Further information ====

Refer the [http://so.pwn.pl/zasady.php Słownik Ortograficzny] (in Polish) for additional information on Polish grammar and typography rules.

Good extract is available at [http://dtp.msstudio.com.pl/typo.html Zasady Typograficzne Składania Tekstu] (in Polish).

=== Portuguese ===

Add the following code to your preamble:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[portuguese]{babel}
}}

You can substitute the language for brazilian portuguese by choosing {{LaTeX/Parameter|brazilian}}.

=== Slovak ===

Basic settings are fine when left the same as Czech, but Slovak needs special signs for 'ď', 'ť', 'ľ'. To be able to type them from keyboard use the following settings:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[slovak]{babel}
\usepackage[IL2]{fontenc}
}}

=== Spanish ===

Include the appropriate Babel option:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[spanish]{babel}
}}

The trick is that Spanish has several options and commands to control the layout. The options may be loaded either at the call to Babel, or before, by defining the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\spanishoptions&lt;!----&gt;}}. Therefore, the following commands are roughly equivalent:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\def\spanishoptions{mexico}
\usepackage[spanish]{babel}
}}

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[spanish,mexico]{babel}
}}

On average, the former syntax should be preferred, as the latter is a deviation from standard Babel behavior, and thus may break other programs (LyX, latex2rtf) interacting with LaTeX.

Spanish also defines shorthands for the dot and &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; so that they are used as logical markup: the former is used as decimal marker in math mode, and the output is typically either a comma or a dot; the latter is used for quoted text, and the output is typically either «» or “”. This allows different typographical conventions with the same input, as preferences may be quite different from, say, Spain and Mexico.

Two particularly useful options are {{LaTeX/Parameter|es-noquoting,es-nolists}}: some packages and classes are known to collide with Spanish in the way they handle active characters, and these options disable the internal workings of Spanish to allow you to overcome these common pitfalls. Moreover, these options may simplify the way LyX customizes some features of the Spanish layout from inside the GUI.

The options {{LaTeX/Parameter|mexico,mexico-com}} provide support for local custom in Mexico: the former using decimal dot, as customary, and the latter allowing decimal comma, as required by the Mexican Official Norm (NOM) of the Department of Economy for labels in foods and goods. More localizations are in the making.

The other commands modify the spanish layout after loading Babel. Two particularly useful commands are {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\spanishoperators&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\spanishdeactivate&lt;!----&gt;}}. 

The macro {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\spanishoperators{&lt;list of operators&gt;}{&lt;!----&gt;}} contains a list of spanish mathematical operators, and may be redefined at will. For instance, the command
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\def\spanishoperators{sen}
}}
only defines {{LaTeX/Parameter|sen}}, overriding all other definitions; the command {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\let\spanishoperators\relax&lt;!----&gt;}} disables them all. This command supports accented or spaced operators: the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\acute{&lt;letter&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}} command puts an accent, and the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\,&lt;!----&gt;}} command adds a small space. 
For instance, the following operators are defined by default.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
l\acute{i}m l\acute{i}m\,sup l\acute{i}m\,inf m\acute{a}x 
\acute{i}nf m\acute{i}n sen tg arc\,sen arc\,cos arc\,tg 
cotg cosec senh tgh
}}

Finally, the macro {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\spanishdeactivate{&lt;list of characters&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}} disables some active characters, to keep you out of trouble if they are redefined by other packages. The candidates for deactivation are the set {&lt;&gt;.&quot;'}. Please, beware that some option preempt the availability of some active characters. In particular, you should not combine the {{LaTeX/Parameter|es-noquoting}} option with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\spanishdeactivate{&lt;&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}}, or the {{LaTeX/Parameter|es-noshorthands}} with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\spanishdeactivate{&lt;&gt;.&quot;}&lt;!----&gt;}}. 

Please check the documentation for Babel or &lt;tt&gt;spanish.dtx&lt;/tt&gt; for further details.


=== Tibetan ===
One option to use Tibetan script in LaTeX is to add
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{ctib}
}}
to your preamble and use a slightly modified Wylie transliteration for input. Refer to the excellent package documentation for details.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Setting up the aquarium is not as simple as it seems. The process is a little more than &quot;Just Add Water.&quot;

When setting up your aquarium, it is important to take several factors into account. You will need to consider a proper support for the tank's weight, the nearby environment, and traffic. 

== Tips if you have a used aquarium ==

Before setting up a fish tank, you should test if for '''leaks''', especially if you received it second-hand. Simply find a location where you would not mind if it leaked, then place newspapers on the ground. Place your tank on the newspapers and fill it up with water, and let it sit for some time to make sure it doesn't leak. Judging by what area of newspaper gets wet, you can judge where the leak is.

== Location ==

As previously mentioned, the '''proper support''' for a tank is necessary. If you are placing an aquarium on something not built for aquariums, you should make sure that the structure is able to support it. Keep in mind, water weighs 8 pounds per gallon so a 100 gallon tank weighs over 800 pounds! An actual store-bought aquarium stand is the safe way to go, and can often be bought in color and wood to match your furniture. Aquarium stands are expensive for a reason. Don't be an idiot like me and think you can go buy wood and build your own (unless of course, you really do know what you're doing). Thrift stores and garage sales are good places to look; get something of a sturdy material, like metal. If you are selecting a stand for a 30 gallon tank, ask yourself if you could picture a sumo wrestler safely standing on it. 

You should also consider the floor that you are placing your aquarium on. First, as you will be performing maintenance in the area, you should expect some water to be spilled, but even if you don't, if the tank leaks the disaster is smaller. Secondly, especially if your tank is larger, you must think about if the floor structure is strong enough. Try to place the aquarium perpendicular to the support structure of the floor so that the most beams can share the weight.

The nearby environment includes other things such as lights, windows, radiators, and such. Anything that emits light too close to the aquarium may disturb the organisms as you turn them on and off. Radiators and other sources of heat or temperature change may effect the temperature of the water. Windows are an especially unwise place to put an aquarium. Though corals need bright light, sunlight can contribute to algal growth. Also, warm or cold air from the window can also effect the aquarium. 

Another factor to consider is '''traffic''' around the aquarium. Fish may be frightened by the moving around of people near the aquarium. It is best to locate the tank in a place to reduce this stress. On the other hand, putting the aquarium in the corner of the house you never visit isn't the best idea either.

Some aquarists actually place their aquarium in the wall, like a natural picture. Though it is a very good effect, there must be some room behind the wall to give access to the aquarium. Also, it means cutting a hole into the wall, which should be considered if you plan to sell the home later.

== Putting it together ==
Now, you've got your tank in the perfect position. Now you can actually start putting stuff inside!

To set up the tank, build from the bottom up. Place stuff that goes under the substrate down first. This can include an undergravel filter or eggcrate. Both of these things are optional, but if you have either, they should be placed first.

Next, the rocks and decorations are placed down. Make sure that they do not wiggle or budge, otherwise they will be more prone to accidents. Some people like to silicon their rocks together to make sure they don't budge, if their rocks are not live and wet. We put the rocks down before putting anything else down to make sure that they form a good support structure, lest your natural monument collapse on you.

After the rocks are all set in place, the substrate is put in, and then all of you equipment that hang onto or attached inside the aquarium. This way you can make sure everything is right without having to get ''too'' wet. After everything is in place, it is time to put in the water.

Use a plate or other solid surface and place it on your substrate or rocks. Pour your water directly on this plate. By doing this, the force of your pouring won't kick up the substrate. 

Congratulations, your tank is now set-up! But even so, you're not finished yet.

== Cycling ==

As talked about in the Nitrogen Cycle section, control of nitrogenous wastes is very important. This can only be done with bacteria, and if you just set up your tank, it's probably relatively sterile, which is not quite what we want if we want the nitrogenous wastes to be controlled.

These bacteria can be obtained in a number of different ways. One is live rock or live sand, both which house plentiful bacterial colonies. Another is a variety of products on the market that claim to have these such bacteria in solution, but the dubious claims of these likely snake oils should be taken with a grain of salt. The third is to get some substrate from an already up-and-running fish tank; this could be sand, gravel, or a piece of dirty filter pad. Or ask your friend to save you some dirty water the next time they clean their tank. The fourth is to let your tank sit, and eventually it will seed itself. 

In all of these situations, it doesn't do any good for the bacteria if the aquarium has no ammonia; otherwise, these bacteria will starve. In the case of the live rock or live sand, it actually perpetuates its own cycle as organisms off of the rock can die, decompose, and thus produce ammonia. However, in the case of using any sort of product or letting the aquarium passively gain bacteria, you must provide this food for them.

To provide ammonia, there are two main methods besides using live rock and sand. Another is to provide another organic ammonia source, such as a living thing, usually a fish. The fish will produce ammonia that will allow the bacteria to feed; however, if you are allowing your tank to gain bacteria on its own, the time it takes for bacteria to grow to a level that can keep the ammonia safe for this fish may be too long. However, this is a viable option, especially if one uses a relatively hardy species that can withstand higher ammonia or worse conditions, such as a Damselfish. Some people frown upon cycling with the use of fish as the fish experiences some stress as the bacteria build up to handle the ammonia.

Another method to add ammonia to the tank is a method known as Fishless Cycling. In this case, the aquarist uses straight ammonia; ammonia can be found at a dollar store pure. When trying to find &quot;pure ammonia&quot;, one should make sure that the ammonia contains no other substances than ammonia and water. A lot of cleaners contain chemicals such as surfactants (that make bubbles), dyes, coloring agents, fragrences, and a whole range of chemicals that you do not want in you aquarium. &quot;Pure ammonia&quot; is clear and smells quite bad, but for a fishless cycle it will do the trick. This ammonia will provide food for the bacteria without endangering a fish. Just add a couple spoons a day of ammonia to the aquarium to allow the bacteria to feed. '''Never''' add ammonia to an aquarium unless there is nothing living inside of it, because, as mentioned before, it is poisonous to most living things other than nitrifying bacteria.

After a couple weeks of this, cycling will be complete, and the aquarium should have built up a sizable colony of bacteria that can handle the waste products of the future inhabitants of your aquarium and make sure the nitrogenous compounds are converted to less dangerous forms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''What roles do fun and joy play in the learning process?'''

'''By: Felicia Carroll'''

Do you know that fun and joy in the classroom can motivate students to learn more effectively and enhance learning?  Enjoying your students and having fun with them is important to strengthen their development. While children constantly explore and experiment, a fun and exciting learning environment enhances learning. Making learning fun can minimize behavioral problems and energize students to become more effective learners.

According to Harris (1991) the best way to motivate students and make learning fun is to reward, explain, satisfy student needs, make learning visual, teach inductively, have students participate, care and use positive emotions to enhance learning and remember that energy sells.  Reward: correct answers and good behavior, its okay to give out happy faces.  Nahomy Dancy, Kindergarten Teacher at Dumfries Elementary believes that positive reinforcement challenges students to be more creative. Dancy says that she loves to use rewards, “they are great ways to keep students excited about learning”.  Everyone likes the feeling of accomplishment and recognition; rewards for good work produce those good feelings.

Besides rewards, Harris says “the important point is that extrinsic motivators can, over a brief period of time, produce intrinsic motivation.  A student who is intrinsically motivated undertakes an activity “for its own sake, for the enjoyment it provides, the learning it permits, or the feelings of accomplishment it evokes” (Leeper 1988).  An extrinsically motivated student performs “in order to obtain some reward or avoid some punishment external to the activity itself,” such as grades, stickers, stamps, candy certificates, verbal praises or teacher approval (Leeper 1988). Whether the student is intrinsically or extrinsically motivated, teachers should support the motivation to learn by making learning joyful and exciting. At the end of the day extrinsic motivators can, over time, produce intrinsic motivation.

Harris (1991) study found the following: Many students do poorly on assignments and participation because they do not know what to do or why they should do it.  As a teacher you must be able to explain the importance of the assignments or activitives.  Focus on what’s interesting and be enthusiastic about it.  Your enthusiasm will rub off on the students and they will likely become interested. Verbally noting the purposes of specific tasks when introducing them to students will have a positive outcome (Brophy 1986).  If teachers spend more time on explaining exactly what is expected on assignments and activities,  student’s who are uncertain about what to do will seldom perform well.

Harris believe that attending to the need satisfaction is a primary method of keeping students interested and happy as well as providing  better learning by attaching images to the ideas we want to convey.  One of those needs is caring.  Show students that you care.  Students attend to adults who appears too be a real person.  Students respond with interest and motivation to teachers who appear to be human and caring (Harris 1991).  As teachers we need to nurture student’s natural curiosity about the world by welcoming their questions, encouraging exploration, and familiarizing them with resources that can enlarge their world.   It is now your duty as an educator to give students the message that learning is fun, enjoyable and satisfying.  If you can make learning fun, exciting, happy, loving, or perhaps even a bit frightening, students will learn more readily and the learning will last much longer.  A fun environment allows us to think outside the box, take risk and have fun doing so, (Mickens).

Unfortunately, as children grow their passion for learning frequently seems to shrink.  Learning often becomes associated with drudgery instead of delight (Lumsden 1994).  According to Assistant Principle Maria Franzen in order to stop the shrinkage, “Educators must realize that fun and joy is not limited”. Fun and joy should be a big part of your instructional day or the motivation level of students will gradually cease.  So do we agree with Harris, when he says that teachers should make learning visual, teach inductively and use positive emotions to enhance learning?  I use visuals everyday in class to give students the opportunity to develop a mental framework or filing system that will help them to learn better and remember more.   As a teacher you should be able to teach inductively and use positive emotions to enhance learning and motivation.  Emotions can be created by classroom attitudes, by doing something unexpected or outrageous, by praise, and by many other means.  The day you come to class with a bowl on your head and speak as an alien observer about humans will be a day and a lesson your students will remember.  Don’t be afraid to embarrass yourself to make a memorable point (Harris 1991).  Teaching inductively increase motivation and maintain interest.  Start with examples, allow students to draw conclusions, generalize about them and make sense of them.

Awareness of how student’s attitudes and beliefs about learning develop and what facilitates learning for its own sake can assist educators in reducing student apathy.  According to Brophy (1987), motivation to learn is a competence acquired “through general experience but stimulated most directly through modeling, communication of expectations and direct instruction or socialization by significant others especially teachers”.  Research has also shown that good everyday teaching practices can do more to counter student apathy than special efforts to attack motivation directly (Ericksen, 1978). Most students respond positively to a well-organized course taught by an enthusiastic instructor who has a genuine interest in students and what they learn. Thus activities you undertake to promote learning will also enhance students' motivation. 

In conclusion, we must understand that good everyday teaching practices can do more to counter student apathy than special efforts to attack motivation directly (Ericksen, 1978). Most students respond positively to a well-organized course taught by an enthusiastic instructor who has a genuine interest in students and what they learn. Thus activities you undertake to promote learning will also enhance students' motivation.  Learning can be fun, exciting, sometimes thrilling, and highly emotional.  Learning experiences should provide as much fun and or enjoyment as possible. The key factor is to remember that energy sells.

If a doctor, lawyer, or dentist had 40 people in his office at one time, all of whom had different needs, and some of whom didn't want to be there and were causing trouble, and the doctor, lawyer, or dentist, without assistance, had to treat them all with professional excellence for nine months, then he might have some conception of the classroom teacher's job.

The United States is a society made up of many ethnicities, classes and races. Our country is considered by many to be the world's most successful mixed society but our education process in serving the children of this society is far from perfect. All student’s regardless of race or class deserve to have their needs addressed and met. As educators we must realize that for today's student to be successful, the educational process is one that now must incorporate the student's social and emotional needs, family and community.  The failure in this process is at the heart of our nation’s school/community disconnect.

Parental involvement is a vital link in the school/community connection and an important step in including families in the educational process.  Since family and school are a child’s first societal experiences, parents, schools, the community and the whole of society should agree on one idea: a child’s life success depends strongly on strengthening all areas of literacy, including social-emotional skills.(Allen and Cosby 2000). When home collaborates with school to implement Social Emotional Learning programs, students gain more.  Because students are constantly being exposed to and bombarded by mass culture messages from television, the Internet, music videos and other outlets unsupervised by adults, it’s important for parents and other caregivers in a child’s life to send opposite messages.(Elias 2006). For this reason, school and community resources have to be mobilized in assisting parents in providing home atmospheres conducive to education.  This is the most basic form of parental involvement in the education of their children. Parent should be given regular overviews of the academic and social-emotional skills students are learning at any time, arranging opportunities for parents and guardians to meet and exchange ideas on how to support their schools teaching,  how to parent and raise their child and how to organize homework routines, etc. (Elias, 2006)

Family composition needs to be recognized by schools as having an affect on a child’s learning ability and focus.  Family composition affects the amount of time children and their parents have to share with one another and can also affect how that time is spent.  A student from a single parent household knows their parent has to contend with the combination of working and maintaining a family. (Cooper and Ryan 2000). For working parents, time constraints often prevent school involvement.  Educators should make every attempt to plan school meetings, activities, and conferences at times when parents are available to attend.  These parents may not have a great of time to spend supervising homework enjoying their children. A school community connection of homework assistance by telephone, email or an after-school appointment would greatly benefit a student in this situation.

Some parents may have other reasons for not being as involved in their children’s schools.  A growing number of parents do not speak English or read it well enough to communicate with teachers and school staff.  Because of cultural differences, many parents are not familiar with the expectations of the school their children attend and don’t quite understand how to go about getting involved even they desire to.(Mapp 1997)  Still others parents feel they lack the education or skills needed to interact with their child’s teachers or staff personnel or have negative experiences from their own school days and are intimidated by and uncomfortable about going into schools.(Mapp 1997)
There will be problems in school due to the language barrier for parents or guardians who do not speak English.  A solution is to have a resource person at the school who can communicate with the parents in their first language.  The resource person could be either a teacher or a parent.  Educators also need to realize that some parents lack the ability to read or are embarrassed about their lack of schooling.  Teachers and staff should know that not all parents are able to read newsletters, school correspondence, field trip permission slips or (most importantly) homework assignments.  Teachers, therefore should not depend on the written communication as the only link to home.  Conferences, phone calls, home visits and other personalized contacts with parents are important. (Mapp 1997).

Another disconnection is school staffs’ failure to recognize or legitimize parents’ role in their children’s education.  Principals and teachers may claim interest in parental participation, but, in fact, grant parents only limited roles at the school and give signals that their feedback, time and opinions are unwelcome.  School staff are rarely trained on how to collaborate with parents and respect the diversity that all children bring to the school. (Mapp 1997)

In addition to fostering parental involvement and focusing on a student’s social and emotional learning, schools and communities may also be connected through community service.  Community service can play an important part in fostering a sense of belonging within a student.  Properly conducted community service begun at the earliest level of education, provides an opportunity for children to learn life skills and integrate them into their daily lives. Service opportunities usually are ways for students to encounter other people, ideas and circumstances in ways that broaden their sense of perspective and can build emphatic understanding and caring connections to the world around them. (Elias 2006). For many students community service is an opportunity to nourish a human need to be a generous and contributing member of important groups.

There are many ways and reasons for developing school, family and community connections.  These connections improve school programs and school climate, provide services and support to families, increase parental involvement and parent skills and leadership while connecting families and students with others in their schools and communities. (Epstein 1995) These connections also assist teachers with their workload.  Alleviating the disconnections create partnerships that assist students in succeeding in school and later life.  

The way our schools care about our children is reflected in the way schools interact with and care about their families, social emotional needs and communities.  If we, as educators, view students only as students we are likely to see the family as separate from the school.  We will then expect the family to do its job and leave the education of the children to the schools. However, if we look at students as children, we will be more likely to see both the family and the community as partners with the school in a child’s education (Epstein 1995.) Making sure schools and communities stay connected will help us to realize our shared interests in and responsibility towards the children.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">;What is an API?
To a programmer, an operating system is defined by its ''API''. ''API'' stands for ''Application Programming Interface''. An ''API'' encompasses all the function calls that an application program can communicate with the hardware or the operating system, or any other application that provides a set of interfaces to the programmer (i.e.: a library), as well as definitions of associated data types and structures. Most ''APIs'' are defined on the application ''Software Development Kit'' (SDK) for program development.

In simple terms the ''API'' can be considered as the interface through which the user (or user programs) will be able interact with the operating system, hardware or other programs to make them to perform a task that may also result in obtaining a result message.

;Can an API be called a ''framework''?
No, a ''framework'' may provide an API, but a ''framework'' is more than a simple API. By default a framework also defines how the code is written, it is a set of solutions, even classes, that as a group addresses the handling of a limited set of related problems and provides not only an API but a default functionality, well designed ''frameworks'' enable its interchangeability for a similar ''framework'', striving to provides the same API.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Abstract Classes ===
An abstract class is, conceptually, a class that cannot be instantiated and is usually implemented as a class that has one or more pure virtual (abstract) functions.

A pure virtual function is one which '''must be overridden''' by any concrete (i.e., non-abstract) derived class.  This is indicated in the declaration with the syntax''' &quot; = 0&quot;''' in the member function's declaration.

; Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class AbstractClass {
public:
  virtual void AbstractMemberFunction() = 0; // Pure virtual function makes
                                             // this class Abstract class.
  virtual void NonAbstractMemberFunction1(); // Virtual function.

  void NonAbstractMemberFunction2();
};
&lt;/source&gt;

In general an abstract class is used to define an implementation and is intended to be inherited from by concrete classes. It's a way of forcing a contract between the class designer and the users of that class. If we wish to create a concrete class (a class that can be instantiated) from an abstract class we must declare and '''define''' a matching member function for each abstract member function of the base class. Otherwise we will create a new abstract class (this could be useful sometimes).

Sometimes we use the phrase &quot;pure abstract class,&quot; meaning a class that exclusively has pure virtual functions (and no data). The concept of interface is mapped to pure abstract classes in C++, as there is no construction &quot;interface&quot; in C++ the same way that there is in Java.

; Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 class Vehicle {
 public:
     explicit
     Vehicle( int topSpeed )
     : m_topSpeed( topSpeed )
     {}
     int TopSpeed() const {
        return m_topSpeed;
     }

     virtual void Save( std::ostream&amp; ) const = 0;
 
 private:
     int m_topSpeed;
 };

 class WheeledLandVehicle : public Vehicle {
 public:
     WheeledLandVehicle( int topSpeed, int numberOfWheels )
     : Vehicle( topSpeed ), m_numberOfWheels( numberOfWheels )
     {}
     int NumberOfWheels() const {
       return m_numberOfWheels;
     }

     void Save( std::ostream&amp; ) const; // is implicitly virtual
 
 private:
     int m_numberOfWheels;
 };

 class TrackedLandVehicle : public Vehicle {
 public:
    TrackedLandVehicle ( int topSpeed, int numberOfTracks )
    : Vehicle( topSpeed ), m_numberOfTracks ( numberOfTracks )
    {}
    int NumberOfTracks() const {
       return m_numberOfTracks;
    }
    void Save( std::ostream&amp; ) const; // is implicitly virtual
 
  private:
    int m_numberOfTracks;
  };
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example the Vehicle is an abstract base class as it has an abstract member function. It is not a pure abstract class as it also has data and concrete member functions. The class WheeledLandVehicle is derived from the base class. It also holds data which is common to all wheeled land vehicles, namely the number of wheels. The class TrackedLandVehicle is another variation of the Vehicle class.

This is something of a contrived example but it does show how that you can share implementation details among a hierarchy of classes. Each class further refines a concept. This is not always the best way to implement an interface but in some cases it works very well. As a guideline, for ease of maintenance and understanding you should try to limit the inheritance to no more than 3 levels. Often the best set of classes to use is a pure virtual abstract base class to define a common interface. Then use an abstract class to further refine an implementation for a set of concrete classes and lastly define the set of concrete classes.

&lt;br /&gt;
An '''abstract class''' is a class that is designed to be specifically used as a base class. An abstract class contains at least one pure virtual function. You declare a pure virtual function by using a pure specifier (= 0) in the declaration of a virtual member function in the class declaration.
&lt;br /&gt;

The following is an example of an abstract class:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class AB {
public:
  virtual void f() = 0;
};&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Function AB::f is a pure virtual function. A function declaration cannot have both a pure specifier and a definition.&lt;br /&gt;

Abstract class cannot be used as a parameter type, a function return type, or the type of an explicit conversion, and not to declare an object of an abstract class. It can be used to declare pointers and references to an abstract class.
&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===== Arrays =====
An [[w:array|array]] stores a constant-sized sequential set of blocks, each block containing a value of the selected type under a single name. Arrays often help organize collections of data efficiently and intuitively.

It is easiest to think of an ''array'' as simply a list with each value as an item of the list. Where individual elements are accessed by their position in the array called its index, also known as subscript. Each item in the array has an index from 0 to (the size of the array) -1, indicating its position in the array. 

'''Advantages of arrays include''':
* Random access in O(1) ([[w:Big o notation|Big O notation]])
* Ease of use/port: Integrated into most modern languages

'''Disadvantages include''':
* Constant size
* Constant data-type
* Large free sequential block to accommodate large arrays
* When used as non-static data members, the element type must allow default construction
* Arrays do not support copy assignment (you cannot write &lt;code&gt;arraya = arrayb&lt;/code&gt;)
* Arrays cannot be used as the value type of a standard container
* Syntax of use differs from standard containers
* Arrays and inheritance don't mix (an array of Derived is not an array of Base, but can too easily be treated like one)

{{NOTE|note=If complexity allows you should consider the use of containers (as in the C++ Standard Library). You should and can use for example &lt;tt&gt;std::vector&lt;/tt&gt; which are as fast as arrays in most situations, can be dynamically resized, support iterators, and lets you treat the storage of the vector just like an array.

In C++11, &lt;tt&gt;std::array&lt;/tt&gt; provides a fixed size array which is guaranteed to be as efficient as an old-style array but with some advantages such as being able to be queried for its size, using iterators like other containers, and having a copy assignment operator. 

(Modern C allows VLAs, variable length arrays, but these are not used in C++, which already had a facility for re-sizable arrays in &lt;tt&gt;std::vector&lt;/tt&gt;.)

The ''pointer operator'' as you will see is similar to the ''array operator''.
}}


For example, here is an array of integers, called List with 5 elements, numbered 0 to 4. Each element of the array is an integer. Like other integer variables, the elements of the array start out uninitialized. That means it is filled with unknown values until we initialize it by assigning something to it. (Remember primitive types in C are not initialized to 0.)

{|
|-
|'''Index'''||'''Data'''
|-
|00||unspecified
|-
|01||unspecified
|-
|02||unspecified
|-
|03||unspecified
|-
|04||unspecified
|-
|}

Since an ''array'' stores values, what type of values and how many values to store must be defined as part of an array declaration, so it can allocate the needed space.  The size of ''array'' must be a &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; integral expression greater than zero. That means that you cannot use user input to declare an ''array''. You need to allocate the memory (with &lt;tt&gt;operator new[]&lt;/tt&gt;), so the size of an array has to be known at compile time.  Another disadvantage of the sequential storage method is that there has to be a free sequential block large enough to hold the array. If you have an array of 500,000,000 blocks, each 1 byte long, you need to have roughly 500 megabytes of sequential space to be free; Sometimes this will require a defragmentation of the memory, which takes a long time.

To declare an array you can do:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int numbers[30]; // creates an array of 30 integers
&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char letters[4]; // create an array of 4 characters
&lt;/source&gt;

and so on...

to initialize as you declare them you can use:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int vector[6]={0,0,1,0,0,0};
&lt;/source&gt;

this will not only create the array with 6 int elements but also initialize them to the given values.

If you initialize the array with less than the full number of elements, the remaining elements are set to a default value - zero in the case of numbers.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int vector[6]={0,0,1}; // this is the same as the example above
&lt;/source&gt;

If you fully initialize the array as you declare it, you can allow the compiler to work out the size of the array:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int vector[]={0,0,1,0,0,0};  // the compiler can see that there are 6 elements
&lt;/source&gt;

====== Assigning and accessing data ====== 
You can assign data to the array by using the name of the array, followed by the index.

For example to assign the number 200 into the element at index 2 in the array

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt; 
List[2] = 200;
&lt;/source&gt;

will give

{|
|-
|'''Index'''||'''Data'''
|-
|00||unspecified
|-
|01||unspecified
|-
|02||&lt;font color='red'&gt;200&lt;/font&gt;
|-
|03||unspecified
|-
|04||unspecified
|-
|}

You can access the data at an element of the array the same way. 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
std::cout &lt;&lt; List[2] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

This will print 200.

Basically working with individual elements in an array is no different then working with normal variables.

As you see accessing a value stored in an ''array'' is easy. Take this other example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int x;
x = vector[2];
&lt;/source&gt;

The above declaration will assign &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; the valued store at index 2 of variable &lt;tt&gt;vector&lt;/tt&gt; which is 1.

Arrays are indexed starting at 0, as opposed to starting at 1. The first element of the array above is &lt;tt&gt;vector[0]&lt;/tt&gt;. The index to the last value in the ''array'' is the ''array'' size minus one. In the example above the subscripts run from 0 through 5. C++ does not do bounds checking on array accesses. The compiler will not complain about the following:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char y;
int z = 9;
char vector[6] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
  
// examples of accessing outside the array. A compile error is not raised
y = vector[15];
y = vector[-4];
y = vector[z];
&lt;/source&gt;

During program execution, an out of bounds ''array'' access does not always cause a run time error. Your program may happily continue after retrieving a value from &lt;tt&gt;vector[-1]&lt;/tt&gt;. To alleviate indexing problems, the {{C++ Programming/kw|sizeof}} expression is commonly used when coding loops that process arrays.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int ix;
short anArray[]= { 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 };
  
for (ix=0; ix&lt; (sizeof(anArray)/sizeof(short)); ++ix) {
  DoSomethingWith( anArray[ix] );
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice in the above example, the size of the array was not explicitly specified. The compiler knows to size it at 5 because of the five values in the initializer list. Adding an additional value to the list will cause it to be sized to six, and because of the {{C++ Programming/kw|sizeof}} expression in the {{C++ Programming/kw|for}} loop, the code automatically adjusts to this change. 

====== multidimensional arrays ======

You can also use multi-dimensional arrays. The simplest type is a two dimensional array. This creates a rectangular array - each row has the same number of columns. To get a '''char''' array with 3 rows and 5 columns we write...

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char two_d[3][5];
&lt;/source&gt;

To access/modify a value in this array we need two subscripts:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char ch;
ch = two_d[2][4];
&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
two_d[0][0] = 'x';
&lt;/source&gt;

====== example ======

There are also weird notations possible:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int a[100];
int i = 0;
if (a[i]==i[a])
  printf(&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;a[i]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;i[a]&lt;/tt&gt; point to the same location. You will understand this better after knowing about pointers.

To get an &lt;tt&gt;array&lt;/tt&gt; of a different size, you must explicitly deal with memory using &lt;tt&gt;realloc&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;malloc&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;memcpy&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.

====== Why start at 0? ======
Most programming languages number arrays from 0. This is useful in languages where arrays are used interchangeably with a pointer to the first element of the array. In C++ the address of an element in the array can be computed from (address of first element) + i, where i is the index starting at 0 (a[1] == *(a + 1)). Notice here that &quot;(address of the first element) + i&quot; is not a literal addition of numbers.  Different types of data have different sizes and the compiler will correctly take this into account.  Therefore, it is simpler for the pointer arithmetic if the index started at 0.

====== Why no bounds checking on array indexes? ======
C++ does allow for, but doesn't force, bounds-checking implementations, in practice little or no checking is done. It affects storage requirements (needing &quot;fat pointers&quot;) and impacts runtime performance. However, the &lt;tt&gt;std::vector&lt;/tt&gt; template class, that we mentioned and  we will examine later in greater detail (a [[C++ Programming/STL#Containers|template class container]]), representing an array provides the &lt;tt&gt;at()&lt;/tt&gt; method, which does enforce bounds checking. Also in many implementations, the standard containers include particularly complete bounds checking in debug mode. They might not support these checks in release builds, as ''any'' performance reduction in container classes relative to built-in arrays might prevent programmers from migrating from arrays to the more modern, safer container classes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Boost Library ==
The [[w:Boost (programming)|'''Boost library''']] (http://www.boost.org/) provides free [[w:peer-review|peer-reviewed]] , [[w:open source|open source]] [[w:Library (computer science)|libraries]] that extend the functionality of C++. Most of the libraries are licensed under the [http://www.boost.org/more/license_info.html Boost Software License], designed to allow Boost to be used with both open and [[w:closed source|closed source]] projects.

Many of Boost's founders are on the [[w:ISO/IEC 14882|C++ standard]] committee and several Boost libraries have been accepted for incorporation into the [[w:Technical Report 1|Technical Report 1]] of [[w:C++0x|C++0x]]. Although Boost was begun by members of the C++ Standards Committee Library Working Group, participation has expanded to include thousands of programmers from the C++ community at large.

The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++ Standard Library. The libraries are aimed at a wide range of C++ users and application domains, and are in regular use by thousands of programmers. They range from general-purpose libraries like [http://www.boost.org/libs/smart_ptr SmartPtr], to OS Abstractions like [http://www.boost.org/libs/filesystem FileSystem], to libraries primarily aimed at other library developers and advanced C++ users, like [http://www.boost.org/libs/mpl MPL].

A further goal is to establish &quot;existing practice&quot; and provide reference implementations so that Boost libraries are suitable for eventual standardization. Ten Boost libraries will be included in the  [http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/ C++ Standards Committee's] upcoming  [http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/library_technical_report.html C++ Standard Library Technical Report] as a step toward becoming part of a future C++ Standard.

In order to ensure efficiency and flexibility, Boost makes extensive use of [[w:template (programming)|template]]s.  Boost has been a source of extensive work and research into [[w:generic programming|generic programming]] and [[w:metaprogramming|metaprogramming]] in C++.

* Workarounds for broken compilers

The current Boost release contains 87 individual libraries, including the following three:

=== noncopyable ===
The &lt;tt&gt;boost::noncopyable&lt;/tt&gt; utility class that [[C++ Programming/Classes#Ensuring_objects_of_a_class_are_never_copied|ensures that objects of a class are never copied]].

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class C : boost::noncopyable
{
  ...
};
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Linear algebra – uBLAS ===
Boost includes the '''uBLAS''' [[w:linear algebra|linear algebra]] library, with [[w:Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms|BLAS]] support for vectors and matrices. uBlas supports a wide range of linear algebra operations, and has bindings to some widely used numerics libraries, such as ATLAS, BLAS and LAPACK.

* Example showing how to multiply a vector with a matrix:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;#include &lt;boost/numeric/ublas/vector.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/numeric/ublas/matrix.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/numeric/ublas/io.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace boost::numeric::ublas;

/* &quot;y = Ax&quot; example */
int main () 
{
      vector&lt;double&gt; x(2);
      x(0) = 1; x(1) = 2;
 
      matrix&lt;double&gt; A(2,2);
      A(0,0) = 0; A(0,1) = 1;
      A(1,0) = 2; A(1,1) = 3;

      vector&lt;double&gt; y = prod(A, x);

      std::cout &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; std::endl;
      return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Generating random numbers – Boost.Random ===
Boost provides distribution-independent [[w:pseudorandom number generator|pseudorandom number generator]]s and PRNG-independent probability distributions, which are combined to build a concrete generator.
* Example showing how to sample from a [[w:normal distribution|normal distribution]] using the [[w:Mersenne Twister|Mersenne Twister]] generator:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;boost/random.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;

using namespace boost;

double SampleNormal (double mean, double sigma)
{
    // Create a Mersenne twister random number generator
    // that is seeded once with #seconds since 1970
    static mt19937 rng(static_cast&lt;unsigned&gt; (std::time(0)));

    // select Gaussian probability distribution
    normal_distribution&lt;double&gt; norm_dist(mean, sigma);

    // bind random number generator to distribution, forming a function
    variate_generator&lt;mt19937&amp;, normal_distribution&lt;double&gt; &gt;  normal_sampler(rng, norm_dist);

    // sample from the distribution
    return normal_sampler();
}
&lt;/source&gt;
See [http://boost.org/libs/random/ Boost Random Number Library] for more details.

=== Multi-threading – Boost.Thread ===
Example code that demonstrates creation of threads:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;boost/thread/thread.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std; 

void hello_world() 
{
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello world, I'm a thread!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) 
{
  // start two new threads that calls the &quot;hello_world&quot; function
  boost::thread my_thread1(&amp;hello_world);
  boost::thread my_thread2(&amp;hello_world);

  // wait for both threads to finish
  my_thread1.join();
  my_thread2.join();
  
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

See also [http://antonym.org/2009/05/threading-with-boost---part-i-creating-threads.html Threading with Boost - Part I: Creating Threads]

=== Thread locking ===
Example usage of a mutex to enforce exclusive access to a function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;boost/thread.hpp&gt;

void locked_function ()
{
    // function access mutex
    static boost::mutex m;
    // wait for mutex lock
    boost::mutex::scoped_lock lock(m);

    // critical section
    // TODO: Do something

    // auto-unlock on return
}

int main (int argc, char* argv[]) 
{
    locked_function();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Example of read/write locking of a property:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;boost/thread.hpp&gt;

/** General class for thread-safe properties of any type. */
template &lt;class T&gt;
class lock_prop : boost::noncopyable {
public:
    lock_prop () {}

    /** Set property value. */
    void operator = (const T &amp; v) {
        // wait for exclusive write access
        boost::unique_lock&lt;boost::shared_mutex&gt; lock(mutex);

        value = v;
    }

    /** Get property value. */
    T operator () () const {
        // wait for shared read access
        boost::shared_lock&lt;boost::shared_mutex&gt; lock(mutex);

        return value;
    }

private:
    /// Property value.
    T                           value;
    /// Mutex to restrict access
    mutable boost::shared_mutex mutex;
};

int main () {

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Classes ==
Classes are used to create ''user defined types''. An instance of a class is called an ''object'' and programs can contain any number of classes. As with other types, object types are case-sensitive. 

Classes provide ''encapsulation'' as defined in the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. A class can have both data members and functions members associated with it. Unlike the built-in types, the class can contain several variables and functions, those are called members. 

Classes also provide flexibility in the &quot;''[[w:divide and conquer|divide and conquer]]''&quot; scheme in program writing. In other words, one programmer can write a class and guarantee an interface. Another programmer can write the main program with that expected interface. The two pieces are put together and compiled for usage. 

{{NOTE|From a technical viewpoint, a struct and a class are practically the same thing. A struct can be used anywhere a class can be and vice-versa, the only technical difference is that class members default to ''private'' and struct members default to ''public''. Structs can be made to behave like classes simply by putting in the keyword private at the beginning of the struct. Other than that it is mostly a difference in convention.

The C++ standard does not have a definition for ''method''. When discussing with users of other languages, the use of the word ''method'' to represent a member function can at times become confusing or raise problems to interpretation, like referring to a static member function as a static method. It is even common for some C++ programmers to use the term method to refer specifically to a virtual member function in an informal context. 
}}

=== Declaration ===
A class is ''defined'' by:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
class MyClass
{
 /* public, protected and private
 variables, constants, and functions */
};  
&lt;/source&gt;

An object of type ''MyClass'' (case-sensitive) is ''declared'' using:

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
MyClass object;
&lt;/source&gt;

*by default, all class members are initially ''private''.
*keywords ''public'' and ''protected'' allow access to class members.
*classes contain not only data members, but also functions to manipulate that data.
*a class is used as the basic building block of OOP (this is a distinction of convention, not of language-enforced semantics).

;A class can be created
* before main() is called.
* when a function is called in which the object is declared.
* when the &quot;new&quot; operator is used.

;Class Names
* Name the class after what it is. If you can't determine a name, then you have not designed the system well enough.
* Compound names of over three words are a clue your design may be confusing various entities in your system. Revisit your design. Try a CRC card session to see if your objects have more responsibilities than they should.
* Avoid the temptation of naming a class something similar to the class it is derived from. A class should stand on its own. Declaring an object with a class type doesn't depend on where that class is derived from.
* Suffixes or prefixes are sometimes helpful. For example, if your system uses agents then naming something DownloadAgent conveys real information.

;''Data Abstraction''
A fundamental concept of Object Oriented (OO) recommends an object should not expose any of its implementation details. This way, you can change the implementation without changing the code that uses the object. The class, by design, allows its programmer to hide (and also prevents changes as to) how the class is implemented. This powerful tool allows the programmer to build in a 'preventive' measure. Variables within the class often have a very significant role in what the class does, therefore variables can be secured within the ''private'' section of the class.

=== Access labels ===
The access labels '''Public''', '''Protected''' and '''Private''' are used within classes to set access permissions for the members in that section of the ''class''. All class members are initially ''private'' by default. The labels can be in any order. These labels can be used multiple times in a class declaration for cases where it is logical to have multiple groups of these types. An access label will remain active until another access label is used to change the permissions.

We have already mentioned that a class can have member functions &quot;inside&quot; it; we will see more about them later. Those member functions can access and modify all the data and member function that are inside the class. Therefore, permission labels are to restrict access to member function that reside outside the class and for other classes.

For example, a class &quot;Bottle&quot; could have a private variable ''fill'', indicating a liquid level 0-3 dl. ''fill'' cannot be modified directly (compiler error), but instead ''Bottle'' provides the member function sip() to reduce the liquid level by 1. Mywaterbottle could be an instance of that class, an object.

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
/* Bottle - Class and Object Example */
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;
 
using namespace std;
 
class Bottle
{
  private:      // variables are modified by member functions of class
  int iFill;    // dl of liquid
     
  public:
    Bottle()    // Default Constructor
    : iFill(3)  // They start with 3 dl of liquid
      {
        // More constructor code would go here if needed.
      }
     
     bool sip() // return true if liquid was available
     {

       if (iFill &gt; 0)
       {
         --iFill;
         return true;
       }
       else
       {
         return false;
       }

     }
 
     int level() const  // return level of liquid dl
     {
         return iFill;
     }
 };  // Class declaration has a trailing semicolon
 
int main()
{
  // terosbottle object is an instance of class Bottle
  Bottle terosbottle;
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;In the beginning, mybottle has &quot;
       &lt;&lt; terosbottle.level()
       &lt;&lt; &quot;  dl of liquid&quot;
       &lt;&lt; endl;
   
  while (terosbottle.sip())
  {
     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Mybottle has &quot;
          &lt;&lt; terosbottle.level()
          &lt;&lt; &quot; dl of liquid&quot;
          &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
   
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

These keywords, ''private, public, and protected,'' affect the permissions of the members -- whether functions or variables.

==== '''public''' ====
This label indicates any members within the 'public' section can be accessed freely anywhere a declared object is in scope.

{{NOTE|Avoid declaring public data members, since doing so would contribute to create unforeseen disasters.}}

==== '''private''' ====
Members defined as private are only accessible within the class defining them, or friend classes. Usually the domain of member variables and helper functions. It's often useful to begin putting functions here and then moving them to the higher access levels as needed so to reduce complexity.

{{NOTE|It's often overlooked that different instances of the same class may access each others' private or protected variables. A common case for this is in copy constructors.}}

(This is an example where the default copy constructor will do the same thing.)

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
class Foo
{
 public:
   Foo(const Foo &amp;f)
   {
     m_iValue = f.m_iValue; // perfectly legal
   }
 
 private:
   int m_iValue;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

==== '''protected''' ====
The protected label has a special meaning to inheritance, protected members are accessible in the class that defines them and in classes that inherit from that base class, or friends of it. In the section on inheritance we will see more about it.

{{NOTE|Other instances of the same class can access a protected field - provided the two classes are of the same type. However, an instance of a child class cannot access a protected field or method of an instance of a parent class.}}

{{:C++ Programming/Classes/Inheritance}}

=== Data members ===
'''Data members''' are declared in the same way as a global or function variable, but as part of the class definition. Their purpose is to store information for that class and may include members of any type, even other user-defined types. They are usually hidden from outside use, depending on the coding style adopted, external use is normally done through [[C++ Programming/Classes#Accessors_and_Modifiers_.28Setter.2FGetter.29|special member functions]].

{{NOTE|Explicit initializers are not allowed inside the class definition, except if they are &lt;code&gt;const static int&lt;code&gt; or enumeration types, these may have an explicit initializer.}}

{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/static/Data Member}}

{{:C++ Programming/Classes/Member Functions}}

=== Subsumption property ===
Subsumption is a property that all objects that reside in a class hierarchy must fulfill: an object of the base class can be substituted by an object that derives from it (directly or indirectly). All mammals are animals (they derive from them), and all cats are mammals. Therefore, because of the subsumption property we can &quot;treat&quot; any mammal as an animal and any cat as a mammal. This implies abstraction, because when we are &quot;treating&quot; a mammal as an animal, the only information we should know about it is that it lives, it grows, etc, but nothing related to mammals.

This property is applied in C++, whenever we are using pointers or references to objects that reside in a class hierarchy. In other words, a pointer of class animal can point to an object of class animal, mammal or cat.

Let's continue with our example:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;

 //needs to be corrected
  enum AnimalType {
       Herbivore,
       Carnivore,
       Omnivore,
  };
 
  class Animal {
        public:
               AnimalType Type;
               bool bIsAlive;
               int iNumberOfChildren;
  };
 
  class Mammal : public Animal{
        public:
               int iNumberOfTeats;
  };
 
  class Cat : public Mammal{
        public:
              bool bLikesFish;  // probably true
  };
 
  int main() {
      Animal* pA1 = new Animal;
      Animal* pA2 = new Mammal;
      Animal* pA3 = new Cat;
      Mammal* pM  = new Cat;
      
      pA2-&gt;bIsAlive = True;     // Correct
      pA2-&gt;Type = Herbivore;    // Correct
      pM-&gt;iNumberOfTeats = 2;   // Correct
 
      pA2-&gt;iNumberOfTeats = 6;  // Incorrect
      pA3-&gt;bLikesFish = True;   // Incorrect
      
      Cat* pC = (Cat*)pA3;      // Downcast, correct (but very poor practice, see later)
      pC-&gt;bLikesFish = False;   // Correct (although it is a very awkward cat)
   }
&lt;/source&gt;

In the last lines of the example there is cast of a pointer to ''Animal'', to a pointer to ''Cat''. This is called &quot;Downcast&quot;. Downcasts are useful and should be used, but first we must ensure that the object we are casting is really of the type we are casting to it. Downcasting a base class to an unrelated class is an error. To resolve this issue, the casting operators {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}}&lt;&gt;, or {{C++ Programming/kw|static_cast}}&lt;&gt; should be used. 
These correctly cast an object from one class to another, and will throw an exception if the class types are not related. eg. If you try:

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
Cat* pC = new Cat;

motorbike* pM = dynamic_cast&lt;motorbike*&gt;(pC);
&lt;/source&gt;

Then, the app will throw an exception, as a cat is not a motorbike. Static_cast is very similar, only it will perform the type checking at compile time. If you have an object where you are not sure of its type then you should use {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}}, and be prepared to handle errors when casting. If you are downcasting objects where you know the types, then you should use {{C++ Programming/kw|static_cast}}. Do not use old-style C casts as these will simply give you an access violation if the types cast are unrelated.

=== Local classes ===
A '''local class''' is any class that is defined inside a specific statement block, in a [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Scope|local scope]], for instance inside a function. This is done like defining any other class, but ''local classes'' can not however access non-static local variables or be used to define [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/static/Data Member|static data members]]. These type of classes are useful especially in template functions, as we will see later. 

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
void MyFunction()
{
   class LocalClass
   {
   // ... members definitions ...
   };
   
   // ... any code that needs the class ...

}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== User defined automatic type conversion ===
We already covered [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Type Casting#Automatic type conversion|automatic type conversions]] (implicit conversion) and mentioned that some can be user-defined.

A user-defined conversion from a class to another class can be done by providing a constructor in the target class that takes the source class as an argument, &lt;code&gt;Target(const Source&amp; a_Class)&lt;/code&gt; or by providing the target class with a conversion operator, as &lt;code&gt;operator Source()&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Ensuring objects of a class are never copied ===
This is required e.g. to prevent memory-related problems that would result in case the default copy-constructor or the default assignment operator is unintentionally applied to a class &lt;tt&gt;C&lt;/tt&gt; which uses dynamically allocated memory, where a copy-constructor and an assignment operator are probably an overkill as they won't be used frequently.

Some style guidelines suggest making all classes non-copyable by default, and only enabling copying if it makes sense. Other (bad) guidelines say that you should always explicitly write the copy constructor and copy assignment operators; that's actually a bad idea, as it adds to the maintenance effort, adds to the work to read a class, is more likely to introduce errors than using the implicitly declared ones, and doesn't make sense for most object types. A sensible guideline is to ''think'' about whether copying makes sense for a type; if it does, then first prefer to arrange that the compiler-generated copy operations will do the right thing (e.g., by holding all resources via resource management classes rather than via raw pointers or handles), and if that's not reasonable then obey the [[C++ Programming/Classes/Member Functions#Law of three|law of three]]. If copying doesn't make sense, you can disallow it in either of two idiomatic ways as shown below.

Just declare the copy-constructor and assignment operator, and make them &lt;tt&gt;private&lt;/tt&gt;. Do not define them. As they are not &lt;tt&gt;protected&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;public&lt;/tt&gt;, they are inaccessible outside the class. Using them within the class would give a linker error since they are not defined.

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
class C
{
  ...
 
  private:
    // Not defined anywhere
    C (const C&amp;);
    C&amp; operator= (const C&amp;);
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember that if the class uses dynamically allocated memory for data members, you ''must'' define the memory release procedures in destructor &lt;tt&gt;~C ()&lt;/tt&gt; to release the allocated memory.

A class which only declares these two functions can be used as a private base class, so that all classes which privately inherits such a class will disallow copying.

{{NOTE|A part of the [[C++ Programming/Libraries/Boost|Boost]] library, the utility class &lt;tt&gt;boost:noncopyable&lt;/tt&gt;  performs a similar function, easier to use but with added costs due to the required derivation.}}

=== Container class ===
A class that is used to hold objects in memory or external storage is often called a ''container class''. A container class acts as a generic holder and has a predefined behavior and a well-known interface. It is also a supporting class whose purpose is to hide the topology used for maintaining the list of objects in memory. When it contains a group of mixed objects, the container is called a heterogeneous container; when the container is holding a group of objects that are all the same, the container is called a homogeneous container.

=== Interface class ===
{{TODO|Complete|C++ Programming}}

=== Singleton class ===
A [[C++ Programming/Code/Design_Patterns#Singleton|Singleton]] class is a class that can only be instantiated once (similar to the use of static variables or functions). It is one of the possible implementations of a [[C++ Programming/Code/Design_Patterns#Creational_Patterns|creational pattern]], which is fully covered in the [[C++ Programming/Code/Design_Patterns|Design Patterns Section]] of the book.

      <comment>/* What is a &quot;nice&quot; class? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== What is a &quot;nice&quot; (container safe) class? ===

A &quot;nice&quot; class takes into consideration the use of the following functions:

1.  The copy constructor.&lt;br&gt;
2.  The assignment operator.&lt;br&gt;
3.  The equality operator.&lt;br&gt;
4.  The inequality operator.&lt;br&gt;

==== Class Declaration ====
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Nice
{
public:
    Nice(const Nice &amp;Copy);
    Nice &amp;operator= (const Nice &amp;Copy);
    bool operator== (const Nice &amp;param) const;
    bool operator!= (const Nice &amp;param) const;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Description ====
A &quot;nice&quot; class could also be called a container safe class.  Many containers such as those in the [[C++ Programming/STL|Standard Template Library]] (STL), that we'll see later, use copy construction and the assignment operator when interacting with the objects of your class.  The assignment operator and copy constructor only need to be declared and defined if the default behavior, which is a member-wise (not binary) copy, is undesirable or insufficient to properly copy/construct your object.

A general rule of thumb is that if the default, member-wise copy operations do not work for your objects then you should define a suitable copy constructor and assignment operator.  They are both needed if either is defined.

==Copy Constructor==

The purpose of the copy constructor is to allow the programmer to perform the same instructions as the assignment operator with the special case of knowing that the caller is initializing/constructing rather than an copying.

It is also good practice to use the explicit keyword when using a copy constructor to prevent unintended implicit type conversion.

'''Example'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Nice
{
public:
  explicit Nice(int _a) : a(_a)
  {
    return;
  }
private:
  int a;
};

class NotNice
{
public:
  NotNice(int _a) :  a(_a)
  {
    return;
  }
private:
  int a;
};

int main()
{
  Nice proper = Nice(10); //this is ok
  Nice notproper = 10; //this will result in an error
  NotNice eg = 10; //this WILL compile, you may not have intended this conversion
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Equality Operator==
The equality operator says, &quot;Is this object equal to that object?&quot;.  What constitutes equal is up to the programmer.  This is a requirement if you ever want to use the equality operator with objects of your class.

However, in most applications (e.g. mathematics), it is usually the case that coding the inequality is easier than coding the equality.  In which case the following code can be written for the equality.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
inline bool Nice::operator== (const Nice&amp; param) const
{
    return !(*this != param);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Inequality Operator==
The inequality operator says, &quot;Is this object not equal to that object?&quot;.  What constitutes not equal is up to the programmer.  This is a requirement if you ever want to use the inequality operator with objects of your class.

However, in some applications, coding the equality is easier than coding the inequality.  In which case the following code can be written for the inequality.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
inline bool Nice::operator!= (const Nice&amp; param) const
{
    return !(*this == param);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If the statement about the (in)equality operators having different efficiency (whatever kind) seems complete nonsense to you, consider that ''typically'', all object attributes must match for two objects to be considered equal.&lt;br&gt;  ''Typically'', only one object attribute must differ for two objects to be considered unequal.  For equality and inequality operators, that doesn't mean one is faster than the other.

Note, however, that using both the above equality and inequality functions as defined will result in an infinite recursive loop and care must be taken to use only one or the other.  Also, there are some situations where neither applies and therefore neither of the above can be used.

Given two objects A and B (with class attributes x and y), an equality operator could be written as

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
  if (A.x != B.x) return false;
  if (A.y != B.y) return false;
  return true;
&lt;/source&gt;

while an inequality operator could be written as

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
  if (A.x != B.x) return true;
  if (A.y != B.y) return true;
  return false;
&lt;/source&gt;

So yes, the equality operator can certainly be written ''...!(a!=b)...'', but it isn't any faster.  In fact, there's the additional overhead of a method call and a negation operation.

So the question becomes, is a little execution overhead worth the smaller code and improved maintainability?  There is no simple answer to this it all depend on how the programmer is using them. If your class is composed of, say, an array of 1 billion elements, the overhead is negligible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Coding style conventions ===
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{TOC right}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
The use of a guide or set of convention gives programmers a set of rules for code normalization or coding ''style'' that establishes how to format code, name variables, place comments or any other non language dependent structural decision that is used on the code. This is very important, as you share a project with others. Agreeing to a common set of coding standards and recommendations saves time and effort, by enabling a greater understandings and transparency of the code base, providing a common ground for undocumented structures, making for easy debugging, and increasing code maintainability. These rules may also be referred to as ''Source Code Style'', ''Code Conventions'', ''Coding Standards'' or a variation of those.

Many organizations have published C++ style guidelines. A list of different approaches can be found on the [[C++ Programming/Weblinks#C++ Coding Conventions| C++ coding conventions Reference Section]]. The most commonly used style in C++ programming is ANSI or Allman while much C programming is still done in the Kernighan and Ritchie (K&amp;R) style. You should be warned that this should be one of the first decisions you make on a project and in a democratic environment, a consensus can be very hard to achieve. 

Programmers tend to stick to a coding style, they have it automated and any deviation can be very hard to conform with, if you don't have a favorite style try to use the smallest possible variation to a common one or get as broad a view as you can get, permitting you to adapt easily to changes or defend your approach. There is software that can help to format or ''beautify'' the code, but automation can have its drawbacks. As seen earlier, indentation and the use of white spaces or tabs are completely ignored by the compiler. A coding style should vary depending on the lowest common denominator of the needs to standardize.

Another factor, even if yet to a minimal degree, for the selection of a coding style convention is the IDE (or the code editor) and its capabilities, this can have for instance an influence in determining how verbose code should be, the maximum the length of lines, etc. Some editors now have extremely useful features like word completion, refactoring functionalities and other that can make some specifications unnecessary or outright outdated. This will make the adoption of a coding style dependent also on the target code user available software.

Field impacted by the selection of a Code Style are:
*Re-usability
**Self documenting code
**Internationalization
**Maintainability
**Portability
*Optimization
*Build process
*Error avoidance
*Security

;Standardization is important
No matter which particular coding style you pick, once it is selected, it should be kept throughout the same project. Reading code that follows different styles can become very difficult. In the next sections we try to explain why some of the options are common practice without forcing you to adopt a specific style.

{{NOTE|Using a bad Coding Style is worse than having no Coding Style at all, since you will be extending bad practices to all the code base.}}

==== 25 lines 80 columns ====

This rule is a commonly recommended, but often countered with argument that the rule is outdated.  The rule originates from the time when text-based computer terminals and dot-matrix printers often could display at most 80 columns of text.  As such, greater than 80-column text would either inconveniently wrap to the next line, or worse, not display at all.

The physical limitations of the devices asides, this rule often still suggested under the argument that '''if you are writing code that will go further than 80 columns or 25 lines, it's time to think about splitting the code into functions'''.   Smaller chunks of encapsulated code helps in reviewing the code as it can be seen all at once without scrolling up or down.  This modularizes, and thus eases, the programmer mental representation of the project. This practice will save you precious time when you have to return to a project you haven't been working on for 6 months.

For example, you may want to split long output statements across multiple lines:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
    fprintf(stdout,&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. &quot;
                   &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n&quot;
                   &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog - %d&quot;, 2);
&lt;/source&gt;


This recommended practice relates also to the [[C++ Programming/Code/Statements/Functions#0_means_success|''0 means success'']] convention for functions, that we will cover on the [[C++ Programming/Code/Statements/Functions|Functions Section]] of this book.

==== Whitespace and indentation ====
{{NOTE|Spaces, tabs and newlines (line breaks) are called ''whitespace''. Whitespace is required to separate adjacent words and numbers; they are ignored everywhere else except within quotes and preprocessor directives}}

Conventions followed when using whitespace to improve the readability of code is called an '''indentation style'''. Every block of code and every definition should follow a consistent indention style. This usually means everything within &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;. However, the same thing goes for one-line code blocks.

Use a fixed number of spaces for indentation. Recommendations vary; 2, 3, 4, 8 are all common numbers. If you use tabs for indention you have to be aware that editors and printers may deal with, and expand, tabs differently. The K&amp;R standard recommends an indentation size of 4 spaces.

The use of tab is controversial, the basic premise is that it reduces source code portability, since the same source code loaded into different editors with distinct setting will not look alike. This is one of the primary reasons why some programmers prefer the consistency of using spaces (or configure the editor to replace the use of the tab key with the necessary number of spaces).

For example, a program could as well be written using as follows:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// Using an indentation size of 2
if ( a &gt; 5 )  { b=a; a++; } 
&lt;/source&gt;
However, the same code could be made much more readable with proper indentation:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// Using an indentation size of 2
if ( a &gt; 5 )  {
  b = a;
  a++;
}

// Using an indentation size of 4
if ( a &gt; 5 )
{
    b = a;
    a++;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Placement of braces ([[w:Curly bracket programming language|curly brackets]]) ====
As we have seen early on the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements|Statements Section]], ''compound statements'' are very important in C++, they also are subject of different coding styles, that recommend different placements of opening and closing braces (&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;). Some recommend putting the opening brace on the line with the statement, at the end ([[w:The C Programming Language (book)|K&amp;R]]). Others recommend putting these on a line by itself, but not indented (ANSI C++). GNU recommends putting braces on a line by itself, and indenting them half-way. We recommend picking one brace-placement style and sticking with it.

Examples:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if (a &gt; 5) {
  // This is K&amp;R style
}

if (a &gt; 5) 
{
  // This is ANSI C++ style
}

if (a &gt; 5) 
  {
    // This is GNU style
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Explicitness or implicitness ====
This can be defended both ways. If defaulting to implicitness, this means less typing but also may create wrong assumptions on the human reader and for the compiler (depending on the situation) to do extra work, on the other hand if you write more keywords and are explicit on your intentions the resulting code will be clearer and reduces errors (enabling hidden errors to be found), or more defined (self documented) but this may also lead to added limitations to the code's evolution (like we will see with the use of const). This is a thin line where an equilibrium must be reached in accord to the projects nature, and the available capabilities of the editor, code completion, syntax coloring and hovering tooltips reduces much of the work. The important fact is to be consistent as with any other rule.

===== {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} =====
The choice of using of {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} even if the member function is implicitly inlined.

===== const =====
Unless you plan on modifying it, you're arguably better off using const data types. The compiler can easily optimize more with this restriction, and you're unlikely to accidentally corrupt the data. Ensure that your methods take const data types unless you absolutely have to modify the parameters. Similarly, when implementing accessors for private member data, you should in most cases {{C++ Programming/kw|return}} a const. This will ensure that if the object that you're operating on is passed as const, methods that do not affect the data stored in the object still work as they should and can be called. For example, for an object containing a person, a getName() should {{C++ Programming/kw|return}} a const data type where as walk() might be non-const as it might change some internal data in the Person such as tiredness.

===== {{C++ Programming/kw|typedef}} =====
It is common practice to avoid using the {{C++ Programming/kw|typedef}} keyword since it can obfuscate code if not properly used or it can cause programmers to accidentally misuse large structures thinking them to be simple types. If used, define a set of rules for the types you rename and be sure to document them.

===== volatile =====
This keyword informs the compiler that the variable it is qualifying as volatile (can change at anytime) is excluded from any optimization techniques. Usage of this variable should be reserved for variables that are known to be modified due to an external influence of a program (whether it's hardware update, third party application, or another thread in the application).

Since the volatile keyword impacts performance, you should consider a different design that avoids this situation: most platforms where this keyword is necessary provide an alternative that helps maintain scalable performance.

Note that using volatile was not intended to be used as a threading or synchronization primitive, nor are operations on a  volatile variable guaranteed to be atomic.

==== Pointer declaration ====
Due to historical reasons some programmers refer to a specific use as: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// C code style
int *z;

// C++ code style
int* z;
&lt;/source&gt;

The second variation is by far the preferred by C++ programmers and will help identify a C programmer or legacy code.

One argument against the C++ code style version is when chaining declarations of more than one item, like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// C code style
int *ptrA, *ptrB;

// C++ code style
int* ptrC, ptrD;
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, in this case, the C code style makes it more obvious that ptrA and ptrB are pointers to int, and the C++ code style makes it less obvious that ptrD is an int, not a pointer to int.

It is rare to use chains of multiple objects in C++ code with the exception of the basic types and even so it is a not often used and it is extremely rare to see it used in pointers or other complex types, since it will make it harder to for a human to visually parse the code.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// C++ code style
int* ptrC;
int D;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Win32 API Wrappers ====
Since the Win32 API is C based and also a moving target and since some alterations are done in each OS version some wrappers were created, in this section you will find some of the approaches available to facilitate the use of the API in a C++ setup and provide abstraction from the low level stuff with higher level implementations of common needed features, dealing with the GUI, complex controls even communications and database access.

; ''Microsoft Foundation Classes'' ('''MFC'''); : a C++ library for developing Windows applications and UI components. Created by Microsoft for the C++ Windows programmer as an abstraction layer for the Win32 API, the use of the new STL enabled capabilities is scarce on the MFC. It's also compatible with Windows CE (the pocket PC version of the OS). MFC was designed to use the Document-View pattern a variant of the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern.&lt;br&gt;More info about '''MFC''' can be obtained on the [[Windows Programming#Section_3:_Microsoft_Foundation_Classes_and_COM|Windows Programming]] Wikibook. 

; ''Windows Template Library'' ('''WTL'''); : a C++ library for developing Windows applications and UI components. It extends ATL (Active Template Library) and provides a set of classes for controls, dialogs, frame windows, GDI objects, and more. This library is not supported by Microsoft Services (but is used internally at MS and available for download at MSDN).

; ''Win32 Foundation Classes'' ('''WFC'''); : (http://www.samblackburn.com/wfc/) a library of C++ classes that extend Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) to do NT specific things.

; ''Borland Visual Component Library'' ('''VCL'''); : a Delphi/C++ library for developing Windows applications, UI components and different kinds of service applications. Created by Borland as an abstraction layer for the Win32 API, but also implementing many non-visual, and non windows-specific objects, like AnsiString class for example.

{{NOTE|There are more generic wrapper that do not focus exclusively on the Windows API, like the ''Qt (framework)'' or ''WxWidgets'' these are covered on the [[C++ Programming/Code/API/Generic Wrappers|Generic Wrappers Section]] of the book.}}

==Reminder: read archives!==
This talk page was huge. The problem was that it took a while to find all of the subject you want to read and write about. So I divided this talk page into a few primary divisions. I created these divisions ''after'' a ton of discussion has already occurred- for easy accessibility, the organization is set up around the issues that have been the center of discussion.

'''If you haven't read through the archive related to the subject you're talking about, please do so. (At least skim) before repeating others.'''

'''Afterwards, add new discussion here, preferably under this post so others are also reminded to check the approp. subject.'''

==Duplicating contents==

What exactly is the section &quot;Duplicating Contents&quot; talking about in its first half? Let me reproduce what I'm confused about here...

::''&quot;New users may confuse Wikibooks as an appropriate place to duplicate contents in order to fork or provide an alternative version. As a result, sometimes they will write content on Wikibooks that is essentially not textbook material. Textbooks generally have a stronger organisation that builds knowledge from one module to the next with a suggested chronological order to the content. One of our sister projects, such as Wikipedia or Wikiversity, may be where you can find a home for what your trying to work on and has already been developed. Duplicating content from one of our sister projects is discouraged for the same reasons, but you are certainly welcome to copy some content from them so long as you or someone else is willing to develop it into appropriate textbook material.&quot;''

Okay, so if the second half is discouraging copying GFDL'd material from wikipedia and wikiversity, what the heck is the first half talking about? What mysterious content source should we be asking not to duplicate from? I know that it's 1. It uses a free license (supposedly, or this would be chiding about copyright violation) 2. It's not a wikimedia sister product 3. It's written in a way which isn't textbook material and 4. Someone might try to fork it or provide an &quot;alternative version&quot;. What kind of source could they be talking about? What are we warning users against duplicating text from? This is bothering me that there's this section telling me not to do something, yet I have no idea what they're telling me not to do.

This is confusing me badly. Any ideas? -[[User:Monk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Monk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Monk|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 23:21, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

:Nevermind, I figured it out by poring over history. Take a look at the changes in the encyclopedia article/Duplicating contents section in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AWhat_is_Wikibooks%2FUnstable&amp;diff=712778&amp;oldid=712694 this diff.] Okay, the first sentence did originally refer to sister projects, but has sort of been expanded to refer to all kinds of content dumping. Although a lot of the editing to this paragraph vastly (and helpfully) shortened the text that was already there, it cut out some context for each sentence. The resulting order of the sentences is confusing. I was going to reword it, but Darklama is one step ahead of me and did a fine job. :) -[[User:Monk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Monk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Monk|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 01:40, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

== Original Research ==

This policy, as it stands include no specific prohibition on original research. This seems like a significant omission, is this what is intended? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:54, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

:There is a mention that a book must be &quot;accurate, verifiable, and peer-reviewable&quot;. This implies no original research. With brevity being a primary goal here, additional information about this clause can be located in a separate guideline, such as [[Wikibooks:Original research]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:25, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

::While that may be an admirable goal, I think this still needs to be explict here in some way, and brevity is hardly the word for what this policy has become anyway.  [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks/Unstable&amp;oldid=781345 I added back in] much of what dealt with original research in what I hope can be considered a positive tone that reflects the same general attitude.  I will note that this is explicitly part of the current &quot;stable&quot; version as well.  I don't know why I have to have an edit war over these couple of sentances here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:36, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

Just a off-the cuff question about this: I asked this somewhere on the staff lounge (I'm still ajusting to the multi-page thing here), but the book [[ATALL]] is unquestionably OR in the sense of &quot;defining a new academic field or approach&quot;. The Wikiversity crowd is perfectly willing to host the book (their OR policy is radically different from ours), but on the other hand this wikibook has won some awards and perhaps provided some notoriety. With Robert's re-additions, we really would need to transwiki it (which either he or I could do, since we're WV admins with import toys), but should we? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:34, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

: I've made some changes, which I hope will allow a limited amount of original research, by reintroducing the concept of reproduction as a valid means of verification as a clarification of peer-reviewable. As SB_Johnny pointed out and has been discussed previously its not as open and shut of a case as it once was. I think some research and new ways of doing things should be allowed and so I think ATALL should be able to stay if that is all it does. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:36, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

::I will say I think we are getting to something I can live with here.  Thanks for these edits!  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:29, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

:In regards to this specific Wikibook, I think Wikiversity may be a better place for original research.  When the &quot;charter&quot; for Wikiversity was being put together, this in particular was something I felt needed to be a strong part of the proposal, and it was something that kept coming back over and over again.  It was also one of the stronger and more compelling reasons I could give for why Wikiversity was inappropriate to be hosted on Wikibooks, as some sorts of genuine academic research needed some room for growth we couldn't offer here.  Or more to the point, if Wikibooks had permitted research of the level that Wikiversity participants were seeking, it would be a very slippery slope to avoid having very dubious books be written on the principle that original research was no something prohibited.

:Earlier I got into a major content fight with none other than the current chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, Anthere.  Her contention was that the Wikimania conference proceedings ought to be hosted here on Wikibooks.  It is very interesting that we were able to stand up to her and offer a rationale for why they didn't belong here, using original research standards as one of the major planks for its deletion.  At the same time, even in the middle of that discussion, I mentioned that Wikiversity would be a perfect home for that sort of content, but unfortunately Wikiversity didn't exist as a seperate project at the time.

:Wikiversity does exist now, and to what extent they will accept original research is still something that is being debated.  As a child project of Wikibooks, Wikiversity will always have some strong ties here, and it isn't too far off the mark to say that the ATALL is merely a part of Wikiversity that got left behind.  Just as we sometimes have to split hairs in regards to what is more encyclopedic content vs. book-like content, the issue of original research is one that IMHO helps to distinguish between Wikibooks and Wikiversity.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:02, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

This topic just came up again, with OR being one of the reasons for a [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#Superluminal particle accelerator|particular vfd]]. I urge that the ban on OR continue to be explicitly in the main text of the &quot;WiW&quot; document and not just a footnote. It's easier to justify &quot;this book is OR and belongs elsewhere&quot; than to justify &quot;the information you're supposedly providing is nonsense.&quot; There are many people who would like to use WikiBooks as a soapbox for their personal, imaginary theories of how the world works. Some of those writers can be very persuasive and their theories very attractive to those readers who are unfamiliar with the topics. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 15:06, 31 October 2007 (UTC)

== Common Knowledge ==

It's tempting to look at the policies and practices of Wikipedia when trying to shape our own. However, the requirements for producing a valuable encyclopedia are far different from the requirements to producing valuable textbooks. A big point that comes up in the OR discussion, above, is that the definition of &quot;verifiability&quot; is far different between the two projects. 

The encyclopedia really can't state any fact without providing a citation for it. Information in that reference needs to be properly referenced to help lend credibility to it. Traditional textbooks, however, tend to rely on the authority and expertise of the author, and the expected background knowledge of the target audience. With the proper background knowledge, and a little patience, results can typically be derived in the pages of the text, without having to reference an external source. Textbooks tend to contain significantly fewer (if any) citations or references. Frequently, these references are listed as &quot;further reading&quot;, not as a &quot;bibliography&quot;. The audience has particular background knowledge, the text derives the proper results, and whole thing then qualifies as &quot;common knowledge&quot; (especially if we have properly defined our target audience).

An issue arises, certainly, that Wikibookians tend not to post their credentials online, and books therefore cannot be reliant on the credibility of the authors. To this extent, we do need to walk the line between requiring citations (in lieu of an &quot;expert&quot; author saying so), and providing adequate derivations or examples. To make the system work, we need to be mindful of our target audiences, and requiring that all new books have a stated target audience, and stated educational prerequisites beforehand is a good start. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

:I think it is still important that any information which is added to Wikibooks be verifiable.  Even in the situation where a Wikibook is discussing philosophy or theology, it would be very useful to show that what you are writing about is existing ideas and not something you are creating completely from scratch just for this book.

:On the other hand, I would have to agree that going for a point by point bibliographic reference that is now customary on Wikipedia is something we should avoid having as a manditory requirement.  If a particular group of users wants to go that far for a particular subject, knock your socks off.  Really.  But it shouldn't be the only deciding factor for if the book is considered one of the &quot;best of...&quot; on that topic and even worthy of featured status.  Some of the book styles will tend to be much more informal and have an appeal to readers that a strongly scholarly approach may not work with as well.

:So in this regard, I think the degree of usage for citations is something that is to be decided ''within'' each separate Wikibook by those who are participating in that book.

:One thing that does distinguish textbooks from other types of non-fiction literature is the &quot;homework problems&quot; that often accompany each major section.  And this is also something very un-encyclopedic in nature as well.  I'm not completely convinced that we should make this a mandetory requirement for Wikibooks (other books of strong educational value can be written without them), but this is perhaps something that may be useful to push for as books of higher quality are beginning to emerge here on this project.  Strong exercises that help to evaluate knowledge comprehension and offer practical applications of the knowledge presented are something currently missing to a large degree with Wikibooks at the moment.

:Another area that we could use some significant improvement toward is to encourage the use of published educational standards as a benchmark to establish why a particular Wikibook is needed.  Some of these published standards are quite specific about the areas of knowledge that ought to be presented, but they don't go into details about how that information is presented.  That is our job as textbook writers.  Again, this is something that is unique to textbook development and currently lacking on Wikibooks.

:The &quot;killer app&quot; that will give legitimacy to this whole project and be able to point out that we have completely succeeded as a group, is when we have something of high enough quality that meets the needs of an instructor in these two areas of textbook coverage.  The question I would offer is on how we can phrase what we are saying here on this policy page to strongly encourage this sort of direction for new Wikibooks?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:45, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

:: I agree that how information is cited or reference is not something that makes sense to standardize at this time. That should be left up to the book writers. The homework problems thing sounds like something left best for what makes a book good enough to be a &quot;featured&quot; or &quot;good&quot; book. I've added &quot;Textbooks are encouraged to follow published educational standards&quot; near the beginning of this policy. I hope that provides an answer to your question. I think this policy may be just about ready again for discussion and voting for whether to move this policy to enforcement. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
::I think that a good textbook is far better than it sources.  For a textbook, for verifiability, it needs to cite only the things that the author does not give justification for.  For example, in a physics textbook, if you derive the speed of light in a vacuum from Maxwell's equations and the permittivity and permeability of free space, you would not need to cite anything except Maxwell's equations and the permittivity and permeability constants.    For example, by Wikipedia's definition of verifiability, Feynman's physics textbooks would be rejected, since he comes up with unique derivations in many places.  In conclusion, I think that verifiability in the context of Wikibooks, should mean that external facts need to be cited (like the date of George Washington's birth) and internal facts just need to be explained sufficiently well that the intended audience can understand how the author derived them.

== Quizes and Exams ==

I'm curious about the general attitude about quizes and exams.  I don't see what would be wrong with having the actual test questions for what would be a unit review.  As something which could be in an appendix of the book or at the end of a series of modules seems like a very sensable thing to do.... and something that is very common for many textbooks.  Perhaps these would be in an &quot;instructor's edition&quot;, but they are found as very typical textbook suplimental material.

On the other hand, Wikibooks should not be used as a &quot;testing center&quot;.  If there are essays or other material which is going to be somehow graded by an instructor and is requested by this instructor to be edited on Wikibooks as a hosting service, it seems to me as something inappropriate to our mission here.  And this is exactly what Wikiversity ought to be directly dealing with as well if something like that is desired.  A personal essay is something that shouldn't be edited my multiple individuals, and I could envision all sorts of headaches if some class put it on Wikibooks and then we decided to delete those test results... provided we didn't have this policy to tell them it shouldn't have been here in the first place.

Any other thoughts about this?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:33, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

:I think the idea behind this passage is that wikibooks is for textbooks, not other kinds of educational material such as stand-along quizzes or exams. We do, however, allow review questions that are integrated into the text. As an analog, consider that we dont allow dictionary or thesauri, but we do allow books to contain glossary. It's a mincing of words, perhaps. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

== Moving to enforced again. ==
&lt;small&gt;(action started by [[User:Darklama]])&lt;/small&gt;

I hope this isn't considered premature. I think sense this proposal's biggest critic, may now be satisfied with the text of this proposal, that it is time again to vote on moving this proposal to enforced status. In order to prevent a premature repeat, I would like to see a show of agreement to moving this policy to enforced status, by anyone currently monitoring this page, before bringing it up on the staff lounge again. 

* '''Support''' - I agree with the [{{fullurl:Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable|oldid=786589}} current text] of this proposal. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:36, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::I wouldn't call it abuse, but that it would be used in that way is guaranteed, we could add a clause that would let a VfD survival work that doesn't meet the criterials to be automatically referenced on the policy text (and so get some protection) and be the bases for an addendum to the types of works we accept (or requiring the complete overhaul of the policy).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:32, 17 March 2007 (UTC)   
:::Exactly my concern (to a point) but then we'd have to somehow extend &quot;VfD survival&quot; to apply to similar (perhaps new) books, which would be incredibly hard to interpret. If I understand you correctly, you're suggesting using precedents in place of policy statements? I like that idea &quot;in principle&quot;, but the problem is that the defenders of &quot;good&quot; books would then be obliged to go combing through the VfD archives (which I personally don't find to be a nice pasttime), and defenders of &quot;truly incompatible&quot; books would use any closed VfD that has anything at all in common with their book to say &quot;well, if you allow that, then mine's allowed too!&quot; --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:50, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
::::We may word it that it would solve those issues (not be general but define books that survive VfD and don't fit a specific type as described on the text, this would reduce the need for general discussions of this policy and make it more versatile to deal with evolutions on that particular problem), as I said it all depends on how we stated it.

::::I was under the impression that is already how things work. VfD decisions to keep or delete book tend to set precedents for what is and isn't allowed and change over time. Perhaps an informal page could be created to summarize current practices based on VfD decisions, to help reduce the need for people to search through the VfD archives. Which could than be used for changing policy at some later point in time. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:03, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::: The separate page is not intended to be a policy page. Adding new entries to this policy right away will definitely be challenged and unrealistic, but creating an informal list that anyone can change, is unlikely to be challenged. I think decisions made on VfD usually take awhile to influence what is or isn't allowed, and even than trying to base policy on such decisions may be challenged. The only reason I mention this policy at all is that this policy could be updated when items that make that list have been consistently on there for some time and there is general agreement to do so. For this policy to even get passed, at some point, people are going to have to agree to stop and allow some things to continue to remain informal for now.
:::::: I can understand concern over potential abuse and removal of pages due to changes in this policy. However I don't think the best method for that is to try and get everything that people feel are at risk of being deleted into this policy, as a means of preventing it. I think people need to keep in mind we have a deletion policy and perhaps if people agree, emphases the need to follow it and not rush to speedy delete based on changes made to this policy. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:15, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

I undid your last edit. The null and void bits were previously disagreed with and I consider it a major change. What I think you may be referring to as being previously potentially agreed to is listing who changed a proposal to enforced and on what date. Nothing else was approved of that I know of, and this proposal hasn't been moved to enforce yet, this is a vote to see if that should be done. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:&quot;Final Word&quot; clause (proposal) was made by Whiteknight to what you stated objection to the wording, they were corrected, I and Whiteknight did make 2 other final comments and you did not object, the proposal was archived without objections several moths ago, to what do you object now? (see archive for the  null and void bits Whiteknight replied to you on those).
:&quot;Moving to enforced again&quot; is the thread name you gave, you are indeed moving to enforce it (make it a policy) and it has failed once before as I've added info about (the proposals aren't the same).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:47, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:: This proposal has gone through some changes since than, including the removal of the &quot;final word&quot; clause without objection, and agree this isn't the same proposal as before. I think adding it now no longer makes sense, because much has changed within this proposal, in other proposals and within Wikibooks in general. I think that it would be better to find out what everyone's current opinion on the matter is, opinions might of changed, before trying to include it again. This is mostly to avoid the same mistakes as before. that might invalidate people's support of the proposal again. I would rather see people write comments or vote opposed if they feel strongly that major changes to this proposal should be made, rather than voting support after making major changes and invalidating votes. Doing that ought to make it clearer whats supported and what, if anything, needs discussion to address opposed votes and reach compromise. If you want me to get more into why I oppose it I will.

:: I'm not making it policy. I'm trying to restart discussions and voting on whether this should be made enforced policy. Since a vote is needed to do so. If there are enough support votes and oppositions have been addressed, than someone will probably change the status from proposal to enforced. When the status goes from proposal to enforced thats the time to add who changed it to enforced and on what date, so its known who did so and when the policy went into effect. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:07, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:::No Darklama, the Final Word was a separated proposal that would be applied to every guideline or proposal text (those lines have a global impact, they don't change in any way the policy where they reside, they empower the last decission above old ones, they provide a sense of progression to the texts) and the motion was technically passed, since you did not object to it ~(there was no straw poll) but consensus means no objections, and it was publicly discussed on the staff lounge. (your inaction may not be a good enough reason to rehash the subject, but is a good point, lets say rhe administrators that lost they flag due to the reform would use the same logic to invalidate the change)
:::And I disagree with you I think it makes perfect sense to use it everywhere, anyway about the removal of the text again I think you shouldn't have removed but expressed your objections because I added it and proceed from there...
:::To restart the discussion a straw pool is not the best way of doing it (what you will get is mostly a feel on who disagrees) and in case no one does it is indeed approved, without more discussions (that is why it is not the best way to go about it, if the intention is further discussion), this is a call to end discussions and approval of the text and making it a policy.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:37, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:::: A call to approve the text and make it a policy, doesn't end discussions, it just makes discussion more formal and I believe it may be ready for it. Indeed part of the intent was to get a feel for if anyone disagrees before announcing it on the staff lounge again. I certainly didn't get the &quot;final word&quot; clause was intended to be put on every policy from previous discussions. That makes even less sense. I think that would need to be discussed on the staff lounge if thats your intention and/or turned into a proposed policy of its own. I don't think this is the place to do it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:28, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::Disagree, what is the result of a non blocked move to enforced ? (approval, not discussion)
:::::It is a requirement to make a policy/guideline decission/revision that it should be made as public as possible, this particular policy draft was added to the bulletin board and on the staff lounge, no further notification are required, but are certainly welcomed.
:::::Final Word has gone by those motions, I was the one that posted on the staff lounge, the discussion started on the Deletion policy, you are rehashing the discussion, I can indeed see your reasoning but I'll not support alone a review of it on those bases.

:::::: For a policy to become enforced, discussion has to take place in order to state approval or disapproval, otherwise its considered dropped and no decision has been reached. As I said if your intent was for your change to be a policy, than you need to make a new policy proposal. For example Wikibooks:Final_Word, which states whatever requirements your wishing to make and than this can be discussed there, where its more appropriate and then announced for voting. To keep this short, I didn't take Whiteknight's comments as disagreeing with me, but as clarifications for me and disagreeing with you, which is why I saw no need to continue discussion. Also other proposed policies that have become enforced since Feb 5, have included no such wording in them. As far as I was concerned, that discussion was for this policy proposal only and got dropped when this proposal was changed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:35, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

*reset 

Darklama the Final Word policy is only useful if it is to be used in every policy text (read what the lines that constitute the policy say or the posts themselves it's clear enough), since 5 Feb 2007 no new policy has yet been adopted (that is why I made a point in calling attention to this, because it was going to be closed.) Read the archive, start on the archive of the deletion policy and continue to the staff lounge. As I said you are rehashing the topic, I understand that you may have another opinion but will not support it only on it, if anyone shares your view then I will be willing to discuss it, you have yet to make a point about what you don't like on the Final Word, inaction is not a justification to rehash a policy, straw vote is not a necessity (we don't even have at the moment a decission policy), consensus means no objections, the policy was discussed and publicly posted (there is no other more public page than the staff lounge), rehashing the discussion will open a can of worms, lets take the example I gave above on the absent administrators that lost their admin flag, or for example a user that is blocked while a discussion is voted, what about if you go on vacations do we need to wait for you ? if you come back do we need to open again all passed policies ? (this is also great stuff to consider on the drafted decission policy, for instance the rehash/reversal of a policy can be started on a significant majority vote for instance 85% I would be fine with it, bad intentions, reading the archives would also have to be included.)   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:46, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

== Readers' guides? ==

Since this policy seems to be about ''everything'', it really shouldn't go through without some mention of these. The much-loved &quot;Muggles Guide&quot; and the often beknighted &quot;Annotations of the Complete Peanuts&quot; are two examples of this that aren't exactly annotations, but seem to me to be the kind of thing that should be perfectly acceptable (similar guides to Tolkien's books, the Narnia series, and other influential works that haven't yet fallen into public domain would also (to me) seem perfectly acceptable, but they wouldn't be annotations as we define it in this policy). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:58, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:Your concern about using this policy as a deletionist strategy is very valid, as changes by at least one admin, as well as the controversial change to the previous incarnation of this policy by Jimbo, have indeed been used to remove many books and reshape Wikibooks policy.  One particular change I wasn't happy with was when one administrator on this project (you can go to the history and logs if you want to find who I'm referring to here... it isn't you Johnny) changed the deletion policy and then proceeded to act upon that changed policy as if it was a long-established Wikibooks principle.... and deleted thousands of pages off of this project as a result.  I would urge caution and suggest a more consensus driven approach if you do want to make policy changes, particularly if you want to act upon those policy changes.

:As far as these readers' guides are concerned, I would agree that not only should they stay, but there is clearly VfD precedence to keep books of this nature (even if not completely unanimous).  Perhaps just as valid is the [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts]] policy, which is currently considered an enforced policy.

Would it be completely silly at this point to split this policy into a guidline for what is, and a policy on what's not?

The community's ideas about particular subjects should be able to change over time without requiring a complete rewrite of our inclusion criteria.

== Annotated Texts ==

The [[WB:AT]] page is official policy now (a recent change), and because of that I dont think that we need to include specific mention of annotated texts in this policy proposal. A better choice would likely to have a section at the bottom of this proposal that points to pages that better describe all the individual specific cases that can come up (if such discussion is even necessary). Having information about annotated texts in two separate policy documents gives rise to the possibility that the two might disagree. Of some concern to me is the fact that making changes to the WIW policy is typically a slow process, and if we try to update the annotated texts section here, it will take some time to get approval. I am going to '''be bold''' and replace the annotated texts section of this page with a link to the relevant policy document. 

If we had a policy about reader's guides, or other types of books, we can link to them as well. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:00, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::I think in general we shouldn't go into &quot;acceptable genres&quot;, unless we have policies about how they need to be written (I think that needs to be done very carefully in any case, since we're ''always'' going to have occaisional migrations of Wikipedians who see nominating things for AfD (oops, I mean VfD) as a good way to help out.

:No problem here, just a minor correction or note, you added the &lt;u&gt;policy&lt;/u&gt; under &lt;u&gt;Special Guidelines&lt;/u&gt; and the policy gives a good image of what an annotated text is, but fails to clearly state that they should be considered good content for Wikibooks (makes some regards considering edition of annotated texts on Wikibooks and even provides a small restriction to what is not an annotated text and states it should become a candidate for deletion that is the single part of the text that I see as enforcible, the rest is basically a guideline), I think, given the actual flow of the text that the mention to the policy should indeed have substituted the part that replicates the intention but a specific statement should be used to state the content as acceptable for Wikibooks.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:46, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

It's just as difficult, if not more so, to list all the things that don't belong here then to list a broad category of things that do.

::::I agree that any of the tasks is very difficult, but as pointed by the objection o SB Jhonny and why I changed my vote, covering what is accepted without stating a safety clause is in fact censoring anything that is not covered (that is the result, there is a note now but it isn't a bit clear) if we attack the problem on the other front we would be only covering what you know we don't want, take the examples above on the other projects the one that covers the 2 fronts is probably the best solution but then again if we are not restricting content why make it a policy &quot;&lt;u&gt;This policy documents the basic scope of Wikibooks&lt;/u&gt; and should not be used alone to justify deleting pages and books. Unless otherwise stated in a policy or guideline, pages and books that are in violation of one or more policies or guidelines, &lt;u&gt;are outside the scope of Wikibooks as documented in this&lt;/u&gt; or other policies and guidelines, or found unsuitable for other reasons, must not be speedy deleted.&quot; (Can almost be resumed to use it but don't use it) the only exception is the reference to the VfD and the DP.

::::Another solution would be replicate the annotated texts (and even merge it all in the future) so that all the works that aren't covered should be fit for a VfD, but again most people if on the know, will then avoid even steeping in it, by avoiding creating new works that could be problematic, so censorship will still be there. (I think that is why the wording of the annotated text is so careful, it is very well written to only cover exactly what is known not to be a annotated text, without overlapping other definitions).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:10, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::I think that as a community, we generally know what we want to keep and what we want to delete when we see it. We know if something should be here or if it should not be here, even if we can't write down specifically ''why'' we feel that way. The best way to proceed, i think, is to allow wikibookians to use their judgement. If we have a list of &quot;thou shalt nots&quot;, or even a list of things that are acceptable, we are not able to use our judgement for things that appear on that list. However, if we include general guidelines, wikibookians can make decisions on a case-by-case basis at VfD.

::::::I think I have not expressed the problem correctly about the distinction of the 2 lists ('''do this''' and '''don't do that''') it is similar to lets use an example of 2 laws, one states that in the US no one can speak foreign languages on national soil and another states exactly what languages you shouldn't speak. For any outsider or a person that doesn't have a deep understanding would probably have second thoughts about using Navajo or other Indian languages and what about archaic English ?

== Wikibooks is not paper ==
With regards to the statement, &quot;Unlike printed books, our textbooks can include links if these are directly relevant to the textbook, and some textbooks are now including interactive features such as multimedia files and interactive features using JavaScript.&quot; It seems that this could create problems. Perhaps, supplemental sections on the table of content page and/or cover page that is clearly in a separate section may be a better option than having Java and links spread throughout the book. It seems that the value of Wikibooks would be diminished if readers could not print out a book in its entirety, containing only text and pictures. If a computer is a requirement to be able to fully utilize the power and knowledge within a Wikibook then this seems like something that could be a detriment to the project and the learning experience of the readers. Many people may not have access to a computer at their leisure, and also some probably would prefer to print out a book just because they like that experience better. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 01:09, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

:Agree but what do you propose as a solution, a requirement to offer dual version of a book or just a notice?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:18, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

:It would be foolish for us to try and tell people not to use hyperlinks, Javascript, or multimedia. The power of wikibooks comes from the fact that it's a dynamic electronic media. It's a lucky coincidence that some of our books are able to be printed, but it's not a requirement. That we would even suggest that people not use all the tools at their disposal to make the best possible books is almost unthinkable. Some books fit the printed book model, and when that occurs it should be encouraged to continue along that path. Otherwise, we should encourage books not to be constrained by such a model. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:11, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::For what I understood, the user is not opposing the inclusion of interactive features but making a point on where we put a line on multimedia content versus more portable contend and how we inform and manage it. Where do we put a line on what is a multimedia presentation and a book. (hyperlinks should be used as a reference they are valid even on print, javascript, animations and sound could be problematic and indeed makes the use of the content more restrictive not only for the reader but even for contributors)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:25, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

:::From my viewpoint, that is something that is up to those contributing on an individual Wikibook, where there may be some intention to make a printed book or not.  In other words, as a project policy, we shouldn't be drawing the line, other than content on Wikibooks is something that must be educationally related and somehow useful for the instruction of some educational experience.  This is one of the reasons why Wikiversity was justifying its inclusion on Wikibooks, as it fit that rough concept.  As for javascript, animations, java applets, and more that are interactive, I don't see what the worry is.
  
:::The main concern about having such applications is that it makes it very easy to exploit security holes in browsers and post what is arguably malicious code... particularly if we allow anonymous edits of the pages.  I think that sort of problem can be overcome, but it is something that the &quot;developers&quot; of Wikimedia projects have been very reluctant to permit for what I hope are obvious reasons.  With Ajax programming and other newer concepts for on-line content display, these are certainly areas we could explore as a project to see if we may want to encourage development in that direction.  As a matter of policy, we shouldn't limit those things other than what are currently within the technical limits of the MediaWiki software.  And even then, we could try to come up with solutions that would deal with the concerns of the development team if we want to increase interactivity.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:49, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Reworking [[meta:Wiki is not paper]] into something more Wikibooks specific. ==

I don't mind the reference to the meta page, and I hope that doesn't hold up getting this policy passed, but I am wondering aloud if either we should try to inject a Wikibooks viewpoint (and other Wikimedia projects as well) into this document on meta, or perhaps fork it and rework it to something that works better for Wikibooks.  In reading through this page, it is very Wikipedia-centric (as is much of the content on Meta, but I digress there).  I know this document is referenced on a great many links throughout Wikimedia projects, just as we've done here.

One point in particular that is grating to me as a Wikibookian is &quot;A 100-page thesis on poker is useless to someone who merely needs an article summarizing the basic rules and history of the game. The purpose of a normal encyclopedia is to provide the reader a brief overview of the subject, while a reference book or text book can explain the details.&quot;  I know that the same section goes onto more details about how you could still do a detailed treatment of poker as a series of Wikipedia articles, but it still doesn't fit with what Wikibooks and other Wikimedia projects have become.

A book about poker is inappropriate for Wikipedia, but I can't say the same thing about Wikibooks.  It is precisely because [[Organic Chemistry]] was VfD'd from Wikipedia that Wikibooks was started, as a place to host a [[Poker|&quot;100-page thesis on poker&quot;]] and other much longer content than would normally be considered a Wikipedia article.

There are other minor objections to this article, and certainly I can make the changes on meta to reflect a more sister-project neutral tone.  Unfortunately, because it is referenced so much I think that would also open up a whole huge can of worms as well.  For crying out loud, Larry Sanger himself &quot;approved&quot; some of the portions of this page, for those of you who knew when he had virtual god-king status on Wikipedia as well.  It may just be easier to fork this page.  This is a good reference item, but the content here is very dated and does need some sort of update, even if that is in the form of a Wikibooks guideline.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:54, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

Why would anyone want to start writing a book here when confronted by that list of musts? This is a *wiki* for God's sake. We should expect books to evolve over time. I wonder how many existing Wikibooks we'd have to delete if we took this revised policy to the letter? Dozens, I expect.

While I agree that most of them are things we should look at anyways, we have to think about who we're trying to reach with this policy, and if a person sees all these things I'd imagine they might be daunted and shy away. A short list of fundamental necessities (NPOV, GFDL) I think would be sufficient, and then the rest would be suggestions (I attempted to do this but I know whats in my sandbox now is somewhat of a mess, just wanted to get the idea in place). We could add amendments to the appropriate section as necessary. Then again, is it possible to have both things that ''must'' be followed and things that ''may'' be under the same umbrella of a &quot;policy&quot; (or a guideline, for that matter)?

I would not however want to hold up the policy because of something like that, if the general consensus is that this is the way to go, as long as the list is understandable, simple, and complete as you said. It looks like its headed in the right direction in those regards; though I'm sure we'll end up adding or removing some things before its all said and done, the structure of it now hopefully will make it easier to make such changes.

I'm not sure how to address people's objections concerning textbooks or if it even makes sense to, and I don't see anyone whose got a problem with that proposing alternatives besides using a more confusing term like &quot;Wikibooks is for wikibooks&quot;, which doesn't help any. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:32, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

There has to be some guidance about the sort of book that is appropriate and the advantage of a list is that individual elements can be removed or added as necessary.  I like [[User:Darklama]]'s current list because it is not prescriptive about the nature of a textbook but is prescriptive about how a Wikibook should be written and its goals. It allows us to say that there are books, textbooks and also '''Wikibooks'''. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:43, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

: I disagree with the reference of calling them Wikibooks, its very confusing. I was referring to the website when I changed it back to &quot;Wikibooks is a collection of...&quot;. I believe that the text should say &quot;censored&quot; rather then edit, to satisfy people who were opposed to this proposal because it didn't say anything about being censored, in order to make that statement clearer as to its intent. I don't think the particular subdivision you made, makes any sense. To me every item in the list describes qualities of Wikibooks' books and are ultimately the goals of some or most books, which is dependent on whether it says &quot;sometimes&quot; or not. I also think the subdivision makes somethings seem more important then others, which may not be the case and may cause some Wikibookians to feel like they can safely ignore the &quot;desirable qualifies&quot;. I think the list should treat everything as being more or less of equal importance and allow some judgment on the part of Wikibookians on the importance of each quality/goal. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:40, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

: Another thing I forgot to mention the line &quot;Wikibooks are free, open-content books that can be used as part of a course of study. This page defines English Wikibooks's basic scope&quot;, includes &quot;part of a course of study&quot;, which I think is better covered later on with &quot;Suitable for learning and teaching class or course curricula, and for self-learning.&quot; Curricula is defined as &quot;courses of study&quot;. I used &quot;Wikibooks is a collection of free [[w:open content|open-content]] textbooks that anyone can edit&quot;, because its both true, and what is plastered all over the place in describing what Wikibooks is for. I don't think it would make any sense not to include that here at a minimal. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:04, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

::I would be in favour of &quot;textbook&quot; if it were defined as &quot;a book used in a course of study&quot;.  This avoidance of the term &quot;textbook&quot; avoids discussion about whether &quot;textbooks&quot; should include guides, manuals, supplementary texts etc. etc. It also pins down what Wikibooks is all about: books for use in a course of study. So, why not dispense with &quot;textbook&quot; and just use &quot;book for use in a course of study&quot;? It will save hours of debate. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:37, 16 May 2007 (UTC)

::: I think the list basically defines what textbooks are allowed on Wikibooks and what they include. I don't think people have a problem with using textbook completely, since its in the current version of the policy. I think some people have a problem with its emphases maybe, or some perceived unconventional usage. I don't think textbook should be dispense with completely, its a major part of what Wikibooks is about. I think the current proposal is more like the current version of the policy in its avoidance of defining textbooks, while providing more information on whats expected from textbooks. I think it pins down what Wikibooks is all about with the use of textbook and in the list &quot;Suitable for learning and teaching class or course curricula, and for self-learning.&quot; --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:10, 16 May 2007 (UTC)


==Wikibooks is de Facto a resource for Supplementary Texts==

Surprisingly few of the books on Wikibooks are straight textbooks.  Many of the books are information that can be studied rather than mainstream courses.  For instance:

High School Mathematics Extensions - a supplementary text

UK Constitution and government - a supplementary text for history/social studies

Rhetoric and composition - a supplementary text for english lessons

Consciousness studies - a supplementary text for neuroscience/philosophy

Learning theories - supplementary in teaching courses

Quenya, Arimaa and Chess - great books but...

etc..

I like this emphasis and feel that it is the central role of Wikibooks.  It sounds great that we might be providing textbooks for the poor and needy but a better way of doing this would be to buy them in India at $3 a piece or much less in bulk.  A good part of what we are really doing at Wikibooks is providing an outlet for people who have specialist knowledge to share this with the world. 

In view of this &quot;what is wikibooks&quot; should make it clear that it is also for supplementary texts. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:59, 13 July 2007 (UTC)

:I would like to add here that I am very sympathethic with the current vision of wikibooks is more than pure textbooks intended as the foundational text for a particular university course (if you want to go with a hardcore strict definition of a textbook).  So little of Wikibooks even fits this hardcore definition that we might as well kill this project and start over again if that really was the goal.  And it doesn't explain the strange additions to Wikibooks over the years by WMF board members themselves that seemingly seek to expand the scope of this project even more.

:The concept of an educational focus has been quite prevalent in the VfD discussions over the years as a way to defend why certain content and not other stuff ought to be kept or deleted.  The idea of defining Wikibooks as educational books (supplimentary as well as textbooks) is something very reasonable.  In fact, I feel very uncomfortable when I see listings on the WMF website marking Wikibooks as only &quot;free textbooks&quot;, as if the definition of what that means has been settled upon and is something that the Wikibooks community has agreed upon.

:I should add here that the original ''textbook only'' definition of Wikibooks was something added by Jimbo himself, and never really expounded upon in any substantial format other than a broad excuse to be used by some admin to cull content in what he perceived was a too permissive policy of accepting content on Wikibooks.  I'm still not thrilled by the culling of the video game guides, especially as the rationale for their removal (they are not textbooks!) is not well defined.  By getting rid of the textbook concept entirely except as an example of permitted content on Wikibooks, it makes significant progress to at least acknowledge what is currently on Wikibooks and to mark where, perhaps, the scope of Wikibooks would be expanded if we allowed other types of content.

:I've tried to fight both an expansion of the scope of Wikibooks (Wikijunior was one of those I fought in the past... and its foundation and creation still doesn't make sense to me) as well as those who try to redefine Wikibooks to a much smaller subset of content.  Over the years we have been the recipient of a great deal of content, and this is a special trust that we guard that content where reasonable and not let it get thrown away without some serious considerations as to its fate.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:41, 14 July 2007 (UTC)

: I agree with RobinH. Saying &quot;Wikibooks is for textbooks only&quot; has lead to some very convoluted and non-standard definitions of what a textbook is that seem unnecessary. I like the addition of &quot;supplementary&quot; texts because it preserves the educational focus of the project, but enables us to avoid such a tortured definition of the word &quot;textbook&quot;. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:03, 14 July 2007 (UTC)

== Issues ==
In &quot;Wikibooks materials are&quot; I don't see a need for the &quot;Useful&quot; and &quot;Fun&quot; subsection as they don't apply to all works and are extremely open definitions. Probably a clarification of the contents &quot;Useful for&quot; &quot;Fun to&quot;, but even then they are highly problematic characteristics to put on the policy.&lt;br&gt;
Another one is the &quot;Appropriate&quot; section I highly object to have it put in this policy in such a way. I agree with the intention but not the format it is presented to the reader. Moving it to the &quot;...are not&quot; section under &quot;are not censured&quot; would be more inline with the intention.&lt;br&gt;
There are other issues but this will start the ball rolling for now, if anyone is interested, if not I will act on my objections.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:55, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

The changes made addressed the above issues. Another issue is the wording &quot;Wikibooks materials&quot; a better wording is &quot;Wikibooks texts&quot;. I considered also &quot;content&quot; but those words cover, as &quot;material&quot;, stuff that may not be free or share the stated characteristics, this would address images, sound and source code...&lt;br&gt;
There remains also the problem that the proposed text is only addressing text on book projects, there is no reference to that distinction.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Wikibooks materials may include&quot; should be presented before the &quot;are not&quot; section. I would even argue that the section is not needed (except to the mention of annotated texts).
Another change would be moving the not &quot;Static&quot; to &quot;Always evolving&quot;/&quot;Mutable&quot;. Since it can cover a transient state, it would benefit to be stated as a characteristic.
The &quot;Enforcement&quot; section mentions Assume good faith, this was a failed proposal. It also makes statements that probably are already on the deletion policy, it could be simplified by just pointing there without extraneous considerations...&lt;br&gt;
Enforcement should just state that any violation can be addressed by fallowing the deletion policy if attempts to fix the issues failed to gather consensus or are seen as unproductive. Something on these lines. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:47, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

: I think &quot;Wikibooks materials&quot; is a more accurate description and is clearly defined by the proceeding description that &quot;Wikibooks is a collection of free open-content textbooks, supplementary texts and annotated texts.&quot;
: I don't understand what distinction you believe there is a problem with or is lacking in.
: If you mean that the &quot;may include&quot; section is not needed, I can agree with that if what the section says were to be included somehow in the other two sections.
: I do like the idea of turning the Not &quot;Static&quot; text into an Is text. The only reason there is even a &quot;Not&quot; section to begin with is to try to compromise and accommodate some people that wanted to be able to point at this policy with a quick assertion that something isn't allowed to justify deletion.
: I disagree that the enforcement section was considered a problem the last time. The intent of the enforcement section is to say that consensus and the decision making process must be used to determine whether to include or exclude material not covered by this policy and any failure on the part of this policy to mention one way or another certain material must not be used as an argument for or against works. Or put another way the intent is to make the policy explicitly neutral and a community decision with regard to any materials that people feel this policy fails to address. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 08:07, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

:: It all depends if &quot;Wikibooks&quot; is being seen as the project or one of the books in the project (this distinction has always been a source of confusion), probably making a clarification about what the policy is covering just on the beginning would fix that...
:: I will try to see about the other points but regarding the enforcement, what you state above is already covered in the deletion policy, and the enforcement or disputes of WIW would always pass by a deletion. That is why I state that the section is redundant and is in fact superseded by the other policy. WIW doesn't even need to be a policy, it could as well be a guideline, as it isn't really enforcible on it own (that is one of the distinctions on policies vs guidelines). It is a simple common agreed definition of what is expected to be acceptable content, that will not cover every instance (the other distinction, exceptions can be expected). We could also argue that it should be included on the deletion policy (since the two are interlinked), but they benefit from the separation as it eases the evolution of what we agree on as being acceptable content for the project...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:50, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

::See also if you agree with the merge of the &quot;may include&quot; in the other sections. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:36, 11 June 2010 (UTC)

:::Comments:
:::* Merging &quot;may include&quot; makes sense.
:::* On the section titles &quot;Wikibooks texts&quot; suffers from the same problem &quot;Wikibooks materials&quot; does. Both wordings would appear, to a casual reader, to refer to specific parts of books, while WIW is more concerned with overall structure and goals of books. A more precise wording would be &quot;What wikibooks are&quot; and &quot;What wikibooks are not&quot; - note the use of plural and lack of capitalization to denote we mean individual books and not Wikibooks the project.
:::* The fact that WIW is not directly enforcible does not mean it must be demoted to a guideline. Definition of project scope is too much of a central issue to not have official status. Even if enforcement requires discussion and consensus the underlining principles should be stated clearly and objectively in the form of a policy (or, if you strive for accuracy, an overarching &quot;meta-principle&quot;, as Pi zero would put it).
:::* The &quot;Enforcement&quot; section is necessary, so that it is absolutely clear that the deletion process is the executive complement to WIW. It is not a problem that DP and WIW refer one to the other - in fact, that's even desirable. And changing the name to &quot;Conclusion&quot; was not an improvement, for as it is the paragraph is not a conclusion.
:::* As far as I can see [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith|Assume good faith]] is not a &quot;failed proposal&quot;, it is just in limbo... in any case, the reference is not a problem, as it does not suggests any official character to AGF, but merely orients editors to have a positive attitude towards stubs.
:::--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 18:31, 11 June 2010 (UTC)

::::I agree with the solution to the &quot;Wikibooks&quot; issue. As for the problem of enforceability can be delegated to the other policy like I said above, it doesn't have to restate what it already present there nor reshape it, that should be done there. But I'm strongly opposed to diluting the distinctions that exist between policies and guidelines. Understanding that they haven't got equal status is of extreme importance to the project. I'm not proposing to change it into a guideline (this relates to the use of should/must in the text) that discussion is on the top of the page and it was covered in 2007.
::::The issue of enforceability has also to do with the active majority recently bringing into force this new concept that drafts and in general unproved texts are somehow equal to guidelines or have any status of unexpressed acceptance by the community is extremely dangerous goes against common practice (until recently, the first evidence of this concept occurred on the alterations made to the deletion policy). People have to understand that concepts or drafts take time to evolve, have to be gather at least a no-objection state (as much as possible) as having some type of approval, the proposal needs to be at least mature, be clearly stated and publicized...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:10, 11 June 2010 (UTC)

::::I've restored the &quot;Enforcement&quot; but removed the link to [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith|Assume good faith]] it can always be added if adopted (I'm not a proponent of it, but it seems Darklama was against and Swift supported it. It also has an unstable version, so any adoption would pass for a merge of the two into a consensual proposal). I'm happy with the references made on the enforcement section to the deletion policy, if any consideration should be made see if it isn't already on that policy and if it wouldn't fit there. (I restate that the two texts could be a single policy and with time and stability that will probably happen as they are complementary and mutually dependent.)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:48, 11 June 2010 (UTC)

==Elaboration of Solvers==
I was just reading the comment on solvers, which I more or less agree with.  But I thought I would point out that [[Solutions To Mathematics Textbooks]] seems like a solver by this description.  Of course there is the obvious reaction that this book doesn't cover &quot;a specific problem&quot; but rather a large collection of problems so maybe it, so maybe it is OK?  

But we have to be careful not to let a collection of problems either, otherwise one could write a book titled [[Beating RPG]]'s which had general strategies for beating RPG video game written (just has this book aims to contain the solutions for every mathematics text ever written).  This of course would be a collection of problems, and thus not be a solver for a specific problem.

This is all of course a bit too litigious of an objection.  But thought I would point it out for discussion. (Overall, I don't see solutions manuals as textbooks, so I side more with how this is written then the current book, but that is just my personal opinion). &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: I expected there would be comments on that change actually. Wikibooks also has [[SimCity and Urban Planning]] which isn't a solver, but might benefit from discussing some strategy and giving a brief walk through of the game some in order to help understand how the game can help people better understand the urban planning profession. Also having &quot;Strategy and Walkthroughs&quot; as an exception to the typical rules has always bothered me. Changing it to Solvers was a way of trying to address what is it about those types of works that we are really trying to address, and I think is that they give answers for solving problems without teaching anything educational. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:39, 11 June 2010 (UTC)

:: Admittedly without thinking too much about the issue, I have some doubts on whether we need this observation. If the solutions are meant to provide guidance or be a supplementary material to learning a subject (like for [[Solutions To Mathematics Textbooks]]) it is clear they belong in Wikibooks; otherwise they just fall into the realm of non-educational works. If the main concern here is banning game walkthroughs addressing solvers in general seems a bit of a roundabout way of doing it - IMO the issue in such cases is not so much the form but the subject. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 17:23, 11 June 2010 (UTC)
::: I agree there are other ways this could be addressed. I think stating that solutions, walkthroughs, strategies, and answers can only be supplementary may be the way to go though. If games as a subject was the issue, than everything in [[:Category:Games]] would need to go. I think why some are a problem and not others makes this a form issue. The form the work takes is to provide solutions or answers in a way that does not allow a person to make informed decisions and develop their own strategies and solutions. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:39, 11 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''''History'''''

Neteller originated in 1999, the purpose of this business was to take advantage of the internet

and create a business which could provide the general public a way of transferring funds from 

the customers accounts to an online merchant. The role Neteller would play in this process was 

to offer a convenient way of money transfer along with the safety and security which a company 

could offer.


'''''Services &amp; Expansion''''' 

Initially just offering services for online money transfers, Neteller soon stemmed out with a 

new program called InstaCASH allowing bank account transfers and distributing Neteller cards 

for customer convenience. Neteller soon realized that the services which they provided were in

demand around the world. In taking another step forward Neteller decided to expand its company’s

limits and offer their services globally. Thus expanding Neteller’s cliental and making it a top

competitor in the online transfer corporation.  With the expansion of the business, Neteller soon

opened new regional offices to maintain customer security and satisfaction which are key principles

the corporation operates on.  The regional offices are based in Calgary, Canada, London, England, Hong Kong, China and San 

Jose, Costa with its corporate head quarters based in Douglas, Isle of Man.





'''''Success'''''

Neteller has succeeded as a business platform , due to the blend of an unconventional idea and the use of technology.

Resulting in a company which has dominated its market and established a global name for itself. Well providing secure 

and friendly service to millions of customers and merchants. With on going advances in techology and a constant demand 

to progress quicker, Neteller will continue to strive forward with assitance of technology.  







'''''Quick Facts'''''

As stated by Neteller &quot; User base of more than 3 million customers&quot;,&quot;More than 3,500

online merchants accept payments through Neteller system&quot;,&quot;Over 7.3 billion in transactions

processed in 2005&quot;, &quot; Company employs over 800 people &quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Computers in Education==
&lt;Br&gt;
The use of computers in the academic setting has been growing with the increases in computing power and the lowering of the cost. Now schools have computer labs that give students access to resources they may not have at home. Some classes even have a computer at every desk for the use of the students. Some examples of computer uses are: teaching software development, hardware design, novel users of microcontrollers. The applications used are also indispensable to computers in education today and into the future.

==Applications&lt;Br&gt;==

Applications for computers are a necessity for everyone and even more important for those in academia. Computer application software is an interface between the user of the computer and the operating system of the computer. This software allows an infinite number of uses for a computer. Typical computer applications would include: word processors, spreadsheets, databases, media players, presentation software, and e-mail.

[[w:Word_processors|Word processors]], next to e-mail, are likely the most used computer application by students. Word processors allow for assignments to be legible, formatted, spell-checked, and printed. It allows students to concentrate more on the content of their projects and focus less on the grammar and spelling.

[[w:Spreadsheet|Spreadsheets]] are a necessity for all business students. Spreadsheets are used to tabulate numbers and create graphs and charts. With the built-in calculation functionality it saves students the possible errors in manual calculations and a number changed on the sheet will change all the connected numbers in real time.

Many classes now also require [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint Microsoft Powerpoint] for in class presentations. Presentation applications like PowerPoint provide a relatively simple, professional format of project presentation. By creating individual slides, a student has full control over the visual and audio aspects of their presentation.  Again this allows for more concentration on the content and less focus on the presentation display. It also allows for quick, easy, and possibly frequent changes to content.

Many educational institutions such as colleges and universities now use [[w:Web_portal|web portals]] for personalized access to course materials, grades, fees as well as other information.

The most ubiquitous application not only for students and academics, but for the world at large is [[w:E-mail|E-mail]] or Electronic Mail. Though many primary and secondary schools frown on free mail services. Many of them have set their firewalls set to prevent access to these services. The schools have purchased their own domains and created their own E-mail services for their students and faculty. E-mail allows for near instant letter communication with their professors, other students, and the school administration!!!

==Current State Of Computers==
&lt;p style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;Online:&lt;/p&gt; With the growing numbers of students that have entered the work force and wish to upgrade their career options online learning has become an ideal option. With online learning you have the ability to work around your current schedule, or take more courses then you can possibly fit in one regular school day. &lt;Br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;Blackboard:&lt;/p&gt;
Blackboard is an online education tool with many functions for the student/teacher relationship. A teacher can customize their blackboard page to fit their classes needs, such as having a place for students to hand in their assignments if they are unable to attend the class that day, or the teacher can post their lessons online so there is no need for a student to even attend the class (unless there is an exam that day.) Blackboard takes the learning process to a new level in efficiency for online learning.
&lt;p style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;Essays / Research:&lt;/p&gt; The internet has provided a handy reliable source of information at our fingertips. With what ever subject we enroll in the information for essays is vast and easy to use. Doing the essays themselves have also become easier. With computers and their spell checking to the ability to type over 50 words a minutes; computers have made the essay writing process a dream.. &lt;Br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;Physical computers in the classroom :&lt;/p&gt;(phones, computers, projectors, monitors, printers, remotes (slides) etc) Projectors to display information give the visual learners extra help on comprehending the current lecture. The &lt;Br&gt;

==Future Of Computers==
With the fast growing computer industry, it's no wonder that computers are becoming more integrated in our school's systems. The computer has for a long time been a part of school systems, now with the growing technology computers have become on official part of the school system for children's research and essay writing. What is the future? the future has already begun, many classes are now online so you can do all the studying you need in the comfort of your own home from over the internet. With online classes you do not have to be afraid of others opinions, and you can feel free to speak your mind on what you think of the topic.
Classroom materials distribution can also be incorporated, with many lessons for all to learn, teachers can create additional assignments that can be done at any time and post them online. This cuts down on the amount of papers students need, and helps the students to stay organized with all their assignments and even their books if teachers feel the need.

==School Communications==
&lt;p style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;Teacher/parent/student communications &amp; participations:&lt;/p&gt; Teachers now have a more efficient way of communicating with the student's parents or even the student themselves. With email those students that are taking online courses can mail their teachers for information on the class, or even ask for help with out the worry of judgement from their classmates. &lt;Br&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;Registration/administators/secretaries:&lt;/p&gt; Computers have brought ease to the secretaries of today. With all the student's information to be processed it has become easier from multiple papers to organized software. The student's contact information/allergies/disabilities are all at their fingers in case an emergency arises.
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;

==Disabilities==
There are many factors that can effect a person's ability to function properly in a normal school setting. A broken arm can prove difficult to write an essay, a migraine can influence focus and a variety of learning disorders also impact negatively on the learning process.  Having a computer handy people have the ability write their essays with greater ease. There are also those with more severe physical and/or mental challenges. With computers they can communicate with us with artificial speaking programs. Stephen Hawkings is a good example of this. He can not speak on his own, so he has a computer that satisfies this need. Teachers now have an efficient way of communicating with those that can't.&lt;Br&gt;

Written by: Anna Bodenhamer

There is no one answer to the school/community disconnect.  There are many disconnecting pieces to the puzzle.  The three major pieces are the family structure, the schools, and the communities we live in.  Each piece plays a major role in a child’s life. So if you plan on teaching for a profession prepare for an exciting, unpredictable, rewarding and many times very stressful career.  

Today the family structure has many components.  They are culturally diverse, single parents, blended families and low-income families that are very unstable.  Instability is the worst and the hardest on kids especially when they are constantly on the move from school to school.  Social workers call the moves, “stealth moves” to stay ahead of landlords looking for overdue rent (Education vital signs, 2006).  Overall, mobility rates are highest in large, predominantly minority urban school districts (American school board journal).  Mobility rates keep climbing.  According to the Chicago Public Schools twenty-three percent of students who entered first grade in 1999 had changed schools by the end of the year.  Four years after entering first grade, more than fifty percent had changed schools (Education vital signs, 2006).  The negative effects of high mobility are well documented; but how can schools address students’ needs amid the pressure of accountability (Susan Black, 2003)?  Schools are under tremendous pressure to meet accreditation and are held accountable for their SOL scores.  So we all know what that means, “teachers are under the microscope” in hopes their students achieve passing scores on the SOL tests.  This is not an easy achievement with students moving in and out and than back in again. It is not surprising that many highly mobile students suffer academically (American school board journal).

Schools are a major piece of the puzzle in shaping our future.  Teaching is becoming a very stressful occupation.  The No Child Left Behind Act, signed into law January 2002, aims to make sure that all children achieve academic proficiency and gain the educational skills necessary to succeed later in life (Child trends data bank, 2003).  In theory this is a wonderful idea but in reality it is not easy to accomplish.  In one classroom you may have as many as twenty-five to thirty-two students with half being two to three years below grade level.  Then there is the SOL pacing guide you must follow and complete by the end of the year.  So your students take the SOL test and you hold your breath, in hopes that their scores are passing or at least not embarrassingly low!   Then the so call specialist scrutinizes your class scores without giving concrete advice or guidance in how to achieve higher scores.  They tell you what you need to accomplish but not how.  It is very frustrating!  There are just too many specialists that have never stepped into a classroom to experience the teacher’s reality of teaching students of “today”.

Students are a product of their environment.  Classrooms are full of cultural diversity and socio-economic levels.  Many homes and communities often accept and encourage behaviors that are incompatible with the behaviors in the school setting (Bos and Vaughn, 2006).  For instance, aggressive and highly emotionally charged behavior may be expected of African American males at home and in their community but are unacceptable in the class setting.  Hispanic students are viewed as dependent and passive (Bos and Vaughn).  This is very confusing to the student when they receive a reprimand and told the behavior is unacceptable at school.  The lack of respect and opposition to authority is increasing every year.  They reason by saying, “My momma says it’s OK!”  Social skills are definitely lacking in society.  When parents are called in for a conference, the teachers immediately realize, “The apple does not fall far from the tree.”  These days it is falling on the schools to teach the social skills our parents, a generation ago, taught us at home.  Teaching students to solve interpersonal problems has been very successful with a wide range of populations (Platt and Spivack, 1972).  The goal of interpersonal problem-solving training is to teach students how to employ a wide range of strategies that allow them to develop and maintain positive relationships with others, cope effectively with others, solve their own problems, and resolve conflict with others.  

'''FAST''' is a strategy that is taught to students with learning disabilities who have been identified as having social skills problems (Vaughn and Lancelotta, 1990; Vaughn, Lancelotta, and Minnis, 1988; Vaughn, McIntosh, and Spencer-Rowe, 1991).  
This is a wonderful strategy for all students.  The idea is to get students to consider:
 
FREEZE and think! What is the problem? 
ALTERNATIVE? What are my possible solutions?                   SOLUTION evaluation choose the best solutions:  Safe? Fair?       TRY It! Slowly and carefully does it work? Soulutions that is 
effective in the long run.
               
'''SLAM''' is another strategy used to assist students in 
accepting and assimilating negative feedback and comments
from other people (McIntosh, Vaughn, and Bennerson, 1995).
It stands for:

STOP—Stop whatever you are doing.
LOOK—Look the person in the eye.
ASK—Ask the person a question to clarify what he/she means.    
MAKE—Make an appropriate response to the person.

When students master these strategies they will have learned a very valuable lesson.  They realize there are laws to abide by and rules to follow in society and to learn to do so will enable them to live a safer, peaceful, and successful life.  

So as you can see “schools” are a major piece of the puzzle.  Teachers educate, nurture, and become surrogate parents to all their students.  The disconnection between schools and communities is wide and the responsibilities on schools seem to grow every year.  A person who becomes a teacher is unselfish, dedicated, and caring.  We all know the profession will not create wealth in our lives but we will enjoy many rewards.  Especially the few students that come back to say, “Thanks for everything you taught me”.

==Health== 
Vision for the Future

With the combination of technology and health care there are many possible doors to be opend and boundaries to be crossed. With the availability of information at our finger tips through the internet there are numerous possibilities to explore. Doctors and nurses are able to research any question or problem in a matter of seconds on the internet. Also organization of files and healthcare documents can all easily be stored on main frame computers, witch can be accesed by doctors around the hospital. Also the availability of computers and technology to the health care system can easily increase the productivity leavels of health care staff and help introduce new aspects that can be put into use.

When you think of Technology and health care, you can only imagine the possible outcomes. Many new and innovative projects have come from Technology inter mingling with health care. Especially the amount of research capability that has increased. With the use of technology more and more viruses are broken down and cures are found. This is also the case for treatment in medicine, with technology progressing so is medicine.

The much vaunted information superhighway is expected to improve the quality of life for all Americans. This vision—the National Information Infrastructure—consists of both existing systems and technologies and others still to emerge, all linked nationwide. Every part of the economy, including health care, will be affected.

For example:

Technlogy has Developed an entirely paperless medical record system at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston that links computerized patient records with different departments, physician offices, and 20 satellite clinics. Developing a practical common medical terminology that will be the basis for computerized patient records, clinical decision support, health services research, data-driven guideline development, and electronic interchange of patient information. The Mayo and the Kaiser Foundations are collaborating on the project, which is cofunded by AHCPR and the National Library of Medicine.

== Improved Quality ==


Improved Quality in Healthcare Computers are aiding healthcare advances in many different ways. An example of which is the HELP system. The HELP system stores useful information that can remind and aid physicians while solving clinical problems. For complex problems, computer workstations can integrate patient records, research plans, and knowledge databases for physicians. The HELP system was in place to study the significance of serving antibiotics two hours before surgery.

In addition to alerting physicians to abnormal and changing clinical values, computers can post reminders for physicians. For complex problems, computer workstations can integrate patient records, research plans, and knowledge databases. Physicians reminded by computer were twice as likely to give flu vaccine to patients at high risk during the winter in a 3-year trial by Indiana University investigators. Winter hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and tests for respiratory ailments were reduced by 10 to 30 percent because the high-risk patients were vaccinated. Computer alerts for physicians prevented serious kidney failure and preserved kidney function in patients. When indicators of kidney function rose in the patients, the computers alerted the physicians, who then stopped medications being given or adjusted doses more than 21 hours sooner than when there were no alerts.

Use of highly interactive HIV workstations for physicians can result in up to 20-percent decrease in hospitalization of HIV patients, increased use of primary care, and improved quality of care. From any of the terminals at the hospital or from home by telephone dialup, clinicians can access the patient data base and the HIV knowledge data base for improved patient care. Computers and databases can be used to compare expected results with actual results and to help physicians make decisions.

== Decreased Costs ==
 
Several analyses have detected substantial quality problems throughout the health care system. The following 4 topics are covered under the health: 1.) Decreased Costs (under health) 2.) Security 3.) Quality 4.) visions Decreased Costs.

As publically acknowledged, Information technology has drastically reduced the consumption of paper. IN the health care industry the abundant selection and records of patients is overcome by a 50kb file containing the vital information about the patients treatments and health on the computer. Information technology has consistently been identified as an important component of any approach for improvement. Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) is a promising technology that allows physicians to enter orders into a computer instead of handwriting them. Because CPOE fundamentally changes the ordering process, it can substantially decrease the overuse, underuse, and misuse of health care services. Studies have documented that CPOE can decrease costs, shorten length of stay, decrease medical errors, and improve compliance with several types of guidelines. The costs of CPOE are substantial both in terms of technology and organizational process analysis and redesign, system implementation, and user training and support. Computerized physician order entry is a relatively new technology, and there is no consensus on the best approaches to many of the challenges it presents. This technology can yield many significant benefits and is an important platform for future changes to the health care system. Organizational leaders must advocate for CPOE as a critical tool in improving health care quality. When a physician orders a test by computer, it can automatically display information that promotes cost-effective testing and treatment.

Costs in total at Wishard Memorial Hospital in Indianapolis decreased by approximately $594 per admission (projected hospital savings: more than $3 million) when physicians used computers to write all inpatient orders. The workstations were linked to a comprehensive electronic medical record system. Total charges per admission were $887 less when workstations were used to write all inpatient orders at the hospital; tens of billions could be saved nationwide. Physicians ordered 14 percent fewer tests per outpatient visit when using computer workstations at a large primary care facility in Indianapolis. Workstations showed prior test results, predictions of abnormal results, and test prices.

==Advances==
The Computer Revolution as a Business Tool
Computers are an indispensable tool for doing business. This is the plain truth that all businesses large or small must understand.

When I was a kid, on allowance day, I'd cycle over to Mr. Lee's candy store and buy 25 cents of mixed candy. Mr. Lee knowing how much I preferred the sugar coated strawberries to those mini-tootsie rolls would fill the order (a little brown bag) top heavy with those delicious strawberries, a smattering of other sweets, and at the most one or two tootsie rolls. Unlike the competition up the street at the Blue Jeans candy store where no matter how you protested the order was always filled with goodies in equal amounts, Mr. Lee understood the business principle of customization. In fact, I'm sure that if Mr. Lee were doing business today, he would be keeping track of his customers buying habits with a computer like so many successful businesses are doing.

Consider this: When you shop at retailers like Superstore, Home Depot, Staples and so on, virtually all of the products on the shelf are there in an attempt to fit the shopper’s tastes. How do these retailers know the shopping habits of thousands people? Simple, they are tracking and recording purchases at the check out counter with a computer. More sophisticated software programs will record demographics like age, address, sex, occupation, and how much money you spend.

But computers don't just help record customer purchases. They are critical in managing inventories of literally thousands of products. This aids retailers in deciding how much and when to replenish there stocks; what is selling like hotcakes and what isn’t moving.

Perhaps most important of all, computers can track the flow of money. Accounting applications like Excel and Quicken allow retailers to keep record of debits and credits, profits and losses, charitable donations, and theft. They are useful for keeping the all important tax records too.
Computers streamline business and keep costs down while enabling faster and more efficient service.

==Drawbacks==
It is easy to get carried away with the advances taking place in the world of business and technology, but for every leap forward there is an inevitable downside. Perhaps the upside to the increasingly global and technological nature of business far outweighs the negatives, however they should be considered none the less.
Stop talking about candy!

=Future=

The Changing Workplace--

The changes in the office setting will be similar to those in the home.  Computers will control more things and have more power.  Businesses will utilize this to be more productive.  Computers will take over more jobs. 
The biggest change will be in where people work.  Actually traveling to a physical office will be unneeded. Faster networks will allow high quality instantaneous video.  People will work from the home and be able to accomplish everything they did before.  There will still be a need to travel to work for face to face meetings, but this will be a rarity.  Personally meeting with people will still be necessary to understand and connect with other people. Technology will play a greater role in the office as it becomes more powerful.  Humans will still do the creative thinking, but will play a smaller role in manual labor tasks. 
 
Computers in Factories--

Computers will play a larger role in factories of the future.  Increasing computing power will allow for greater automation.  This will reduce the number of jobs available, but people will always be needed.  The amount of tasks done by computer will continue to increase.

==iPods==

Looking around everywhere in public, Apple iPod’s are everywhere.  They are portable media players and allow you to listen to music uploaded onto the device from your computer.  There are '''iPod''' video players now, which on top of listening to music, allow you to watch the music video to that song. You can also upload movies, pictures, and shows and view them on the little screen.  There are a number of different types of '''iPod’s''' in the iPod family including the Nano, Shuffle, Mini, and Photo.  Some University classes even make the lecture available to view from your iPod!  Even news broadcasts are offered to be viewed with it.  In order to transfer the media onto the device, you need iTunes, which is a program where you organize and load up your iPod with all the stuff you want on it. You can choose whether to take songs from cd’s, buy songs from the iPod store online, or even download what you want.  There are many other MP3 players being made similar to the iPod, but by far the iPod is the most popular one being marketed.  You can accessorize it with different covers, connect it to your car, and connect it to a boom-box so everyone can enjoy your music.  With technology moving as fast as it is today, there are sure to be many more features made available on our precious iPods.

Careers are the general course or progression of one's working life or one's professional achievements.

==IT and the Effects on Transportation==


I'm writing about the effects, both good and bad alike, about how computers have affected people's careers. I'll be talking about how computers have changed transportation, and peoples careers.

Transportation has, and will always be very important. Without it peoples lives would be greatly changed. Most people think of transportation as in buses, cars, trucks, and vans that people use for everyday uses for example food, mail, friends, and we don't think much about it or we take it for granted. Something people don't think about much is that there are careers based on transportation, like FedEx, UPS and others out there whose main purpose is to transport things. The ironic thing is that without the people who have careers in transportation and delivering goods we ourselves would have poor transportation. For with it ideas are shared, materials shipped from one place to another. One thing leads to another and soon you are here.

Computers had effects on this for with the advancment of computers leads to better design, faster methods, and many more wonderful things, which people dreamed about. Look at history and you will see that more change have happened in the last 50 years then ever before. Taking a look back to let's say the medieval times, they had horses, and maybe some chariots for royalty and wealthy merchants nothing more. You can go to [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-64340 http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-64340] a website that talks about it and the effects felt during those times. They didn't have computers and see how things were back then, not so good since the average person couldn't get supplies in a few days to make things better.

Now to our time, everywhere you look you can see some sort of transportation, be it a bike, car etc... We had cars before computers but after it was when things changed, you can go to www.computerhope.com/history/ for more info about the changes associated with computers. Since we have it peoples careers have changed from where you work to your stress level, like working in an office compared to fishermen not the average person I mean the ones that are on huge fishing ships that have nets, hooks, storage departments to hold the fish. They have an extremely high stress since they say its the most dangerous place to work you can go to www.wharfcat.com, one of a thousand sites that have more info about it. They rely on the ship to keep them alive and their careers, just like a mailman needs his truck to work properly, to FedXx people who deliver packages from place to place regardless of size.

Computers have had a tremendous effect on our transportation system for without it we would be less advanced then we are now.  No planes, smaller boats maybe, but nothing like the cruise ships we have so seafood would be limited to shore catches. We would have cars that weren't as good as the ones we have now so ultimately computers have effected our way of life mainly with transportation for without it who knows where we might be today.

=='''IT and Its Effects on Careers - Changes in the Career World'''==

It's the &quot;Age of Information Technology (IT)&quot; and has had significant effects on our lives.  We are inundated by the changes.  We live with and by the changes.  Among the many facets of our lives affected by Information Technology are the changes that have, and will continue to, occur in our careers. 

How did you choose your first career?  How did you determine if this would be an appropriate career choice for you -- physically and mentally?  What is the job market and wage situation in your chosen field?  How did you know what training was necessary to pursue this career?  How did you determine where this training could be obtained?  How did you find out the specific training and possible co-op or apprenticeship program that would benefit you in the pursuit of this career?  How did you search for a job?  How did you apply for the jobs of interest?  To most or all of these questions, we can generally say that we have utilized the computer at some point.  We have entered the &quot;Age of Information Technology&quot;. 

IT has become increasingly critical in career choices and within our career itself.  IT has made it possible for many, especially the disabled community, to pursue a career. IT has opened up the career world -- from a career in IT itself to careers utilizing various aspects of IT to careers supporting the IT industry, to name a few. IT and its influence on people's careers is the main topic of investigation and this segment briefly examines the changes IT has had on careers.  Of particular interest is how IT has affected change both within and around careers and career choices.

'''Choosing Your Career - What Career Best Suits Me?'''

One may know from a very early age what they &quot;want to be when they grow up,&quot; while others have more difficulty defining their place in the work world.  Fortunes or misfortunes of life, as well as life's experiences, may cause one to rethink and redirect their original intention.  It appears that the 'career for life' is becoming non-existent and estimates have been given whereby individuals will be changing their jobs approximately seven times in their lifetime.  So, whether you are beginning your journey in the career world or merely seeking that change (forced or otherwise), Information Technology will probably play a large part in how one assesses their competency and interest(s)in specific areas.  

One may get their career advice from such sources as parents, friends, family and various other contacts (e.g., career or guidance counsellors).  However, tapping into electronic sources of information is also gaining in popularity and maybe utilized in concert with, or exclusive of, human contacts.  Add to this, the fact that various forms of Information Technology was likely used in the production of print materials offering career choices, advice and options.  Furthermore, one's decision may be affected by some form of electronic testing or self-directed assessment, including some forms of IQ testing which would identify more precisely what career(s) may be best suited to you and your personality, abilities and interests.

One example of the latter maybe found at the Human Resources and Skills Development website (i.e., http://www23.hrdc-drhc.gc.ca/ch/e/docs/ch_welcome.asp).  This electronic version of the ''Career Handbook'' &quot;... is the counselling component of the National Occupational Classification (NOC) system [which]provides global ratings assigned to occupations to further define skills, worker characteristics and other indicators related to occupations that are important for career exploration and informed career decision-making. This counselling resource is used by a wide range of professionals for many applications, and by individuals engaged in self-directed career planning.  [It] ... provides 923 occupational profiles for counselling based on NOC 2001 occupations and ... includes information on aptitudes, interests, involvement with data/people/things, physical activities, environmental conditions, education/training indicators, career progression and work settings&quot; (HRSDC website, accessed 09/12/09).

'''Choosing Your Career - IT and Career Selection'''

Not everyone selects a career path that &quot;best suits&quot; them.  Choices are made for a variety of reasons.  Sometimes it comes down to such factors as: a) what is in the best interests of the family?; b) the current or prospective job market; c) timeframe for, and availability of, training and/or apprenticeship spaces; d) wage rates; e) job location; f) one's age at the time of choosing; and even g)the level of IT knowledge required.  For example, some may choose to shy away from careers that involve intensive use of Information Technology, whereas others may make IT their specific career.

If one must make a choice, whether as a &quot;best fit&quot; or for other reasons, IT can be invaluable in the decision-making process.  The aforementioned HRSDC ''Career Handbook'' is just one source that could be of assistance in one's career selection.  Another that may be of help to those seeking a career in Alberta or employment with an Alberta employer is the Alberta Learning Information Services (ALIS) website that maybe found at http://www.alis.gov.ab.ca/wageinfo/Content/RequestAction.asp?format=html&amp;aspAction=GetWageHomePage&amp;Page=Home).  Four main links on this site include: a) OCCinfo; b) WAGEinfo; c) CERTinfo; and d) EDinfo.  As these names imply, one can find information about: a) the occupational &quot;fit&quot; for you and what you want by providing specific details about an occupation's duties, working conditions, salaries, advancement opportunities, personal characteristics and educational qualifications; b) Alberta wage and salary profiles (full- and part-time) by occupation, geographic area and industry group; c) certification and regulation requirements for specific Alberta occupations, including regulated occupations; and d) what educational programs are required and where they maybe obtained, as well as information about distance learning programs in Western Canada.

These are only two examples of  IT at work in career selection.  IT, therefore, can provide information as well as influence one's choice.  For example, one's interests may lie in an area where there are few jobs and/or low pay and, as a result, one may look elsewhere for their chosen field.

'''Career Training - IT at Work for Your Work'''

Okay, so you've decided upon the career path, now what?  On-the-job training is just one aspect of a career.  Specific educational requirements may have to be met prior to, or in concert with, on-the-job training (e.g., co-op or apprenticeship).  Information Technology may play a big part in this training, be it on-the-job or institutional-based.  

There is no question that a career directly linked to the IT industry will require intensive study and hands-on application of IT.  From programming to repairing IT products, IT &quot;professionals&quot; will be intimately involved in IT training programs. In other cases, learning to use specific IT tools is necessary (e.g., CADD in Architectural or Piping Drafting).  

Educational facilities make extensive use of IT in the delivery of training programs (e.g.,  Blackboard, e-learning, video conferencing).  This includes the need for the trainee to use IT in the application, course searching/scheduling and registration process.  Finally, there are the numerous in-class instructional IT tools (e.g., laptops and projection equipment).

Then, for those of us employed in positions less dependent upon IT (if there are any), there maybe on-the-job training that could be delivered via IT tools.  For example, customer service representatives may undergo intensive training on how to deal with various customers, situations and complaints by means of videos.  Others may train by means of training modules on the company computer.

For each and everyone of us, IT is proving to be more important in career preparation.

'''Getting That Job -- IT and THE Job'''

Well, your training is complete and now you are ready for the real world!  If you have not already landed the perfect job by way of an internship, apprenticeship or co-op program, then your work at finding work begins.  IT has become an integral part of the job search and acquisition process.  Jobs may still be found in the local, regional and national newspapers and magazines, but the use of IT sources has increased significantly.  Potential job opportunities are posted online and maybe found on company, government and &quot;job&quot; sites (e.g., workopolis.com).

You've sought out various job postings and must now commence the application process.  Here, too, potential employees are often required to apply on-line.  In fact, one may have utilized a &quot;resume builder&quot; program in preparation for the application.  Employers are often requesting a specific &quot;company&quot; application form be filled out and submitted on-line.  There's no getting away from IT in these cases.

The application has been sent and is now in the hands of the potential employer.  It is at this stage that your future maybe entirely outside the influence of human &quot;hands&quot; and under the influence of IT forces.  Remember that on-line &quot;company&quot; application form?  HR maybe deluged by a mountain of applications and unable to deal with the volume on a personal level, therefore, companies may opt to conduct an initial sort and assessment of applications by electronic means.  

If you've made the &quot;IT cut,&quot; then further assessment and possible interview maybe done in person.  However, even at that stage, IT can be at work.  People may conduct the interview, but IT maybe incorporated into the process.  For example, the applicant maybe presented with a situational video and asked to comment on how they may handle the situation (e.g., a difficult customer that must be appeased in some manner).

Once you have acquired the position, then there's the aspect of getting you on the payroll.  IT is intimately involved in this in that your personnel files maybe stored electronically.  Then, what about getting that paycheque?  The trend has been toward the use of direct deposits.  At the current time, one can also see their pay stub on-line, but Employment Standards has (to-date) not allowed this as the sole means of receiving notification of your pay -- a paper copy must still be provided to the employee.

'''IT On the Job'''

Whether you've landed that IT job or a more &quot;traditional&quot; job, IT is bound to be involved in that job.  One can pretty much say that &quot;traditional&quot; no longer has the meaning it once did, but now must include IT as part and parcel of the job.  

The following example will help to explain.  In most instances, a reservations clerk no longer simply answers the phone and enters your request or responds to your inquiries without the benefit of IT.  The clerk may not, in fact, be the first point of contact for the customer -- e.g., there maybe an automated telephone answering system that directs the call or an answering machine may give alternative contact information and/or updates on bookings and availability.  Computer software has also been designed to aid in this clerk's job.  It may offer feedback on availability, allow bookings and collection of customer information on the spot in a one-step process.  IT has, as a result, made many jobs more efficient and less time consuming.  Old jobs have become more streamlined, although some would disagree on this point in some circumstances.

IT could also be utilized in monitoring one's job, not only for security reasons, but also for assessing one's on-the-job efficiency.  The video surveillance camera and the remote controlled electronic door access are two such &quot;security&quot; related IT tools at the workplace.  For the grocery clerk passing items across the scanner, there is less need for manual input of codes or prices, but this system can also assess the volume of sales and efficiency of the clerk in doing their job.  This, too, decreases the need for order clerks and physical shelf checks -- the system can automatically submit an order when a certain volume of sales has been achieved (and the stock is in need of replenishing).

Physically challenged persons are no longer as restricted in their career choices.  With IT, there are many potential positions available. Simply being confined to a wheelchair, for example, does not necessarily mean that you are not interested or suited to an IT job such as programming or data entry, to name a couple.  In addition, some jobs have been redefined by IT and are now within the range of possiblity for those with various challenges.  Some of the once physically challenging duties are aided by technology and even getting to work and about the workplace has become less difficult (e.g., electronic doors and automatic door openers).

IT has changed many jobs from within.  From personal experience, a job that entailed face-to-face contact and &quot;juggling&quot; a great deal of paper has shifted to one encompassing IT.  The paper has disappeared for the most part and people are no longer dealing with you across the counter. The medium of contact and job focus has shifted to Blackboard and e-mail.  IT has redefined the job and has necessitated a change in duties and expertise.

IT was once, and often continues to be, thought of as somewhat of an evil monster lurking to grab one's job.  Computers were going to take over!  They would be the downfall of society!  Well, maybe this is true in some cases, but not all.  While IT can and has changed jobs from within (as noted above), IT can also expand one's job skills and duties.  This can be especially relevant cases where downsizing has taken place because the company no longer found it necessary to retain employees with &quot;old&quot; job skills, but have downloaded some of that employees duties onto another.  On the other hand, some positions are moving &quot;offshore&quot; because of the Age of Information Technology.

'''IT and a Final Note'''

We are defined by our career or job.  Information Technology has defined our job and our career.  One cannot definitively say that they are not influenced by Information Technology in some way in determining, acquiring, performing or getting paid for their job.  IT has had a significant impact on people's work world.

Vision for the Future 

With the combination of technology and health care there are many possible doors to be opend and boundaries to be crossed. With the availability of information at our finger tips through the internet there are numerous possibilities to explore. Doctors and nurses are able to research any question or problem in a matter of seconds on the internet. Also organization of files and healthcare documents can all easily be stored on main frame computers, witch can be accesed by doctors around the hospital. Also the availability of computers and technology to the health care system can easily increase the productivity leavels of health care staff and help introduce new aspects that can be put into use.  

When you think of Technology and health care, you can only imagine the possible outcomes. Many new and innovative projects have come from Technology inter mingling with health care. Especially the amount of research capability that has increased. With the use of technology more and more viruses are broken down and cures are found. This is also the case for treatment in medicine, with technology progressing so is medicine. 

The much vaunted information superhighway is expected to improve the quality of life for all Americans. This vision—the National Information Infrastructure—consists of both existing systems and technologies and others still to emerge, all linked nationwide. Every part of the economy, including health care, will be affected.

For example: 

Technlogy has Developed an entirely paperless medical record system at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston that links computerized patient records with different departments, physician offices, and 20 satellite clinics. 
Developing a practical common medical terminology that will be the basis for computerized patient records, clinical decision support, health services research, data-driven guideline development, and electronic interchange of patient information. The Mayo and the Kaiser Foundations are collaborating on the project, which is cofunded by AHCPR and the National Library of Medicine.

== Word Processing ==

'''Introduction and Overview'''

Word processing is probably the most common among the &quot;productivity&quot; software applications in use.  The computer was certainly adopted quickly as a replacement for the typewriter when users had increased access to computers and discovered its advantages in document creation, editing, formatting and saving -- that is, its word processing capabilities.  This is especially true when it comes to making changes to previously created documents.  No longer is it necessary to re-type entire pages and/or documents in order to add, delete and make corrections, among other things.  It has become as simple as retrieving the originally typed document from the computer (or storage device), making the necessary changes and either printing it with the &quot;push of a button&quot; (or few keystrokes) or putting the new version back into a file on the computer or on a storage device.  In fact, there should be less chance of errors and typos because of such features as spelling and grammar checking options.

Possibly the greatest advantage in word processing is the &quot;word wrap&quot; feature which eliminates the need for time consuming &quot;carriage returns,&quot; therefore also decreasing the expenditure of energy in the typing process.  In order to do &quot;word processing,&quot; one needs a computer and a program called a &quot;word processor&quot;  (http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/word_processing.html  Retrieved Oct 2, 2006).

Computers are generally sold with factory installed word processing software, but often this software is not the product or version desired by the customer.  For example, the functionality of the software (e.g., Notepad) is more limited compared to the likes of Microsoft Word.  As a result, purchasers tend to purchase, install and upgrade to a more common and familiar word processor.

In the early 1980s, word processing software such as DW3 (DisplayWriter) was command based and, as a result, more dependent upon &quot;function&quot; keys for implementing commands.  Since the 1990s, users are not required to remember specific functions because the programs tend to be more 'user friendly' in terms of providing icons and drop-down menu options for the user's convenience.  Although it may take one some time to find the appropriate command, a user can search and/or browse -- even request &quot;help&quot; from the program itself --  to find what they wish to accomplish in their document.

Perhaps the most common and familiar to computer users are such word processing software as Microsoft Word and WordPerfect.  In fact, word processing has advanced to the point of being within a &quot;suite&quot; of productivity software applications and, as a result, can utilize the interconnectivity of the programs in this &quot;suite&quot; to produce advanced word document presentations with such features as 'linked' tables, maps and websites.  

For more technical documents, there's an option to utilize a feature called &quot;Cite While You Write&quot; which inserts commands into the menu (i.e., 'Tools') of the word processing program (e.g., Microsoft Word) to give the user direct access to references and enables the bibliographic software (e.g., EndNote or ProCite) to conduct bibliographic formatting during the writing stage in the open document  (Thomson ISI ResearchSoft, 2003, &quot;EndNote 7 ... Bibliographies &amp; More Made Easy,&quot; p. 38; ISI ResearchSoft, 2000, &quot;ProCite,&quot; pp. 63-64).

Today, rather than purchasing word processing software, there is the option to use Free Software (e.g., AbiWord).  Many word processors can open and save Microsoft Word Document files [and] .... suitable for a wide variety of word processing tasks [and] ... available for a number of languages and operating systems&quot; (http://www.abisource.com/  Retrieved Oct 3, 2006).. Another option is to make use of  web based word processors (e.g., Writely).  One can &quot;share documents instantly &amp; collaborate [in] real-time ... edit your documents from anywhere ... store your documents securely online ... [and is] easy to use ... [because it provides] a familiar, desktop feel&quot; (https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=writely&amp;passive=true&amp;continue=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.writely.com%2F&amp;ltmpl=homepage&amp;nui=0  Retrieved Oct 2, 2006). 

While there are many word processors available, each and everyone has the ability to perform the basics.  That is, word processors enable the user to create or type a document, edit (make additions and corrections, as well as check spelling and grammar, move, copy and paste text), format (e.g., change spacing and capitalization, bold, italicize and underline text), print and save  (http://www.compusmart.ab.ca/alummis/beginnerword/index.htm  Retrieved Oct 2, 2006).  Word processors can be quite complicated and provide the user with very advanced functions (as noted above), but the following discussions will begin by focusing on the basics for the benefit of all users.

Windows Vista has speech recognition with Microsoft Word. The Speech Recognition allows you to issue commands to your computer with your voice. You can launch programs, switch between open programs, close a window, etc with a microphone connected to the computer. With Microsoft Word, you can dictate text, edit and format the text. Once it is set up, there a many possibilities for commands you can use like waking a “sleeping” system, selecting or correcting words in a document or even requesting for a list of possible commands to use.
[[File:Microphone gooseneck.jpg|75px |thumb|Computer Microphone]]
You do need to train the Speech Recognition feature to learn your voice accurately through an interactive tutorial before you begin using it, it is highly suggested to use a good quality microphone so the computer can hear you better which will reduce errors.  The dictation mode allows you to easily speak what’s on your mind and have Microsoft Word do all the work for you, dramatically reducing the use of your keyboard and mouse, it will also allow you to navigate between screens and applications with ease.  The Speech Recognition feature is not very useful though for those who often work with text that is not grammatical, such as computer programmers, accountants, and computer administrators.(http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb530325.aspx)

Microsoft Word 2007 attempts to change the de facto word (and office) document file format, but the Open Document is used across more word processors and is gaining in popularity faster.

Microsoft's newest update to the application is Word 2010 which was released in June of 2010.  The application included a release of a free online version that works on an applet on most browsers that could be accessed through Microsoft’s online email client, Live or Hotmail.  The new version also replaced what once was Microsoft Works with Office Starter 2010 offering a more basic word processor in the suite which comes pre-installed on most computers.[[File:Office2007floppy.PNG|thumb|Office2007Orb]] The new version of Word most noticeable change could have been the look of the &quot;Orb&quot; which was the icon for the File option which is now a tab icon with the word File on it. Along with these changes and other the application does offer more features for common to power users. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2010 Wikipedia Office 2010])


'''Basics of &quot;building&quot; a Document: Creating'''

When you enter text onto a new word document by a use of a keyboard you are not only inputting data into the computer but you are also forcing the computer to begin word processing in a new document (William.B &amp; Sawyer.S, 2007.  Using Information Technology. The McGraw-Hill Publishing Inc: New York).  Three functions of word processing assist you with this process of what we call creating or starting a new document.  The most integral function is the cursor.  This small arrow or vertical line that appears on the screen allows you to see where you are located in the document.  It allows you to navigate through the document so that you do not loose your place.  

On the left side of your document you will also find a scrolling device that allows you to quickly move back and forth through the document from beginning to end.  This device allows you to preview the beginning and end of the document while saving a vast amount of time (William.B &amp; Sawyer.S, 2007.  Using Information Technology.

'''Correcting-Editing'''

Editing is the process of making changes or modifications to an existing document.  In word processors there are many features that can assist you with editing your document.  Word processing allows people to spend less time with editing and formatting which in turn allows them to put more time into the piece they are writing (http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/word/HA101650321033.aspx, Retrieved December 5, 2006).  Information technology has greatly improved the process of human editing but also has allowed us to become “editing inept” as we the computer just does it for us with the touch of a button.  Essentially an English professor may say we have become lazy in our approach to English.

Part of the reason we have become lazy is due to the fact that word processing has made it so easy for us to edit.  Instead of whiteout or erasing if we make a mistake we can use the insert &amp; delete button.  If we feel we want to make additions to the document we can use the insert button and start typing wherever we place the cursor.  All other text will shift (William.B &amp; Sawyer.S, 2007.  Using Information Technology. The McGraw-Hill Publishing Inc: New York).  You can also replace text in a document meaning if you have typed one word throughout the whole document but realize you made a mistake you can find all instances of the words and then replace them with the word you meant to have.  This feature saves the average writer an enormous amount of time.  Making a mistake used to be a great annoyance in those handwriting days because it meant using an eraser, whiteout or even starting over however now with the undo command you can undo the last mistake you made just by using a touch of a button or simple command – Control Z on the keyboard. (William.B &amp; Sawyer.S, 2007.  Using Information Technology. The McGraw-Hill Publishing Inc: New York).  

Editing in word processing also allows you to cut and paste which used to be a function only with scissors and glue however you can do this on the computer also with a touch of a button.  Word processing also allows you to copy a word, paragraph or picture and paste to another location or another file.  If you are having trouble thinking of a synonym all you have to do is use the built in thesaurus which is part of Microsoft word.  

The last two elements of word processing that we have become to increasingly rely on in our daily careers, schooling and writing is spelling and grammar check.  The computer will scan your document and pick up any miss-spelled word errors or grammar issues you may have in your writing.  This English technique is and was one that you would spend hours and hours on in your English class learning however now the computer will automatically check and fix for you.  Be careful with the spell check feature as if the word is spelled correctly but in the wrong context it will not pick it up.  These features are good but still need the human eye to totally understand the language.

When it comes to creating a document the easiest package that comes to mind is Microsoft Word. With Microsoft Word you are able to create, edit, spell check, print, and save professional looking documents, calendars, brochures, etc. In addition to creating, editing, spell checking, printing, and saving professional looking documents you can import other applications into Microsoft Word including spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and database directly into Microsoft Word maximizing all the specifications of other applications.
There are similar packages out there that will do basically the same as Microsoft Word. They include Word Perfect, Open Office, and Lotus to name a few.

== Word Processing ==

'''Introduction and Overview'''

Word processing is probably the most common among the &quot;productivity&quot; software applications in use.  The computer was certainly adopted quickly as a replacement for the typewriter when users had increased access to computers and discovered its advantages in document creation, editing, formatting and saving -- that is, its word processing capabilities.  This is especially true when it comes to making changes to previously created documents.  No longer is it necessary to re-type entire pages and/or documents in order to add, delete and make corrections, among other things.  It has become as simple as retrieving the originally typed document from the computer (or storage device), making the necessary changes and either printing it with the &quot;push of a button&quot; (or few keystrokes) or putting the new version back into a file on the computer or on a storage device.  In fact, there should be less chance of errors and typos because of such features as spelling and grammar checking options.

Possibly the greatest advantage in word processing is the &quot;word wrap&quot; feature which eliminates the need for time consuming &quot;carriage returns,&quot; therefore also decreasing the expenditure of energy in the typing process.  In order to do &quot;word processing,&quot; one needs a computer and a program called a &quot;word processor&quot;  (http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/word_processing.html  Retrieved Oct 2, 2006).

Computers are generally sold with factory installed word processing software, but often this software is not the product or version desired by the customer.  For example, the functionality of the software (e.g., Notepad) is more limited compared to the likes of Microsoft Word.  As a result, purchasers tend to purchase, install and upgrade to a more common and familiar word processor.

In the early 1980s, word processing software such as DW3 (DisplayWriter) was command based and, as a result, more dependent upon &quot;function&quot; keys for implementing commands.  Since the 1990s, users are not required to remember specific functions because the programs tend to be more 'user friendly' in terms of providing icons and drop-down menu options for the user's convenience.  Although it may take one some time to find the appropriate command, a user can search and/or browse -- even request &quot;help&quot; from the program itself --  to find what they wish to accomplish in their document.

Perhaps the most common and familiar to computer users are such word processing software as Microsoft Word and WordPerfect.  In fact, word processing has advanced to the point of being within a &quot;suite&quot; of productivity software applications and, as a result, can utilize the interconnectivity of the programs in this &quot;suite&quot; to produce advanced word document presentations with such features as 'linked' tables, maps and websites.  

For more technical documents, there's an option to utilize a feature called &quot;Cite While You Write&quot; which inserts commands into the menu (i.e., 'Tools') of the word processing program (e.g., Microsoft Word) to give the user direct access to references and enables the bibliographic software (e.g., EndNote or ProCite) to conduct bibliographic formatting during the writing stage in the open document  (Thomson ISI ResearchSoft, 2003, &quot;EndNote 7 ... Bibliographies &amp; More Made Easy,&quot; p. 38; ISI ResearchSoft, 2000, &quot;ProCite,&quot; pp. 63-64).

Today, rather than purchasing word processing software, there is the option to use Free Software (e.g., AbiWord).  Many word processors can open and save Microsoft Word Document files [and] .... suitable for a wide variety of word processing tasks [and] ... available for a number of languages and operating systems&quot; (http://www.abisource.com/  Retrieved Oct 3, 2006).. Another option is to make use of  web based word processors (e.g., Writely).  One can &quot;share documents instantly &amp; collaborate [in] real-time ... edit your documents from anywhere ... store your documents securely online ... [and is] easy to use ... [because it provides] a familiar, desktop feel&quot; (https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=writely&amp;passive=true&amp;continue=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.writely.com%2F&amp;ltmpl=homepage&amp;nui=0  Retrieved Oct 2, 2006). 

While there are many word processors available, each and everyone has the ability to perform the basics.  That is, word processors enable the user to create or type a document, edit (make additions and corrections, as well as check spelling and grammar, move, copy and paste text), format (e.g., change spacing and capitalization, bold, italicize and underline text), print and save  (http://www.compusmart.ab.ca/alummis/beginnerword/index.htm  Retrieved Oct 2, 2006).  Word processors can be quite complicated and provide the user with very advanced functions (as noted above), but the following discussions will begin by focusing on the basics for the benefit of all users.

Microsoft Word 2007 attempts to change the de facto word (and office) document file format, but the Open Document is used across more word processors and is gaining in popularity faster.

'''Basics of &quot;building&quot; a Document: Creating'''

When you enter text onto a new word document by a use of a keyboard you are not only inputting data into the computer but you are also forcing the computer to begin word processing in a new document (William.B &amp; Sawyer.S, 2007.  Using Information Technology. The McGraw-Hill Publishing Inc: New York).  Three functions of word processing assist you with this process of what we call creating or starting a new document.  The most integral function is the cursor.  This small arrow or vertical line that appears on the screen allows you to see where you are located in the document.  It allows you to navigate through the document so that you do not loose your place.  

On the left side of your document you will also find a scrolling device that allows you to quickly move back and forth through the document from beginning to end.  This device allows you to preview the beginning and end of the document while saving a vast amount of time (William.B &amp; Sawyer.S, 2007.  Using Information Technology. The McGraw-Hill Publishing Inc: New York).


'''Correcting-Editing'''

Editing is the process of making changes or modifications to an existing document.  In word processors there are many features that can assist you with editing your document.  Word processing allows people to spend less time with editing and formatting which in turn allows them to put more time into the piece they are writing (http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/word/HA101650321033.aspx, Retrieved December 5, 2006).

Be careful with the spell check feature as if the word is spelled correctly but in the wrong context it will not pick it up.  These features are good but still need the human eye to totally understand the language.

'''Creating a document'''

In order to create a document, you first open word and save the document under a relevant name.  Proceed to input you data, you can include clip art, graphics, color, bold, etc.  Microsoft word automatically saves your work as you go but it is always suggested that you save and sav e often so in the event of a hard drive crash, power failure your work is not lost.
You can always edit, format, etc your document.  You can delete and start over. Using the tabs at the bottom you can add other pages to your document. In word you can add tables, columns, draw, add audio and/or video, etc.


==== Useful Information when using Office 2007 ====
'''Using Access Keys'''. You can move about the ribbon using access keys. To do this simply press the ALT key then a letter will appear on the ribbon press the letter you want and that section will open. This way you can move about the screen without ever leaving the keyboard. You do not have to memorize the commands because they will always appear on the screen. 
'''Key Combination'''.  Can also be helpful however these you have to memorize because in Office 2007 there not on the screen like access keys are. Key combination usually start with start with the Ctrl key, and the combination has to be enter at the same time to start a command some poplar are key combinations are ctrl-s for saving, ctrl-c for coping ctrl-v to paste what you have copied and ctrl-p to print your document.

==Formatting Documents with the help of templates &amp; wizards ==

Two very useful tools in Microsoft Word are Templates and Wizards. There are numerous pre-made Templates you have access to in Microsoft Word; ranging from certain types of business and personal Templates. There is also an option to create your own personalized Template. The purpose of these Templates is to save you time when creating specific documents you may use with the same outlines just different body information. Template can contain formatting, styles, headers, footers, and graphics. The Wizard is a tool that can save a lot of time formatting, printing, and mail merging. In Microsoft Office 2010 both of these tools can be accessed through the File tab.

The use of templates in word processing has become very popular.  Templates are extremely helpful whether you are working in a Fortune 500 company or own your own small business.  The templates that are available are wide spread and include fax cover sheets, resumes, calendars, business cards  and memos to name just a few.   I think that the resume templates are most helpful whether you are a recent college graduate or if you are returning to work.  The templates give you many different options to choose from, but also give you the ability to customize them to make them your own.

==Database management system==


The Database management system (DBMS)is a collection of interrelated data together with a set of programs to access the data, also called database system, or simply database.
A major purpose of a database system is to provide users with an abstract view of the data.That is, the system hides certain details of how the data are stored and maintained. Thereby, data can be stored in complex data structures that permit efficient retrieval, yet users see a simplified and easy-to-use view of the data. The lowest level of abstraction, the physical level, describes how the data are actually stored and details the data structures. The next-higher level of abstraction, the logical level, describes what data are stored, and what relationships exist among those data. The highest level of abstraction, the view level, describes parts of the database that are relevant to each user; application programs used to access a database form part of the view level.

==What Is a Database?==
It is a collection of related data kept on a computer and organized well enough to be easily retrievable. The data is organized into ''fields, records,'' and ''files''. A ''field/column'' is a single type of data that is to be stored in a database, like a last name or telephone number. A ''record/row'' is a group of related fields, like the name, address, and major of Phyllis Hoffman. A ''table'' is a collection of related rows, like all student address data.

[[File:Kexi Win2000 Addressbook - Tables Countries (edit).png|120px|thumb|A Database]]

Database
 
The above is an example of a database.  A database can contain various columns and rows that consist of data needed to perform a task.  The task can be mailing, labels, email blast, etc.    Some terms used in composing a database are the following:
Tables – rows and columns
Record – row
Field - column
{{clear}}

[[File:Electric_charge_symbol_negative.svg‎|50px|thumb|Negative DBMS]] A database is a collection of related data that is stored and organized in a manner that enables information to be retrieved as needed. There are advantages and disadvantages for DBMS, database management system, which is used to create, maintain, and access a database. The biggest disadvantage is increased vulnerability because the data can be highly integrated. A nice advantage is that the database usually has a faster response time.[[File:Electric_charge_symbol_positive.svg‎|50px|thumb|Positive DBMS]] 
{{clear}}

A database is a collection of data that is stored and can then be accessed by the designer, developer, administrator or the user.  The designer is the person who would work with the analysts and others who are involved in the SDLC.  This group would determine what type of data is going to be collected and what output is desired.  The database developers will actually create the database based on the information from the designers.  The developers also get the database ready for data entry.  The database administrators are responsible for managing, maintaining, determine monitoring user access and the security of the database.  Then eventually the users are responsible for entering the data.
“Understanding Computers, Today and Tomorrow, Edition 13, Deborah Morley and Charles Parker, Page 552&quot;

==Evolution of Databases==
[[File:Flat File Model.jpg|thumb|Example of the Flat File Model]]
Databases have evolved greatly since the 1960s. As our reliance on information systems have increased, so has the evolution of databases. Examples of our reliance includes the need to store and retrieve complex data such as multimedia objects. The biggest advances in databases can be expressed in terms of their organization of data. The organization of data has evolved from a collection of flat files with tree levels with a high level of data redundancy to a collection of tables and objects that support multimedia objects with a minimum data redundancy.

==Creating a Database==
First a files needs to be created, then the objects that the database is going to contain. Every time the Access is launched it gives the user the option of creating a new and blank database file/template or opening an already existing one. These will open in ''Datasheet view'', which shows a table with rows and columns.

One of the easiest ways to create databases is to use Microsoft Access. When the program opens you are in a blank database. In the bottom right corner type the name of your database. After that you are shown in Datasheet View with a blank Database with just the Field ID as the Primary Key.  A primary key is a field in a table that is used to relate that table to other tables.  A primary key must uniquely identify each record in that table, which means that no two records within a table can have the same value in the primary key field.  When selecting a primary key, it is important to pick a field that contains unique data that isn’t likely to change.  
To change the Primary Key text you double click in the field and type what you desire as the Primary Key. To add fields to the database you right click on the tab that says click to add fields. Then choose one of the field types: Text, Number, Currency, Date &amp; Time, Yes/No, Lookup &amp; Relationship, Rich Text, Memo, Attachments, Hyperlinks, Calculated Field, and Paste as Fields. Once you have chosen what you want to add to the Database you can type that form of data within the cell. To add lines to your database just press the Enter Key. Once you are done with your database you can add all the same formatting that you are used to in any other application within Microsoft.  Some of them include Font Color, Background, Table Styles, Conditional Formatting, and Table Formatting. Every time you open the database it automatically updates your information stored within the database.

'''Shortcuts in Access'''

Sometimes creating databases can be long and strenuous and even creating multiple databases at one time. That is why Microsoft has included shortcuts in Access to make databases faster and easier to create. There is an extended list of shortcuts posted on the shortcutworld.com web page. Some of these shortcuts can be used in all versions of Access but the majority of the listed shortcuts only pertains to Access 2010. Shortcutworld.com divided all the shortcuts into five different groups with many subgroups. The groups are: Manage Databases, Manage Access Features, Working with Text and Data, Working with Access Views, and The Rest.
 
==Marketing Database and Government Database==

[[File:Kexi Win2000 Addressbook - Contacts.png|100px|thumb|Add Description of Kexi, Addressbook]]

Marketing Database contain Marketing and demographic data about people, such as where they live and what products they buy. This type of information is used for marketing purposes, such as sending advertisements flyers by mail or email that fit each individual’s interests or trying to sign people up over the phone for some type of service. For example, when you subscribe a magazine, fill out a sweepstakes entry or any product registration card, or buy any product or service using a credit card, there is a good chance that the information will find its way into a marketing database. Marketing database is also used with Web activities such as social network activity and searches performed via Facebook, MySpace, Twitter etc data can be tracked and used for marketing purposes. Google also collect enormous amounts of data about individuals, worries many privacy advocates. Google may have data stored about your search history via search site, browsing history such as Google Chrome, e-mail – Gmail account, appointments such as Google calendar, telephone messages – Google voice, photos – Picasa Web Albums, reading history – Google books, and media history, and Google health.


Governments provide a few different types of databases depending on the laws that govern the country. Some of the usual databases one might find are property value search databases, vital records search databases, and address number and phone number search databases. For example, if you're listed in the U.S. telephone book, someone can look for you using either your name or telephone number.  These particular databases rely heavily on the law because they wouldn't exist at all if they weren't allowed. It is important to know your local and federal laws regarding databases so you know what is allowed and what is not allowed in your area. .&lt;ref&gt;  Understanding Computers 13th Edition- page 608 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;references/&gt;
[[File:Oracle Databases.jpg|thumb|Oracle Database Buildings]]




Information about individuals is also available in Government databases. Some information such as Social Security earnings, income tax returns, is confidential and can legally be seen only by authorized individuals. Other information – such as birth records, marriage certificates, and divorce information, as well as property purchases, assessments, liens, tax values – is available to the public, as well as to marketing companies that specialize in creating marketing databases. Other government databases application is the creation of national ID system that link’s driver’s license databases, I-Pass ID is also linked to the State government databases. There is a big advantage of these online databases and one of them is checking the background of a potential employee or looking up a misplaced phone number etc.  And also to keep an eye on hackers who is stealing all these information from these databases. In short, both these databases are useful and helpful to all these organizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Presentation software ====
Some ways to create a slideshow within Windows or Mac to create a presentation include Microsoft Power Point, Adobe Photoshop, or Corel Draw to produce professional presentations. Once you open any of these applications you have to create a slide on the screen to convey each portion of what you desire to present. Once you have created your text of a maximum of eight lines or less per slide you have to choose the options within the application to attract the viewer to what you are presenting. Some of these options include the Font Size, Color, Bullets, Shapes, 3D Appearance, and other features to maximize your presentation that you can place anywhere within the slides. Once you are finished creating the presentation you have to Rotate, Pivot, and use several Transitions to make your final project run smoothly.

===== Power Point =====
Microsoft PowerPoint 
Is a very easy to use presentations software designed and made for Microsoft windows and Mac OS operating systems. Power point is most commonly used by business people and students to create phenomenal presentations and projects. It can easily be used by Junior high student all the way up to senior's, with intermediate options to technically challenging options. Apparently the Microsoft corporation believes that thirty million presentations are made each day with the power point program. 

There are many different options and abilities to use when working with PowerPoint, text, graphics, animation, movies and other objects are all possibilities within the program itself. It offers challenging components as well as easy to do elements that allows all levels off people to use it.

'''Presentation Graphics Concepts'''         [[File:Consumo de agua.jpg|100px|thumb|Presentation Concepts]]

The saying “a picture is worth a thousand words” is the cornerstone of Presentation Graphics. The basic concepts and features of presentation graphics is an image designed to enhance a presentation such as an electronic slide show or a printed report.  A variety of software including spreadsheet programs, image editing programs, and presentation graphics software can be used to create presentation graphics. It takes the form of electronic slide containing images, text, video and more that are displayed one after other in an electronic slide show. Electronic slide shows are created with presentation graphics software and can be run on individual computers or presented to a large group of people in a conference room on a big computer projector; they are frequently used for business, Educational presentations. Today's most common presentation graphics programs are Microsoft PowerPoint, Corel Presentations, and Apple Keynote. 

[[File:Harveyballs.v2.svg|left|100px|thumb|Add HarveyBalls slide]]

Creating a Presentation - A Presentation graphics program contains a variety of tools for creating and editing slides. For example, new slide can be added to a new or existing presentation. Charts can be added or edited in a new or existing presentation slide. Text, photographs, tables, shapes, charts and more can be added to slides using the Insert tab and formatted as needed using the Format tab. To create more exciting and dynamic presentation, multimedia objects and animation effects can be used. Video and audio clips can be inserted into a slide and set up to play automatically each time the slide containing those elements is displayed. 
Once the basic slides in a presentation have been created, the overall appearance of the entire slide show can be changed by applying a theme such as combination of colors, fonts, and effects that can be applied to an entire slide show at one time to the presentation using the Design tab. Transitions-special effects used between slides can be applied to specific slides. In PowerPoint, animation and transition are both specified using the Animation tab.

==== Helpful Rules When Creating a PowerPoint Presentation ====
 
Power Point presentations should be developed around 2-3 messages.  The messages should summarize what you want the audience to remember.  A rule that is good to remember when creating a Power Point presentation is KISS:  keep it short and simple.
The slides should show key points, one idea per slide.  For a presentation, it is good to remember 1 slide per minute.  When using technical terms in a presentation, it is a good idea to give an explanation of the technical terms.  This will help the audience to have a better understanding of the presentation.  [[File:slideshow.jpg|thumb|PowerPoint]]
On the slides use short phrases, but make sure to capture the important points.  The only exception to this is when quoting something, and it can be cited in its entirety.  A good rule to follow when preparing a Power Point presentation is the “6X6” rule.  The rule is to use 6 words per line and 6 lines per slide, not including the title.  Fonts should be large enough for the audience to see, font size 32-44 for titles and no smaller than 28 point for text or bullet items.  Presentations should have a consistent look throughout each slide.  So, it’s important to use the same font, size, color and capitalization format.  Short, strong statements should be used, and the bullet point should open with a noun or verb in active voice.  The same structure should be used for each slide.

===== Flash =====
Macromedia Flash can take the power of presentations to the next level. With the addition of movies, sounds, animations and more integrative options a flash presentations can be more advanced and powerful then a PowerPoint presentation, since Flash is not specific a platform for creating presentations. Though flash presentations are hard to make then PowerPoint presentations..flash really allows more freedom to everything to an artistic presentation. A company by the name of Impact Engine designs custom flash presentations for companies. www.presentationengine.com.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &quot;How dangerous is it?&quot; ==

Is this a predefined template, or can we do away with this? I don't see how relevant this question is in regards to an automotive engine. An automotive engine is *not* dangerous, so I will edit that section. I'll wait and see if I receive any objections.

:It's a pedefined template. In this case, I would just use this question as an opportunity to discuss general safety around cars and engines. In general, the questions should just be used as an opportunity  to discuss a particular aspect of the topic, IMO.

:Engines are hot and have lots of moving parts. So they have to be turned off before you can work on them. Cars can be very dangerous when they are not operated properly and legally and many people die in auto accidents every year. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 12:00, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

'''Organic lawn care''' is a method of establishing and caring for a garden lawn without the use of synthetic chemical inputs such as pesticides, herbicides, or artificial fertilisers. Using organic practices on a lawn is a good way to avoid exposure to potentially harmful chemicals, since among all the elements of the garden, the lawn is the part that humans come in contact with the most often, either through walking or sitting on the lawn, as well as through exposure to pets that have been on the lawn.

Managed organically, the lawn can be more than simply a green carpet and can contribute to the overall biodiversity and richness of the garden ecosystem. Organic lawns can be valuable habitats in their own right, providing a home for a variety of insects, birds and other wildlife. Indeed, by relaxing a little and allowing the grass to grow longer, we will find that the lawn becomes healthier, requires less work and even becomes more visually interesting.

==Choices of grass for the organic lawn==

An important principle of organic lawn care is the choosing of grasses that will suit the location and the type of lawn required, and the uses that will be expected of it. Hard wearing grass mixes can be chosen for lawns used for football and play, whilst shady spots or a fine quality ‘ornamental’ lawn would have different requirements. 

===Cool season grasses===

Cool season grasses are grown in climates with cold winters. They are evergreen, but may go dormant in midsummer.

*'''Bluegrass''' - Fine textured, somewhat less durable than some other cool season grasses.
*'''Ryegrass'''- hard wearing perennial grass that provides a good utility lawn, withstands drought and looks good.
*'''Red fescue'''- both slender and creeping varieties of red fescue grow strongly to provide thick growth which is hard-wearing and reasonably drought tolerant.
*'''Meadow grasses'''- smooth-stalked varieties are used in blends for fine lawns.
*'''Other grasses'''- Chewings fescue, browntop bent and crested dog's tail are just some of the other grasses used in lawn seed mixes.

===Warm season grasses===

Warm season grasses do well in hot climates. They are green throughout the heat of summer, but will go dormant during cold weather.

*'''Zoysia grass'''
*'''Bermuda grass'''
*'''St. Augustine grass'''

==Cutting the grass==

The frequency and height of cut will depend on the use to which the lawn will be put. By varying them the lawn can have either a formal appearance or a more natural look. There are a wide variety of lawnmowers available, and again, these should be chosen to be appropriate to needs and circumstances. For a small lawn a hand push mower with cylinder cutting blades would be sufficient, but for larger areas it might be worthwhile to consider the benefits of power mowers, including mulching mowers. These chop the cut grass into tiny fragments which are then blown down close to the soil surface where they will quickly decompose, recycling nutrients and adding fertility to the turf. Regular mowing should only be required during the growing season between spring and autumn. Frequency will depend upon speed of growth, which will vary according to conditions, but generally speaking a weekly trim will be sufficient in early spring, increasing to twice a week later on, especially on play areas or that are required to be neater. Grass growth decreases again in autumn, and whilst the grass will still grow in winter, it isn’t usually necessary to mow, besides which conditions are often too wet.

Longer grass tends to resist drought better than short grass, and is more able to compete with weed growth. Most lawn areas can be cut to about 3 cm (1.5”), although may be shorter in play areas. Lawn mowings should never be discarded, instead should be either composted, used as a high nitrogen compost activator or used as a mulch around trees, shrubs or vegetables.

The organic gardener can recreate the traditional ‘stripe’ pattern favoured in more formal landscapes simply by using a cylinder mower or one fitted with a rear roller, but these can be a chore to maintain. Instead interest and wildlife friendly habitats can be created by mowing large lawn areas to different heights, leaving some areas to grow long with mown ‘paths’ between them.

Lawn edges can be trimmed with long handled shears, which avoid the need to bend down, and occasionally cut to a clean border edge using a spade or half-moon edge cutter.

==Weeds in The lawn==

Lawns do not have to consist of only grasses, indeed they will be colonised by a variety of other plant species. A tolerant attitude will see this as an asset rather than a problem to be eradicated. For example, allowing clover (''Trifolium'' spp.) to spread will feed the grass with nitrogen. The grass will therefore grow more strongly and will be a deeper green, and will not require artificial nitrogen fertilisers. Yarrow (''Achillea millefolium'') will also grow very well in the lawn, and is a valuable plant in its own right, being rich in minerals and greatly enriching the compost heap. It will also increase the vigour of grass and its resistance to disease. Yarrow also has medicinal properties, and if left uncut will produce beautiful white flowers. Daisies (''Bellis perennis'') will also brighten any lawn, often flowering even into the depths of winter, whilst another attractive lawn flower, the dandelion (''Taraxacum officinale'') has a wealth of uses, all parts are edible and it has medicinal properties. In addition its deep tap root will mine minerals from deep in the subsoil to be made available via the compost heap. Other valuable wild plants that will often make themselves at home in the organic lawn include chicory (''Cichorium intybus''), catsear (''Hypochoeris radicata''), melilot (''Melilotus officinalis''), salad burnet (''Sanguisorba minor''), plantain (''Plantago spp.''), rough hawkbit (''Leontodon hispidus'') and coltsfoot (''Tussilago farfara'').

If however weeds do become a problem, there are organic methods which can be used to control them, including;
*Removal of individual weeds such as dandelions, daisies and plantain by hand, using an old kitchen knife or weed grubbing tool.
*Fill in holes left after removing weeds with soil or potting compost, and sow fresh grass seed into this.
*Avoid mowing too low, short grass offers less competition for weeds and can weaken it, making it easier for weeds to invade.
*Scarify to remove debris and improve conditions for grass growth.
*Ensure good drainage to prevent water-logging which will encourage moisture loving weeds and moss.

Moss can be a problem on some lawns, thriving in moist or waterlogged conditions, but also on drier soils where fertility is poor and acidity high (in particular, under evergreen trees). Moss will colonise in shady areas and spread over soil where the grass is mown too short.  Moss does not withstand foot traffic as well as grasses, and trampled moss can result in bare soil and soil loss.  Moss can be controlled by regular raking in spring and autumn. Bare patches should be re-seeded, and a poor lawn should be fed, for example with seaweed meal. In addition, mower blades should be raised to 2.5 cm (1”), drainage should be improved (see below) and limestone or dolomitic lime added to raise the Soil pH levels.  Moss is valuable to birds as nesting material, so the wildlife conscious organic gardener may opt to leave some areas of mossy lawn for this reason.

==Lawn pests==

Lawn pests can include;
*'''Leatherjackets''' (''Tipula'' and ''Nephrotoma'' spp). These softgreyishh black legless grubs growing up to 5 cm (2”) long are the larvae of thecraneflyy, and can feed upon grass roots, causing growth to become yellow and withered. They can be controlled by watering yellow areas and covering overnight with tarpaulin or sacking. Theleatherjacketss will come to the surface and can be picked off the following morning.
*'''Ants''' (''Lasiuss'' and ''Myrmica'' spp). Ants can cause problems by building nests and mounds in the lawn, causing it to become unsightly and difficult to mow. They are very difficult to control, however pouring cold or boiling water onto troublesome colonies can go some way to reducing numbers.  There are numerous species of ants, however, and many live in lawns without causing problems.
*'''Moles'''. Moles cause damage to the lawn by their tunneling actions, leaving mounds of earth which can make lawn mowing difficult and reducing valuable earthworm populations. Strong smells or the vibrations of electronic molescarerss can deter them, but trapping is the only effective permanent means of control.

==Improving the lawn==

The lawn is made up of millions of individual plants, and as with other parts of the garden, a healthy and fertile soil with a good soil structure is essential to obtaining good results.  Feeding the lawn should not be necessary unless growth is poor, in which case an organic fertilizer such as seaweed meal can be raked in as a top dressing, or else garden compost can be thinly spread over the lawn surface.
An annual top dressing consisting of a mix of 3 parts sharp sand, 1 part loam and 1 part bulky organic material on heavy soils where moss is a problem can be beneficial, as can 2 parts loam to 3 parts bulky organic material on lighter, free-draining sandy lawns.  Over-fertilizing a lawn, however, can actually reduce biodiversity.  Many plants, in particular legumes such as Clover, thrive in nitrogen-poor lawns, and adding nitrogen can eliminate these plants.

Acid soil conditions can cause a build up of fibrous organic matter and debris called thatch, and can also encourage weeds such as sheep’s sorrel. If the pH is below 5.5-6, lime the area to raise it to around 7. Ground limestone ordolomiticc lime evenly sprinkled over the lawn and gently raked in is the appropriate organic treatment. Repeat annually if required until the desired pH is reached. Vigorously raking the lawn in autumn with a lawn rake to remove debris and leaves is known as scarifying. In addition to preventing diseases and removing obstructions to the growing grass, this process will help the lawn to thicken up by encouraging side shoot production.

Aerating the lawn is the process of creating holes in the soil in order to improve drainage and increase air circulation, and can be particularly beneficial on compacted areas. This is best carried out in early autumn when the soil is moist. A special hollow tined aerator can be used, which takes out a core of soil about 10 cm (4”) deep, or else the soil can simply be spiked with a fork on small areas. Most lawns should not need to be aerated more than once every three years or so.

==Alternative lawns==

Lawns are usually established with grasses, but other evergreen species can be used. These include chamomile (''Chamaemelum nobilee''), which releases a sweet, apple like scent when crushed underfoot, and is thus very useful in a sensory landscape, or as a feature in the herb garden. However such a lawn will not tolerate heavy wear. The non flowering clone Treneaguee’ is especially suitable for the establishment of a chamomile lawn as it is naturally low growing. Cotulaa’ has fern like leaves and is more hard-wearing, but will not survive temperatures below &amp;minus;4 °C (25 °F). Another alternative, particularly where space is abundant, might be to establish a wild flower meadow. Simply leave some areas uncut and see what comes up, or else a wild flower meadow can be created by using one of the numerous seed mixes that are available that include a selection of wild flowers and grasses. Wild flowers prefer poorer soils, so should not be fertilized. Mowing is carried out infrequently, preferably on a sunny day after a period of dry weather. Mowings should be left on the ground to dry out, then shaken well in order to release any seed, but should not be left to break down as this will tend to raise fertility levels.

In shady yards, a grassy lawn can be particularly difficult to maintain.  Grasses are best adapted to full sunlight, and in shade tend to be out-competed by a variety of plants, including mosses, Ground ivy, and other plants.  These plants can combine to form a robust ground-cover that can withstand periodic mowing and some foot traffic.  Mowing in such shade lawns needs to be carried out less often, since the plants grow more slowly due to the lack of sunlight.  Care should be taken to not mow the lawn too close to the ground, as shady yards tend to have less dense growth, and removal of too many plants can lead to soil loss.  In the most shaded yards, many people choose to forgo mowed lawns entirely and choose instead to use a ground cover that does not require mowing.

More and more people are creating their own next job by starting their own business. You can start your own business with the purpose of just yourself working for it or you can create a business with the ambition to employ other people.

== Free Agents ==
Our modern economy has been described as a free agent economy. Free agents are people who work for several companies independently not beening hired as an employee by the companies.
A free agent can in many cases work much like an employee of a company but does not have the same rights to benefits etc. as an employee.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You've always dreamed of listening to your music in your car, at home on a boom box, or uploading it on your friend's computer. Well, you can. All you have to do is burn a CD-R or a CD-RW (which are blank CDs that are recordable). So what you're doing is putting your songs onto a disc from your iTunes library. But you could only have around twenty songs on a blank disc (it depends on how much memory is on the disc). Now, to start: you need to have iTunes, of course. Then have your songs ready on your playlist or library. You will see little checks in check-boxes on the left of the songs' names. Check or uncheck the songs that you want or don't want (checked box means that it will be burned onto your blank CD; unchecked means that the song will not be on the blank CD).Then take one of your blank CDs and stick it into the CD drive. An icon will come up on your desktop. A box might pop up that says put a name for the disk; you can do that if you want. Then look up on top of your iTunes, and you will see a closed hole that says &quot;Burn Disk&quot;; press that. The hole will open and a glowing icon will appear. Then continue on: you will know how to do the rest. Once you are done, take your CD out and enjoy!

== More help ==

=== Where to find CD-Rs ===
You can find CD-Rs anywhere, basically. The best place to buy CD-Rs is your local office supply store, like Office Depot or Staples. You can either buy CD-Rs or CD-RWs. The difference is that CD-Rs are just one-time recording. CD-RWs can rewrite many times. I would advise for you to just buy CD-Rs. You can use them for presentations for your company, music, clips and more. If you have a video camera, you can record your video and put it on your computer. You cannot put a video on a CD-R  (technically you can, but you have to burn it as a VCD, which is compatible with most of the newer model DVD players.  VCDs do not hold nearly as much as DVDs, so this is ideal for short video clips.), so you need a DVD-R. Then download your movie on the DVD-R and watch your movie on your DVD player.

== Don't overload a blank CD ==
You only have a certain amount of capacity on your blank CD. You can always check your CD's amount on the blank CD or the blank CD case.

; Student Misconceptions
: The correct scientific explanation

; Plants get most of their food from the soil.  This is why fertilizers are needed.
: Plants are autotrophs, meaning they create their own food from inorganic substances and energy.  The Plant takes inorganic substances and water from the soil, not food.

; The simple conversion of carbon dioxide and water to carbohydrates and oxygen is photosynthesis.
: Photosynthesis is a complex series of reactions in which light energy is utilized to convert inorganic substances into carbohydrates.  The oxygen released is a byproduct.

; Photosynthesis occurs during the day, and at night, plants respire.
: Photosynthesis includes the light reactions and the light-independent reactions.  Both sets of reactions together comprise the suite of reactions that we refer to as &quot;photosynthesis&quot;.  The requirement of light means that plants can only perform the full set of photosynthetic reactions during hours of the day when light is present.  The reactions of respiration have no such dependency on light, but the accessible chemical energy carried in the ATP produced during respiration is needed at all times—day and night—in order to power the living cells that constitute the plant.  Plants therefore must respire every second of their lives; when respiration stops, death begins.

; Plants are green because they do not absorb green light.
: Plants are green because their cells absorb other wavelengths of light more efficiently.  Some green light is still absorbed, notably by accessory pigments rather than chlorophylls a and b.

; Chlorophyll molecules in the light harvesting complexes transfer electrons to reaction centers.
: Light energy is relayed into each of the photosystems.  This energy reaches the chlorophyll a molecules in Photosystem II.  Electrons in the chlorophyll are excited into a higher energy state.  The excited electrons leave the chlorophyll a molecules.  The primary electron acceptor begins the electron transport chain.  Energy lost by electrons is used to move protons into the thylakoid.  Photosystem I electrons replace those that have passed through the electron transport chain in Photosystem II.  Electrons must be replaced in the system for the electron transport chains to continue functioning.

== How can teachers help students to overcome these misconceptions? ==

Photosynthesis is one of the more difficult concepts taught in high school biology.  There are definitely misconceptions that come with such broad and complex topics.  The misconception mentioned above is one held by elementary, middle, and secondary students alike.  Photosynthesis presents a difficult problem for educators since the molecules involved are so small, actually visualizing this process is difficult (Russell, 2004).  The actual results of photosynthesis are also hard to analyze since plants grow at seemingly slow rates.  Textbook diagrams have proved inadequate in addressing this misconception, but a new form of technology is promising.  A group of researchers has developed “Photosynthesis in silico”, a multimedia exploration of photosynthesis and laboratory practices.  The CD-Rom has separate modules for students to explore photosynthetic reactions.  Because of the expense of laboratory equipment, the CD-Rom offers students a means by which to perform photosynthesis activities.  After being tested, it was demonstrated that the use of such forms of multimedia eliminated over 70% of misconceptions.  This tool represents a great way for teachers to educate their students in a cost efficient and highly effective manner.  These interactive diagrams therefore seem imperative for students to understand the photosynthetic pathways.

Misconceptions are formed through five categories: oversimplifications, overgeneralizations, obsolete concepts or terms, misidentifications, and flawed research (Hershey, 2004).  Many pre-service biology teachers are ill prepared to teach botany, and therefore they cannot readily recognize errors in literature and textbooks.  Students’ misconceptions are then reinforced due to ignorance.  Biology teachers must focus on these misconceptions in order to recognize when literature is incorrect (Hershey, 2004).  The only way to overcome these misconceptions is to have teachers prepare more and have a more comprehensive analysis of what they are teaching.

The overall trend for eliminating misconceptions seems to be experiential learning and proper instruction.  While the article by Russell does not outright say it, the CD-Rom is a form by which students can discover photosynthesis and experience it.  The media used enables abstract ideas and concepts to come to life for students.  Rather than imagining the electrons, students can visualize the movement of these particles.  Furthermore, teachers need to understand misconceptions that students may have in order to help students overcome them.  These are simply a few ways in which educators are assisting learners in their hunt for truth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This guide is based on &quot;Debt Diet&quot;,  a series for the &quot;Oprah Winfrey&quot; Show, where Oprah challenged Americans to get out of debt. Oprah teamed up with three of the nations top financial experts to create a step-by-step action plan to show her viewers how to get out of debt. Oprah featured Jean Chatzky, Glinda Bridgforth, and David Bach as her top financial experts.

So, here's a &quot;How To Get Out of Debt&quot; guide based on the show.

{{Yellow Warning|This Guide is based on a show aired in the United States. Therefore, some of the types of debt described and some of the advice given may not be applicable in other countries}}

==Introduction==

Oprah compared American's over-spending habits to their similar over-eating habits. She showed how compulsive over-spenders are much like compulsive over-eaters and how America doesn’t just have a high rate of obesity in our body, but obesity in our debt.

Oprah featured three families that were suffering from their high debt. First, there was the Widlund’s, who had the lowest annual income at over $75,000 and $81,000 in debt. Then there was the Eggleston’s, making about $92,000 a year and with $115,000 in debt. And the Bradley’s topped it off with over $100,000 a year income and $170,000 in debt.

==The Four Steps of the Debt Diet==

===Debt Diet Step 1: How much debt do you really have?===

Calculate how much debt you really have so you can begin paying it down.

Oftentimes many people do not even know how much debt they really have. This is an important step to getting your debt under control.

It's a good idea to run a three-in-one credit report. A three-in-one credit report is a combined credit report from each of the three credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TranUnion). Whether you regularly get monthly statements or not, running this kind of credit report will show you any old debts that you still may owe, along with anything that may be being reported to the bureaus for which you may not be responsible.

What &quot;kind&quot; of debt is just as important as how much...

Knowing your &quot;Point A&quot;, your &quot;current reality&quot; or where you're starting from IS the best place to start. If you were driving to New York, how would you know where to go if you didn't know where you were starting from?

But knowing how much debt you have is only one side of the coin.  The other side of the coin is knowing what kind of debt you have.

Knowing how much of each type of debt you have will make a HUGE difference in understanding which options are available to you, AND how each option will impact you.

''TAKE ACTION!''

Organize your debt into these categories:

*Secured Debt - This includes any debt secured by a title or asset, like a house, car, motorcycle, boat, RV, etc. This may also include dirt bikes, quads, jewelry, or furniture.

*&quot;Qualified&quot; Unsecured Debt - This includes all unsecured debt (debt NOT secured by a title or asset) that may qualify for debt management programs such as credit counseling, debt negotiation / settlement or other debt management programs.  Qualified unsecured debt includes credit cards, personal loans, credit unions, hospital &amp; medical bills, collection accounts, and deficiency balances.  Some examples of unsecured debt that is not qualified for debt management programs are payday loans, cash advances, Military accounts, public utilities, personal loans from family or friends, and student loans.

*Other Unsecured Debt - All unsecured debt &quot;&quot;not included&quot;&quot; above

*Student Loan Debt - Self explanatory.

*Tax Debt - Any debts owed to the IRS or State TAX authority.

Once you know how much of each kind of debt you have, document it and keep it handy. If your situation changes, update your info and keep it current.

===Debt Diet Step 2: Track your spending and find extra money to pay down the debt===

Cut back on daily extras and find savings where you least expect them.

''Track Your Spending:''
This is a multi-part step. The first part is to track your spending. Track each and every penny that you spend, whether it's food, coffee, gum, bills, etc., track it and write it down for review.

This alone can be very powerful. It can show you just how much of your money is eaten up on the little things. This is what one of Oprah Experts refer to as the “Latté Factor®.” Say you buy a latté every day… after all, it's just $5, right? But added to the soda each day, a snack from the vending machine at work, some gum and maybe some candy, too it really starts to add up! Just $10 a day can double the minimum payment on a $10,000 credit card! That’s up to $3,600 a year!

''Trim the Fat:''
The next part to this step is “trimming the fat.” Look at where you are spending your money. It's time to make sacrifices. Try using a budget calculator to find some extra cash to pay down your debts. From cutting back to basic cable or not eating out as much to downsizing your big-screen T.V. and giving up the extra car, cutting back on these extra expenses can really cut back on your total debt!

You probably know how much money you made last month, but do you know how much money you spent? Or do you know how much money you have left to spend this month? If you don't, you're not alone, most people have no idea.

The fact is most of us spend 10% more per month than we make. That comes out to $431 per month based on the average American income. No wonder the average credit card debt is now at $8,500!

So why is it so difficult to track your spending? Today we live in a near &quot;cashless&quot; society. Using debit cards, credit cards, automatic deposits, and wire transfers, we rarely even see our money. It's easier than ever to spend, spend, spend!

Traditionally, many people managed their money by dividing their cash into several paper envelopes. An envelope for food, entertainment, utilities etc. They then spent their money from these envelopes. They always knew how much money they had left to spend, and how long it had to last. So how can we use such a simple, effective system today, when we don't even see most of our money?

''TAKE ACTION!''

• Track every penny that you spend for the next 30 days

• Create a spending plan and stick to it!

===Debt Diet Step 3: Learn to play the credit card game===

Get expert advice about how to lower creditor’s interest rates.

This, again, is a two-part step. The first step is attacking your interest rates. Many people who are deep in debt are suffering from high interest rates. Creditors may raise your interest rates if you are ever late on any payments or simply because you have too much debt.

You will want to contact each of your creditors and lower your interest rates. This is not always easy but if you follow some of these simple secrets, you may find that your results are better than you would expect!

Once you have gotten your interest rates lowered, you will want to re-assess how you use the money you have allotted to pay them off. You can also use the extra money from your budget that you uncovered to pay your cards off quicker.

Know your options.

Making minimum payments is simply not smart. It's purely in the best financial interests of the bank, not you. If you can afford to pay OVER the minimum payment each month, then you can use an accelerated payoff plan (AKA: &quot;roll up&quot; / &quot;roll down&quot;) to avoid paying insane amounts of interest and get out of debt faster.

You can use the Dead on Last Payment method as mentioned by David Bach or a system that pays off the highest interest rate card first, which can save you the most money and getting you debt free faster.

But what other options exist?

*Do you have equity in your home for a debt consolidation loan?
*Did you know that credit counseling could significantly reduce your interest rates and get you debt free faster?
*What about debt settlement? Did you know you could be debt free for lot less than what you owe? ...And completely eliminate interest?
*Is bankruptcy right for you?

These questions are worth looking into. In fact, they could be worth THOUSANDS of dollars to you, if you know your options and make the right choice. They could mean the difference between freeing yourself from debt in 30 years or in 30 months. 
Don't you think it would be wise to get some quality answers and truly know your options?

''TAKE ACTION!''

While learning to play the credit card game and getting expert advice about how to lower creditor’s interest rates is important, we think it's more financially intelligent to take it a step further. There IS more out there and you deserve to know the truth about which options exist for you and how each option would impact you.

REMEMBER: Always beware of anyone offering only one option.
Learn about and consider all of your options before choosing what's best for you.

===Debt Diet Step 4: Stop spending===

Teach yourself to spend less and save more every day.

This step is everlasting and can take a lot of focus and energy. For many people, they must break life-long habits in order to make this work. Creating your budget will help tremendously. At that point, you only have so much per week, or per month, to spend on any given category (groceries, entertainment, cigarettes, etc.). The more to stick to the budget, the more you will begin to get comfortable with it.

While you must control your spending in order to overcome debt, it's good to point out that this step holds a SECRET...

Money is a highly emotionally charged subject. Spending is emotional.

So how do we deal with it?

How do we control our spending?

The secret is that our deep, emotionally driven need to spend money is actually the key to gaining control. Even better, we can harness these same emotional drives that have caused us to spend out of control to awaken our financial genius.

If you want more... but instead of being able to afford it, you go into more debt, well, that's not very financially smart. You will need to STOP SPENDING and discipline your self to create and stick to a spending plan.

But remember what you want!

If you want to spend, that's great! HOW CAN YOU? 

More income is usually the answer. It's critical to control spending. At the same time, it becomes the perfect motivator for you to stick to your budget and find ways to &quot;trim the fat&quot; AND to earn more money ...so you can buy the things you want!

Having a clear, motivating goal and purpose is what you need to stick to any plan, especially a spending plan.

''TAKE ACTION!''

Decide what you really want and why you want it. Get committed! Then sticking to a spending plan will be possible. Along the way, controlling your spending will become freeing, fun and fulfilling.

*Think about what you really want. Define it clearly and specifically. Write it down as your goal.
*Focus on this goal whenever you meet resistance in starting or sticking to your Debt Diet.
*Realize that in order for you to have what you want, you simply must follow the steps of the debt diet.

===Debt Diet Step 5: Create a monthly spending plan===

Creating a budget helps you estimate your monthly expenses and free up money for paying off debt. It is recommended that you divide your budget as follows:

*35% Housing
*15% Debt
*15% Transportation
*25% Expenses
*10% Savings

If you get paid more than once per month you can determine which bills to pay from which paycheck. Check all of your bills and plot their due dates on your calendar. Pay as many bills on time as possible from each paycheck. Some expenses, like groceries or entertainment, can be allocated per pay period. For example, if your monthly plan is $400 and you get paid on the 1st and 15th, you can allocate $200 per check.

''TAKE ACTION!''

*estimate and plot your monthly expenses
*allocate your take-home pay toward specific budget categories
*assign your paychecks to specific monthly expenses

===Debt Diet Step 6: Grow your income===

Once you've started to make significant contributions to paying down your debt, it's time to consider other ways to pay that debt off quicker. One way to do that is to increase your income so you have more money available.

Start out by making hard choices about &quot;big-ticket&quot; items in your life, namely: your house, your car, your children's education. Can you move into a smaller house? Can you find alternate methods of transportation to get to and from work? Can your children go to public school? Making sacrifices in these three categories can help tremendously to free up more money for paying off debt.

You may also have a lot of items sitting around the house that are unnecessary. A boat, and extra car, an old coin collection - any number of these things could be sold, and the proceeds put toward debt reduction.

The obvious way to increase your income is to get paid more. Ask for a raise or, if you're self-employed, raise your rates. You might even consider getting a second job. Even an extra $100 per month can make a significant difference in your ability to pay off debt quickly.

''TAKE ACTION!''

Grow your income by:

*downsizing on your big-ticket items
*selling off some of your assets
*earning more money

===Debt Diet Step 7: Prioritize your debts and increase your credit score===

Secure debts - or those backed by your assets - are your top priority. Student loans and child support, for instance, are debts for which your wages can be garnished if you fail to pay. After you see to your secure debt, the next most important debt categories are services that you need to continue using, such as paying medical bills if you have a chronic illness. After those are taken care, you can then focus on unsecured debt, like your credit cards. Finally, pay back debts to family and friends. Hopefully, they're more understanding than your other creditors.

Your credit score is an important piece of information that can affect how much money you can borrow and what kind of interest rates you'll pay, among other things. In general, these are the factors that affect your credit score:

*35% – How well you pay your bills
*30% – How much credit you have available to you and how much of that credit you're using
*10% – How recently you have opened (or inquired about opening) new accounts
*10% – The percentage of your file that is bankcard debt vs. the percentage of installment debt
*15% – How long you have had the cards

Here are some steps to help improve your credit score:

*pay your debts on time
*pay off as much credit card debt as possible, so that you're not using any more than 20%-30% of your available credit
*stop applying for more credit, unless your shopping for a mortgage or car loan
*it's good to have at least 1 credit card that's over 2 years old, so don't cancel all your old cards

''TAKE ACTION!''

*pay off secured debts first
*understand what your credit score is and what areas of your life it affects
*boost your credit score using the tips above

===Debt Diet Step 8: Understand your spending issues and save===

One of the keys to getting out of debt is to stop creating more debt. Different people shop for different reasons. By understanding your personal motivations for spending money, you can train yourself to spend less.

Reasons for spending:

*Entertainment
*Mood repair
*Habit
*Impulse
*Compulsive behavior

Once you understand your spending issues, you can begin to save. In times of financial crisis, it is good to have a stash of money saved up so you don't have to fall back on credit cards (and go further into debt). Start out by saving 3%-4% of your income, and eventually work your way up to 10%. Put your savings in a safe place, such as a high-yielding money-market account. Once you have accumulated 3-6 months worth of salary, you will have a good emergency cushion to help you through rough times. Everything you save beyond this emergency cushion should be invested in a portfolio that can help you grow your money over time.

''TAKE ACTION!''

*understand why you spend
*modify your spending behaviors
*save money to create an emergency cushion
*invest your savings and build a foundation for future wealth

I, Jason Niesen, wrote this article, as I wrote the article that was submitted to holisticjunction.  I added the article here as well, since there was no information on the newly founded term &quot;debt diet.&quot;  Therefore, wikipedia has full rights to publish this article.  Please replace article just as it was before.  Thank you.

== Spam Magnet ==
I think this page is a 'spam magnet'.  I feel that links to non debt-diet &quot;loan consolidation services&quot; that may be placed on it can be deleted, without particular care being taken to check out whether the link might be offering some basic money advice as well.  I'm acting accordingly.  If other people think otherwise, please leave a note here.  [[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 13:26, 18 October 2010 (UTC)

== Wikibooks ==

Even though the article is GFDLed, I see one MAJOR problem with it. It reads like a how-to guide on following the steps of the Debt Diet. As such, I marked it to be copied to Wikipedia's sister site, [[Wikibooks]], a collection of free, open-content textbooks that you can edit. As Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, it needs to explain what the subject is in a neutural point of view. --[[User:Lbmixpro|LBMixPro]] [[User talk:Lbmixpro|&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lt;Sp&lt;/sup&gt;]][[WP:EA|&lt;font color=&quot;#0c0&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Lbmixpro|&lt;sup&gt;ak|&lt;/sup&gt;]][[WP:CCD|&lt;font color=&quot;#0cc&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Lbmixpro|&lt;sup&gt;n|it!&amp;gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 07:04, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

:If we rewrite this to be more encyclopedic, can we also add this article (the way it is now) to Wikibooks? [[User:Jason sot|Jason sot]] 19:31, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

::Yes. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;|&lt;sub&gt;[[b:User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;books&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 10:55, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
:::Actually, that's the plan. I'll transfer (transwiki as its called) this version to Wikibooks, so that the GFDL permissions and such stay intact. Afterward, I'll create a [[WP:STUB|stub]] breifly explaining the debt diet, which will include a box saying that the guide is at Wikibooks. --[[User:Lbmixpro|LBMixPro]] [[User talk:Lbmixpro|&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lt;Sp&lt;/sup&gt;]][[WP:EA|&lt;font color=&quot;#0c0&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Lbmixpro|&lt;sup&gt;ak|&lt;/sup&gt;]][[WP:CCD|&lt;font color=&quot;#0cc&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Lbmixpro|&lt;sup&gt;n|it!&amp;gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:31, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

*The greek alphabet has 5 vowel SOUNDS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Electoral systems and voting behaviour is the first of three modules required for an AQA accredited AS level in Government and Politics. It introduces the reader to politics, and more specifically voting, by examining different electoral systems, affects of voting, determinants of electoral turnout and the composition of the electorate.

=Electoral Systems=
==Introduction==
The predominant form of political participation in the United Kingdom is voting. It is from elections that governments derive their legitimacy and competitive elections are a defining feature of democracy. This necessitates a great interest in the multitude of methods by which governments are elected. Academics the world over have evaluated and discussed the vices and virtues of different systems, but a universal standard has yet to be achieved. Below the evidence advocating and opposing the various systems will be evaluated in addition to the debate surrounding electoral reform, an increasingly salient issue, following the election in 1997 of a Labour government committed to a referendum on reform of the electoral system.

==First-Past-The-Post==

First-past-the-post (or simple plurality) is the electoral system utilized for General Elections in the United Kingdom.  First-past-the-post is used to elect one candidate in a single member constituency, with the winning candidate requiring only one more vote than their nearest opponent. 

A widely celebrated characteristic of first-past-the-post is its history of creating large single party governments, and as the strength of a government is derived from the size of its majority, capable of strong governing. Furthermore, the strong and easily understood link between the electorate and their representative under first-past-the-post creates a climate in which the electorate can easily hold their representative accountable.  The simplicity of first-past-the-post, requiring the voter to mark only an 'X' to indicate their favoured candidate, is  a feature which allows first-past-the-post to ensure that votes are seldom wrongly cast reducing the extent to which electoral difficulties distort the representativeness of the election.

The results of use of first-past-the-post has generated considerable debate regarding electoral reform due to associated disadvantages. The ability to win an election without majority support has been the cause of much criticism of first-past-the-post by limiting the extent to which the candidate can be said to be representative of the electorate's wishes. In the 2005 General Election approximately 70% of votes cast were 'wasted', with 52% being cast in favour of losing candidates and 18% of votes were excess votes for winning candidates. This leaves 52% of those who voted with a representative they did not vote for, generating significant criticism of the system. As with most systems the employment of first-past-the-post in elections can produce an appreciable bias, in this instance towards larger parties with geographically concentrated support. The all-or-nothing nature of first-past-the-post with only one candidate being elected in each constituency creates a bias towards larger parties. Only candidates who can attain a simple majority in any constituency are elected, meaning that although a party may hold considerable support nation wide, the geographical disparity of their support can rule them out from acquiring a number of seats commensurate with their level of support. An excellent example of this is the Liberal Democrats who, despite obtaining over a fifth of the popular vote,  received only a tenth of the seats in the House of Commons. A further example is the 1992 General Election in which John Major's Conservative Party received the highest number of votes in a UK General Election, but managed only a 30(?) seat majority.[[Image:ComparisonVotesToSeats2005GeneralElection.png|frame]] Figure 1.1 compares the proportion of seats and the proportion of votes from the 2005 General Election and illustrates the disproportional distribution of seats.In addition to these criticisms it has been suggested that first-past-the-post reduces the amount  and quality of electoral participation. Critics claim that the reduced incentive to vote in 'safe seats' reduces the turnout and as a result the legitimacy of the government.(pg106 Developments) The likely hood of tactical voting also increases under first-past-the-post with supporters of opponents in safe seats instead of voting for their preferred candidate voting for another with a greater chance of defeating the incumbent, an action referred to as tactical voting.

==Alternative Vote==
Alternative vote is a majority system, used to elect a representative for a single member constituency, under which the voter is presented with a list of candidates which they then rank in order of preferences. In order to be elected a candidate must receive a majority of votes. The first preferences of the electorate are counted and if one candidate has gained a majority of first preferences they are elected, otherwise, the candidate who received the fewest number of first preferences is eliminated and their votes are redistributed according to the voter's second preference. This continues until a candidate gains a majority and is elected. 

This system tends to be more representative than first-past-the-post with the winning candidate likely, having received a majority, got a mandate from a larger proportion of the electorate than the winner under first-past-the-post, with candidates routinely winning on less than a majority. Additionally, the link between constituency and representative is preserved providing the electorate with an easily identifiable contact by which they can address their grievances, something reduced under systems with multi-member constituencies.  

Utilization of alternative vote can present a significant bias in favour of centre parties who, on the basis of their policies being the least acrimonious, are able to win on 2nd and 3rd preferences.

==Single Transferable Vote==

Single transferable vote is used to elect several representatives in a multi-member constituency under which candidates have to achieve a quote of votes to be elected. Voters are presented with a list of candidates who they rank in order of preference. The first preferences are then counted and if a candidate achieves the quota they are elected and the surplus votes redistributed, if, however, no candidate achieves the quota then the last placed candidate is eliminated and their votes redistributed, this continues until the prerequisite number of candidates have been elected.

&lt;math&gt; {Quota\ =\ }{Number\ of\ votes\ cast}\over {Number\ of\ seats\ in\ the\ constituency\ +1\ }{+1}&lt;/math&gt;

This system, although not as representative as the list system, is significantly more representative than first-past-the-post or the majority systems.

      <comment>/* 2.4L PowerTech I4 */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== 2.4L PowerTech I4 ==

The 2.4L [[w:Chrysler PowerTech engine|PowerTech]] I4 was available from 2002 to 2005.  It was discontinued as a result of sluggish sales. It was only available on Sport, and only available from 2002-2004.

== 3.7L PowerTech V6 ==

[[File:Jeep_Liberty_Gas_Intake_2005.jpg|thumb|right|2005 Jeep Liberty 3.7L PowerTech V6]]

The 3.7L PowerTech V6 has been available in the Liberty from 2002 to present.  It was optional on Sport from 2002-2004, and then standard on all models from 2005-2007. It was standard on Renegade and Limited Edition models from 2002-2004. 

Two different PCMs (Powertrain Control Modules) have been coupled with the PowerTech. The JTEC was the older controller and the NGC is the newer controller.  The JTEC PCM had three connectors on it and used a separate TCM (Transmission Control Module), while the NGC has four because it integrates the TCM.  2006-2007 Libertys use a hybrid bus system in which the PCM, gas TCM, and ABM (ABS and ESP) use the CAN Bus and everything else uses the PCI Bus. The BCM (Body Control Module) then acts as a bridge between the PCI Bus and CAN Bus.

== 2.8L VM Motori I4 ==

The 2.8L [[w:VM Motori|VM Motori]] Turbodiesel was available in the CRD (Common-Rail Diesel) Liberty from 2005 to 2006.  The CRD was eventually discontinued in the US as a result of stricter emissions regulations. The engine is still available overseas.

The CRD (Common-Rail Diesel) engine was available on the Sport and Limited Edition models from 2005-2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Essentialism as the prodominent philosophy in the classroom.




History of Essentialism

Essentialism is an American philosophy of education which started its movement in the early 1930’s.  It was derived as a counter to the “child-centered” approach to teaching.

Essentialism is portrayed as the “traditional” or “Back to Basic” approach to education. (Cooper/Ryan).  Its main goal is to provide student with the essential needs of academic learning and social development.  Essentialism is a conservative philosophy that pertains to the ever-changing social, educational, and technological aspects of American Society.  It stresses the importance of the teacher as the authoritative figure in the classroom and subject matter should be the center of the curriculum.  Also, essentialist express concern that schools should not try to radically change society.  Instead schools should promote the traditional moral values such as:  respect for authority, perseverance, and consideration for others.  Along with the gathering of basic knowledge, students will have the skills to become model citizens.

One of the founding fathers of Essentialism is William C. Bagley (1874-1946).  He was a professor at Teachers’ College of Columbia University, and one of the founding fathers of Kappa Delta P.  He was the leader of the Essentialistic Education.  Society, and author of “Education and Emergent Man” (1934).  He was critical of the progressive educational system of the time, and believed that society had a core of common knowledge that needed to be relayed to students in a disciplined manner.  He stressed that progressive education damaged the intellectual and moral standards of students.  His belief was that a systematic way of teaching could stress the essential knowledge and skill one needs to become a productive citizen within a society.

Beliefs of Essentialism 

To achieve maximum results in education, hard work and effort are required.  Motivation is a crucial key to learning, but if a lack of motivation exist the teacher is responsible for keeping the student(s) focused on the task.  This belief exists, because at an early age students may not know what they need in the future.  Students sometimes have a difficult time deciefiering the goal/meaning of a lesson or curriculum.  Therefore, teachers must help students overcome their desires for a quick-fix, and help guide them to reach future objectives.

Discipline in the classroom is a key tool for only the teacher, but equally important for the student.  Keeping order is a necessity.  A classroom full of distractions does not make for a desirable place to learn.  Teachers must give direction.  The classroom should revolve around the teacher-centered philosophy, because the teacher is far more likely to know what their students will need to know to be a productive member of society.  Therefore, the teacher is responsible for the growth of their students.

Hard work and discipline are the two major beliefs essentialists believe will result in positive results in the classroom, these ideals need to be constantly reinforced by the teacher.  Essentialists perceive their teachers are intellectual and moral role models for their students. 

Essentialism in the Classroom 

In 1924, William C. Bagley co-edited a series of books about the art of teaching.  These books intended use were for those students in professional schools for teachers.  In the first volume, An Introduction to Teaching, Bagley (1924) begins to lay out his beliefs for his soon to be developed philosophy of Essentialism.  He did this by describing the subject areas of instruction that teachers and student should know.  Bagley broke knowledge up into four subject areas: social arts, the liberal studies, practical arts, and applied sciences. Social arts were subjects that dealt with language matter and numbers.  Areas of focus were reading language, spelling, and arithmetic.  Liberal studies are subjects used to widen and deepen the educational experiences.  The core subjects were: geography, history, civics, literature, and the natural sciences.  Practical arts is the area intended on helping students develop skills in which they can us materials to make things.  Common materials would be wood, metals, food, and textiles.  Students will learn these skills to help them with the daily routines of home life and demands of many occupations.  Applied sciences uses obtained knowledge to improve the practical arts.  The subject field would consist of teachings areas like: navigation, agriculture, forestry, and mechanical arts just to name a few.  These four areas are what essentialist believe are the most essential skills and knowledge that needs to be taught to all students.  In essentialist classroom teacher/administrators decide what is most important for their students to learn, and place little emphasis on student interests.  Student’s interest often diverts time and attention from the academic curriculum.  Students will only be promoted from grade level to level by displaying the abilities to master the required material for that grade level.  Essentialist teachers do this by review achievement test scores.  Essentialist believe that test scores serve as the best mean for measuring progress and comparing results.  Through this process students are taught to be culturally and socially literate.  Students achieve this by understanding the working of the people, ideas, events, and institutions that shape their society.  Essentialists want their students to leave school with the concept of basic skills and extensive body of knowledge.  Also, students will develop a disciplined a practical mind, deeming themselves capable of applying their classroom lessons to solve problems in the real world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">   What does it mean for leadership to be ethical?
Lauren Zirkle
ECI 301

As teachers, we are leaders of future leaders and so it is imperative we teach students the skills to attain ethical leadership.  The turn of phrase, “ethical leadership,” can be an ambiguous expression because everyone has their own opinion of what it means to be ethical.  However, it is fairly obvious what is classified as “ethical” in the classroom. Part of being an ethical leader to your students means accepting ones mistakes, being humble, maintaining a close relationship with the students and instilling the importance of integrity and honesty into your students.

Ethical leadership is built on the principle of promoting the best interest of the followers(Franzwa).  Students are always the primary concern in the classroom; that is what teachers need to have as a constant reminder.  There is no room for self-centered people in the classroom.  Everything that occurs in the classroom must be beneficial to the students. It is the role of the instructor to outline the best way for the children to be taught (Benninga). A teacher's first moral obligation is to provide excellent instruction.  Since every child learns differently, teachers need to be cognizant of that at all time.  Some children are artistic; others are gifted in math, others in language.  So what teachers can do is, relate the subject material to all different types of learning styles.  For example, teachers can give students the opportunity to decide what kind of project they want to do.  That way the students are learning and having fun at the same time.  Being empathetic to the students’ learning style is imperative to being a successful teacher.

Children need to learn not only the necessary curricula, but also exactly what ethical behavior entails.  We show leadership not just through our words, but also through our actions.  All eyes are always on you when you are standing in front of a room full of students.  As a new teacher, you will make mistakes.  What to remember is that it can turn into a “teaching moment.”   It is an excellent opportunity to teach the students that all people make mistakes. An ethical leader is someone who is aware of his or her errors and who can admit mistakes (Franzwa).   A lot of teachers just get irritated when a student brings the fault to his or her attention, but what teachers should do is teach the children that making mistakes is a part of life.  Everyone does it and it actually is more beneficial because you already learned what didn’t work.  I think that is very encouraging to hear; something students definitely should heed.  

Being an ethical leader means being humble and being willing to improve at all times. Leaders should learn more about themselves if they want to succeed,” said Joseph L. Badaracco Jr., the John Shad Professor of Business Ethics at Harvard Business School (Shaw). Part of the journey of becoming a teacher is analyzing your strengths and weaknesses.  I find it very difficult to learn from an arrogant person.    That is why I think being humble is one of the most important qualities because children model what they see. Humility is not something you can directly strive for like aiming an arrow at a bull's eye. But, humility is a consequence that is experienced by those who have reached it — or better said those who have discovered it — not experienced as a character trait, but as an insight into the actual (Keers). If one of our goals as educators is to train our children (our students) to be ethical beings, then humbleness should be one of the criteria.  A teacher has to be someone the students admire, trust, and look up to.  This is so important because as a teacher, you need to form a relationship with your students.

I think the type of relationship a teacher has with his or her students should be very special. Leadership ultimately is an interaction or relationship between the leader and the led(Wikipedia). 
I know a lot of teachers think their sole job is to teach the material, asses the children and make sure they do not disrupt the class.  The teacher-student relationship has to have depth in order to reach each student.  I think school needs to be a place where students look forward to coming.  So teachers need to treat the students with respect, but yet still have the control; be friendly with the students, but still be an authoritative figure.  This is the hard part; drawing the line between teacher and friend.  You can be “friendly,” but not “friends” because the definition of a friend is not synonymous to the definition of a teacher.  Something all teachers need to be is accessible to the students.  The students should feel like they can come to you if they have anything they want to talk about.  So many children today come from broken homes and school may be their only escape.  Students should feel safe when they are in your classroom.  As new teachers, you need to take the stand and let the students know you are there if they need to talk. It is more meaningful if a teacher goes up to a student one on one and lets he or she know they can talk to you.  If a teacher takes a real interest in a student who appears distraught, then that could truly make a difference in that child’s life. 

I want school to be enjoyable for the students.  I think it is the teacher’s responsibility to figure out what needs to be done in order for that to be accomplished.  It may mean giving the students time to work in groups occasionally to give them freedom, giving them rewards for jobs well done, or doing more entertaining activities to keep them engaged.  Whatever gets the children interested in school is the key to their future accomplishments.  If a student enjoys coming to school, he or she will try harder and be more willing to go the extra mile to learn the material.  I think once a teacher finds what grabs the students’ attention and keeps them active and interested, then half the job is already accomplished.  

It is our duty as teachers to instill the importance of ethics into our students. Ethics refers to well based standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness, or specific virtues. (Velasquez)
Teaching them right and wrong might be difficult because cheating is something we are bound to encounter. Students need to know that cheating is only hurting themselves.  If a student cheats once and is not caught, he or she is bound to repeat the offense.  We all know what it is like to be tempted with cheating. Teachers need to empathize with the students and explore why that student found it necessary to cheat.  Is it because that student was just lazy?  Or maybe he or she was having a rough time at home and didn’t have time to study.  Or maybe we as teachers didn’t relate the material well enough for the student to comprehend the material.  I think if a teacher catches a students cheating, the most important thing to find out is why.  Punishment is definitely essential, but finding the reason behind it is more important.  Stressing the importance of integrity and honesty will help the student to develop a strong conscience and hopefully prevent any further honor infractions. 

All teachers need to exhibit integrity and strong ethical values at all times.  There will be issues that teachers will face and we need to use each issue as an opportunity to teach our students about ethical behavior.  We need to have close relationships with our students, accept our mistakes, practice humility and, of course, demonstrate what it means to be ethical leaders to our students.  I want to mold my students into intelligent, confident, ethical, future leaders of America.  I know as teachers, we are not able to save every single child from following the wrong crowd, but I still would like to strive to do so.

The Importance of a Teaching Philosophy in Education

John J. Newton

Old Dominion University
 
The Importance of a Teaching Philosophy in Education

A philosophy is a belief or a concept of ideas by an individual or a group of individuals. Philo-sophia is the Greek word that means, “love of Wisdom” (Wikipedia, 2006).  In education, we are to rely on educators to have good principles when educating our children. Why are teaching philosophies important in education? We, as future educators, are expected to teach our students good principles and to convey our purpose as teachers though our philosophies. Because individual philosophies differ, it is hard to know if every school and their educators are teaching with the right philosophies in mind. That difference in beliefs can only be controlled if the school where a given student is learning has a firm set of philosophies and principles at the forefront of their goals for educating our youth. The most important aspect of educational philosophy is unity amongst educators.

We as educators can learn through professors, well documented studies, and trial and error. We can observe our peers, test our knowledge through examination, and begin to build our own philosophies before we step foot into a classroom as a teaching professional. I am told from a former City of Chesapeake teacher that in Virginia, the State and its respective local governments control the operation with regard to curriculum, school funding, and overall decision-making. (S. C. Newton, personal communication, September 22, 2006). Whether I am right or wrong, if a collection of officials has a certain philosophy that differs from what I believe to be right, I may have to adapt to their philosophies as an educator in the interest of consistency throughout the institution. As an example, I read a journal based on the teaching philosophies in the Amish community. Their teaching philosophy is based on God and the fact that no one in the classroom can ask questions with regard to His plan. If I were to move from Iowa [where this example is based] to seek out a teaching position in the public school system in Virginia, I could not hinge my philosophies of teaching on God (Ediger, 2005). Neither the City nor the State would allow it. This only supports that a unified philosophy is of the utmost importance.

Because my area of study is Music Education, I found an article by Estelle R. Jorgensen to be extremely relevant with regard to teaching philosophies. In this article she writes, “In the past, music education grew up within national borders and its work was often nationalistic in emphasis. Now, we face new challenges of thinking beyond these national commitments to a world of music education” (Jorgensen, 2006, p. 16).  Clearly, the emphasis on diversifying music from a cultural standpoint is the purpose of her article. It seems to me that this idea of allowing students who represent many nationalities or cultures to learn the different influences of music from around the world would be widely excepted and seen as a necessary teaching tool in America’s music education programs. I believe that anything related to teaching philosophies by any person or group is likely to be accepted as long as the goal of those said philosophies is to reach children of all nationalities. We must think on a more global scale in this regard.

The aforementioned ideals with regard to a philosophy that reaches individuals that represent a specified group of people versus a philosophy that speaks to multiple nationalities are very different. Wouldn’t the government be more inclined to accept a concept for educating our youth on a global scale versus a much more narrow target area? This idea of reaching many students that can relate to the subject matter as a group would be a better strategy in trying to unify the classroom as opposed to having some of the children feeling left behind because they do not relate to the given curriculum. Again, reaching the masses, no matter where they come from or what they believe, is the most effective way to teach. I believe that basing a teaching philosophy around that principle is essential. 

Finally, teaching philosophies differ among individuals who currently teach or plan to teach. Sometimes, in the interest of the student, one’s individual beliefs or theories have to be set a side to help unify the entire classroom. Why are teaching philosophies important? They are designed to help every student learn. As elementary as that sounds, without a more global way of thinking, our methods of teaching could fail. I’m not certain if everyone is aware of our governments “No Child Left Behind” program (U.S. Department of Education, 2006). Whether they are or are not, leaving a child left behind because of a narrow-minded based philosophy will only cause that child to stumble along the path of education. It is understandable for a student to trip and fall along the way, and I would hope that we have the necessary tools to help him/her get back up and keep going. As my father told me as a youth, “if you never get off the launch pad, you’re already behind.” I believe that a strong teaching philosophy is that launch pad, and with a unified philosophy more children will finish the race for a sound education than not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Role of Standards


“These reforms express my deep belief in our public schools and their mission to build the mind and character of every child, from every background, in every part of America,”(Excutive Summary,1.

President George W. Bush 
January 2001

	According to Robert L. Linn, standards have played a prominent role in education during the past 50 years.  In the 1950s under the influence of James B. Conant, testing was used to select students for higher education and to identify students for gifted programs.  In the 1960s testing was used to measure the effectiveness of Title I and other federal programs.  In the 1970s and early 1980s, state testing to measure basic skills was developed and became a graduation requirement in 34 states.  This minimum competency testing continued into the late 1980s and early 1990s and was overlapped by a movement toward the use of standardized test results for accountability purposes.(Linn,1)  This use of standardized testing is still used in todays schools and has developed even greater emphasis with the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001(NCLB).  The NCLB act is an education reform effort proposed by President George W. Bush and passed into law by congress on January 8, 2002.  Two important areas of the NCLB act that directly effect the role that standards play in todays educational system include increased accountability for states, school districts, and schools and a greater choice for parents and students(particularly about school choice, (executive summary,1).  The role of education standards has become the primary tool for assessing implementation of these key principles of the act.  
	The role of standards is very evident in the assessment of the first principle of the NCLB act of increased accountability for states, school districts, and schools.  According to the executive summary of the NCLB act it is a requirement that states implement an accountability system covering all public schools and students.  These systems require state standards in reading and math and annual testing for students in grades 3-8.  Schools that fail to make yearly progress toward state goals will have to undergo corrective action to help them meet state standards.  The bill prohibits any “national testing” or federally controlled curriculum.  It is the responsibility of the state to design their own test and to make sure their test are aligned to their state curriculum standards.  Federal funding was provided to states to develop their test.  The test results are required to be made public annually.  The test results are divided and reported according to poverty, race, ethnicity, disability, and limited English proficiency.  This process is known as “disaggregation of data” and is used to prevent lumping all students together to hide the achievement gaps within certain groups of students.  States had until the 2005-06 school year to develop and implement their test.  Schools and school districts are now required to show “adequate yearly progress”(A.Y.P.) toward demonstrating with their test scores that they are on course to reach 100 percent proficiency for all groups of students within 12 years.  States decide what the acceptable A.Y.P. is.  Schools that fall behind may be subject to various “ school improvement measures”.  States will also have to compare their test results against an independent benchmark called the National Assessment of Educational Progress(NAEP), which will be given to a small sample of each state’s 4th and 8th grade students.  The purpose of the NAEP is to insure that the state standards are not set to low,(Executive summary, 1).  The role of standards is very important in insuring that states, school districts, and local schools are being held accountable for student performance. 
	According to the executive summary of the NCLB act standards also play a very important role in deciding how Title I funds are spent.  The NCLB act increases the choices available for parents and students.  If a school is identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring students must be given the opportunity to attend a better performing public school.  The district must provide transportation to the school and use at least 5 percent of its Title I funds for this purpose.  Schools that consistently fail to meet state standards for at least 3 of the 4 preceding years must use Title I funds to obtain supplemental services from the public or private sector.  To help maintain that local educational agencies offer productive choices NCLB requires districts to spend 20 percent of their Title I money to provide school choice and supplemental programs to eligible students.  Standards play an important role in determine how Title I money will be spent,(executive summary, 1-2).  The school choice and supplemental program portion of NCLB provides incentives to poor performing schools to improve performance on state standards to prevent losing portions of their budgets.  
	The role that standards have played in education has always been a controversial one.  Despite the 50 year history of standards in education it is still not clear if they are a reliable source of indicating educational quality.  The NCLB act has heightened this debate and has been highly criticized for its dependence on testing standards.  According to K-8 principal and Vice-Chair of the Coalition of Essential Schools, Deborah Meier “the current push for national and state-mandated standards is fundamentally misguided.  It leads inevitably to standardization, which is the antithesis of real education.  It will not help develop young minds, contribute to a robust democratic life, or aid the most vulnerable of our fellow citizens.  By shifting the locus of authority to outside bodies, it undermines the capacity of schools to instruct by example in the qualities of mind that schools in a democracy should be fostering in kids-responsibility for one’s own ideas, tolerance for the ideas of others, and a capacity to negotiate differences.  Standardization instead turns teachers and parents into the local instruments of externally imposed expert judgment.  It thus decreases the chances that young people will grow up in the 
midst of adults who are making hard decisions and exercise mature judgment in the face of disagreements.  And it squeezes out those schools and educators with innovative ideas”(Meier,1).  Proponents of using standards in educational reform argue, however that testing is a necessary way to maintain accountability.  According to President George W. Bush, “how do you know if a child is learning if you don’t test(Marsha,1).”  Regardless of the controversy created by the use of standards in education their role will continue to be an important one for all educators.

Either this section has some factual errors or it is written in an odd manner. I have removed this because I believe it to be misleading and NPOV in its current form.  --[[User:Cspurrier|Cspurrier]] 21:10, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
{{quote|Due Process is not a ceiling to a defendants rights in a criminal process in which a defendant is accused of a crime; it is a floor of guaranteed fairness and all diligence due to protect the interest of an accused or of a defendant.  Due process of law can be established in any original claim of a defendant.  Due process of law, is always fair and unbiased, when a defendant or his attorney is first made aware than any unfair advantage is weighed on the side of Guilt; an objection should be made for the court record, and a Demand for Fact of Law should follow if the court does not or will not recognized an element that is not fairs. DUE PROCESS although ficticously listed as a set of guarantees, is never limited to those guarantees but is denied when any unfair advantage is given the state or plaintiff.  A study of supreme court opinions will validate this addition.  THe above limited processes are fowl and contempt if the defendant does not know that he alone can recognize any unfair element.  This is constitional law and it overrides any legal president and allows all fairness to be given to a defendant.  To deny this is to ask for a dismissal on bias contempt.  When the law officer is on the stand and says he knows  you are guilty; he, usurps the honor of his position to an unfair advantage.  It is impossible to know that you are guilty when you certain are not, untill a verdict is reached.
}}

I concur with below comments.  I find the basic outline of this whole text flawed and of little use to the layman.  I suggest just reading the US Constitution and asking for the Public Defender. 



==Innovative defenses==
I have never heard of any of these defenses being used successful, or even being presented seriously by any lawyer. If you can find a cite for any of them, we can re-add them. These “defenses” work off flawed understandings of US law and using them will only seriously harm your case and probably get you a contempt charge. --[[User:Cspurrier|Cspurrier]] 21:10, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

I have seen one instance in which a defendant's insistance in maintaining this sort of 'defense' over several court appearances despite judicial admonishments eventually resulted in the involuntary psychiatric hospitalization of the defendant.  --[[User:198.144.137.145|198.144.137.145]] 12:05, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

{{quote|Jurisdistion of Subject Matter is a valid defense.  1) Subject Matter is limited to the Prosecutors BIASED Opinion.  Subject matter that lacks important information because a State Welfare Attorney Failed to Prepare for the Trial, and your case record from the Clerks office is tainted or Painted.  If there are not several document filed from your attorney, then he has become incompetant defence and you must request other representation.  Subject matter Jurisdiction is void when the court is   prejudiced against the case already.  When you are not allowed to ask questions of the Judge and he has not really benefited you with a prudent understanding of the Crimes and accsations to you level of understanding then the court is moot until he is able to cause you to understand.  IF he decided to check NOT GUILTY because your 15 minutes are almost up and you do not admit to understanding any crime or accusation as it would apply to your understanding, then ASK him if his act ( the act of checking NOT GUILTY just to get you through the line ) is a JUDICIAL DICISION.  If it is then you are not guilty and you are free to go.  If he reponds not, tell him you are not willing to accept his plea unless he is will to be supeonoed to your trial as a witness to your defence.  He cannot Constitutionally enter a plea without your admission that you understand all the charges.  If there is no attorney with you, ask him to dismiss your charges on the account that you have rights to counsel; but your counsel has not prepared you for any step of the legal process.

Jurisdiction of COURT?  There are 3 courts that try cases in the United States.  The Criminal Court, The Civil Court, and the Courts of Admiralty Marinetime Law.  In order to know how to defend you self, you must ask which jurisdiction does this court have.  If he says crimal court, ask him why is the Admiralty Marinetime Flag in his courtroom.  Look, it is the almost US FLAG, but has gold trim around it. HE may threaten to charge to with contempt; the prosecutor may object; you camly say that you object to the Prosecutors Attempt to Deprive you of the rights to the Courts of the United States. &quot;I must know which laws to use to defend myself.&quot;  Please answer, Is this civil and criminal, statutory, or Military.&quot;

Ask for a continuance so that you may have the benefit of counsel that is more highly trained and may now if you have committed a Statory Offense or A Common Law Crime.  Start Studying and know your rights and Mail a Motion to the Court to Drop all Charges or move your courtcase to a Jurisdiction of Marinetime Law.  Remind them then that you must be appointed an attorney who practices Criminal Defense In the Washington DC area.  

Conflict of Interest and Bias Possibility?  Ask if the Prosecutor is Paid by the State who is charging you, even a Resident of the Same State; of which your are the People.  Ask if the Judge is Paid by the State, and if the Appointed Attorney is paid by the State.  Ask if the Jury is paid by the state; object to proceeding any further if a public audience is not in the court; you have the right to a public trial; demand one, or at least have it televised.

Chapter 9 Section 4

What Role does Flexible Scheduling Play?

First of all you must know what Flexible Scheduling is and it is a way to make better use of time, space, and staff.  There are many different types of flexible scheduling and the three most ordinarily used are block scheduling, rotating scheduling, and dropped scheduling.  Block scheduling is taking half your classes in the first half of the school year and the other half of your classes in the rest of the school year, and with block scheduling you would spend about an hour and a half in each class.  Rotating scheduling is when the times of each class change each day for example you may have history at 10:00am on Monday, and at 11:00am on Tuesday.  Dropped scheduling is where students are scheduled more classes than there are class periods which allows more time for study sessions, clubs, and/or assembles.  Most schools started out with traditional scheduling, but lately more and more are switching to more flexible scheduling.  

Flexible scheduling is preferred over traditional because it allows teachers more time to teach their classes.  Martha Phibbs a former guidance counselor and French teacher at Smithfield High School says, “I prefer block scheduling over traditional as a teacher and as a mother.”  She taught with traditional scheduling at first but switched to block and even though she did not know whether it would work she still wanted a change for she did not have that much time to spend with her family at home.  “A 2002 report by the Families and Work Institute found that 45 percent of employees say that work and family responsibilities interfere with each other, and 67 percent of working parents say they do not have enough time with their children.”  “84 percent of American voters agreed that children are shortchanged when their parents have to work long hours.”  Wrote by Karen Kornbluh of Washington Monthly and that is all employees not just teachers but at least teachers found a way to fix the problem.  Flexible scheduling gives teachers twice the amount of time to teach the kids and in Martha Phibbs’ class she noticed an improvement because of the extra time for the children to understand the material and now teachers have the time to where if they want to do an activity they can.  Flexible scheduling allows teachers to do less lecturing, which is extremely boring to most kids, and more hands on activities which many kids learn better from because they do the work themselves.  Kids get more of a chance to advance in school because of flexible scheduling, because they can enjoy it more because with block scheduling they have more time for an elective which most kids enjoy.  Flexible scheduling also relieves much stress from teachers such as: less students everyday, less routine in everyday classes, more in depth lessons and teachers have more time to be creative with their lessons.  “In a survey of nominated exemplary middle schools 75 percent of the respondents indicated that flexible scheduling was moderate to well developed at their schools.” This quote is from the National Middle School Association which is all for flexible scheduling because of the increase in student participation and overall grade point averages.  
Although flexible scheduling is better in many ways it is more difficult as well.  Not all teachers like more flexible schedules because not everyone likes change some enjoy routine because it is simple.  Both teachers and students are now responsible for understanding the schedule, and for some teachers they may enjoy a routine everyday but with a flexible schedule they will need to be more creative to use the extra time they a re given with their students.  Some schools actually allow their teachers to make the schedules for their own classes which would mean much more work and responsibility for that teacher.  On the other hand, though these teachers have the power to change the schedule in any way they need to accommodate any school assemble or fieldtrip that may interfere with their classes.  The reason that all teachers are here is to teach the students and to do that, you must first get their attention.  To get the attention of the students nowadays teachers must be very creative, and with a flexible schedule teachers now have more time to come up with creative ideas and more time in class to implement them.  Flexible schedules are great for most but some grades are just too young.  Children in kindergarten, primary schools, and even intermediate schools are a little too young to be subject to flexible scheduling because all they know is staying in one class all day and to put the responsibility of going to multiple classes each day is just too much for them to handle.  So flexible scheduling is not for everyone but for middle school and high school and college flexible scheduling is needed.  

So what role does flexible scheduling play?  Flexible scheduling plays a big role in middle schools, high schools, and colleges or universities.  Flexible scheduling gives benefits to both teachers and students.  Teachers have more time to be creative with their lessons and more time to really explore the subject of the day with the students because with flexible scheduling the class periods are twice as long.  Teachers can spend more time at home with their family because they have more time in school during planning sessions to set up lesson plans and grade papers.  Students benefit by being introduced to the subject of each class for a longer period of time and hopefully in a more entertaining way and when the lesson is entertaining the students listen more intently and understand more and do better on standards of learning tests.  Students also have more time to spend at home with the family because with flexible scheduling they do not take as many classes a day as traditional scheduling which is six to eight classes.  With flexible scheduling they only take about four a day and so they have less homework to do at home.  So flexible scheduling is beneficial to almost everyone, teachers, students, and parents, and that is why more and more schools are adopting flexible scheduling in some way.

      <comment>/* TCP/IP */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==TCP/IP ==

TCP/IP(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is built into the UNIX operating system. It is used by the Internet, making it the de facto standard for transmitting data over networks.

===TCP===
TCP - ensures the verification of the correct delivery of data from client to server. Data can be lost in the intermediate network. TCP adds support to detect errors or lost data and to trigger retransmission until the data is correctly and completely received.

TCP is typically used by application software that require guaranteed delivery. It is a sliding window protocol that provides handling for both timeouts and retransmissions.

TCP creates a complete duplex virtual connection between 2 endpoints. Each endpoint is defined by an IP address and a TCP port number and is implemented as a finite state machine.

The byte stream is transferred in segments. The window size determines the number of bytes of data that can be sent before an verification from the receiver is necessary.

===IP===
IP - is responsible for transferring packet of data from one node to another. IP forwards each packet based on a four byte destination address (the IP number). The Internet authorities assign ranges of numbers to different organizations. The organizations assign groups of their numbers to departments. IP operates on gateway machines that move data from department to organization to region and then around the world.

==HTTP==
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.  Tim Berners-Lee developed the web protocol to act as web addresses. By using the protocol, you can connect to web servers without the server knowing who you are.  The request to the site does not reveal if you have visited the site previously. Therefore, the protocol is basically stateless, unlike [[#FTP|FTP]], which is interactive. 

The only documentation for early versions of the HTTP/1.0 protocol consisted of a discussion draft in HTML form. This documentation is available for historical reasons only, since it has been replaced by the Internet Drafts, Informational RFC, and now Standard track documents, and does not reflect current practice among WWW applications. 
The purpose for the protocol is so you can retrieve information, promptly and with minimal hassle. 

Connection is the establishment of a connection by the client to the server. Request is the act of sending a request message, by the client, to the server. Response is the sending, by the server, of a response to the client. Finally, the closing of the connection by either both parties.

==FTP==

What is FTP:  
FTP stands for &quot;file transfer protocol.&quot; FTP is the Internet's tool for transmitting files between certain computers. Basically it is a way of sending and receiving files over the internet. FTP enables you to gain access to files that are stored on a hard drive on someone else's computer which is connected to the internet.

FTP is just one of many ways to share information and data over the internet. With FTP the main objective is to have individual/direct control over a certain file. You are able to find out where the file comes from and where the file must go. The easiest way to use FTP is to use a program that is specifically designed to use the File Transfer Protocol. 

The 2 different types of files are text and binary, as you could have guessed there is and FTP method for each of these files. The text files consists of letters and numbers that make up text, where as the Binary files are those that are comprised of sounds pics, and programs. You can only transfer these files if they are in the proper format or they will not work.

==TOP LEVEL DOMAIN==

'''The top level domain''' is the part of the URL that specifies what site is part of government, business, education and so on. It's also easy to remember since it's always after the &quot;dot&quot; in the Web address, for example .com, .edu, .info and so on. There is 3 types of top-level domains those are:

- Country code top-level domains : Used by a country. It is two letters long, for example &quot;ca&quot; for Canada. 

- Generic top-level domain : Used for commercial organizations. It is three or more letters long. for example .aero, .coop and .museum, and unsponsored top-level domains such as .biz and .info

- Infrastructure top-level domain: The top-level domain ARPA is the only confirmed one. Root has been known to exist without reason

'''Registration'''

Internet domain names are registered with any of several registrars. To find out if a domain name is taken, one popular domain name registrar is Go Daddy (www.godaddy.com).

==URL==

What is URL?

Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a reference to a resource on the internet (an address). The URL has 4 components:
# Web Protocol
# Domain Name (web server name)
# Directory name or path
# File 

The web protocol (http://) is a convention or standard that controls or enables the connection, communication, and data transfer between two computing endpoints. This web protocol was developed by Tim Berners-Lee and is seen at the beginning of web addresses. 

The domain is a location on the internet (often referred to as web  addresses). Domain names are hostnames that provide more easily memorable names to stand in for numeric IP addresses. They allow for any service to move to a different location in the topology of the Internet (or another internet), which would then have a different IP address.

A directory name is the name on the server for the directory, or folder from which your browser needs to pull the file

A file name is a special kind of string used to uniquely identify a file stored on the file system of a computer.The file is the particular page or document that you are seeking.

==STANDARDS==

In order to ensure that products that are developed can work with other products, a series of networking standards have been developed to address how the device connects to the network as well as how the devices communicate. 
The most widely used standard with wired networks is the Ethernet. 
Some of the wireless standards that currently exist, classified by their range are: short range connecting network elements within a small perimeter (Bluetooth, wireless USB, UWB, WiHD, ZigBee), medium range connecting computers to LAN (Wi-Fi) and long range developed to provide internet access to a large area for fixed and mobile users(WiMax, Cellular standards).</text>

==Languages==
The computer does not read information the same way we do. Instead of understanding the symbols we are used to, computers read numbers and letters using a special code of 1's and 0's. Each letter takes a specific combination of around eight 1's and 0's to make. In order for us to create data on computers, whether it be software or a web-page, we have developed a type of computer language called HTML. HTML, a mix between the computer's language and our own, gives us a way to easily communicate with computers. HTML has made many advancements, from basic HTML to XML, Java, and finally javascript.

'''Low Level Languages'''

Machine language and assembly language are considered low-level languages. They received their names from the fact that programmers using these languages must write instructions at a low level so that the computer can easily and quickly understand them. Machine language consist of 0's and 1's while assemble language works with names and and other symbols. Machine language is instructions are typically in binary form. Assembly language instructions typically use mnemonic operating codes.Assembly language has an advantage has over machine language because it has execution efficiency. Low level languages were developed during the 1st generation of programming languages. These two languages are the earliest programming languages.  

&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Computers Today and Tomorrow 13th edition Morley and Parker&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Fig5-a.jpg|thumb|Fig5-a]]

==Programming Languages History==
The first programming language developed was FORTRAN in November 1954 which progressed to FORTRAN I in October of 1956, FORTRAN II in 1957 and a form of FORTRAN is still used today. There have been several programming languages that were created from scratch. Fortran was the first one, then there was: B-O in 1957 which transformed into the better known COBOL in 1958, LISP arrived in 1958, APL in 1960, Snobol in 1962, JOSS in 1964 which has morphed into M ANSI ISO, Forth in 1968, sh in 1969, Prolog in 1970, ML in 1973 and B in 1981. ([http://www.levenez.com/lang/history.html#03 ref#1]). All other marketed languages can have their history traced back to one or more of these languages at some point in time.

==HTML==
 HTML, or &quot;Hyper Text Markup Language,&quot; is a programming language used most often in the creation of Web Pages. A markup language simply denotes a form of programming in which there is text with extra information relating to that text. With HTML this is accomplished by using tags, which are commands encased in brackets (&lt;&gt;). For example, putting a B in the brackets before the text and a /b in brackets after the text will &lt;B&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; that text. HTML gained wide acceptance in the creation of web pages because it is simple to use and easy to understand.

==XML==
XML or &quot;Extesible Markup Language&quot; is an advancement over HTML. It has had a tremendous impact on the internet, surfing and the transmission of data. It allows two computers to communicate with each other. RSS or Really Simple Syndication allows for applications to update automatically when updated by the webmaster. This incredibly powerful feature has helped the expansion of blogs (web logs) which are frequently used as online diaries and vblogs (video web logs) which are blgs with a video component.

==Java==
Java is a programming language that allows interactive web pages. It is has its language taken from C and C++ but is much more simpler. With Java animation is also relatively easily done.

==Javascript==
Javascript  adds an interactive perspective to regular html pages, this can be things like moving images. Javascript allows the user to interact solely with their browser without the need to consult the server.  Things such as form validation can be completed on the users computer without the need to consult the server saving time and resources.

==Portals==

What is a Web Portal, more commonly called just a Portal? It is a website that offers a broad array of resources such as chatrooms, e-mail, forums, search engines and on-line shopping.  Some common portals are Yahoo, AOL, Lycos and MSN.  These sites offer a variety of links and resources.

In the late 1990s, the Web portal began it's popularity. After the introduction of Web browsers in the mid 1990s, many companies tried to build or obtain a portal, to have a piece of the Internet market.

Commonly these portals are used as homepages - a start page listing several catagories for finding the latest weather, news, sports, entertainment etc...

==Search Engine/Google==

The search engine Google is an American public corporation and was founded in Menlo Park, California on September 7th 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page. The company based in Mountain View, California employs 7,942 people including CEO/Director Eric E. Schmidt.

The name &quot;Google&quot; originated from a misspelling of &quot;googol&quot;, meaning a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros. Google has had a major impact on online but also off it. The verb &quot;google&quot; was recently added to both the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, meaning &quot;to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.&quot;

In competition with Yahoo and MSN, Google is the most popular search engine world wide.

==Search Engine/Yahoo==



So what is [http://www.yahoo.com yahoo]!?

It is a naviagtional guide to the web. A search engine or search service program designed to help find information stored on World Wide Web. The search engine allows one to ask for content meeting specific criteria (typically those containing a given word or phrase) and retrieves a list of references that match those criteria. Search engines use regularly updated indexes to operate quickly and efficiently. Without further qualification, search engine usually refers to a Web search engine, which searches for information on the public Web.

Where and When did it come about?

&quot;&quot;&quot;Originally named &quot;Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web&quot; by founders David Filo and Jerry Yang, Yahoo is one of the world's most recognized search engine.&quot;&quot;&quot;

The name Yahoo! is an acronym for &quot;Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle&quot;, however was chosen by the two creators for its more common deffinition: rude, unsophisticated,uncouth.

Yahoo! began as a student hobby and evolved into a global brand that has changed the way people communicate with each other, find and access information and purchase things. The two founders of Yahoo!, David Filo and Jerry Yang, Ph.D. candidates in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, started their guide in a campus trailer in February 1994 as a way to keep track of their personal interests on the Internet. Before long they were spending more time on their home-brewed lists of favorite links than on their doctoral dissertations. Eventually, Jerry and David's lists became too long and unwieldy, and they broke them out into categories. When the categories became too full, they developed subcategories ... and the core concept behind Yahoo! was born. 

Yahoo! celebrated its first million-hit day in the fall of 1994, translating to almost 100 thousand unique visitors

Today, Yahoo! Inc. is a leading global Internet communications, commerce and media company that offers a comprehensive branded network of services to more than 345 million individuals each month worldwide. As the first online navigational guide to the Web, www.yahoo.com is the leading guide in terms of traffic, advertising, household and business user reach. Yahoo! is the No. 1 Internet brand globally and reaches the largest audience worldwide. The company also provides online business and enterprise services designed to enhance the productivity and Web presence of Yahoo!'s clients. These services include Corporate Yahoo!, a popular customized enterprise portal solution; audio and video streaming; store hosting and management; and Web site tools and services. The company's global Web network includes 25 World properties. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, Calif., Yahoo! has offices in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, Canada and the United States.

==Multimedia==
The dictionary defines multimedia as measures of communication involving various methods of media.  Media being different types of ways to interact, such as web cameras, CD-ROM’s, graphics, and videos.  These days, there are so many types of different software and programs you may use on your computer.  Technology is getting more advanced every day and there are applications that allow you to do just about anything.  Multimedia allows you to create life-like graphics in animation. You can have a sound system on your computer and making videos is relatively easy as well.
Multimedia is enhancing the world we live in.  Because of all the different types of media out there, the more powerful your computer, the better.  There are numerous devices available to use on your computer.  They include larger memory and storage space, accelerators, sound cards, subwoofers with the speakers, microphones, DVD-ROM’s, improved microprocessors, and wireless additions to the computer.  Many of these devices even require additional software in order to operate.
We are able to integrate digital cameras onto our computers and scan items for graphics.  Multimedia software is used everywhere everyday.  We even use multimedia to describe our home entertainment systems.  The big screen TV’s with surround sound and DVD player is all included in the electronic products that we refer to as multimedia. 
There are different dimensions to media.  Single-dimensional would refer to email (you are just using text to communicate) or radio (you are producing sound for people to listen to).  To be categorized as multimedia, the technology must exhibit more than one way of communication.  This would include the internet, as you can view text and pictures at the same time you’re listening to music and talking through a web camera to your friend.

==News Groups==
&lt;p&gt;A News Group is a message board posted in cyberspace where participants exchange information on topics of common interest. The range of subject matter is as limitless as the content of the internet itself; there are News Groups for topics as varied as dance shoes, dog grooming, software and global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; News Groups differ from news found in the media because they invite the user to contribute to the discussion rather than simply absorbing information. You needn't be a scholar or pundit to participate, you only need to have some pertinent information or question. This is called &quot;Open Source&quot;. Open Source is a highly effective way of information exchange because is allows a greater spectrum of people to participate; allowing average Joe to contribute is a good idea because as has been proven,(by Wikipedia and others) the general public is often a greater source of info than a small group of specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; When posting a message on a News Group the participant must type in what the message is referring to, (much like a subject box with email) and then write what is called an &quot;Article&quot; or message. The article is the information the participant is offering. An article is not defined by its length but rather by the fact that a contribution to the News Group has been made. It may be a single paragraph, sentence, or word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; News Groups often have a series of related topics or sub- categories call &quot;Hierarchies&quot;. These hierarchies can supply useful back ground info for News Groups topics and also act as a link to the plethora of other News Group topics available for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt; News Groups are hosted on network of computers called Usenet. A specialized program is required for the user to read and access information. Payment and registration are required and News Groups as a general rule do  not edit, regulate, or filter content.  See Usenet disclaimer below: &lt;br&gt;

''Please note: Usenet.com does not control the newsgroups on Usenet. We do not post content in the newsgroups or create their names. Each newsgroup and each post that are created are the sole responsibility of those who created them. We do not control what people post to the Usenet newsgroups. Our servers are classified as a &quot;transitory network.&quot; A newsgroup name in and of itself does not mean that what is posted to that group corresponds to the name of the newsgroup.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


 
==Email==
&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#770077&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; becomes more and more popular in modern society. People use email to communicate each other easily comparing with writing a letter. First of all, people using email correctly save a lot of time and using email the right way will get faster responses. Secondly, people can share their experience with email.
 
&lt;H4&gt;Advantages for using email&lt;/H4&gt; 
&lt;table border=4&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; 1. Email is effective in finding the right person in an organization or company to answer your question. 
2. Email is good to make appointments for busy people. 
3. Email can distribute information quickly to many people for the time it takes to email one person.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;H4&gt;Disadvantages for using email&lt;/H4&gt;
&lt;table border=4&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; 1. Email can become time-consuming for answering complicated questions and misunderstandings can arise because cultural differences in the interpretation of certain words. The telephone is much better for providing detailed answers or if you feel that the question is not absolutely clear.
2. Email can compromise the security of an organization because sensitive information can be easily distributed accidentally or deliberately. Email should be entrusted to well trained and trusted staff members. 
3. Email sometimes can become impersonal or misunderstood.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
==Spam==
[[File:No-spam.svg|100px|thumb|left]]
&lt;b&gt;Spam&lt;b&gt; is the electronic version of junk mail.  It is unsolicited e-mail sent to large groups of people at one time.  It is used to sell products or services, but can also be used for fraudulent purposes such as phishing schemes, or counterfeit products.  The best way to prevent spam is by using your e-mail address for only trusted sources, such as family, friends and work associates.  For activities such as online shopping, or other things that may lead to spam, you can use a second e-mail address, which could be a free account from Yahoo, Hotmail, or Google’s Gmail.  These e-mail accounts are often called disposable or throw-away addresses, because once they become too overwhelming, you can quit using it, and start a new one.  Some ISPs provide disposable e-mail addresses for their subscribers, and then the subscriber can delete the address when it is no longer wanted or needed.  &lt;i&gt;Anonymous e-mail services&lt;i&gt; allow users to create/delete anonymous accounts which are forwarded to an account specified by the user.  These companies generally charge a yearly fee for their service.



==Blog==

 
*''' What it is ''' 

A blog is a means of which people can post information onto the internet and the responding readers can feel free to post comments or their own point of view.Blogs can take many forms for instance online personal journals which allows people to express themselves through there own identity or a username. In some cases entire sites are dedicated to individual blogs, where the topics can be of a political point of view to the simplest comments on a genre of music. One of the key attractions about blogs is the motivation to state your opinion and there is no cost in starting a blog.


*'''Who can use it'''

Blogs for the most part are open to anyone and everyone; however some sites pose age restriction. So that minors have to seek parents' approval and acknowledgement before venturing out onto the World Wide Web. This is in place to protect children from venturing onto blogs with mature content. These are common restriction becoming more active as the internet becomes more available to youth and access at schools and libraries. 



*'''What the content is '''

The content in blogs can range from properly planting tomatoes, to a person’s daily journal about life. Blogs content usually depends on the writer of the blog, if the person maybe a retired train engineer the blog could possibly be about years of work and accessing the right resources to becoming a train engineer. Or possibly the online journal of a celebrity keeping her/his fans informed of tour dates and the daily life on a tour bus and the interesting life style.


*'''Where the future of blogs is'''

As blogs have become more evidently popular, people have started to combine blogs and media players together. Individuals are now setting up blogs with the addition of their favorite music or music which they have created. These sites have started to evolve to the point of where millions of users are adding to their own blog and checking on friends or new users. Commenting on not only the blog but the selection of music and leaving comments so that the owner of the blog may start a discussion with the commenting user. An example of one of these sites is http://www.myspace.com, http://www.youtube.com and many more.

== Instant Messaging ==
[[ IM Introduction ]]

Exchanging messages in real-time between two or more people. Unlike a dial-up system such as the telephone, instant messaging (IM) requires that both parties be logged onto their IM service at the same time. Also known as a &quot;chatting,&quot; IM has become very popular for both business and personal use. In business, IM provides a way to contact co-workers any time of the day, providing they are at their computers. Thus, IM is often used as a way to avoid telephone tag, whether the communication continues as text messages or winds up as a traditional phone call.

[[ IM History ]]

Since the early '90s, AOL has always had a form of Instant Messaging but it wasn't until 1996, when they introduced the Buddy List feature, that it really took off. In the same year, ICQ (I Seek You) burst onto the Internet scene and helped popularize Instant Messaging. Whereas AOL Instant Messaging was exclusive to AOL members, ICQ was a free IM software available for download to anyone. 

In 1997, AOL introduced AIM (AOL Instant Messenger), which allowed its members to talk with non-members for the first time. AIM eventually usurped ICQ as the prevalent IM client, and in 1998, AOL bought Mirablis (ICQ's creator), thus becoming the dominant player in Instant Messaging. 

As the popularity of Instant Messaging grew, other IM clients like MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger and a variety of smaller players eventually entered the mix. However, it's important to point out that there is no interoperability between the different IM clients. Each IM software uses its own proprietary system and network.

[[ Benefits ]]

Instant messaging typically boosts communication and allows easy collaboration. In contrast to e-mails or phone, the parties know whether the peer is available. Most systems allow the user to set an online status or away message so peers get notified whenever the user is available, busy, or away from the computer. On the other hand, people are not forced to reply immediately to incoming messages. This way, communication via instant messaging can be less intrusive than communication via phone, which is partly a reason why instant messaging is becoming more and more important in corporate environments. Also, the fact that instant messages typically get logged in a local message history closes the gap to the persistent nature of e-mails, facilitating quick, safe, and persistent exchange of information such as URLs or document snippets, which can be unwieldy when done using inappropriate media such as phone.

== VOIP ==
Basically VoIP stands for voice over internet protocol; which is when a
you use the internet to conduct your phone calls, allowing for
video-conferencing through a link to a videophone. The voice signal from
your phone is converted into a digital signal that travels through the
internet into either another phone using VoIP or through a adapter to a
regular phone number. To be able to use this service you require a high
speed internet connection through either a cable modem or high speed
services and your choice of a microphone which is connected directly into
the computer or through a telephone connected to your computer. Since the
service is digital there are some advantages and disadvantages that come
along with use of VoIP.

The advantages include not needing to maintain and pay the additional cost
for a line just to make telephone call, as well with many VoIP plans you
can talk for as long as you want with any person in the world, you are also
able to talk with many people at the same time without any additional
cost. For individuals who are traveling, VoIP provides the advantage of portability, as long
as you have access to a broadband connection. With access to a broadband connection you can easily and cheaply
keep in touch. Many of the same features that you’ve come to expect as
standard with your traditional and cell phone service are available with your
VoIP service. These services include call forwarding, call waiting, voicemail,
caller ID and more are available through your ip phone
. You can also send data, as you would with a broadband internet connection, like pictures and documents, all
while talking on the phone.

 The disadvantages of this service include some VoIP services not
working during power outages and back up power is not guaranteed. As well,
not all VoIP service providers connect directly to emergency services
through 9-1-1, they require an outside link to receive service. There are
also issues with VoIP sound quality and reliability. Just like any data
sent over the internet, it is sent through little
“packets”. Due to the real-time nature of voice communication, the
reassembly process becomes more of a problem with VoIP. In order to
minimize the delay of the voice connection, some data packets may
occasionally need to be “dropped” if they don’t arrive in time, resulting in periods of silence in the conversation


'''Microwave and Satellite Transmissions'''

[[File:Lockheed WC-130 (2152189123).jpg|100px|thumb|Add Lockheed WC-130]]


Microwaves are high frequency radio signals that can send large quantities of data at high speed over long distances. Microwave signals can be sent or received using microwave stations or communication satellites, but only can travel in straight line from one station or one satellite to another without encountering any obstacles, since microwave signals are line of sight.  Microwave stations are earth-based stations that can transmit signals directly to each other over distances of up to about 30 miles.  To avoid buildings, mountains and the curvature of the earth obstructing the signal, microwave stations are usually placed on tall buildings, towers, mountaintops. Microwave stations contain both a dish-shaped microwave antenna and a transceiver. When one station receives a transmission from another, it amplifies it and passes it on to the next station. Microwave stations can exchange data transmissions with communication satellite and also with other microwave stations. Microwave stations designed specifically to communicate with satellite such as satellite TV and satellite Internet services are also called satellite dishes. Satellite dishes are installed permanently where they are needed.  They can also be mounted on trucks, boats, RVs and other types of transportation devices when portable transmission capabilities are necessary such as military or recreational applications.  

[[File:100 3376.JPG|100px|left]]

'''Communication satellites'''– are space-based devices launched into orbit around the earth to receive and transmit microwave signals to and from earth. Communication satellite was originally used to facilitate microwave transmissions when microwave stations were not economically viable such as largely populated areas or were physically impractical such as over large bodies of water.  Today, communication satellites are used to send and receive transmissions to and from a variety of other devices such as personal satellite dishes used for satellite television and Internet service.  GPS receivers, satellite radio receivers and satellite phones.

What Can Be Done to Make Teaching an Attractive Profession?

As a profession, teaching is behind in its ability to attract qualified applicants. The competition for high quality teachers is fierce. Schools have been forced to find new ways to not only attract but keep new teachers. Because of the No Child Left Behind Act that President Bush signed in 2002, states need to have “highly qualified” teachers for all the core academic courses. This needs to be accomplished by the end of the 2006-2007 school year, or states face a loss in federal funding (King, 2006). Because of this urgency, the time is now to face teaching shortages and attract and keep quality professionals.  A competitive salary, hiring incentives, and especially more support and consideration for the hardships of new teachers would all make teaching a more attractive profession and help end the problems with finding “highly qualified” teachers.

The most logical way to entice a potential teacher is with a competitive salary. The problem is that for starting teachers, the salary offered is below what they could receive in the business sector. In 2003-04, the estimated starting salary for teachers with a B.A, was $30,496. Beginning salary for accountants that same year was $41,110 and for computer science graduates, $49,691 (Solomon, 2005).  

Institutions of public education need to stay more competitive. One of the ways is to not base pay on years of experience, but instead on the need for the particular position. For example, there are fewer applicants for positions teaching physics than there are for positions as English teachers, because someone with a physics degree can earn a lot more in the business sector than someone with an English degree could earn in a field outside education, therefore, the physics position should offer higher salary than the English position.  The current pay schedule does not account for this.

More importantly, salaries should be higher for teachers overall.  Doctors and nurses have jobs that are very important for our society, and they make high pay.  What teachers do, could be argued, is just as important, if not more important, given that all Americans receive an education, and the quality of this education determines the intelligence and ability of our future nation.

Along with salary increases, states should look at ways to offer other rewards to potential teachers. Signing bonuses are a common incentive. These are usually given with the requirement of working as a teacher within the system for a given number of years. More creative ways to offer rewards include helping with student loans, making mortgage subsidies available, and even something small such as offering free or discounted health club memberships. 

Private businesses have tried to help with the recruitment of quality teachers.  Bank of America offers mortgage loans of up to $252,700 to teachers nationwide. This allows the purchase of a house with little to no down payment (Siskos, 2001). 

Competitive salaries and added perks such as bonuses and other incentives will help, but more is needed.  The main problem in attracting and keeping qualified teachers is job satisfaction. One third of all new teachers leave the field within three years. Close to half leave teaching after five years (National Education Association, 2003).  This kind of turnover costs more than schools can afford. Studies done by the Texas Center for Educational Research state that turnover costs as much as one and a half times the departing teachers salary. Part of that cost is the training, bonuses and benefits that have now been lost with the teacher (Kraus, 2005).  With all this considered, it is important to do the things needed to keep new teacher in place. 

One of the biggest complaints of new teachers is that they feel lost. There is not adequate guidance and mentoring in most schools. Often, the first year teachers are given the most difficult and challenging students, full loads with little time to prepare, and more than a fair share of extracurricular assignments is areas like coaching and club activities (Columbia Group, 2006).  Christina Knowles, a high school English teacher in rural North Carolina, says about her first year teaching: 

They made me in charge of the yearbook, which, besides football, is the only thing people around here care about it.  (The students and other teachers) all have in their minds how they want this book to be, yet no one wants to help.  To make things worse, the staff of students I got to produce this product was an overcrowded class including a kid who dropped out of school, four kids who would come to class stoned, two students who chased me on the highway, a group of five who tried to get me fired, and a bold young man who would do things like spray paint on paper in my classroom while substitute was there or leave an unwrapped condom on my desk just to embarrass me.  That was just one of my classes (Knowles 2006).

To help with this, the school systems should make sure that new teachers are not given the most challenging courses. Beginning teachers still need to learn how to run an actual live class full of students. For the first couple years, teachers should have reduced course work so that they can learn their craft at a pace that will not overwhelm them. They should be given time during the day to plan and ask questions of more experienced staff. An organized and structured mentoring system should be in place to help new teachers. Guidance and support are the basic things needed to keep teachers content with the job. 

With the timeline established in the No Child Left Behind Act, the problems with attracting quality teachers needs to be solved immediately.  To do this, every state needs to offer a competitive salary, more and better hiring incentives, and a strong support system for new teachers.  This is possible, but it my take a major change in national mindset.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Differences in Perception and Reality 

	The differences in perception and reality in education bring into focus the group of people in our society that are forgotten. In this article some of the differences between perception and reality will be addressed. Lets start with the definition of perception and reality. Reality is that which exists objectively and in fact (American Heritage). Perception is the awareness of directly through any of the senses (American Heritage). To put this simply reality is how things really are and perception is how we comprehend things to be. Within education both of these exist. Lets examine some realities and perceptions within education. 

	With the multicultural society that is found in the United States there are many teachers and students from various backgrounds. The teachers and students in America’s public institution foster the reality and perception of education. The barriers that students from low-income families are facing are affecting their educational experience. This problem referred to as the digital divide is affecting a proportion of the population that is falling further behind. This is a reality that needs to be addressed. Ethnic differences create literary and language barriers these barriers are directly related to the digital divide ( The Children’s Partnership).  These barriers of literary and language are problems, but solutions are in the works. With the use of technology teachers can teach class in closed-captioned settings. This will allow students with literacy and language barriers to learn by the preferred language of choice. The perception of education then changes to allow students that were left behind because of these barriers to embrace technology and put it to use. The digital divide can be eliminated if technology is there to use. This is not always the case. Technology is not in every school to be accessed by every teacher. The process of education needs to be rethought. The idea of the National Experimental School Administration (NESA) as proposed by Dr. Allen and Dr. Cosby in their book “American Schools: The 100 Billion Dollar Challenge” is one way of approaching the digital divide problem. The creation of NESA would allow testing of various teaching styles that could show what would make education current in the 21st century. Then the barriers that were listed above would not matter and all students could have access to current technology if the NESA was successful. 

	Another perception of education is that the educational preparation students receive is supposed to equip them for the job market. Students are instructed to do their homework and pass the standardized tests to determine their success in life. The does not really guarantee that students will be successful or get a job. This means change in the classroom needs to happen. Teachers need to change their assumptions they have about how students learn. The assumptions that “they are willful and need correction, they are innocent and must be protected from a dangerous or vulgar society, they are empty vessels to be filled with knowledge that only adults can provide, that they are egocentric and in need of socialization, etc.” are long held perceptions (Bruner). These are perceptions about students that need to be rethought and the reality needs to be voiced and put into practice. The reality is that teachers need to stop looking at students as if they do not know anything. Teachers have a lot that could be learned from students with all the information and technology that is in our society. The days that teachers stood in the front of the classroom to give students information that they could not find anywhere else but school have passed. Teachers and students need to be joining together in the learning process. In doing this interesting and useful ways to explore technology would become a reality in preparing students for the job market.

	In mentioning students as a forgotten group teachers must not be left out of this classification. Teachers that have professional development training sessions have been found to have a positive impact on students. The reality of positive impact that teachers can make occurs when teacher development meets the following: 1. it is sustained over time; 2. focuses on specific content areas or instructional strategies; 3. supports collection learning; 4. aligns with school and teacher goals; and 5. provides opportunities for teachers to practice and apply new knowledge (Hamilton).  When these things become a reality for teachers their attitudes about teaching will become more of a rewarding experience. When the perception that teachers have all the training in college is changed, then can teacher development become a reality. The administration of schools that offer teacher development give the opportunity for teachers to learn from each other. Teachers would cover material that other teachers were applying and gain a comfort level and solid knowledge of what is expected of them. This would also be rewarding for the students having teachers that were excited about the material they were presenting. Teachers would also be aligned with the school goals that were set before them by the administration. The students that are taught by well prepared teachers are going to see improvement. The perception that students are getting further behind would begin to be erased. This would be replaced by the reality of quality improvement in students’ assignments and projects (Gale). This could go a long way to changing how education and teachers are viewed by society. Teacher professional development could allow the ability to lead the way into students successfully being well-educated citizens of the country. These changes will come if we dare change the way teachers are taught by altering our perceptions of how learning should occur.

	This article addressed some of the components that show some of the differences in perception and reality in education.  The predicament of education is that change in the way students are educated must happen. Perceptions toward education will not be changed until education itself undergoes change. New realities in education will then be acknowledged. Teachers and students could benefit, what is there to lose. The choice is to let education remain where it is or to change it so that no one will be left behind is the turning point that education faces at this time. It is up to us as teachers to decide were to go from here.

      <comment>Explain why the Wikibook does not need more diagram based proofs.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">How about including some more diagrams which can serve as proof of the theorem, perhaps the one with the three squares on the outside of the center triangle, or the one with three circles. Perhaps I will upload some myself. --[[User:Navaburo|Navaburo]] 01:48, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

There was a time when a certain French mathematics journal (I forget the name) actually banned the use of diagrams in proofs in their articles. Why? Because they found too many authors were drawing figures that were special cases or otherwise fooled the author (and reader) into thinking something not yet proved was proved because &quot;it is obvious from the diagram&quot;.

So here, too. Even the first diagram used in the main text of chapter 14 for 'proving' the Pythagorean Theorem obscures the fact that the author of the proof did not prove that the figure formed by all four instances of the hypotenuse c really IS a square. By the time you dot all your i's and cross all your t's, the proof is not that simple after all, even though the symmetry is so highly suggestive. This is one of several reasons Euclid did not do it this way, choosing a proof that at first glance appears more obscure and complicated.

Now if the author had first proved that the only quadrilateral with C4 symmetry is the square, then fixing his proof (of the PT) would have been much easier, so the diagram based proof would still be useful. But as it is...

      <text xml:space="preserve">In a time when teachers are being held more and more accountable for how well students learn, it is becoming very important for teachers to be flexible when it comes to their teaching methods.  Much of the accountability issue is largely due to the signing of the No Child Left Behind Act, also referred to as NCLB, in 2002 by President George W. Bush.  The No Child Left Behind Act was established to “close the achievement gap among all students and ensure high academic standards”(“No Child Left Behind”).  The Act went on to list all of the goals and expectations the government expected the national school systems to be able to satisfy by 2005.  Included amongst the goals was “Improving Teacher Quality”.  The theory behind this goal was that student learning will improve when states set ambitious academic standards, align assessments to the standards, and hold schools and teachers accountable for how well students meet the national and state standards (Cross).  Once this law was passed, the education profession, as a whole, was put under greater scrutiny, with much of the focus being drawn to the teachers and the demands for better instruction in the classroom.

In the past few years there have been increasing demands for teachers to be “highly qualified” in all of the subjects in which they teach.  By the federal government’s standards, a highly qualified teacher is one who has at least a bachelor’s degree, along with a full teaching certification, and mastery in each subject area they teach.  It is up to each state to determine the specifications for both teacher certification and subject mastery in their individual school systems (Schleicher).  In order to try and meet the standards that are being set by both the state and federal government, there have been many recommendations on new ways to ensure a better quality of those entering the teaching profession.  Future teachers may soon find themselves having to fulfill many new requirements before graduating with their certifications.  Some of those requirements may include completing additional courses in general education, attending courses that link instructional method courses with subject-area courses, and participating in longer observations and student-teaching experiences so that they may receive more knowledge of the in-class environment (Cross).  Their willingness to comply with these new standards is proof of their continued flexibility in preparing for the demands of the classroom.  Up and coming teachers, have already begun to see the need for increased education despite the fact that it is not yet required by many states.

In order to make sure that educators are able to teach their subject in the most efficient and effective ways they can, it is often prudent for them to take developmental classes to further their education even after they have graduated college.  According to an American School Board Journal that was released in April of 2002, teachers are expected to teach more demanding standard-based curricula and often find that they too need to be instructed in the new subject area content and effective ways to teach the subject (Cross).

As for those teachers that have already graduated from college and are already working in a classroom environment, there have also been discussions on ways to ensure that they too, are meeting the necessary standards within the classroom.  It is important that teachers and the administration work together to ensure that all state standards are met.  By discovering new ways to capture the interest of students, presenting curriculum in an easy, comprehensive manner and striving to ensure that each student can reach their full potential; educators are ensuring that no child is left behind.

These days it’s not just the new teachers that have to take additional courses to remain flexible.  Many educators teaching with a maximum background of a Bachelor’s Degree have begun taking steps to continue their education and receive their Master’s Degree.  Many teachers also attend classes annually to keep informed of all the changes to the curriculum and to learn new techniques to implement in the classroom.

So what does this mean for those going into the field of teaching?  How can one remain flexible when the government and society are set on making them accountable for how their students perform?  As of now, there are many steps being taken by teachers to stay flexible despite the accountability factor.  Because much of the curriculum that is taught in classrooms is based upon the set standards of the state assessment tests, many teachers feel that they are teaching for the assessment tests.  One way to work around these tests is to assess the needs of each student.   The teacher would need to prepare materials based on the ability of the student to absorb the content being taught.  They would also need to be able to provide ample time and patience to create a suitable learning environment (Mowry). According to a policy brief from the Education Commission of the State, otherwise known as the ECS, teachers can significantly impact how a student learns. If teachers take time to make themselves available to their students they can have a great influence on how their students learn and can potentially help shape their lives. Teachers should also be able to help their students become comfortable with the testing process. By helping students prepare for the assessment testing and offering incentives for learning it might be possible for educators to boost assessment test scores.
 
As you can see the flexibility of today’s educators is an important tool in the classroom. As state laws and the need to improve education continues to change so to will the increased need of flexibility within the classroom.  Without this flexibility, teachers would fail in their objective to provide a quality education for all students (Mowry).

Hi, I aim to move my guide from [http://www.geocities.com/guidetoisland/] to here. I would appreciate some help for converting the formats, such as bold, italics and links. Is there a tool that converts html to wiki?  --[[User:MrC|MrC]] 03:13, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

Ok, I posted a pretty rough draft.  This page needs LOTS of work.  I would appreciate some help with it. --[[User:MrC|MrC]] 16:20, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

This guide contains information on the mind-boggling number of obscure references and vocabulary used in ''Island'', by Aldous Huxley. It also translates the German, Latin, and French that Huxley uses and for some reason assumes the reader can understand without explanation. He also assumes you know the English countryside and institutions very well.


'''Dedication'''

'''Pala'''- The fictional Pacific island the story takes place on. For info on its possible location, see 87, 131, and 145. The text suggests that Pala is somewhere around the Indonesian island of Sumatra and South of the smaller Nicobar Islands. Nicrobar was part of the British Indian colony until 1948. Huxley is being ambiguous but there is an island named Pulau, off the coast of Sumatra which may have served as a basis for a name. What's made clear is that Pala is off the Western coast of the Malaysian peninsula, where Huxley traveled to in 1926.

'''Rendang-Lobo'''- The nation closest to Pala.  Again, fictional.  The name probably comes from Rendang, a way of cooking meats in Indonesia and Malaysia, the mainlands that would be around Pala.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''differential geometry of curves''' is usual starting point of students in field of differential geometry which is the field concerned with studying curves, surfaces, etc. with the use of the concept of derivatives in calculus. Thus, implicit in the discussion, we assume that the defining functions are ''sufficiently'' differentiable, i.e., they have no corners or cusps, etc. Curves are usually studied as subsets of an ambient space with a notion of equivalence. For example, one may study curves in the plane, the usual three dimensional space, curves on a sphere, etc. The most common notion of equivalence is that of rigid or Euclidean motion where two curves may be brought into alignment by a rotation and a translation. There are other interesting notions, however. In particular, in affine differential geometry of curves, two curves are equivalent if the may be brought into alignment through a rotation and a linear transformation. Special affine differential geometry considers two curves equivalent if they may be brought into alignment with a translation and linear transformation of determinant one. All ellipses in the plane are equivalent in affine geometry and are equivalent in special affine geometry if their interior has the same area. We will concentrate on the equivalence under Euclidean motions. In all these notions of equivalency, the ambient space is equipped with some additional structure. In the case of Euclidean motion equivalency, the additional structure is the ''inner'' or ''dot'' product of vectors. 

'''Plane curves''': Curves may defined parametrically, say &lt;math&gt;(x(t),y(t)) = (\cos(t),\sin(t))&lt;/math&gt; or as the level set of a function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=c&lt;/math&gt;, e.g., &lt;math&gt;\{ (x,y)|x^2+y^2=1\}&lt;/math&gt;. These, of course, both define the circle of radius one. The third method of defining curves is that of a graph, &lt;math&gt;(x,y=f(x))&lt;/math&gt;. We will find the parametrically formulation usually easier to work with. Any graph type curve has the parametrization &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(t,f(t))&lt;/math&gt;. For the most part, we will not concern ourselves with the &quot;speed&quot; of curve, i.e., the actual parametrization of the curve. For example, the map &lt;math&gt;t\to 2t&lt;/math&gt; defines a curve that traverses the same path only twice as quickly.

Given a plane curve &lt;math&gt;\bold{x}(t)=(x(t),y(t))&lt;/math&gt;, we may consider it's velocity which is the simply the component-wise derivative, &lt;math&gt;\bold{x}'(t)=(x'(t),y'(t))&lt;/math&gt;. If one considers a rather simple reparametrization &lt;math&gt;t\to e^{tan(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, one can quickly obtain derivatives which become quite ugly and unwieldy even starting with &quot;easy&quot; curves such as the circle. Thus recognizing that one is dealing with a circle might not be obvious if one looks at these derivatives.

Given a curve with a specific parametrization, there is a special reparametrization (almost unique) that eliminates this freedom that causes our headaches. Again, let &lt;math&gt;\bold{x}(t)=(x(t),y(t))&lt;/math&gt; be our curve. We want &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to be the reparametrization &lt;math&gt;t=t(s)&lt;/math&gt; so that the new curve has speed one, i.e.,  the magnitude of the vector velocity &lt;math&gt;= \sqrt{x'(s)^2+y'(s)^2}=1&lt;/math&gt;. One may determine the function &lt;math&gt;t(s)&lt;/math&gt; with the chain rule. In order for the curve &lt;math&gt;\bold{x}(s)=(x(t(s)),y(t(s)))&lt;/math&gt; to have unit speed, by the chain rule, we need 

&lt;math&gt;(\frac{dx}{dt}\frac{dt}{ds})^2+ (\frac{dy}{dt}\frac{dt}{ds})^2=1&lt;/math&gt; or

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dt}{ds}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\frac{dx}{dt})^2+ (\frac{dy}{dt})^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The later is a differential equation, which, for all intents and purposes, cannot be solved explicitly except in very special circumstances. It will, by the standard theory of differential equations, have a solution away from points where the velocity vanishes. We will develop the theory assuming that this equation has been solved but then show how to work in other, non-unit-speed, parametrizations.  

Thus, we assume that &lt;math&gt;\bold{x}=\bold{x}(s)=(x(s),y(s))&lt;/math&gt;. With this parametrization, we have &lt;math&gt;\bold{x}'(s)=(x'(s),y'(s))&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector, the tangent unit vector. Let us call this vector &lt;math&gt;\bold{e}_1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\bold{e}_1(s)=(x'(s),y'(s))&lt;/math&gt;. We define unit normal vector &lt;math&gt;\bold{e}_2&lt;/math&gt; be the unit vector obtained by rotating &lt;math&gt;\bold{e}_1&lt;/math&gt; by 90° counter clockwise: 

&lt;math&gt;\bold{e}_2(s)=(-y'(s),x'(s))&lt;/math&gt;.

Because we are in the plane, all vectors that are perpendicular to the vector &lt;math&gt;\bold{e}_1&lt;/math&gt; are necessarily some scalar multiple of &lt;math&gt;\bold{e}_2&lt;/math&gt;. We use this observation as follows: The scalar function of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\bold{e}_1(s)\cdot \bold{e}_1(s)&lt;/math&gt; is constant (equal to one). Thus, it's derivative vanishes:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{ds}(\bold{e}_1(s)\cdot \bold{e}_1(s))=2\,\bold{e}_1(s)\cdot \frac{d}{ds}\bold{e}_1(s)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the vector valued function &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{ds}\bold{e}_1(s)=(x''(s),y''(s))&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\bold{e}_1(s)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus by the above observation, we may write:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{ds}\bold{e}_1(s)=\kappa(s)\, \bold{e}_2(s)&lt;/math&gt;

for some function &lt;math&gt;\kappa(s)&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;\kappa(s)&lt;/math&gt; is intrinsic and may be understood as the amount that the unit vector ''swings'' into the unit normal direction.

'''An example''': We consider a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; centered around the origin. This may be parametrized by &lt;math&gt;(r\, \cos(t), r\,\sin(t))&lt;/math&gt;. One can solve the differential equation defining &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in this case and the unit speed parametrization is given by &lt;math&gt;(r\, \cos(s/r), r\,\sin(s/r))&lt;/math&gt;. (This may have guessed as well.) The unit tangent and normal is given by  &lt;math&gt;\bold{e}_1= \cos(s/r), \sin(s/r),\bold{e}_2=(-\sin(s/r), \cos(s/r))&lt;/math&gt;. One then has:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{ds}\bold{e}_1(s)=(1/r)(-\sin(s/r), \cos(s/r))=\kappa(s)\, \bold{e}_2(s)&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\kappa(s)&lt;/math&gt; being the constant function &lt;math&gt;1/r&lt;/math&gt;. This gives another interpretation of the function &lt;math&gt;\kappa(s)&lt;/math&gt; as the reciprocal of the radius of the best fitting or ''osculating'' circle. 

The function &lt;math&gt;\kappa(s)&lt;/math&gt; characterizes curves up Euclidean motion with the following result: 

'''Theorem''': If two curves 
&lt;math&gt;\bold{x}_1(s)=(x_1(s),y_1(s))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bold{x}_2(s)=(x_1(s),y_2(s))&lt;/math&gt; have the same curvature function &lt;math&gt;\kappa(s)=\kappa_1(s)=\kappa_2(s)&lt;/math&gt; then necessarily there exists a rigid motion involving a rotation and translation taking the curve &lt;math&gt;\bold{x}_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\bold{x}_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Hi, Zainramadan, and welcome to wikibooks. I noticed that you started a book at [[Zain Ramadan]] but the content raised some questions that I hope you could help me with.

The content looks a lot like it has been typed out of an existing textbook. If that is the case, there may a copyright issue which bars it from being published here under the site license. If there are no licensing problems, but the book has been published before, it should rather be put up on [[w:Wikisource]].

I'm also wondering about the name since it is basically the same as your username. You may wish to opt for a more descriptive name to aid users in finding the book.

If you have any questions regarding the book or Wikibooks in general, don't hesitate to drop a note on my [[User talk:Swift|talk page]] or on the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:21, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

: I'm starting to get a better idea of what is going on here. This page seems to be a part of the [[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]] project. I noticed that another editor was using his/her userpage for similar work. Please note that your userpage is [[User:Zainramadan]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 16:46, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

}}The '''pokeweeds''', also known as '''poke''', '''pokebush''', '''pokeberry''', '''pokeroot''', '''inkberry''' or '''ombú''', comprise the genus '''''Phytolacca''''', perennial plants native to North America, South America, East Asia and New Zealand. Pokeweed contains ''phytolaccatoxin'' and ''phytolaccigenin'', which are poisonous to mammals. However, the berries are eaten by birds, which are not affected by the toxin.

Pokeweeds are herbs growing from 1-10 ft. tall. They have single alternate leaves, pointed at the end, with crinkled edges. The stems are often colored pink or red. The flowers are greenish-white, in long clusters at the ends of the stems. They develop into dark purple berries.

==Ecology==
Pokeweed can be a troublesome weed of gardens and pastures. The fruits attract birds when ripe, and the birds then sow the seeds.

==Uses==
Young pokeweed leaves can be boiled twice to reduce the toxin, discarding the water after the first boiling. The result is known as poke salit, or Poke salad, and is occasionally available commercially. Many authorities advise against eating pokeweed even after twice boiling, as traces of the toxin may still remain. When fried in bacon grease, poke salad is no longer poisonous, and many say it tastes very good, &quot;especially with cornbread&quot;. For many decades, Poke salad has been a staple of southern U.S. cuisine, despite campaigns by doctors who believed pokeweed remained toxic even after being boiled. The lingering cultural significance of Poke salad can be seen in the recording of the song &quot;Polk Salad Annie&quot; by Tony Joe White, famously covered by Elvis Presley.&lt;div style=&quot;page-break-after: always;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Pokeweed is used as a homeopathic remedy to treat many ailments. It can be applied topically or taken internally. Topical treatments have been used for acne and other ailments. Internal treatments include tonsilitis, swollen glands and weight loss.

Pokeweed berries yield a red ink or dye, which was once used by Native Americans to decorate their horses. The red juice has also been used to symbolize blood, as in the anti-slavery protest of Benjamin Lay.

Pokeweeds are also grown as ornamental plants, mainly for their attractive berries; a number of cultivars have been selected for larger fruit panicles.Pokeweeds are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Giant Leopard Moth.

Edging is the technique of defining the edges of a garden where it bumps up against lawn, hardscapes, or pathways.

*Half-moon edgers
::The most efficient way to use a half-moon edger is to keep one's foot always on the blade on the side opposite to the direction of travel (lifting the foot with the rest of the tool while moving along). 
*String trimmers
*Edging machines

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Example==

 The amount of information that needs to be entered into the database 
 is enormous, and it needs to be entered in a different way for each patient. 
 '''This''' will make the design process complex.&quot;

== What's wrong? ==

The example uses a demonstrative pronoun (such as this, these, or those), but there are two or more possible antecedents. To which does the pronoun refer?

Consider this example:

 The new equipment arrived yesterday, and everything is in 
 working order. This was something of a surprise.

Which is surprising? The fact that the equipment arrived, or that it was in working order, or both?

== How to fix this problem ==

Supply a clarifying noun:

 The new equipment arrived yesterday, and everything is in working order. 
 This '''happy outcome''' was something of a surprise.

I'd like to ask whether contributors would agree to revising this section along the lines suggested in this entry. 
If this section were developed this way, teachers could refer students to the various pages as errors crop up. I've developed about 75 of these during the past 20 years, and I'd like for them to have a home.

If they aren't suitable in this section, or if it's felt that this section shouldn't be revised along these lines, where could they go?[[User:Pfaff9|Pfaff9]] 18:32, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

=Histology of Bone=
In simple terms bone is a type of specialised connective tissue. Though bone comes in several shapes and sizes the structure and composition of bone is the same in all.
==Structure==
===Gross Structure===
[[Image:Structure of bone.png|thumb|300px|Fig 1:Diagram depicting the Structure of bone]]
The human eye can discern only two types of bone. For a surgeon this distiction is what he encounters in the operating room. A cross section of any bone will demostrate these two types of bones. ''''Compact''' or '''cortical''' bone is usually thick dense bone that forms the outer shell covering almost all bones in the body. The inner aspect consists of bone that is not as dense as cortical bone and has a honeycomb appearance. This is '''cancellous''' bone. In tubular bones, long or short, cancellous bone is usually present at either ends. In irregular or flat bones they make up the entire inner body of the bone. Screws used for fracture fixation differ in structure depending on whether they are used to fix cancellous (less dense) or cortical (more dense) areas.
===Microscopic Structure===
[[Image:Transverse Section Of Bone.png|thumb|250px|Fig 3:Transverse section of decalcified bone x250]]
Cross sections of the bone when studied under the microscope reveal quite a different picture. By and large they could be either mineralised or unmineralised ('''Osteoid'''). Osteoid is normally found in children with a growing skeleton. In the transition from cartilage to bone at the growing end of a bone, bone first formed is unmineralised and then calcium salts are laid down giving them the strength of normal bone. Bone formed at the site of fracture healing is also osteoid, which eventually gets minerailised. When mineralisation does not occur adequately as in rickets or Osteomalacia the osteoid content of bone increases. Osteoid is not as strong as normal mineralised bone is and either fractures easily (osteomalacia) or deforms (rickets).&lt;/br&gt;
Mineralised bone could be either '''Woven Bone''' (Immature) or '''Lamellar Bone''' (mature). The basic microscopic unit of bone is an '''Osteon'''. '''Haversian canals''' run through the entire length of the bone carrying blood vessels. They are interlinked to each other through the '''Volkmans canals'''. On a transverse section of the bone each of these haversian canls is surrounded by a groupd of '''lacunae''', which lodge an '''Osteocyte'''. (Fig 3)The entire group of osteocytes link to each other and to the centrally located haversian canal through cytoplasmic extensions that run throug tiny channels called '''canaliculi'''. The osteocytes derive their nutrition through their cytoplasmic extensions from the vessels in the haversian canal. In mature bone the osteons are arranged in layers (Lamellar bone) while in developing bone they are arranged randomly (woven bone). Lamellar bone makes up the compact or cortical bone in the skeleton. When the same lamellar bone is loosely arranged it makes up trabecular bone. Its called trabecular bone because of the trabecular pattern that shows up on an x-ray. Woven bone is found on the growing ends of an immature skeleton or at the site of fracture healing.
==Compostion==
[[Image:Composition of bone.png|thumb|300px|Fig 2:Diagram depicting the Composition of bone]]
Bone is composed of protein,minerals and cells (see Fig 2)
===Matrix===
Matrix is the ground substance in which the cells of bone exist. The organic components of matrix would be collagen, mucopolysaccharides and a large non-homogenous group of non-collagenous proteins. The other important constituents of the matrix are the inorganic minerals calcium, phosphorus and to a lesser extent magnesium. The matrix forms the extracellular material that binds all the cellular constituents of bone together.
===Cells===
Cells in the human body that are specific to bone are the Osteoprogenitor cells, Osteoblasts, Ostecytes and the Osteoclasts.</text>

      <comment>/* A Conic Section Definition */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==An Introduction==
&lt;!--[[Image:AllFourConics.png|thumbnail|300px|The basic shape of each conic section. Starting from the top left box and going clockwise, the curves are: a circle, an ellipse, a parabola, and a hyperbola.]]--&gt;
There exists a certain group of curves called Conic Sections that are conceptually kin in several astonishing ways. Each member of this group has a certain shape, and can be classified appropriately: as either a circle, an ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola. The term &quot;Conic Section&quot; can be applied to any one of these curves, and the study of one curve is not essential to the study of another. However, their correlation to each other is one of the more intriguing coincidences of mathematics. 

But that's enough about conic sections. Perhaps you would instead like to view this short dialog between a mathematical novice and an expert about pi (&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;):

*Novice: So, what's pi?
*Expert: Pi a mathematical constant. It's always the same value, about 3.1415926. It's irrational and transcendental.
*Novice: Great. So what good is it?
*Expert: Well, the first thing that I can think of is for calculating volumes of surfaces of revolutions. That's calculus. And of course, radian measure.
*Novice: That's not what I meant. Why does it exist? Does it have a practical definition?
*Expert: Of course! It's the ratio of a circle's circumference to that circle's diameter. Pi a mathematical constant, you know. It's always the same value. I thought everybody knew that.
*Novice: (sardonically) Thanks.

This completely conic section-free piece of literature has some sort of application to conic sections. You may have caught that pi can be defined by a series of digits, but that doesn't help one use it, for there are plenty of numbers that can be defined by 3,1,4, and/or other numerals. Why is pi more useful than, for example, 2.7182818, that a letter of the Greek alphabet was chose to represent it? On the other hand, any conic section can basically be defined with a general equation. On the other hand, most curves can be defined with a general equation. These equations do not get to the issue of what a conic section is any more than a string of digits actually defines pi.

==Equations of Conic Sections==
Nonetheless, here is just a sample of the sort of equations that are considered conic sections:

&lt;math&gt;y^2+8y=2x+4\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y^2=3-x^2\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x^2+4y^2-6x+16y=171\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{9}-\frac{y^2}{49}=1\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Browsing this list reveals several subtle similarities. For example, you might see that there are only several types of terms in these equations. A conic section is a quadratic curve, meaning that there are only two variables used, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and these variables only appear as themselves or squared, and possibly multiplied by a constant. One feature of conic sections is that they can be simplified down so that they only have these terms in them! (Another term, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, can be used when rotating conic sections, but it's not relevant at the moment.) 

Here are a couple of other equations for conic sections:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(x-3)^2+(y+2)^2-16=0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(y-4)^2=2(x+4)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y=x^2+4\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3x^2+3y^2-2xy=8\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The last equation above uses the xy term, which can be eliminated by a rotation. You'll notice that there are squared binomials (terms like &lt;math&gt;(x-3)^2 &lt;/math&gt;) in some of the equations. However, these equations can always be simplified so that &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and a constant are the only terms in the equation. This is a conic section's General Form, and looks like &lt;math&gt;Ax^2+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F\,&lt;/math&gt;, where A, C, D, E, and F are constants.


The use of squared binomials is one way to find graphical information about conic sections. A binomial is any algebraic expression that's the sum or difference of two terms. &lt;math&gt;y-4&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;5x^2-C&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;ax+6&lt;/math&gt; are all binomials. The word binomial means &quot;having two parts&quot;, hence the two different terms in a binomial.

Conic sections aren't all that different. Circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas have several properties: the existence of foci, the locus of the intersection of a cone and a plane, and the consistency between the multiple definitions of eccentricity, including the ratio between the distance between foci and the distance between vertices, the slant of the plane, and the constant ratio between the distance from a focus to a directrix for any point on the curve. In addition, all conic sections are equations of the second degree or less. You basically can't have one characteristic and not have all the others.

We'll now conclude via the definition of conic sections from whence the term &quot;conic section&quot; derives it name.
==A Conic Section Definition==
Put simply, a conic section is a shape generated when a cone intersects with a plane.  There are four main types of conic sections: parabola, hyperbola, circle, and ellipse.  The circle is sometimes categorized as a type of ellipse. (See picture below)

Public schools vs. Private schools.

Public or private schools; do student do better in private schools than public schools?  Do you think your child would do better in private school or public school?   I can’t afford to send my child to private school, what can I do about this?  Some say that private school students tend to do better on standardized test than children in public school, but also some say that public school children do better in math, than in private schools.  What would render your decision if you had to pick one over the other?   How much do you know about the difference between the two?
Public schools cannot charge tuition.  They are funded through federal, state and local taxes.  When you pay your taxes, you are paying for your child’s education and the education of other children in your community.  Public schools admit all children, by law they must educated all children, including students with special need.  To enroll in public school you simply register your child by filling out the necessary paperwork.  Public schools must follow all federal, state, and local laws in educating children; such laws usually include specifics about funding, program development and curriculum.
Public school teachers also are usually state certifies or at a minimum, working toward certification; certification ensures that a teacher has gone through the training required by the state, which includes student teaching and coursework.
Private school teachers may not be required to have certification and instead often have subject area expertise and an undergraduate or graduate degree in the subject they teach.
Private schools are not subject to as many state and federal regulation as public school.  Private schools are funded independently; they are not subject to the limitations of state education budgets and have more freedom in designing curriculum and instruction.
Private school cost money, they do not receive tax revenues, but instead are funded through tuition, fundraising, donations and private grants, and also private schools are selective.  They are not obligated to accept every child, and in many private schools admission is very completive.
Sarah and Christopher Lubienski, education professors at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign did a recent study that concluded that when it comes to math, students in regular public school do as well or significantly better than comparable students in private school.
Many private schools will allow students to transfer in even after the school year has begun.  School vouchers, also known as scholarships redirect the flow of education funding, channeling it directly to individual families rather than to the school districts.  This allows families to select the public or private schools of their choice and have all or part of the tuition paid.  Scholarships give parental choice and competition between public and private schools.
School vouchers may not be for private schools, because once private schools start taking government funds, the government is going to tell them how they have to spend those funds.  They are also going to put all kinds of condition and standards on private schools to keep getting those funds.  A school voucher system would lead to the elimination of private and religious education.
The different between private schools is that they run on private money and public schools run on public money.  Once a private school gets hooked on public money they will slowly lose all the freedom of being a private school.   Private schools are called private for a reason – they can exclude the poor, disadvantages, troublesome, disabled, and other undesirable classes of kids that bring down the averages.  The students that attend private schools are from families that have more money and are willing to spend it on their children.  Are these the things that make private school better schools?  President Bush called school vouchers a “great victory to parents and students.”  “He said vouchers give “freedom to parent,”
If the lesson of history can be distilled to a single observation, it is that the institution of public schooling is not, after all the best system for advancing our ideals of public education.  After 150 years of experimentation and decades of disappointment, is it not time that we consider alternatives to the public school system? (Coulson)
Public school or private school, the choice is yours.  I believe either can beneficiate a child that is willing to learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikisource|The Republic}}
Plato's ''Republic'' is often referred to as the cornerstone of all Western philosophy. It is in the form of a dialogue. The use of dialogue was a common device for framing philosophical arguments and Plato's use of the dialogue is considered a classic in structure and clarity. When reading The Republic is must be borne in mind that Plato was writing 2,500 years ago and that the views he expresses are very much of their time. The main protagonist is Socrates who is cast as the narrator. He is detained by the enquiring minds of Cephalus, Polemarchus (the text takes place at his home), Thrasymachus, Lysias, Euthydemus, Niceratus, Charmantides and Cleitophon. Socrates has arrived to atttend the festival and at first tries to dissuade his friends from detaining him any further. To the Ancient Greeks festivals were very important occasions and the very human quality that Plato's imparts to the character of Socrates as he tries to fend off his friend's questions is remarkably familiar to modern readers. 

The book explores the notion of an ideal society that is created and disputed throughout the book. The purpose of imagining the society is in order to discover the true meaning of Justice. The book starts when Socrates encounters Polemarchus and is invited back to his home, there, Cephalus, Polemarchus' father, greets Socrates and talks about ageing. Cephalus eventually leaves and Polemarchus is left to take up the debate and the theme turns to that of Justice.

Thrasymachus then takes up the argument complaining of how Socrates is simply asking more questions rather than answering. After Thrasymachus' argument Glaucon provides another view of Justice where Socrates then sets about depicting his ideal city state. In this state the rulers or 'guardians' as they are known, receive a special education and attention. The book then continues on this theme until Socrates realizes that until philosophers are kings or vice-versa, society will always keep its problems.

=Introduction to Nanotechnology=
Nanotechnology, often shortened to &quot;nanotech,&quot; is the study of the control of matter on an atomic and molecular scale. Generally, nanotechnology deals with structures of the size 100 nanometers or smaller in at least one dimension, and involves developing materials or devices within that size. Nanotechnology is very diverse, encompassing numerous fields in the natural sciences. 

There has been much debate on the future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology has the potential to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in medicine, electronics and energy production. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as with any introduction of new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes|author= Cristina Buzea, Ivan Pacheco, and Kevin Robbie|title=Nanomaterials and Nanoparticles: Sources and Toxicity|volume=2|year=2007|page=MR17|journal=Biointerphases}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo doomsday scenarios]. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.

=The eyes in nanotech=
Without being able to 'see' the nanoscale objects, nanotechnology would be very difficult. In this part, the different microscope techniques are reviewed along with various spectroscopic and diffraction methods that can tell us more about the nanoscale structure of matter.

[[Image:TheElectromagneticSpectrum.jpg|thumb|300px|the electromagnetic spectrum]]
Visible light is only a part of the electromagnetic spectrum and useful information about different physical interactions in nanostructures can be acquired from the different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Seeing 'nano' can be done in different ways, but not with the naked eye which normally cannot see things much smaller than 100µm (though a single atom can be seen if it lights up in a dark room). Instead of our eyes, we use various instruments to 'see' for us, and they 'see' different things depending on how they are made:

=Microscopy=
[[w:Microscopy|Microscopy]] uses microscopes to create an image of the specimen. The image is rarely an image as you see it with your eyes, but rather how some physical probe interacts differently with the specimen as function of position on it. The physical probe can be an AFM cantilever, a beam of light or electrons, or something completely different.

==Overview of Microscopes==
[[Image:MicroscopesOverview.jpg|thumb|300px|Overview of the different types of microscopes]]

'''Optical:''' The beam from a light source is focused onto a sample and either the transmitted or scattered light is collected by an objective lens and the image is magnified onto a camera or to the observer's eye. The resolution can be down to about 200 nm, and the microscopes can be fairly cheap, small and easy to use.

'''Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM):''' Electrons from a very bright electron source are directed to a very thin sample that is transparent to the high energy electrons (100-300 keV) and the electron beam is then magnified by electromagnetic lenses and sent onto a fluorescent screen or a camera to observe the image. The resolution can be less than 0.1 nm on expensive high-end instruments where even individual atoms can be imaged. The samples must be very thin (typically less than 200 nm) and the whole system must be under high vacuum.

'''Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM):''' A focused electron beam is scanned over a sample and the scattered electrons are detected. The detector current is used to give an image depending on the electron beam position on the sample. The resolution can be down to about 5 nm and the sample can be much larger than in the TEM because the electrons do not have to pass through the sample.

'''Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPM)''' move a very sharp probe across a sample in a raster pattern while recording how the probe interacts with the sample. The typical SPMs are the AFM, STM and SNOM:

'''Atomic Force Microscope (AFM):''' An almost atomically sharp tip is protruding from a cantilever and is scanned over the sample. When the cantilever deflects, a laser beam reflected off the backside of the cantilever will change directions and this will be measured by a photodetector. The laser position can be used to control the force between the tip and the sample, and the AFM is often used to measure both topography and forces on the nanoscale. The resolution is normally down to about 1 nm, but even subatomic resolution is possible. The AFM can work with both dry and wet, conducting and isolating samples.

'''Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM):''' An atomically sharp tip is moved within atomic distance of a sample that has a voltage applied to it. When the tip-sample distance becomes so small that the electron clouds of the tip and sample touch, electrons can much more easily tunnel between the two and this gives rise to a tip-sample current (often a few pA at a 1V bias voltage). This current can be used to maintain a fixed tip-sample distance when the tip is scanned over the sample, and this can give images of conducting surfaces with atomic resolution.

'''Scanning Near-field Optical Microscope (SNOM):''' As electrons can tunnel between electrical conductors in the STM, photons can tunnel between optical guiding structures. The SNOM uses a narrow light guide to measure how the optical electromagnetic field changes as the guide is moved across the sample. For instance, light can be sent from below the sample and then scattered into the scanning light guide above it. The resolution can be much smaller than the wavelength of light.

'''Point-Projection Microscopes:'''  The Field Emission Microscope (FEM), Field Ion Microscope (FIM) and the atom probe are examples of point-projection microscopes where ions are excited from a needle-shaped specimen and hit a detector.  The Atom-Probe Tomograph (APT) is the most modern incarnation and allows a three-dimensional atom-by-atom (with chemical elements identified) reconstruction with sub-nanometer resolution.

=Spectroscopy=
[[w:Spectroscopy| Spectroscopy]] uses spectrometers to tell how radiation interacts with the specimen as function of the energy/wavelength of the radiation

=Diffraction=
[[w:Diffraction| Diffraction]] uses radiation to observe how it is scattered in different directions from the specimen. This can be used to tell about the order of the atoms in the sample.

=Surface analysis=
Many of these methods are used for 'macroscopic' [[w:List_of_surface_analysis_methods| surface analysis]] where the outmost nanometers of a material is being studied over larger areas. The methods can be combined with microscopes to give spectrometrical information from a well defined location on the sample - for instance when doing diffraction measurements in a TEM or level spectroscopy in an STM on a single atom.

[[w:Quantum_mechanics| Quantum mechanics]] and classical mechanics are still valid on the nanoscale - but many assumptions we are used to take for granted are no longer valid. This makes many traditional systems difficult to make on the atomic scale -if for instance you scale down a car the new relation between adhesion forces and gravity or changes in heat conduction will very likely make it perform very poorly if at all - but at the same time a wealth of other new possiblities open up!

[[w:Scaling_law| Scaling laws]] can be used to determine how the physical properties vary as the dimensions are changed. At some point the scaling law no longer can be applied because the assumptions behind it become invalid at some large or small scale.

So, scaling is one thing - the end of scaling another, and surfaces a third! For instance at some point the idealized classical point of view on a system being downscaled will need quantum mechanics to describe what's going on in a proper way, but as the scale is decreased the system might also be very different because the interaction at the surface becomes very significant compared to the bulk.

This part will try to give an overview of these effects.

=Scaling laws=
[[w:Scaling_law| Scaling laws]] can be used to describe how the physical properties of a system change as the dimensions are changed.

[[Image:Scaling in length area and volume.jpg |thumb|300px| The scaling properties of physical laws is an important effect to consider when miniaturizing devices. On the nanoscale the mass and heat capacity become very unimportant, whereas eg. surface forces scaling with area become dominant. 
]]

=Quantized Nano Systems=
[[w:Quantum_wire| Quantum wires]] are examples of nanosystems where the quantum effects become very important.

[[w:Break_junction| Break junctions]] is another example.

Resources
*[http://cnx.org/content/m1000/latest/ Simple model of conduction] - the classical case

=Bulk matter and the end of bulk: surfaces=

*[[w:Surface_states| Surface states]] are electronic states on the surface of a material, which can have radically different properties than the underlying bulk material. For instance, a semiconductor can have superconducting surface states.

*Surface reconstruction
The surface of a material can be very different from the bulk because the surface atoms rearrange themselves to lower their energy rather than stay in the bulk lattice and have dangling bonds extending into space where there is no more material. Atoms from the surroundings will easily bind to such surfaces and for example for silicon, more than 2000 surface reconstructions have been found, depending on what additional atoms and conditions are present.

*Surface plasmons
[[w:Plasmon| Plasmons]] are collective oscillations of the electrons in matter, and the electrons on the surfaces can also make local plasmons that propagate on the surface.


=The Tyndall Effect=
The Tyndall Effect is caused by reflection of light off of small particles such as dust or mist.  This is also seen off of dust when sunlight comes through windows and clouds or when headlight beams go through fog. The Tyndall Effect can only be seen through colloidal suspensions.  A colloid is a substance that consists of particles dispersed throughout another substance, which are too small for resolution with an ordinary light microscope but are incapable of passing through a semi permeable membrane.
The Tyndall Effect is most easily visible through liquid using a laser pointer.  The Tyndall Effect is named after its discoverer, the 19th-century British physicist John Tyndall.&lt;ref&gt;“Tyndall Effect.” Silver Lighting. 1 June 2008.

One way to classify a material is its electronic structure
[[Image:Electronic_structure_of_materials.jpg|left|thumb|300px|
Overview of the electronic structure of the different fundamental classes of materials.

'''Atoms''' have discrete energy levels for each electronic state. Electronic transitions by eg. optical excitation can change the state of the atom.

'''Molecules''' can also have discrete energy levels, but the more complex structure also gives a much more complex diagram of electronic states. In addition, the molecules con rotate and vibrate which modulates the oberserved energy levels.

'''Insulators''' can be seen as a condensed phase of molecules with little electronic connection between neighboring molecules for conducting a current. Only when excitation is made with an energy above the several eV bandgap will conduction be possible.

'''Semiconductors''' have a more narrow bandgap and even at room temperature a few conduction electrons will be excited into the conductance band.

'''Doped Semiconductors''' have higher electrical conductance because added dopants provide conduction electrons.

'''Metals''' can be considered as ionized metal atoms in a sea of free electrons, giving a high conductivity and high reflectivity of light (as long as it is not too high in frequency).

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can't hope to answer the question of whether or not men can be feminists unless you know what a feminist is.  You need a definition.    A set of (female) examples can't answer the question.

It's like asking whether it's possible to be French and have Krangspiel, if you have only German examples.  Unless you know what &quot;Krangspiel&quot; is, you cannot tell whether it is a cultural thing restricted to Germans or a general human emotion that everyone can share.
&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:212.159.16.190|212.159.16.190]] ([[User talk:212.159.16.190|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/212.159.16.190|contribs]]) 22:14, 24 September 2006.&lt;/small&gt;
:I agree. In order to answer this question, we need a definition. I think this section out to be laid out more or less as follows: first a definition, or a discussion of several possible definitions, then an explanation of whether or not by that or those definition(s), men could be feminists, and then a discussion of why some men who hold feminist views and some female feminists may prefer to use or not to use the term 'feminist' to describe a man who otherwise matches the definition, assuming the chosen definition does not inherently exclude men.

:I'm new to this Wikibook (and haven't been around Wikibooks much) so I don't know whether there's a clear definition laid out earlier in the book. In any case, I'm leaving these suggestions in the hope that even if I don't do something about it, someone else will.

:My own reaction to the question is to say that of course men can be feminists. I would define a feminist as someone who believes that people hold different and unequal positions in society based on their genders, that women generally get the short end of the stick compared to men, and that this is a bad situation that needs to change. Said person should also describe themself as a feminist in order to be considered one (mainly in order to avoid associating people with the historical and ideological complexities of the feminist movement when they disavow the connection, though I feel ambivalent about this part of the definition). This is a working definition and would need to be cleaned up to be at all usable in the article, for what it's worth.

Many times under [[Differential_Equations/Homogenous_1#Class_3a:_Purely_Imaginary_Roots|Class 3a]], the claim is made that the general sln to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+\omega^2 y=0&lt;/math&gt;

is

:&lt;math&gt;y=A\sin \omega x+B\sin \omega x \,&lt;/math&gt;

I believe this to be wrong, as you can simplify this to

:&lt;math&gt;y=(A+B)\sin \omega x \,&lt;/math&gt;

leaving yourself with an incomplete sln. I made the edit, then noticed 3 places where this (mistake?) occurs and decided to revert my edit and ask here. I do believe (via mo knowledge of the subject and following the math leading up to the sln) that the correct sln is

:&lt;math&gt;y=A\sin \omega x+B\cos \omega x \,&lt;/math&gt;

Am I missing something, or was this a mistake?

make up cell membranes and these are the very important barriers that control what can enter and exit a cell. The importance can be seen in the fact that one third of all proteins are membrane proteins.

==Cell Energy Supply and Consumption==
The cell organelle the mitochondria is the power plant of the cell energy metabolism.

It synthesises ATP, the basic energy source for numerous processes in cells. The synthesis proces is driven by an electric potential (~150mV) across the mithocondrial inner membrane that is maintained by ion pumps in the membrane that make the outside more acidic while the inner matrix region is more alkaline. The gradient is ~0.5 pH units
&lt;ref&gt;Mitochondrial diseases in man and mouse, Wallace DC, Science, vol. 283 (5407): 1482-1488 MAR 5 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;.
The membrane potential is not homogeneous over the mitochondria

The Chemiosmotic theory of the ATP synthesis was developed by Peter Mitchell in 1961, who was
later rewarded the chemistry Nobel prize for it in 1978.

Current research on Mitocondria was reviewed eg. in Science 28 aug 1998 and 5 mar 1999.

The membrane potential difference is small, but the menbrane is also very thin; approx
5-7nm, giving an electrical field across the membrane of the order 30MV/m - which will make any physicist designnig high energy particle accelerators quite envious - the value is huge compared to electrical fields that would make large scale matter break down. Its is on contrast to the otherwise weak forces normally encountered when talking about the physical properties of lipid membranes. Despite being a thin and soft membrane that can easily be ruptured by mechanical contact, it is capable of withstanding extreme electrical fields.

The membrane potential can be observed by using the fluorescent probe JC-1 -or more verbosely 5,5’,6,6’-tetrachloro-1,1’,3,3’-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide. JC-1 is a lipophilic cation that can penetrate the (lipo)membrane of the cell and mitochondria. JC-1 can be excited by green laser light and emit fluorescent green light at 530nm when it is in a monomeric form, but if the the membrane potential is increased above a threshold around 80-100mV, JC-1 will aggregate and the fluorescense becomes increasingly orange at 590nm

=Fluorescent Markers=
Natural cells and biological structures often have very little contrast when seen in optical microscopes. Take a normal yeast cell and look at it under a microscope and you will only see small balls with no structure. Fluorescent markers and dyes can be used to stain specific substances inside the cell which would otherwise not give an appreciable optical signal. Such markers have for many years been essential to get proper images of biological samples. No matter what type of microscope is used, the fluorescent markers are widely used to enhance the contrast and signal to noise ratio in measurements.

Using fluorescent dyes and recording spectra of light emitted from whole or selected parts of cells can give valuable information &lt;ref&gt;Manfaits webpage on Le Groupement De Recherche 1860 at the Centre National de la recherche scientifique, [http://www-gdr-cpo.univ-troyes.fr/resumes_CFMCP/manfait.html]&lt;/ref&gt;, such as:

*The functional and structural characteristics of normal or malignant cells
*The intracellular dynamics of molecules that are naturally occurring, or added to the cell such as drugs.
*Characterization of the interactions between cells, or the cell and its surrounding media.
*Intracellular dynamics of ions such as Ca++, Mg++, or other important variables such as pH or membrane potentials by using fluorescent markers for the chemicals and potentials under investigation.

The fluorescent markers are used for many other techniques than just microscopy. A method called flow cytometry is very efficient for analyzing large numbers of individual cells. One by one, individual cells pass through a thin channel where they are exposed to the exciting laser light and the emitted fluorescense and absoption is detected by light sensors. The technique gives very good statistical results, but does not allow the detection of eg. individual mithocondria inside a well functioning cell but will rather give an average value of the state of all mithocondria in a single cell.

How will nanotechnology affect our lives - this part will not look in terms of the technological impact such as faster and cheaper computers, but at the very important health and environmental effects that necessarily must be considered.

When will it help cure cancer or and when might it cause it? Will the apparent ecological benefit of a nanoparticle that improves catalytic reactions be futile when we consider the ecological footprint of the nanoaparticles' life cycle? There are many open questions where the search for answers has only just begun!

Nanotechnology has been proclaimed to imply a wealth of potential benefits for society many of which will have direct or indirect positive effects on the environment. Of specific environmental importance is the potential improved efficiency of energy production, reduced energy use of products, reduced use of chemicals due to e.g. functionalization of surfaces, remediation of soil pollution, improved sensoring and monitoring of the environment and improved functionality of materials.

Additionally, principles of green engineering and chemistry are beginning to be integrated into the development of nanomaterials, meaning that nanotechnology may also lead to more environmental beneficial production methods (Schmidt, 2007)
&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmidt3a&quot;&gt;Schmidt, K.: Green Nanotechnology: It's easier than you think. Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. PEN 8 April 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;.

There are a lot of opportunities but as with many other nanotechnologies there is still a large gap from the research labs to manufacturing and real life use of nanotechnological products and solutions.

The focus here will however be at the potential health and environmental impacts.  For a more thorough review of ecopotentials see e.g. Malsch

==Vision==
We hope to use the Wikibooks format to make an Open Source Handbook on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, freely accessible for everyone, that can be updated continuously.

Wikipedia is growing fast and one of the most visited websites on the net – a valuable resource of information we all use.

In science and technology we often need more detailed information than what can be presented in a brief encyclopedic article – and here wikibooks.org, a sister project to Wikipedia, can help us with this newly started handbook.

Though the book is still in its infancy, it has been elected book of the month December 2006, and we hope this will provide PR and more people contributing to the project!

The plan to create the book:

1: First to create smaller articles to ‘cover’ the entire area of nanotechnology and achieve a well defined structure the book (some parts could be revised thoroughly in this process,for instance the materials chapter).

2: Once the structure is reasonably well defined, to begin refining the articles with in-depth material so we reach lecture-note level material.

3: Since everybody can contribute, a continuous contribution of material is expected and a backing group of editors is needed to maintain a trustworthy level of information.

An voluntary editorial board is being put together to oversee the book, support, contribute and follow its development.

Discussion about the content of the book can be found on the main talk page [[talk:Nanotechnology]]

As with Wikipedia, we hope to see a solid information resource continuously updated with open source material available for everyone!

==Editing hints==
===References in Wikibooks===

Add references whenever possible, with reference lists at the end of each page. Please try to make links to the articles with the DOI (digital object identifier) because that gives a uniform and structured access for everyone to the papers.

All papers get a DOI - a unique number like a bar code in a supermarket. All DOIs are registered by [http://www.doi.org www.doi.org] and in the reference list you can add links like [http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b504435a http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b504435a] so people will be able to find it no matter how the homepage of the journal or their own library changes.

The [[#references | References]] section has an example reference.

Add links to the Wikipedia whenever possible - and for the beginning I will rely extensively on Wikipedia's pages on the subjects, simply referring to these. This textbook could be simply a gathering of Wikipedia pages, but an encyclopedia entry is brief, and for a handbook it is preferable to have more in-depth material with examples and the necessary formulas. So, some information in this textbook will be very much like the Wikipedia entries and we might not need to write it in the book but can simply refer to Wikipedia, but the hope is that this will be more a text book as is the intention with Wikibooks.

Multiple references, see [[w:Help:Footnotes]]

===Links===
There's a shorthand way to make links to Wikipedia from Wikibooks:
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Quantum_tunneling|Wikipedia on Quantum Tunneling]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
gives the link [[w:Quantum_tunneling| Wikipedia on Quantum Tunneling]].

===Media===
{{Commons|Nanotechnology}}

==History==
The book was started by [http://kristian.molhave.dk Kristian Molhave ][[User:KristianMolhave|(wiki user page)]] 13. Apr. 2006.
Initially it was named ''Nanowiki'', and later changed to [[Nanotechnology]].
Kristian is currently slowly uploading material to the book and looking for people who would like to contribute that can and substantial material to specific sections under the GNU license.
I hope we can make an 'editorial panel' of people each keeping an eye on and updating specific sections.

The Summer 2008 Duke Talent Identification Program (TIP) eStudies Nanotechnology students will be adding to the content of this Wikibook.  From June-Aug 2008 there will be content additions with references that will add to this great resource.

==Authors and Editors==
*The Opensource Handbook on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology was started by [http://kristian.molhave.dk Kristian Molhave][[User:KristianMolhave|(wiki user page)]]

===Editors===
*An editorial board is currently being organized.

== Support and Acknowledgments ==

Starting this book is supported by the [http://forsk.dk/portal/page/pr04/FIST/FORSIDE/DIVERSE_SIDER/DANISH_RESEARCH_AGENCY Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation] through Kristian Mølhave's talent project ’[http://kristian.molhave.dk/namic NAMIC]’ No. 26-04-0258.

==How to Reference this Book==

I am not currently sure how work on wikibooks or wikipedia can be referenced reliably in published literature.

Three suggestions:

1) Reference the references from the wikibook. Wikibooks are not intended to be the publication channel for new results, but should be based on published and accepted information with references and these references can be used. But this of course does not give credit to the book, so I recommend then adding an acknowledgement about the book to give it PR and credit.

2) Reference the book with a specific page and date - the previous versions of the pages are all available in the history pane and can easily be accessed by future users. You can also hit &quot;permanent version&quot; on the left side of the webpage (it is under &quot;toolbox&quot;). That sends you  specifically to the selected version of the wikipage with a link to it that will never change. 

3) Reference the PDF version and its version number. Once the book achieves a reasonable level, PDF versions will become available for download and they will have a unique version number and can be retrieved.

Other suggestions are most welcome!

==Non-nanotech products and a warning==
Not everything that says nano is nano - and given the hype surrounding nanotechnology you will see an increasing number of 'nano' products that have nothing to do with it. It is worrying when sometimes problems arise with non-nano products and this adds to the 'scare' that is present in the public, fuelled by the newspapers where they are just waiting for a nice scandal... an example was the product [http://www.discover.com/issues/jan-07/features/policy/#36 Magic Nano from a German company] that made a number of users sick when inhaling the aerosol cleaning product - which in the end turned out to have nothing 'nano' in it. There is good reason to be very alert to such issues. Not all countries have legislation in place to secure the consumers against the possible dangers present in nanoparticles and some products could end being marketed before having been tested well enough. Though this example turned out to be 'non-nano', we will probably meet new cases shortly that are truly 'nano'. On this background environmental and health aspects will be an important part of this book.

All ogg files, *after* I have them moved to the commons.wikimedia.org, because all that files will be used by translations of the english chinese lessions.

This applies to all ogg files out of [[Chinese/Lesson_1]]
[[Chinese/Lesson_2]] 
[[Chinese/Lesson_3]] 
[[Chinese/Lesson_4]] 
[[Chinese/Lesson_5]] 
[[Chinese/Lesson_6]] 
[[Chinese/Lesson_7]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Arithmetic is the study of numerical quantities. At least a basic understanding of arithmetic is fundamental in the study of  algebra and many other mathematical studies.

== Basic Operations ==
There are four basic operations one can perform on different numeric quantities (as well as other mathematical objects which you will encounter later). These are:
*addition
*subtraction
*multiplication
*division

== Equals ==

It is also important to understand that the equals sign (in this book, '&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;' ) means that the things on both sides are of equal value, and that &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; is not an operator.

When you see an &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; sign, say to yourself ''Same value, different appearance''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Multiplication ==
Multiplication is denoted by an asterisk (*), &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; sign. However, the “&lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt;” sign is normally not used in algebra, and is instead limited to very basic elementary math, as it can easily be confused with an “x” variable.  The generic multiplication operator will take any two numbers, called factors, as operands. The result is called the product of the two numbers. If the multiplicants are not both written as numbers, the multiplication sign can be left out. Thus, the following example expressions are equivalent: 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3*\!(a*b) = 3 \times \!(a \times b) = 3\! \cdot \!(a \!\cdot \! b) = 3 \!\cdot \!(ab) = 3(a \!\cdot \! b) = 3(ab) = 3ab&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Multiplication is a form of repeated addition.  For example 
&lt;math&gt; 3 \times 5 &lt;/math&gt; means 

&lt;math&gt; 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 \quad \operatorname{or} \quad 5 + 5 + 5 &lt;/math&gt;

Multiplication is also commutative.  This means that the multiplication of two numbers (factors) will give the same product regardless of the order in which the numbers are multiplied together. The following expressions are also equivalent:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3 \!\cdot \!(ab)= a \!\cdot \! (3b) = b \!\cdot \! (3a)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Numbers with exponents&lt;!-- The concept has not been introduced yet! --&gt; that are whole numbers larger than 1 indicate the number of factors to be multiplied, thus that number is multiplied by itself as many times as the exponent shows.  Numbers with an exponent of 1 have only one factor, and therefore are equal to the number.  Any number with an exponent of 0 has no factors at all, and the result is 1.  Examples:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;5^3 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \qquad\qquad 5^1 = 5 \qquad\qquad 5^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Long Multiplication===

''Long Multiplication'' is the multiplication of numbers more than 12, but usually only the facts from 1 through 9 are used&lt;!-- ??? --&gt;. Before you attempt long multiplication, please make sure you know the facts 1 through 9. The others are optional, but makes long division a bit easier. The steps for the vertical multiplication method are:


1. Write the numbers down.

   52
   19
  ------
2. Multiply 9 times 2. If there is a tens place for the answer, regroup. Multiply 9 times 5, add the regroup, and write the numbers down. You should have:

   1
   52
   19
 ------
  468

3. Multiply 1 times 2, and 1 times 5, regrouping if needed, but this time shift the answer one space to the left. If you want to, you can put a zero under the 8 instead. You should now have:

   52
   19
 ------
  468
  520
4. Now add.


  52
  19
 -----
 468
 520
 -----
 988

If you are multiplying decimals, then multiply without the decimal point. Count the number of decimal places in both numbers, and add the number of decimal places. In the answer, count that number of spaces to the left. Put the decimal point there.

5. In a summary:

Write the problem down, vertically. Multiply the last digit of the second number to the last digit of the first number. Regroup if there is a tens place in the answer. Multiply it by the second to last number, and ADD the regroup. Repeat the process for the second to last digit of the second number, but put a 0 at the end of the line under the number you got before, if a third line put 2 0s, and repeat until the problem is done.

===Fast Multiplication===

''Fast Multiplication'' is the method in which you can reasonably multiply numbers greater than 10 and reasonably less than 1000 by simply multiplying by the method of &quot;10's.&quot; This is done by recognizing how many digits there are in the numbers. Here are some steps which are useful for multiplying numbers really fast

1. See if you can recognize any zeros on the end and simply &quot;add them&quot; to your answer.

   45,300 x 5
   The easy way to do this is &quot;taking away&quot; the 2 zeros for now and reserving them for later.
   
   the number is now 453 x 5, which is much too mind boggling to do. 
   Now here comes the interesting part of the method
   of &quot;10's&quot;

2. Break down the number into its &quot;10's&quot; parts
   
   What this means is basically breakup the number by its place value.

   453 = 4 (hundreds place) + 5 (tens place) + 3 (ones place)

   Knowing that, this become 400, 50 and 3.

3. Multiply and apply the &quot;10's part&quot;
  
   okay now simply multiply:

   So, here is a step where we essentially take out the &quot;0's&quot; out for a bit and put it back
   in when were done.

   so, its now 5 x 400. in order to make it easier, &quot;take out&quot; the zeroes for now and 
   multiply 4 x 5 = 20. Now
   heres the magic. Since you magically took away the 2 zeroes, you will now suddenly make
   the 2 zeroes reappear!
   20 + &quot;00&quot; = 2000! AMAZING! (the quotes means they're magic zeroes, and simply not the value 
   of zero!)

   50 is done the same away. Take away the &quot;0&quot; and multiply 5 x 5 = 25. Now add it back, 25 +
   &quot;0&quot; = 250

   Simply 3 x 5 = 15

4. Now abracadabra, Add them all together!

   2000 
    250
     15 
  ----- 
   2265!

5. Now take the two zeroes you reserved in the beginning (from the original 45,300), and tack them onto the end to get your answer: 226,500.

Step 2: Multiplying numbers that are not zero friendly

   2102 x 52

Using the step from before recognize that:

 2102 = 2 (thousand) + 1(hundred) + 0 (tens) + 2 (ones)
   52 = 5 (tens) + 2 (ones)

 Now, to make it easier on yourself, circle the number 2 of &quot;52&quot; and put it in your magic 
 hat. (2)

 Now the problem becomes 2102 x 50. Look familiar? First of all, take out the magic &quot;0&quot; and 
 put it in the hat, too.
 Since we recognized that 50 is basically 5 with an added magical &quot;0&quot; to it, we now see the 
 problem as

 2102 x 5!

 Now break down the bigger, uglier number and start multiplying:
 2000 x 5 (take away the magic zeroes) = 2 x 5 = 10 + &quot;000&quot;(now put them back!) = 10,000 (notice it has 4 zeroes)
  100 x 5 (take away the magic zeroes) = 1 x 5 = 5 + &quot;00&quot;  (now put them back!) =   500 (2 zeroes)
    2 x 5  (sadly, no magical zeroes)  = 2 x 5 = 10                             =    10 (1 zero)

  Remember, after every step, be sure to put your friendly magical &quot;0&quot; back in:
  10,000 + &quot;0&quot; =100,000  
     500 + &quot;0&quot; =  5,000
      10 + &quot;0&quot; =    100
    (notice how the number of zeroes on the left side equal the number of zeroes on the right
    side)

 Now add them all together:

  100000
    5000
     100
  -----
  105100....... That's not all yet folks! Do you remember the 2 in your magic hat? Lets get it to work:

   2 x 2102 = 
       2000 x 2 = 2 x 2 = 4 = 4000
        100 x 2 = 1 x 2 = 2 =  200
          2 x 2             =    4
                      total:  4204

   So the answer should be
    105,100
      4,204
    -------
    109,304! Wow!

To practice this concept, I recommend [http://www.mathplace.com/Developmental/ Developmental Mathematics], volume 8, along with cards to memorize multiplication facts. This is my favorite for developing multiplication skills, but if you prefer something else, try Miquon Math. This is a complete program for grades 1-3 and is an excellent program for developing advanced math skills. Another option is Progress in Mathematics, a standards-based math program for Sadlier-Oxford. Of course, advance multiplication skills until the student/s is doing 5-digit multiplication with ease.

== Division ==
Division uses the ÷ sign.  It may also be signified by the slash(/), :, or the fraction bar.  The generic division operator will take any two numbers as operands.  The number before the ÷ sign is called the dividend and the number after the ÷ sign is called the divisor.  The result is called the quotient of the two numbers.

Division is not a commutative operation.  Switching the dividend and the divisor will likely give a different quotient  [[Algebra/Division_is_not_commutative|(but sometimes not)]]. The division with a divisor of 0 is not defined.  There is no answer for it. 

Example:
*&lt;math&gt;4 / 2 = 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 / 4 = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;

===Long Division===

In [[Wikipedia:arithmetic|arithmetic]], '''long division''' is an algorithm for [[Wikipedia:division|division]] of two [[Wikipedia:real number|real number]]s. It requires only the means to write the numbers down, and is simple to perform even for large [[Wikipedia:dividend|dividend]]s because the [[Wikipedia:algorithm|algorithm]] separates a complex division problem into smaller problems. However, the procedure requires various numbers to be divided by the [[Wikipedia:divisor|divisor]]: this is simple with single-digit divisors, but becomes harder with larger ones.

A more generalized version of this method is used for [[Wikipedia:polynomial long division|dividing polynomials]] (sometimes using a shorthand version called [[Wikipedia:synthetic division|synthetic division]]).

In long division notation,  ''500'' &amp;divide; ''4'' = ''125'' is denoted as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\quad 125\\
4\overline{)500}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The method involves several steps:

1. Write the dividend and divisor in this form: 

:&lt;math&gt;4\overline{)500}&lt;/math&gt; 

In this example, 500 is the dividend and 4 is the divisor.

2. Consider the leftmost digit of the dividend ''(5)''. Find the largest multiple of the divisor that is less than the leftmost digit: in other words, mentally perform &quot;5 divided by 4&quot;. If this digit is too small, consider the first two digits.

In this case, the largest multiple of ''4'' that is less than ''5'' is ''4''. Write this number under the leftmost digit of the dividend. Divide the multiple by the divisor ''(in this case, 4 divided by 4)'' and write the result ''(in this case, 1)'' above the line over the leftmost digit of the dividend.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1\\
4\overline{)500}\\
4
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

3. Subtract the digit under the dividend from the digit used in the dividend (in this case, subtract 4 from 5). Write the result (remainder) (in this case, 1) underneath and in the same column, then drop the second digit of the dividend (in this case, the first zero) to the right of it. This gives you a new number to divide by the divisor.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1\\
4\overline{)500}\\
\underline{4}\\
\;\,10
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

4. Now apply the same steps 2 and 3 to this new number, and write the results in the corresponding columns (in this case, the unit column is aligned with the second digit of the original dividend): multiple and remainder underneath the new number, and the answer above the line.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\,\,12\\
4\overline{)500}\\
\underline{4}\\
\;\,10\\
\quad\underline{8}\\
\quad\;\,20
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

5. Repeat step 4 until there are no digits remaining in the dividend. The number written above the bar is the quotient, and the last remainder calculated is the remainder for the entire problem.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\quad 125\\
4\overline{)500}\\
\underline{4}\\
\;\,10\\
\quad\underline{8}\\
\quad\;\,20\\
\quad\;\,\underline{20}\\
\qquad0
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Order of operations ==
The order of operations is the order in which all algebraic expressions should be simplified. Oftentimes, the meaning of a complex expression changes depending upon the order in which it is calculated. The order of operations is:

::'''P'''arentheses
::'''E'''xponents (and Roots)
::'''M'''ultiplication &amp; '''D'''ivision
::'''A'''ddition &amp; '''S'''ubtraction
This means that expressions within parentheses are evaluated first, then exponents (including roots, i.e. radicals), then multiplication and division (at the same level), and finally addition and subtraction (at the same level).  If there are multiple operations at the same level on the order of operations, move from left to right.

There is a number of different abbreviations for memorizing the order.  PEMDAS, BEDMAS and BODMAS (B is Brackets) are common.  Another common way to remember the order is the mnemonic 

*&quot;Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,&quot; 

with the beginning letters standing for each operation.  Whichever mnemonic you use, be aware that multiplication does '''not''' always come before division, and addition does '''not''' always come before subtraction.  For example:

If you have an expression like 

*3 &amp;times; 3 - 5 + 2 

you work like this:  First notice that, there are no Parentheses or Exponents, so we move to Multiplication and Division.  There's only the one multiplication, so we do that first and end up with 9 - 5 + 2.  Now we move to Addition and Subtraction, working left to right.  So firstly we do the subtraction to get 4 + 2, and finally the addition to give 6.  If we had blindly done the addition first, we would have got the answer 2, which is wrong!

The rationale for the grouping (apart from parentheses, which are obviously first) is that multiplication is repeated addition and exponentiation is repeated multiplication. Also, division is multiplication by the reciprocal and subtraction is addition of the negative, so these operations are equivalent. In fact PEMA would be a better phrase (&quot;Please Excuse My Aunt&quot;), but in lower arithmetic courses MDAS is often taught without explaining reciprocals.

Parentheses are curved symbols, '''(''' and ''')''', that are put around part of an expression in order to convey that the expressions inside them should be evaluated first. Within a set of parentheses, the order of operations should be followed. Square brackets, '''[''' and ''']''', are sometimes used around parentheses to avoid confusion: [(3+5)&amp;times;2]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; means the same as ((3+5)&amp;times;2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The fraction bar and radical bar (often called a vinculum) groups expressions like parentheses.

For example, the expression 2&amp;times;(6+7)-8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; should be solved in the following order:

&lt;table align=center cellspacing=5&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2&amp;times;(6+7)-8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;   {first compute the expression inside the parentheses (6+7)}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; &amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;times;(13)-8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;    {second, calculate the exponent 8&lt;sup&gt;2}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; &amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;times;(13)-64   &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;   {third, calculate the multiplication 2&amp;times;(13)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; &amp;nbsp;= 26-64 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;  {finally, calculate the subtraction}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; &amp;nbsp;= -38   &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;   {our final answer}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
If the desired order for solving the expression were different (based on the initial problem), parentheses would be positioned differently, or even omitted.

The meaning of the fraction and radical bars must be deciphered carefully.  The part of the expression directly below or above the bar is to be treated as parenthesised.  (Care must be taken in writing expressions with a bar.)

The expression &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a + b} \times c&lt;/math&gt; means ''c'' times the root of ''a'' + ''b'', not the root of ''a'' + ''b'' &amp;times; ''c'' or even the root of ''c'' times the sum ''a'' + ''b'', since the bar is above the ''a'' and the ''b'', but not the ''c''.

The expression &lt;math&gt;\frac{4 + 5}{1 + 2}&lt;/math&gt; could be written in one line as &lt;br&gt;(4+5)/(1+2) = 9/3 = 3, not as 4+5/1+2 = 4+5+2 = 11.  As you see, the expression above the bar is evaluated, as is the expression below the bar.  Finally we can divide.

Because of order of operations -2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -(2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = -4, not (-2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = +4: the negative sign can be considered to have an implicit 0 in front, making the expression 0 - 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

When it comes to distributing a power, use the raise a power to a power rule.
Example: (xy^2)to the fourth power (^4)
=(x)^4 (y^2)^4
=x^4&amp;times;y^8 (originally it was y^6; this would only be true for y^2 * y^4, where you add the exponents) 

The order of operations is very important, and you must remember the order when using simple calculators. Expressions such as 2+3 &amp;times; 5 vary on the order used. Entering [2] [+] [3] [&amp;times;] [5] on most calculators would result in adding three to two and then multiplying by five, resulting in 25; the proper evaluation sequence would be 2+(3&amp;times;5), multiplying three and five and then adding that to two to get 17. Some scientific calculators and most graphing calculators use the proper order of operations, but four-function calculators typically use &quot;left-to-right&quot; evaluation, which can return incorrect results.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Fractions ==
A '''fraction''' consists of one quantity divided by another quantity. The fraction &quot;three divided by five&quot; or &quot;three over five&quot;  or &quot;three fifths&quot; can be written as:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{3}{5} &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;or as:    '''3/5'''&lt;/center&gt;

In this section, we will use the notation 3/5.  Note that some fractions have special names.

: 1/2 - Instead of calling this a twoth, or a second, it's called a ''half''.
: 3/4 - As well as three fourths, it can also be called three ''quarters''.

===Numerator and Denominator===
The first quantity, the number on top of the fraction, is called the '''numerator'''.  It tells you the number, or how many of something you've got.  The other number, on the bottom, is called the '''denominator'''.  The denominator tells you the ''denomination'' of the fraction, which is really just a fancy way of telling you the ''type'' of the fraction.  In exactly the same way, we know a £5 note and a £10 pound note are different because they are different types.

So, look at a number like 3/5.  The numerator is 3.  So whatever we've got, we've got three of them.  The denominator is 5, so we've got fifths, whatever they are.  Put the two together, we've got ''three'' of those things called ''fifths''.  We've got three fifths, we've got 3/5.  ''Same value, different appearance''.


Several rules for calculation with fractions are useful:

==Changing the ''type'' of a fraction==
If both the numerator and the denominator of a fraction are multiplied or divided by the same number, then the fraction does not change its value.

&lt;!--If the numerator and denominator are not relatively prime they are both divided by a number that makes them relatively prime.--&gt;

This means we can make some fractions simpler, by making the numbers involved smaller.  When the numbers are as small as possible, the fraction is said to be expressed in its lowest terms, or reduced.  Let's look at an example:  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
4/6 = 2/3.  

&lt;!--Is it usual to use such complicated language on a simple idea?  Do we really need to talk about numbers being relatively prime here?--&gt;

Remember what that ' = ' sign means?  It means that 4/6 and 2/3, although they look different, have the same value.  ''Same value, different appearance''.

This is because 

:::&lt;math&gt; \frac{4}{6} = \frac{4/2}{6/2} = \frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Try it out yourself with a calculator or with long division. From here, there is nothing we can divide both numbers by, so the fraction is reduced, which is our goal. To find out what to divide them by, you need to find a ''common divisor'', which is a number they are both divisible by.

==Mixed fractions==
Sometimes you may meet 'mixed fractions' like &lt;math&gt;1\frac{3}{5}&lt;/math&gt;. This really means &lt;math&gt;1+\frac{3}{5}&lt;/math&gt;, or in words ''one and three-fifths''. Mixed fractions are hard to work with... how would you go about working out the following?

::::&lt;math&gt;1\frac{3}{5} \times 2\frac{2}{7}&lt;/math&gt;

The answer is to convert the mixed fraction into a standard fraction of the form numerator/denominator. For example, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1\frac{3}{5}=1+\frac{3}{5}=\frac{5}{5}+\frac{3}{5}=\frac{8}{5}\,\,\,\,&lt;/math&gt;


and    


&lt;math&gt;2\frac{2}{7}=2+\frac{2}{7}=\frac{14}{7}+\frac{2}{7}=\frac{16}{7}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now, it's simple to multiply the fractions together:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1\frac{3}{5} \times 2\frac{2}{7}=\frac{8}{5} \times \frac{16}{7}=\frac{128}{35}=\frac{105}{35}+\frac{23}{35}=3\frac{23}{35}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Keep in mind that with mixed fractions, the whole number represents the ''quotient'' whereas the fraction represents the ''remainder''.  If you were to divide 25 by 5, you would be left with only 5 (and no remainder).  However, if you were to divide 27 by 5, you would be left with 5 2/5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Adding fractions==
Before we go into fractions, let's have a think about what addition is.  Answer these really simple questions.

*What is 1 bird + 5 birds?
*What is 3 elephants + 9 elephants?
*What is 6 birds + 2 elephants?

Hopefully you could answer the first two, but you might have had trouble with the third.  Why?  Because we can't add up two different things!  However, before we add them up, we can change them into something else.  We can say that 6 birds are also 6 animals, and 2 elephants are also 2 animals, so now

:::6 birds + 2 elephants = 8 animals.

You probably did all this in your head without even thinking about it - so what has it all got to do with fractions?  

To add or subtract two fractions, you first need to change the two fractions so that they have the same type. The simplest way to do this is to multiply the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the denominator of the other. 

For instance, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2 \times 4}{3 \times 4} + \frac{1 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{8}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{(8+3)}{12} = \frac{11}{12}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

A more advanced way is to use the LCM of the denominators, which will be explained later in this section. Then you can add or subtract the numerators and put the common denominator as the denominator of the solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Multiplying fractions==
To multiply two fractions: 
*'''multiply the numerators''' to get the new '''numerator''', and 
*'''multiply the denominators''' to get the new '''denominator'''. 

For instance, 

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2 \times 1}{3 \times 4} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Dividing fractions==
To divide one fraction by another one, flip numerator and denominator of the second one, and then multiply the two fractions. The flipped-over fraction is called the multiplicative inverse or '''reciprocal'''. 

For instance, 

:::&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) / \left(\frac{4}{5}\right) = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{5}{4} = \frac{2 \times 5}{3 \times 4} = \frac{10}{12} = \frac{5}{6}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;!--I don't know how to made the compound fraction look pretty--&gt;
To simplify a compound fraction, like &lt;math&gt;\frac{\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)}{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;, just remember that a fraction is the same as division, and divide (3/5) &amp;divide; (1/4), which comes to 12/5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Absolute value ==
The absolute value of a number is found by applying a simple rule: If you see a negative sign in front of the number, change it to a plus sign. If you see a plus sign, leave it alone.  So, for example, the absolute value of -17 is +17. The absolute value of +36 is +36. 

Another way to understand the absolute value of a number is to think about the number line:

[[image:Real_Number_Line.PNG]]

The absolute value of a number is the distance from zero to that number on the number line. 

The absolute value of x is usually written as |x|. On calculators and computers it is sometimes written as abs (x). 

'''Questions:'''

1. Calculate the absolute value of the following numbers:
: a. -5  
: b. 9  
: c. -3.8   
: d. -139,462  
: e. 5/8

2. What is the absolute value of zero? Explain.

3. Calculate the following:

: a. |27|   
: b. |-1.9|  
: c. |3 - 7|  
: d. |3 - 0.5| 
: e. abs (-6)

4. Draw a graph of abs(x) from -5 to +5.  Can abs(x) ever be less than zero? How can you see that from your graph?

'''Answers:'''

1. a. 5
b. 9
c. 3.8
d. 139,462
e. 5/8

2. Zero, because zero is exactly zero away from zero on the number line.

3. a. 27
b. 1.9
c. |3-7| = |-4| = 4
d. |3-0.5| = |2.5| = 2.5
e. 6

4. [[Media:Absolute value.svg|Image of the absolute value of x]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Radicals ==

&lt;!--Maybe we should bring part of the Exponents section over here before we get into radicals?  Alternately, maybe this isn't the place for discussion of radicals?--&gt;
A '''radical''' is a special kind of number that is the root of a polynomial equation. First, let us look at one specific kind of radical, the &quot;square root&quot;. It is a special kind of number related to squaring.

When we have a number, say 2, what positive number will give us, when we square it, the number 2?

* 1 &amp;times; 1 = 1, so the number must be higher than 1.
* 2 &amp;times; 2 = 4, so the number must be lower than 2.
* 1.5 &amp;times; 1.5 = 2.25, so the number must be lower than 1.5.

We could continue like this forever, and with each step get closer and closer to the answers (this kind of process for refining the answer is called [[../Iteration|iteration]]). The number we are looking for is approximately 1.41421...

Obviously this is very difficult for us to work with, so we have a special notation. We write for a number ''a'', &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a}&lt;/math&gt; to represent the number when squared will give us ''a'' back.

Since this is the inverse operation from squaring, it can also be denoted as a&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;(a^{1/2})^2=a^1=a&lt;/math&gt;.

We can extend this idea to other kinds of radicals. &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{a}&lt;/math&gt; indicates the number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;x^3=a&lt;/math&gt;. For example, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{7}=1.91293...&lt;/math&gt;

Note that it is not possible to find any [[w:Real numbers|real number]] whose square would be negative. Multiplying with a negative number changes the sign of the number being multiplied and two negative signs thus eliminate each other. For example, -7 &amp;times; -7 = 49 and also 7 &amp;times; 7 = 49 . Therefore the square root of a negative number is an undefined operation unless imaginary numbers are allowed as answers.

== Simplifying Radicals ==
To simplify a radical, you look for the largest perfect square factor of the number under the radical.
:&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{162}}&lt;/math&gt;
Once you find a perfect square factor, you can express the number under the radical as the product of two factors.
:&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{81*2}}&lt;/math&gt;
Then you can take the square root of the perfect square factor out of the radical and place it outside.
:&lt;math&gt;9{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
Once you have factored out all perfect square factors, you have simplified the radical.

Here are some practice problems.  Click [[Algebra/Manipulation_of_Radicals#Answers|here]] and scroll to the section labeled '''Simplifying Radicals''' for the answers.
*&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{50}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{392}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{290}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Rationalizing the Denominator ==
&quot;Rationalizing the denominator&quot; is simply taking the roots out of the denominator.  This is needed because it is not proper to leave roots in the denominator.  To rationalize the denominator you simply multiply the numerator and the denominator by the root that is in the denominator.  For example:

&lt;math&gt;{4\over\sqrt{5}}={4\sqrt{5}\over(\sqrt{5})^2}={4\sqrt{5}\over5}&lt;/math&gt;

If you can simplify, do so.

:&lt;math&gt;{10\over\sqrt{5}}={10\sqrt{5}\over(\sqrt{5})^2}={10\sqrt{5}\over5}={2\sqrt{5}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{4\over\sqrt{8}}={{4}\over{\sqrt{(4*2)}}}={{4}\over{2}{\sqrt{2}}}={{4{\sqrt{2}}}\over{2{{{\sqrt{2}}}^2}}}={{4{\sqrt{2}}}\over{4}}=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Here are some practice problems.  Click [[Algebra/Manipulation_of_Radicals#Answers|here]] and scroll to the section labeled '''Rationalizing the Denominator''' for the answers.
*&lt;math&gt;{2\over\sqrt{4}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;{3\over\sqrt{7}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;{11\over\sqrt{72}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;{33\over\sqrt{11}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Applying Operations to Radicals==
===Addition and Subtraction===
Adding and subtracting radicals can only be done when the numbers inside the radicals are the same. For instance, consider the following expression:
:&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{7}+\sqrt{28}}&lt;/math&gt;

You can not add those two terms as they are. However, the following equation simplifies the second term, and you get this:
:&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{7}+\sqrt{4*7}}={\sqrt{7}+2\sqrt{7}}&lt;/math&gt;

These terms can be added (or subtracted, for that matter). Also, coefficients of 1 are usually not written, so:
:&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{7}+2\sqrt{7}}={1\sqrt{7}+2\sqrt{7}}={3\sqrt{7}}&lt;/math&gt;

You can subtract radicals using the same procedure as adding, just instead of adding the coefficients, you subtract them.


The reason we can do this is the distributive property. Proving it is quite simple, and would look like this:
:&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{7}+2\sqrt{7}}&lt;/math&gt;

Remember that coefficients of 1 are not written, so this equation could also be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;{1\sqrt{7}+2\sqrt{7}}&lt;/math&gt;

We then extract the term &lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{7}}&lt;/math&gt; from the expression:
:&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{7}*(1+2)}&lt;/math&gt;

We all know that &lt;math&gt;{1+2}={3}&lt;/math&gt;, so:
:&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{7}*(3)}={3\sqrt{7}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Multiplication and Division===
Multiplying and dividing radicals is quite simple. Multiplication requires very little work. When you are given two radicals to multiply, all you do is multiply the numbers inside the radicals and put the product under a radical. Consider the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{11}*\sqrt{5}}={\sqrt{55}}&lt;/math&gt;

Division is a bit different, however. One way to divide radicals that uses a concept mentioned earlier on this page is to set up the division problem as a fraction. The following equation illustrates this concept using constants (regular numbers):
:&lt;math&gt;{{1}\div{2}}={{1}\over{2}}={0.5}&lt;/math&gt;

The same concept applies to the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;{{\sqrt{10}}\div{\sqrt{3}}}={{\sqrt{10}}\over{\sqrt{3}}}&lt;/math&gt;

You can then rationalize the expression &lt;math&gt;{{\sqrt{10}}\over{\sqrt{3}}}&lt;/math&gt; using the technique found earlier on the page under [[Algebra/Manipulation_of_Radicals#Rationalizing_the_Denominator|Rationalizing the Denominator]]

Here are some practice problems.  Click [[Algebra/Manipulation_of_Radicals#Answers|here]] and scroll to the section labeled '''Applying Operations to Radicals''' for the answers.

*&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{8}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{60}-\sqrt{15}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{13}*\sqrt{7}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;{{\sqrt{17}}\div{\sqrt{5}}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Answers ==

=== Simplifying Radicals ===
*&lt;math&gt;5{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;14{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
*Not Able To Be Simplified

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Estimation ==

Estimation involves working out a rough answer to a calculation. The most common way to estimate a solution to a calculation is to round the numbers up or down to numbers which are easier to calculate with.

An example: Estimate the answer to 99 &amp;times; 9. In this case we can easily see that 9 is almost 10, and multiplying by 10 is really easy, so we can replace our calculation with 99 &amp;times; 10 which is far more easy to calculate. As we rounded a number up we know that our ''estimate'' is going to be larger than the real answer.

Why don't we just call this a guess?  The difference is that a guess is just that, a completely wild guess.  An estimate is based on some extra information.  So whilst you might guess that &lt;br&gt;99 &amp;times; 9 is something around 1000 by just pulling a number out of the air, we estimate that 99 &amp;times; 9 is close to 99 &amp;times; 10, then we work out 99 &amp;times; 10 exactly, which gives 990 as an ''estimate'' of &lt;br&gt;99 &amp;times; 9.

When we estimate, we want our estimate to be close enough to the actual value so as to be useful. (This also applies to approximation.) In our example above, the answer deviates from the actual value by about 10%, which might not be acceptable. Estimation often involves some guesswork, so we might not actually know how accurate our estimate is. (And yes, that figure 10% is itself an estimate.)

A better way to estimate 99 &amp;times; 9 is to say that 99 is close to 100, then we work out 100 &amp;times; 9 exactly, which gives 900 as an ''estimate'' of 99 &amp;times; 9.  This estimate is 1.0101...% off.  The reason this is a better estimate is that 99 deviates from 100 much less than 9 deviates from 10 in percentage terms (although the absolute difference is one in each case).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Conversions between percents, decimals and fractions ==

The perhaps easiest way to convert from:

Decimal to fractions is by simply moving the period over 2 and putting it over a 100

(ex) Express .50 as a fraction

    .500   = 50.0 = 50/100 = 1/2
    . &gt;. (this means the moving of the dot)

usually the best way to set it all up is the following
                              ------------------------------
                             | fraction | Decimal | percent |
                             |    ?     |   ?     |   50%   |
                               ------------------------------
            (move 2 to the right)    &lt;--   x       --&gt;(move dot over 2 to the right)  
               (and put over 100)

 When converting decimal to fraction                  When converting from decimal to percent
 always be sure it has 2 place to the                 this always works   
 right of the (.)                                     ? = 50.% if its not known, do the &quot;reverse&quot;
 (ex)   .5 = .50   = ? =  50                         .50 &lt;--.
             .--&gt;   ---  ---
                    100  100 


When reading decimals, it is similar to verbalizing a fraction.  For example, 0.2 is spelled out as &quot;two-tenths&quot;, hence 2/10, which simplifies to 1/5.  What if you had the real number 0.002?  Same principle: &quot;two-thousandths&quot; implies 2/1000, which reduces to 1/500.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Exponents ==
Exponents or 'powers' are a process of repeated multiplication, in much the same way that multiplication is a process of repeated addition.

Exponents are normally written in the form &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the base and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the exponent. In contexts where superscripts are not available, such as in many contexts in computers, &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt; is commonly written as &quot;a^b&quot; or less often as &quot;a**b&quot;. If you're not familiar with algebra, you can just imagine the letters a and b as representing numbers. We pronounce &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt; as ''a to the power of b'', ''a to the b'' or ''a exponent b''.

===Integer exponents===

When the exponent is a positive integer, then it is just a simple case of multiplying the base by itself a certain number of times. For example,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;3^4 = 3\times3\times3\times3 = 81\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Here, 3 is the ''base'', 4 is the ''exponent'' (written as a superscript), and 81 is 3 ''raised to'' the 4th ''power''.
Notice that the base 3 appears 4 times in the repeated multiplication, because the exponent is 4.

Some more examples:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
12^2=12\times12=144\\
2^8=2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2=256\\
1^5=1\times1\times1\times1\times1=1
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Multiplying exponents====

If you have two or more exponents with the same base, then multiplying them has the same effect as adding their exponents.

For instance &lt;math&gt;(a^b)*(a^c)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;a^{b+c}\,&lt;/math&gt;. For example,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(3^4)*(3^2)=(3*3*3*3)*(3*3)=(3*3*3*3*3*3)=(3^6)=(3^{4+2})\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Dividing exponents====

If you have two or more exponents with the same base, then dividing them has the same effect as subtracting their exponents.

For instance &lt;math&gt;(a^b)/(a^c)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;a^{b-c}\,&lt;/math&gt;. For example,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(3^6)/(3^2)=(3*3*3*3*3*3)/(3*3)=(3*3*3*3)=(3^4)=(3^{6-2})\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==== Exercises ====
# What are &lt;math&gt;4^3\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;3^4\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1^{250}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{250}^1\,&lt;/math&gt;
# Write these numbers as powers of 2: &lt;math&gt;128, 8, 1024\,&lt;/math&gt;
# What is &lt;math&gt;(2^3)*(2^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;
# What is &lt;math&gt;(2^6)/(2^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;
# Harder: Why does &lt;math&gt;3^0=1\,&lt;/math&gt; (clue: think about &lt;math&gt;{3^2}/{3^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;, for example)

====Negative exponents====

Negative exponents work slightly differently. Let's say you want to calculate &lt;math&gt;3^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;. To do that, you take &lt;math&gt;1/3^2&lt;/math&gt; to get your answer. We do the exponent first, see [[Arithmetic/Order_of_Operations|Order of Operations]]

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;3^{-2}=\frac{1}{3^2}=\frac{1}{9}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The commutative property doesn't apply in exponents. See for yourself! Try to calculate 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and then see if it is the same as 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[../Exponents/Answers#commutative|answer here]]). The distributive and associative properties don't apply either.

Exponents do, however, have their own set of axioms that they consistently follow. Consistent with the preceding examples, one can state generally that:

:&lt;math&gt;
(a^b)\times(a^c)=a^{b+c}
\,\,\,\,&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;
(a^b)/(a^c)=a^{b-c}
\,\,\,\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

It's also easy to see that
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
(a^b)^c=a^{b\times c}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Fractional exponents===
So far, we have only seen exponents as whole numbers, but exponents can be fractional as well.  With a fractional exponent, the numerator acts as a normal whole-number exponent, while the denominator acts as a root.

In general,
&lt;math&gt;a^{p/q}=\sqrt[q]{a^p}\,\,\,\,&lt;/math&gt; 
for any real number &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; &amp;ne; 0.

Let's look at &lt;math&gt;8^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt; as an example.  First, we raise 8 to the power of the numerator, 2.  Then, since the denominator is 3, we take the third root of this number.  The expression is read as ''the cubed root of eight squared'', and written as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;8^{2/3}=\sqrt[3]{8^2}=\sqrt[3]{64}=4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

It should then be evident that when the numerator of the fractional exponent is 1, the expression is a simple root.  That is, &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; is a square root, &lt;math&gt;1/3&lt;/math&gt; is a cubed root, &lt;math&gt;1/4&lt;/math&gt; is a fourth root, etc.

For example, &lt;math&gt;9^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; would be read as ''the square root of nine'', and written as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;9^{1/2}=\sqrt[2]{9^1}=\sqrt{9}=3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">To find the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of several numbers, we first express each number as a product of its prime factors.

For example, if we wish to find the LCM of 60, 12 and 102 we write

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
60=2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \\
12=2^2 \cdot 3 \\
102=2 \cdot 3 \cdot 17 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The product of the highest power of each different factor appearing
is the LCM.

For example in this case, &lt;math&gt;2^2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot17=1020&lt;/math&gt;. You can see that 1020 is a multiple of 12, 60 and 102 ... the lowest common multiple of all three numbers.

Another example: What is the LCM of 36, 45, and 27?

Solution: Factorise each of the numbers

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
36=2^2\cdot3^2\\
45=5\cdot3^2 \\
27=3^3
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The product of the highest power of each different factor appearing
is the LCM, i.e.; 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^2\cdot5\cdot3^3=540&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Properties of the LCM====

If the LCM of the numbers is found and 1 is subtracted from the LCM then the remainder when divided by each of the numbers whose LCM is found would have a remainder that is 1 less than the divisor.
For example if the LCM of 2 numbers 10 and 9 is 90.
Then 90-1=89 and 
89 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 9 and the same number divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 8.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) can be found in a similar fashion. In this case, the product of the prime factors common to all the numbers gives the HCF.

For example, if we wish to find the HCF of 60, 12 and 102 we write

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
60=2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \\
12=2^2 \cdot 3 \\
102=2 \cdot 3 \cdot 17 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now the HCF is &lt;math&gt;2 \cdot 3=6&lt;/math&gt;.

Two numbers which have an HCF of 1, for example 12 and 5, are said to be '''coprime''' - they have no factors in common (except 1).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Associative ==
The Associative property of real numbers is: 
&lt;math&gt;(a+b)+c = a+(b+c) &lt;/math&gt; for all real number a,b,c &lt;br&gt;
This implies that the order in which addition is done does not matter. Note however this only applies to addition and not to subtracting numbers.the associative property is easy its like 1,2,3


Multiplication shares the same property. &lt;math&gt; (ab)c=a(bc)&lt;/math&gt; As in addition the groups or the association of the numbers in the parenthesis change. The actual order of the numbers remains the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Logic is the strict following of several simple rules. These rules have to do with persistence and relationships. In logic, a statement can only be '''true''' or '''false''' - there is nothing in between. Following this, a statement can only be formulated so that everyone can state whether it is true or false independently of your relationship with the statement. Lets illustrate this with some examples:
* Statement: ''1 + 1 = 2.''  Value: ''True.'' 
* Statement: ''1 + 1 = 5.''  Value: ''False.'' 
* Statement: ''Jonny is a nice fellow.''  Value: ''There is no logical truth value as it depends on your relationship with Jonny. It is also not clear who Jonny is and what you mean by &quot;nice&quot; (friendly, honest, cooperative or a completely different meaning), so in logic you cannot give a truth value to this statement.

In logic, the truth value of a statement remains unchanged. If a statement is true, it remains true. The truth value of a statement can lead to the truth value of another statement, which in the same way remains unchanged.

Let's take a look at the relationship between two statements named '''p''' and '''q'''.  The relationship is: If '''p''' is true then '''q''' is true too. (p = True =&gt; q = True) Can '''q'''  be false?  Not as long as '''p''' is true. What about when '''p''' is not true? (p = False)  Since '''q''' is only dependent on '''p''' when '''p''' is true then '''q''' is unsolved as long as '''p''' is false.

Relationship 1:
*p = True =&gt; q = True
*p = False =&gt; q = unsolved

If we do not know the result of '''p''' but know the result of '''q''', then can we tell if '''p''' is true or not? If '''p''' is true then '''q''' has to be true, but if '''p''' is not true then '''q''' is unsolved (can be true or not). Following this we can say that if '''q''' is not true then '''p''' can also not be true as a true '''p''' leads to a true '''q''' (p = True =&gt; q = True). If '''q''' is true (q = True) '''p''' can be true but it can also be not true as '''q''' is independent of '''p''' when '''p''' is False. We have now used '''relationship 1''' to set up a new relationship.

Relationship 2:
*q = False =&gt; p = False
*q = True =&gt; p = unsolved

How about the persistence of  p  or  q?

p  is  p.  We know this much. And we know that q is q.  Do we really?  Well can't they change?  We must define these statements as persistent.  If they change, then they are defined as new statements.

==Examples==

What does this mean?  Let's look at some real world statements.  Here are two:

The sky is blue.
The water is blue.

Now if the sky is blue, then is the water blue?  Well in many natural areas this is the case, however in many natural areas, the water is muddy and brown or glacial and green and even these colors are a matter of perspective.  Some might say that the water is clear and any color in the &quot;water&quot; comes from something that is not H2O at all.  There are too many assumptions and conditions to state any useful logical relationship about these two statements except that they do not necessarily &quot;follow&quot; one another logically.

Here are two different statements:

The sky is blue.
There are no clouds in the sky.

Does one of these statements follow from the other?  I'll suggest that in order to be certain of something we must assume that we are in the day without special circumstances such as a dust storm, volcanic ash haze, or a solar eclipse.  Then I can safely say that:

If there are no clouds in the sky then the sky is blue.
If  p  then  q.

What about the other way around?

If  q  then  p.
If the sky is blue, then there are no clouds in the sky.

I don't think that works.  Have you ever seen a brilliant blue sky and one cloud in the sky at the same time?  Sure!  So  p  doesn't follow  q.  But  q  does indeed follow  p  (under our special assumptions about volcanoes and such).

What about if  q  is false?  Is  p?

If the sky is not blue, then there are clouds in the sky.

Yes!  This seems to ring true in all cases.  (Again under our special assumptions.)
Logicians call this statement the contrapositive of the first statement.

Statement:
If  p  then  q.

Contrapositive:
If not  q  then not  p.

==Statements==
There are four types of statements in logic. A bar over a letter negates the statement. For example, ''&quot;My name is Tristan&quot;'' would become ''&quot;My name is '''not''' Tristan&quot;''. The four types of statements are the:

*Statement: '''p''' implies '''q'''
:&lt;math&gt;p \to q&lt;/math&gt;
*Contrapositive: not '''q''' implies not '''p'''
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{q} \to \bar{p}&lt;/math&gt;

*Converse: '''q''' implies '''p'''
:&lt;math&gt;q \to p&lt;/math&gt;
*Inverse: not '''p''' implies not '''q'''
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{p} \to \bar{q}&lt;/math&gt;

The statement and contrapositive are said to be &quot;logically equivalent&quot;. The converse and inverse are also logically equivalent. What this means is that if the statement is true, the contrapositive is also true. The converse and inverse are not necessarily true, but can be. Here are some basic statements to illustrate this:

p = '''Today is New Year's Day.'''&lt;br&gt;
q = '''Today is a holiday.'''

The statement, which is &lt;math&gt;p \to q&lt;/math&gt;, would read, &quot;If '''Today is New Year's Day''', then '''Today is a holiday'''&quot;.

The contrapositive, &lt;math&gt;\bar{q} \to \bar{p}&lt;/math&gt; is also true, &quot;If '''Today is not a holiday''', then '''Today is not New Year's Day'''&quot;.

In this case, the converse, &lt;math&gt;q \to p&lt;/math&gt;, is not true. It would read, &quot;If '''Today is a holiday''', then '''Today is New Year's Day'''.

Since the converse and the inverse are logically equivolent, the inverse, &lt;math&gt;\bar{p} \to \bar{q}&lt;/math&gt; is not true, either. It reads, &quot;If '''Today is not New Year's Day''', then '''Today is not a holiday'''&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Counting Principle==

Before we can delve into the properties of probability and odds, we need to understand the '''Counting Principle'''. We use the Counting Principle to determine how many different ways one can choose/do certain events. It is easier to define the Principle through examples:

===Independent Events===
Let's say that John is at a deli sub restaurant. There are 3 different breads, 3 different cheeses, 3 different condiments, and 3 different vegetables he can place on his sandwich, assuming that he can only place one from each category on to his sandwich. How many different ways can he set up his sandwich?

Since choosing a cheese doesn't affect the amount of choices of vegetables, condiments, or bread, these events are called '''independent events'''. For this problem, we will multiply 3 by 3 by 3 by 3, so &lt;math&gt;3^4&lt;/math&gt;, which is 81. So there are 81 different possible combinations to form this sandwich. 

====Practice Problems====

1) Thomas goes to a McDonalds' restaurant and chooses to create his own burger. He has 2 different kinds of cheese, 3 different breads, and 3 different sauces he can choose from, but he can only choose one of each category. How many different ways can he create this burger?

2) Diane is ordering pizza for her family. There are 4 different possible sizes of the pizza. Also, she has to choose one of 5 toppings to place on the pizza and one of 3 different types of cheese for the pizza. In addition, she must choose one of 3 different kinds of crust. How many different ways can she have her pizza?

3)a) How many 3-digit numbers can be formed from the digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9?

b) How many of these numbers are less than 400?

====Answers====

1) &lt;math&gt;(2)(3)(3) = 18&lt;/math&gt;

2) &lt;math&gt;(4)(5)(3)(3) = 180&lt;/math&gt;

3) a) Since there are six available digits, the answer is &lt;math&gt; (6)(6)(6) = 216 &lt;/math&gt;

b) For the value of the 3-digit number to be less than 400, we only have two choices for the first digit, namely 2 or 3. After that we can choose the other two digits freely. The answer is thus &lt;math&gt; (2)(6)(6) = 72 &lt;/math&gt;.

===Dependent Events===

Assume that John is now working at a library. He must put 5 books on a shelf in any order. How many different ways can he order the books on the shelf? Unlike the independent events, when John puts a book on the shelf, that eliminates one book from the remaining choices of books to put next on the shelf; thus these are referred to as '''dependent events'''. At first, he has 5 different choices, so our first number in the multiplication problem will be 5. Now that one is missing, the number is reduced to 4. Next, it's down to 3, and so on. So, the problem will be

&lt;math&gt;(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)&lt;/math&gt;

However, there is a symbol for this very idea. A ''!'' represents the term ''factorial''. So, for example, &lt;math&gt;3! = (3)(2)(1)&lt;/math&gt;. Factorials are very useful in statistics and probability.

Therefore, the problem can be rewritten as 5!, which ends up being equal to 120.

However, not all dependent event problems are that simple. Let's say that there are 10 dogs at a dog competition. How many different ways can one select the Champion AND the Runner-Up? This problem could actually be considered simpler than the last one, but it doesn't involve a factorial. So, how many different ways can the judge determine the Champion? Of course, there are 10 different dogs, so 10 different ways. Next, how many dogs are left to select the Runner-Up from? Well, you removed one, so it's down to 9. Instead of placing a factorial, though, you will only multiply 10 and 9, resulting in 90.

===Independent Or Dependent?===

To help you differentiate between the two, we will do a few more examples, but we will have to decide if it is dependent or independent before solving the problem.

Let's say that you are creating a 5-digit garage door opener code (the digits would include 0-9). If there were absolutely no restrictions, would the events be independent of each other or dependent on each other? Of course, there are no restrictions, since you could have five 4's for the code, so to solve the problem, you multiply 10 by itself 5 times, resulting in 100000.

Alternatively, suppose that the first number of the code cannot be 0, and that there can be no repeated numbers whatsoever. Obviously these events are dependent on each other, because there cannot be any repetitions. Let's look at this problem one number at a time.

The first number can be all the numbers except 0, reducing the possible amount to 9.
The second number '''can''' be 0 this time, so the possible amount returns to 10. However, it cannot be a repeat of the previous number, so there are 9 possible choices again.
After that, the numbers will reduce by one each time, due to the fact that there cannot be repeats, so the problem would look like this

&lt;math&gt;(9)(9)(8)(7)(6) = (9)(9!)/(5!) = 27216&lt;/math&gt;

Now, just one more example. Let's say that you were choosing your schedule for school. There are 8 periods each day, and there are 7 classes to choose from. Nonetheless, you must have a lunch period during the 4th period. We can think of 4th period as non existent because it is in a constant position and therefore does not affect the possible choices. With 7 slots and 7 options, the answer is simply 7!.

&lt;math&gt;(7!) = 5040&lt;/math&gt;

===Review Of The Counting Principle===

So, we use the Counting Principle to determine the different unique ways we can do something, such as a sandwich or a selection of classes. Sometimes, these events will affect each other, such as when you can't choose the same number twice for your garage door code, so they are dependent events. However, other times, one event has no effect on the next event, such as when you have different cheeses and breads to choose for your sandwich, so they are independent events. The Counting Principle is a fundamental mathematical idea and an essential part of probability.

== Counting Rules ==

'''Rule 1:''' If any one of ''K'' mutually exclusive and exhaustive events can occur on each of ''N'' trials, there are ''K^N'' different sequences that may result from a set of such trials.
Example: Flip a coin three times, finding the number of possible sequences. N=3, K=2, therefore, K^N =2^3=8

'''Rule 2:''' If K1, K2, ....KN are the numbers of distinct events that can occur on trials 1,....''N'' in a series, the number of different sequences of ''N'' events that can occur is (K1)(K2)...(KN).
Example: Flip a coin and roll a die, finding the number of possible sequences. Therefore, (K1)(K2) = (2)(6) = 12

'''Rule 3:''' The number of different ways that ''N'' distinct things may be arranged in order is N! = (1)(2)(3)....(N-1)(N), where 0! = 1. An arrangement in order is called a permutation, so that the total number of permutations of ''N'' objects is N! (the symbol N! Is called N-factorial).
Example: Arrange 10 items in order, finding the number of possible ways. Therefore, 10! = 10x9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 = 3,628,800

'''Rule 4:''' The number of ways, ''N'', of selecting and arranging ''r'' objects from among ''N'' distinct objects is: N!/(N-r)!, or as seen on calculators, [nPr].
Example: pick 3 things from 10 items, and arrange them in order. Therefore N=10, r=3, so 10!/(10-3)! = 10!/7! = 720

'''Rule 5:''' The total number of ways of selecting ''r'' distinct combinations of ''N'' objects, irrespective of order (ie order NOT important), is: N!/r!(N-r)! or as seen on calculators, [nCr].
Example: Pick 3 items from 10 in any order, where N=10, r=3. Therefore, 10!/3!(7!) = 720/6 = 120

'''''What is Fluid Mechanics?'''''

Fluid mechanics is the study of the forces on and between, and the energy and motion of, fluids. The solution to essentially any problem involving fluids--whether the design of a sprinkler system, a dam, or common fresh water and sewage house piping, for instance--requires knowledge of fluid mechanics. Fluid mechanics is composed of two subfields:  fluid statics, which is the study of fluids at rest; and fluid dynamics, which is the study of fluids in motion. Before we discuss these two fields in detail, however, it is obligatory for us to delve into several rudimentary yet imperative concepts and definitions. 

'''''Definition of a Fluid'''''

A fluid is defined as a collection of molecules where the molecules conform to the shape of their container.  Thus, both liquids and gases can be defined as fluids. In contrast, solids tend to retain their shape and hence do not conform easily upon changes in container shape. Obviously, water, oil, and mercury are all examples of fluids; by contrast, steel piping, concrete, and glass are all obvious examples of solids.

'''''Useful properties of fluids'''''

There are several properties of fluids which are integral in the study of fluid mechanics, the most important of which is specific weight (γ). γ is defined as the weight of the fluid divided by its volume; hence, it has the units, in SI, &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{N}{m^3} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;; in English units, γ is in &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{lb}{ft^3} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;. The weight of a fluid (or of a solid, for that matter) is 


&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}=Mg&lt;/math&gt;


where w is weight, M is mass, and g is the gravitation constant. The units of g in SI are &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{m}{s^2} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;, and in English units g is in &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{ft}{s^2} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, γ is equal to


&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\gamma}=\begin{matrix} \frac{w}{V} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;


where V is the volume, which is not to be confused with velocity, which we will define later as v. Another important fluid property is density (ρ), which is defined as the mass of a fluid per unit volume. 


&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\rho}=\begin{matrix} \frac{M}{V} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;


Its units in SI and English are &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{kg}{m^3} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{slugs}{ft^3} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The relationship between density and specific weight is a rather obvious one which the scrupulous reader will no doubt discover quickly:


&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\gamma}=\boldsymbol{\rho}g=\begin{matrix} \frac{Mg}{V} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;


since, obviously, the weight divided by the volume is equivalent to the mass times g divided by the same volume of fluid.



'''''Pressure'''''

The pressure on or due to a fluid is defined as the force exerted divided by the area on which it is exerted. Mathematically, we define pressure to be :

&lt;math&gt;P = \begin{matrix} \frac{\mathbf{F}}{A} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The units of pressure are pascals (Pa); one pascal is equal to &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{1N}{m^2} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Pressure will form the basis of our first detailed study of fluid mechanics, fluid statics.

== ''Fluid Statics'' ==


Fluid statics, as mentioned previously, is the study of fluids at rest. The pressures being incurred by the sides of a dam holding back non-moving water, for example, could be derived via fluid statics concepts.

There are a few aspects of pressure which we will discuss in this section, which all relate to the question of how pressure changes and acts in a static pool of fluid. For example, we wish to be able to answer questions such as:  how many pascals of pressure would there be at a depth of 5 meters of water? Additionally, we would like to be able to make conclusions about the directions in which the fluid pressures acts; for instance, is the pressure on a diver at 5 meters acting upwards equivalent to the pressure on the said diver acting downwards? Furthermore, does the amount of water above the diver affect the pressures the diver will experience? In other words, does the pressure at the bottom of an 8 cm glass with a radius of 1 cm equal the pressure at the bottom of an 8 cm glass with a radius of 8 cm? We begin our discussion with a review of elementary physics.

(As an aside, it is generally assumed that a 'boldface' symbol or letter indicates a vector. In this case, however, boldface is used to emphasize and is not necessarily indicative of a vector.)

'''''Newton's Laws, revisited'''''

Isaac Newton's first and second laws are shown below in mathematical form.

For all objects:


&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=M\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of the object and M is the mass of the object. Therefore, when an object is under no external force, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; must be zero. Hence, in that particular case:


&lt;math&gt;\sum\mathbf{F_x}= \sum\mathbf{F_y} = \sum\mathbf{F_z}=0&lt;/math&gt;


In fluid statics, of course, we assume that the fluid in question is at rest with respect to its surroundings--and hence &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is zero and the sum of all the forces in each direction must be, as shown above, zero.

We imagine an arbitrary cube of fluid in the middle of a static pool of fluid as shown in Figure 1. We label the unknown pressures acting upon this cube as shown in Figure 1. Let us set the pressures labeled with a &quot;1&quot; to be in the 'positive' directions, and those labeled with a &quot;2&quot; we'll let act in the 'negative' directions. Note that these signs are arbitrary and if switched would produce exactly the same result. We will assume that the fluid does not compress due to the pressures acting on it.


[[Image:fluids.jpg|thumb|450px|'''Figure 1''':  ''An arbitrary static cube of fluid''.]]

Thus, we have six pressures:  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_{1x}}, \mathbf{P_{2x}}, \mathbf{P_{1y}}, \mathbf{P_{2y}}, \mathbf{P_{1z}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_{2z}}&lt;/math&gt; (only some are shown in the figure). Each of these pressures act upon a face of the cube. Of course, the depth of this cube is arbitrary, so we must redefine each of these pressures to some arbitrary pressure at the center of the cube, which we will label &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_A}&lt;/math&gt;.


Each of these pressures can be related to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_A}&lt;/math&gt; via the change in pressure from the center point (A) to each of the surfaces. For &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_{1x}}&lt;/math&gt;, for example, the change in pressure is equal to the partial derivative of the pressure with respect to the x direction times the distance between A and the surface on which &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_{1x}}&lt;/math&gt; acts:


&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\delta P_X} = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial x}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\delta P_X}&lt;/math&gt; is the change in pressure between point A and the surface one which &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_{1x}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P_{2x}}&lt;/math&gt; act. &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\delta X}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right )&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from A to either surface.  Changes in pressure in the Y and Z directions are similarly found:


&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\delta P_Y} = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial y}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right )&lt;/math&gt; 


&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\delta P_Z} = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial z}\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;





Keeping with the usual convention of assuming 'right' is positive, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P_{2x}}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_A}&lt;/math&gt; plus the change in pressure:


&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P_{2x}}=\boldsymbol{\delta P_X} + P_A = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial x}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) + P_A&lt;/math&gt;


Similarly, the change in pressure is negative for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_{1x}}&lt;/math&gt;:


&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P_{1x}}=-\boldsymbol{\delta P_X} + P_A= -\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial x}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) + P_A&lt;/math&gt;


Of course, all of the other pressures can be derived in the same way. Here we assume--remember, though it's arbitrary the opposite sign assignment would produce the same result--that &quot;up&quot; in the Y direction and &quot;out&quot; from the monitor in the Z direction are both positive:


&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P_{1y}}=-\boldsymbol{\delta P_Y} + P_A = -\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial y}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) + P_A&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P_{2y}}=\boldsymbol{\delta P_Y} + P_A = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial y}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) + P_A&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P_{1Z}}=-\boldsymbol{\delta P_Z} + P_A = -\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial z}\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) + P_A&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P_{2Z}}=\boldsymbol{\delta P_Z} + P_A = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial z}\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) + P_A&lt;/math&gt;


Now that we have derived the pressures on each face of the cube, we seek to use Newton's Laws to solve for pressure. We know that the total force on the cube must be equal to its mass times its acceleration. However, we began this derivation assuming that the cube was static. Hence, 


&lt;math&gt;\sum\mathbf{F_T}= 0&lt;/math&gt;


Since we now know the pressures, we can find the forces acting on each face. The force acting in the positive X direction, for instance, is equal to


&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_{1x}}=(\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}) \mathbf{P_{1X}}=\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}(\frac{-\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial x}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) + P_A)&lt;/math&gt;


Since, remember, 


&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = PA&lt;/math&gt;


Here, of course, taking a look at Figure 1 it becomes apparent that


&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}=A&lt;/math&gt;


Using the same method, we state that  


&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_{2x}}=(\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}) \mathbf{P_{2X}}=\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial x}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) + P_A)&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore, we can sum the forces in the X direction to get


&lt;math&gt;\sum\mathbf{F_X}= 0 = \boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial x}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) + P_A) - 
\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}(\frac{-\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial x}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) + P_A)&lt;/math&gt;



&lt;math&gt;0=\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial x}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) + P_A + 
\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial x}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) - P_A&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;0=\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial x}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right )+ 
\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial x}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;0=\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial x}\boldsymbol{\delta V}&lt;/math&gt;


where the &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\delta}&lt;/math&gt; symbol means 'a small amount', and hence &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\delta V}&lt;/math&gt; means 'a little volume'.


Note that in this simple equation lies a partial answer to one of our initial questions. We sought to determine the way in which pressure changes. The above equation tells us that the product of the volume of a cube of fluid and the change in pressure in the X-direction is always zero. Assuming that the volume of our arbitrary cube is nonzero, this means that the change in pressure in the X-direction must be zero! The significance of this is greater than you may think. Personal experience tells us that the pressure we feel when diving in a pool depends upon our depth, not our position in the pool. We know from experience that the pressure at the bottom of a pool at one end doesn't feel any different from the pressure at the bottom of the same pool at the other end. Yet, without such experience we may never come to realize this aspect of our world. Using fairly simple logic and mathematics, however, we can not only prove such hypotheses, we can predict them accurately even without direct experience or data. 


Moving on to finishing our proof, we can sum the forces in the Z direction in exactly the same way we did for the X-direction. This is because the only two forces acting in the Z-direction are opposing forces due to pressure. As in the X-direction, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_A}&lt;/math&gt; cancels out and we are left with a similar equation: 


&lt;math&gt;0=\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial z}=\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial z}\boldsymbol{\delta V}&lt;/math&gt;


Hence, the change of pressure in the Z-direction in a pool of water must be zero. I suggest to the reader to derive the above if she is not fully convinced of it.

At first we may be tempted to claim that the derivation of pressure for the Y-direction would be essentially the same as in the X- and Z-directions. However, the careful reader will have noticed that in Figure 1 the weight of the fluid has not been neglected. The weight of the fluid is equal to the specific weight times the volume:



&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\boldsymbol{\gamma}=\boldsymbol{\delta V \gamma}=\boldsymbol{W}&lt;/math&gt;


This is because specific volume, you will remember, is equal to the weight divided by the volume. Therefore, multiplying the specific weight by the volume gives weight. 


Therefore, the sum of the forces in the Y direction reveals the following equality:



&lt;math&gt;\sum\mathbf{F_Y}= W =\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\boldsymbol{\gamma}=    \boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial y}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) + P_A)  
-\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}(\frac{-\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial y}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) + P_A)&lt;/math&gt;


The pressure at A once again cancels out, and we have



&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\boldsymbol{\gamma}=\boldsymbol{\delta Z}\boldsymbol{\delta Y}\boldsymbol{\delta X}\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial y}\boldsymbol{\delta V}&lt;/math&gt;


Hence, we can cancel out the small volume and we have


&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\gamma}=\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{P}}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt;


Now (finally!!) we can derive the equation for pressure. Multiplying by the derivative of y and integrating, we have


&lt;math&gt;\int_{P_1}^{P_2} dP=\int_{y_1}^{y_2} \boldsymbol{\gamma}dy&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Delta P}=(y_2-y_1)\boldsymbol{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore, the change in pressure between two point in a static fluid is equal to the product of the specific weight of the fluid and the change in depth of the fluid. There are, therefore, two laws we can state regarding fluid statics:


'''''1. Pressure only changes with respect to the depth of a fluid; no other dimensional change affects pressure.'''''

'''''2. Since a point in a static fluid must have no net force acting upon it, pressure acts equally from all angles.'''''


Generally, fluid mechanics problems assume a reference pressure which is equivalent to atmospheric pressure. This is because, since pressure is always measured as a change, it becomes more practical to let atmospheric pressure equal zero, and hence measure all other pressures with respect to this reference pressure. This is called the 'gauge pressure'. For example, if one wants to measure the pressure at the bottom of a lake, it becomes easier to let the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the lake be zero, and therefore the pressure at some depth of the lake is


&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}=(h)\boldsymbol{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;


Here, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the reference line of the system, which in the case of a lake, for instance, would be the distance from the surface of the water. The 'absolute pressure', on the other hand, is a pressure which is measured from a reference value of zero. In other words, in this case it would include the atmospheric pressure being imparted on the surface of the lake.



'''Example Problem 1''':''Finding the pressure in a tube of water.''


[[Image:Fluidsexample1.jpg|thumb|700px|'''Figure 2''':  ''Tank and tube setup''.]]


Consider the tank and tube setup to the right in Figure 2. Unless we state otherwise, let us assume that every pressure is a gauge pressure. Find the following:


&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{i)}&lt;/math&gt; The pressure at point A, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_A}&lt;/math&gt;.


''Solution'':  

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_A}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h_A}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific weight of the fluid--in this case, water. Hence,

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_A}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;2(9.8)\left ( \frac{KN}{m^3} \right )m&lt;/math&gt;  

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_A}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;19.6\left ( \frac{KN}{m^2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_A}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;19.6  \mathbf{KPa}&lt;/math&gt;




&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ii)}&lt;/math&gt; The pressure at point B, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_B}&lt;/math&gt;.


''Solution'':  

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_B}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{h_A}+\mathbf{h_B}]\mathbf{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_B}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;3(9.8)\left ( \frac{KN}{m^3} \right )m&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_B}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;29.4\left ( \frac{KN}{m^2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_B}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;29.4  \mathbf{KPa}&lt;/math&gt;



&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{iii)}&lt;/math&gt; The absolute pressure at point C, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_c}&lt;/math&gt;.


''Solution'':

The absolute pressure at point C is the atmospheric pressure, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{P_0}&lt;/math&gt;




&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{iv)}&lt;/math&gt; The absolute pressure at point B, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_b}&lt;/math&gt;.


''Solution'':  

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_b}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{h_A}+\mathbf{h_B}]\mathbf{\gamma} + \mathbf{P_0}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_b}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;3(9.8) + 101\mathbf{KPa}\left ( \frac{KN}{m^3} \right )m&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_b}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;130.4\left ( \frac{KN}{m^2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P_b}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;130.4  \mathbf{KPa}&lt;/math&gt;



'''Example Problem 2''':''Finding the minimum length of the pipe 'r' needed if no water is to leak from the system.''

[[Image:Fluidsexample2.jpg|thumb|380px|'''Figure 3''':  ''Finding the length of pipe 'r' needed to ensure that no water leaks from the end of the pipe''.]]


A designer of some type of canister wants to know the minimum length of the pipe 'r', as shown in Figure 3 to the right, that she will need to buy in order to ensure that no water leaks from the system. In addition, she tells you that the pressure at the bottom of the canister is a constant &lt;math&gt;466\mathbf{KPa}&lt;/math&gt;. Find the least amount of piping 'r' that she must buy.

The bomb comes from the shot glass dropping into another glass such as an [[Bartending/Cocktails/Irish Car Bomb|Irish Car Bomb]] or a [[Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary#J|Jäger Bomb]] or a [[Bartending/Cocktails/Boilermaker|Boilermaker]].  This is a much more pleasant bomb drink as it does not need to be chugged to prevent curdling and has a pleasant taste.  The dropped shot means the rum does not mix very much and is the last element of the drink tasted, giving it a unique aftertaste.  It is a fun drink to watch being made, and its clear appearance from the white rum and clear flavored vodka means its appearance matches that of much stronger and more acquired taste drinks such as martinis.

===Ingredients===

* 1 1/2 oz. Green Apple Vodka (Smirnoff)
* 1 1/2 oz. Watermelon Rum (Bacardi Grand Melon)
* 7-Up

===Garnishes===
*1 maraschino cherry
*optional:
**sugar for rimming the glass
**lime or lemon wedge for the rim

==Glass==
* Collins glass (aka longdrink)
* shot glass

==Procedure==
* Rim Collins glass with sugar(optional).
*Build (or shake if using warm ingredients) Vodka and 7-Up in a Chilled Collins (longdrink) glass about half full.
*Pour Rum in a shot glass.
*Drop the shot glass into the Collins Glass.  To prevent spilling cup  one hand over the glass as the other hand drops the shot glass.  A [barmat] is a nice tool for this stage.
*Drop the cherry into the glass so it falls into the shot glass (it thus displaces some of the rum and begins slightly mixing the cocktail).
*Fill the Collins glass the rest of the way with ice and/or 7-Up.
*(optional place wedge of lemon or lime on the rim of the collins glass)

==Variations==
* Replacing the watermelon rum with melon liquor such as midori adds a bright green color to the drink
* Adding a small layer of cherry juice to the bottom of the shot glass adds a little color to the drink
* Adding a second shot of regular vodka to make it a &quot;double strength&quot; or &quot;extra strength&quot; Melon Bomb

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

Not meaning to rock the boat, but trigger systems, as they're explained here, don't actually exist in natural languages.  I think they only exist as conlangs, actually (I have one too).  The trigger systems of Austronesia don't actually seem to be anything more than languages with multiple passive formation and applicativization strategies.  The &quot;trigger&quot; isn't actually unmarked, it's simply in the case that the subject of an intransitive verb is put into.  The morphology doesn't mark the role of the verb, per se, but merely marks what role the new subject played in the &quot;underived&quot; sentence.  It would be something like the following:

&lt;u&gt;English:&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct Object Passive: I ate a hamburger. -&gt; A hamburger eat-PASS1 by me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indirect Object Passive: I gave you a flower. -&gt; You give-PASS2 a flower by me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepositional Object Passive: I walked into a store. -&gt; A store walk-PASS3 by me.  (Prepositional information lost.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

As it so happens, the form of the passive is the same for all three in English.  They could very well be different, to give the hearer more information about the role of the subject (since its case is invariant).  If you add in applicatives, which English doesn't have, you have a wealth of verbal morphology that tells what the role of the subject is.

So, the &quot;trigger&quot; actually is the syntactic subject--just the way the raised patient of a passive is the subject of the sentence.  And these languages do have passive morphology--extensive passive morphology.  The notion of the &quot;trigger&quot; language, then, is something exclusive to conlangs.

For example, one could create a language like the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verb: maka &quot;eat&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject Trigger: makana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object Trigger: makasi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indirect Object Trigger: makalo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genitive Trigger: makava&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adessive Trigger: makawe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allative Trigger: makatu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abessive Trigger: makaje&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ablative Trigger: makazo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inessive Trigger: makapi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illative Trigger: makaha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Etc.

In other words, a language with a whole bunch of cases that are simply marked on the verb, and in order to use one of these cases, the case must be used with the subject of the verb.  This kind of language doesn't exist in the wild, but, given the idea of &quot;trigger languages&quot;, there's no reason why it shouldn't.

The point of this post is the following:

&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To suggest that trigger languages, as they're described, do not exist naturally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To suggest that such trigger languages exist as conlangs only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To suggest that this should be noted on this page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I don't mean to suggest that the trigger conlang is a bad thing (as I said, I have one myself), only that it isn't necessarily a representation of something that's naturally occurring.

==What's wrong?==

You've enumerated a list of items using markers such as &amp;quot;First,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Second,&amp;quot; and so on, but they aren't consistent. Use ''first, second, third'' or ''firstly, secondly, thirdly''; don't mix them.

==How to fix this problem==

Use consistent enumerators

If two of the enumerators are separated by a lengthy passage, consider reminding the reader what's being enumerated, as in the following example:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Spreadsheets ====
The spreadsheet program summarizes information from many paper sources in one place and presents the information in a format to help a decision maker see the financial &quot;big picture&quot; for the company. Over half of financial management reporting is performed with spreadsheets.

Because of the ease of use, flexibility, and power of spreadsheets, they support many critical business functions and often fill roles where other solutions would be too slow or costly to implement. Years ago accountants and payroll specialists used to input all of their information into long hardcopy documents.  Now companies can get the work done with half the amount of staff.

Philip Howard (2005-04-22). Managing spreadsheets. IT-Directors.com. Retrieved on 2006-06-29.

Spreadsheets have come a long way over the years and are more user friendly so more people use them – not just accountants. Because of the large number of mechanical calculations that must be performed, payroll was one of the first functions to be computerized in most organizations.  

Software packages allow users to create a large worksheet in which data and formulas can be entered to perform a variety of calculations and analysis. People used to have to work on multiple spreadsheets at the same time or in other applications when they needed to analyze large amounts of information.  Now spreadsheets can be a lot larger in size.

Charts, tables and graphs can also be utilized. You can apply rich visual enhancements to your charts.
 
Another great benefit of spreadsheets is the fact that more than one person can manipulate a spreadsheet if they are on a shared database.  They can input data from their own computers anytime they want. The advantage of this is that people can work in teams and help to protect and control access to their work.   

Real Estate professionals use spreadsheets for financially analyzing income property for all types of real estate (amortization and appreciation).  
Once there is a spreadsheet created for one property the data can be saved for all investors’ presentations related to the building in one workbook.  Later you can recall the input data for any investor.
This makes work very convenient and saves a lot of time.

One spreadsheet document is referred to as a worksheet.  Many worksheets can be saved together into a spreadsheet file called a workbook.  The worksheets are divided into rows and columns that all have cell addresses.  You can enter information into the active cell, which is the selected cell.  In order to enter information into multiple cells all you do is select more than one cell with the cell pointer.  Formulas may be used to perform mathematical functions to compute certain tasks.  Using formulas can save a lot of time entering information.

===== The Bad News about Spreadsheets =====
Spreadsheets are the most used program in accounting, finances, statistics and many other tasks in the daily activities of a company. However, spreadsheets have their downfalls when it comes to how the formulas are used within them. If the right output or input is not correct then a wrong answer will be generated, but sometimes it is not possible to know if we have the wrong answer. Also if the numbers in each cells are not formula generated, many mistaken would be generated when we try to use them. If a number is hand written in a cell, not generated by a formula, then that number will give the wrong answer when used within another formula, and in a large set of data it is impossible to know if we have the wrong answer. Another fact is that if we want to pin a cell within a formula a dollar sign is required in front of the cell, in order to be able to use that cell only, in cases where we need to perform calculations in multiple cells with the copy and paste function, instead of writing the formula for each cell. If we do not pin the cell we want to use for each calculation then Excel will perform the calculation for each cell numerically and we will have wrong answers.
Spreadsheets are easy to use for large groups of data, but the input and output options have to be always correct in order to have the right answer at the end.

Microsoft Excel is the component of Microsoft Office which is used to create payroll analyses, reports, charts, queries, and forms for either personal or for a business.

One page of a book is called a sheet and a whole book is called a workbook.

The easiest way to calculate numbers is by using formulas. In order to create a formula you need to start one by using an equal sign (or a plus or minus sign). For example =sum (A1:B1). A1 = 1 B1 = 2 C1 would = 3. If you do not put a sign, the formula will be interpreted as text.
The fastest way to add up a row is to use the Auto Sum function from the Home Tab.

The easiest way to sum up more than one row is dragging to the right and down the rows at once.

Some of the other features include Merging &amp; Centering Data, Rotating Text, the ability to copy and paste data from one cell to another by the use of the Format Painter, and the use of an IF statement to test if a condition is true.

===== History of Spreadsheets =====
Spreadsheets have certainly aided the computer industry for business purposes, with the most popular example being the Microsoft Excel application.

Microsoft originally developed a spreadsheet program called Multiplan in 1982. However, it soon lost popularity to Lotus 1-2-3 when it came to MS-DOS systems. This heralded the development and release of Excel in 1985 for the Macintosh computer. The first Windows version was released in November 1987 which lined up with the Mac and bundled with a run-time windows environment.

By 1988, Excel had started to outsell 1-2-3 because Lotus was slow to bring it to Windows. This helped Microsoft become the leading PC software developer. Microsoft developed regular new releases every two years or so.

Another company was selling a software package named &quot;Excel&quot; in the early years of Microsoft's Excel development, which lead to a trademark lawsuit. This necessitated that Microsoft refer to the program as &quot;Microsoft Excel&quot; in all of its press releases and legal documents. Eventually this practice was ignored, particularly since Microsoft purchased the trademark to the other program. The Microsoft program was also referred to as &quot;XL&quot; as an abbreviation, and the file extension of the default Excel format is &quot;.xls&quot;.

Excel allowed the user to determine the appearance of spreadsheets (fonts, character attributes and cell appearance). Until 1999, this was unique compared to other spreadsheets on the market. It also allowed only cells dependent on the cell being modified to update. Previous spreadsheet programs recalculated everything all the time or waited for user commands to update the spreadsheet. The icing on the cake for Microsoft Excel was that in 1993 when it was first bundled into Microsoft Office, Microsoft Word and Microsoft Powerpoint had their GUIs redesigned for consistency with Excel.

Microsoft also added the ability to automate tasks in Excel and to provide user-defined functions for use in worksheets. However, the automation functionality caused Excel to become a target for macro viruses.

The biggest threat to Microsoft Excel is the Free Software OpenOffice.org Calc and also Gnumeric, both of which can open and save Excel documents.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This plugin uses a quartz oscillator which uses a crystal (X1), amongst other components to give a 32,768Hz (32,768=2&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) output. This is input to a [[Practical Electronics/IC/4020|4020]] 14-Stage Ripple Counter, which divides this signal down by 2&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; to a 2Hz signal. This 2Hz signal is then halved in frequency using a JK flip-flop ([[Practical Electronics/IC/4027|4027]]) configured as a toggle flip-flop. The output from this is used as the 1Hz signal.

Both the 1Hz and 2Hz signals are taken as outputs, as the faster 2Hz signal is sometimes useful for clocking circuits at a visible speed, without going too slowly.

[[image:1Hz_Quartz_Oscillator_CD.png|750px]]

Below is the stripboard layout for the plugin. The dimensions of the stripboard are 12x23 holes. An LED and current-limiting resistor have been added to the 1Hz output to provide a visual indicator. This can be omitted without affecting the performance of the the circuit. R2 may need to be mounted around D1, as there is very little space for it.

[[image:1Hz_Quartz_Oscillator.svg|700px]]

The parts lift below assumes a power supply of 9V. If a different voltage is used, it is possible that the LED current-limiting resistor (R2) must be changed and the oscillator may need adjustment as well.

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address, also, you can enable and email adress in your preferences and email other users directly.
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.[[User:Mirtone|Mir]][[User:Mirtone/myskin.css|'''t''']][[User talk:Mirtone|'''one''']] 02:08, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

This list is updated for DD-WRT v22 SP1.  The newest release is DD-WRT SP2, so this list may not be fully up to date.

Generally, five different versions of the DD-WRT package are available.

* Micro
* Mini
* Standard
* VOIP
* VPN

Special versions are available, for a fee, from the [http://www.dd-wrt.com/shop/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=31 DD-WRT Shop], with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service QOS] and PPPOE-Relay features.  But since the DD-WRT software is licensed under the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License GPL] version 2, it is legal to redistribute copies of even the Special versions.

* I really like the idea. I'm concerned, however, about the number of questions that could be asked. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:42, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
* Kids love this sort of thing. Would be a big project though. [[User:82.27.235.165|82.27.235.165]] 18:09, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
* It would of been appropriate if we made a general book about animals. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 18:10, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
* Is bugs just a general US term for insects?  What exactly is a bug?  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:26, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
:*Bug is a general term for any insect or similar creeping or crawling invertebrate. I do not know if it is only in the US or is also used in other places. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 23:19, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
* The title should probably be changed to &quot;Insects&quot;. [[User:Bart133|Bart133]] 17:18, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

* Noble cause but how much is it juristiction dependent? At the very least it should be called Californian Fifth Grade Maths. Link with the Open textbook thingo would be cool. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 04:20, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
* This would be great, esp. if we could get it to published status. Schools might consider buying it because it would be of real value to them. [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:45, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
* Not going to work with diffrent curriculums
* I think there are enough basic topics that could work with different curriculums

* A great example of a project that could benefit from a world-wide wiki environment. [[User:Dilaudid|Dilaudid]] 01:03, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
* An alternative name could be &quot;introduction to flamewars for kids&quot; [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 04:21, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
*Hope this one wins, it will open up minds for the future.--[[User:Afa86|Afa86]] 03:25, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
*Don't be so cynical. If kids don't learn this stuff sometime, they'll simply attack what they don't know, hence flamewars. But that's a worst case scenario, but my vote stands nonetheless.[[User:Ferretinator|Ferretinator]] 17:04, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
*Kids really need to learn this subject and that's why this should win. Supe95
*I think this would be great. [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:43, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
* This would be a cool book to actaully stop conflicts against religions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== I'm the first to write here. Yay! ==

I don't really need an external program to create a human, as I'm becoming quite proficient with the modelling aspect of Blender. In fact I'm working on a technique to create full human models (though basic and just for storyboarding) in +/- 2hrs. But I did download makehuman and it seems like a good idea, even though it's currently in the Beta version and quite unworkable. However, I suggest that someone keep and eye on it's development for inclusion somewhere in Wikibooks (probably here). I'll personally try to keep an eye on it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ideal gas law ==
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; PV \propto T &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== Pressure ===
Suppose we have a cylinder which contains [[A-level Chemistry/AQA/Module 5/Thermodynamics/Ideal Gas|ideal gas]] (or [[w:ideal gas|ideal gas]]). The cylinder is sealed with a free to move piston. 

Given:

: M - piston's mass &lt;br&gt;
: A - cross-sectional area &lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; P_0&lt;/math&gt; -  atmospheric pressure &lt;br&gt;

Free-body diagram for the piston includes three forces:
: * a force from the air above the piston
: * a force from the gas
: * the weight of the piston

Remember that the piston is '''free to move''', so the equilibrium of all three forces is established. That is one force (pointing up) equals to the sum of the two others (pointing down). Also note, that if piston were massless (it's weight would be zero), then the force of the above air pushing down would exactly equilize the force of the gas, pushing the piston up.

Let's denote the pressure inside the cylinder as &lt;math&gt;P_{inside}&lt;/math&gt;. Owning to the fact that force is pressure times area, we have

:&lt;math&gt; F_{pg} = F_{pa} + Mg \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P_{inside} A = P_0 A + Mg \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P_{inside} = P_0 + Mg/A\ &lt;/math&gt;

This formula is quite reasonable: if you sit on the top of the piston you'll effectively increase the mass of the piston, thereby increasing the pressure inside :)

'''Questions:''' does the pressure inside depend on
: how high the piston is
: what gas is inside
: the temperature of the gas

[[w:Avogadro's law|Avogadro's law]] and [[w:Avogadro constant|Avogadro's number]]

== First law of thermodynamics ==

=== Work ===
First there is a reminder of how '''mechanical work''' defined in physics. 

: &lt;math&gt;dW = \vec F \cdot d\vec{s} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

You need to know [[w:Dot_product#Geometric_interpretation geometric|interpretation of dot product]] as well. Note that if force and displacement are perpendicular each other, the work is ''zero''. There is no work by itself, the work is done by force. So for every force there might be work done. The sum of all contributions would give you ''total work'' done on system (body). Here we introduce work-kinetic energy theorem, which say ''the net work done by all the forces equals to the change of kinetic energy of a body''.

: &lt;math&gt; W_{total} = E_{f} - E_{i}  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Work and internal energy ===
Suppose we have a cylinder with ideal gas inside. The cylinder is closed by a piston which can move without friction. If we push the piston, the work done '''on''' gas (by hand) is positive  and the work done '''by''' gas (on hand) is negative. 

Now let's place the system in thermally isolated coating. It means there is no exchange of heat between the cylinder and surrounding. 

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta E_{int} = W_{on system}  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Don't confuse the temperature with thermal isolation. Thermal isolation '''does NOT mean''' constant temperature. The temperature is rather directly associated with ''internal energy'' of the system.

=== Heat ===
If heat flows '''to''' some system it is positive, otherwise it is negative. As you could have guessed heat flow is zero in thermally isolated systems.

=== Heat, work and internal energy ===
: &lt;math&gt; \Delta E_{int} = W_{on system} + Q  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[w:First_law_of_thermodynamics|First Law of Thermodynamics]].

If we take the same cylinder with the piston and place it in some huge tank with water (usually called ''thermal bath'') and wait for some time. The the system will eventually acquire the temperature of the tank and whatever we'll do with the system (cylinder+gas+piston), after waiting for some time there is no way to change it's temperature. This is an example of ''isothermal'' (constant temperature) process. Since change in temperature is related to the change in internal energy, we'll have

: &lt;math&gt; 0 = W_{on system} + Q  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The last special case is to fix the piston in space, therefore the work would be zero.

      <comment>/* Linear Motion with changing speed over time */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Linear Motion==
Linear Motion referes to any motion moving in a straight line without changing it's direction

==Linear Motion with constant speed over time==
Any Linear Motion that has constant speed at all time can be expressed as
* Speed
: &lt;math&gt;v(t) = V&lt;/math&gt;

* Acceleration
: &lt;math&gt;a(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

* Distance
: &lt;math&gt;s(t) = V t&lt;/math&gt;

==Linear Motion with changing speed over time==
For any Linear Motion travels at different speed at different time 
: v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
: v at t

* Change in Speed
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v =  v - v_o&lt;/math&gt;

* Change in Time
: ∆t = &lt;math&gt;t - t_o&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio of Change in Speed over Change in Time gives the Accelerarion of the motion or The Rate of Change of Velocity versus Time
* Rate of Change of Speed over Time
:&lt;math&gt;  a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v - v_o}{t - t_o}&lt;/math&gt;


: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = a \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = a (t - t_o) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;v = v_o + a (t - t_o)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;v = v_o + a \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;v = v_o + \Delta v&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;s = v_o \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} \Delta v \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;s = \Delta t [v_o  + \frac{1}{2} \Delta v ]&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">hi,
how can I be able to use locate formulation in writting a program?
Another aspect I don't understand is how to caculate the lines in a qbasic program, since there is no visible lines or rules to help you determin the number of the lines.
Thanks 
Chris

Answer: you can put a number before the command

e.g.  10 PRINT

The '''Mock Strawberry''', ''Potentilla indica'' (formerly ''Duchesnea indica''), is also known as the '''Indian Strawberry'''. Although the foliage and fruit are quite similar, is not a true strawberry and can readily be distinguished by its yellow flowers, as opposed to the flowers of true strawberries which are white or slightly pink. It is native to eastern and southern Asia, but has been introduced to many other areas as an ornamental plant, though it is considered a noxious weed in some regions. It can become a particular problem in shady lawns and when growing in with other ground covers.

==Description==
The leaves are trifoliate, roughly veined beneath, dark green, often persisting through the winter, arising from short crowns. The plant spreads along long, wiry stolons, rooting and producing crowns at each node. The yellow flowers are produced in mid spring, then sporadically throughout the growing season, repeating if mown down before fruit set. The fruits are red, with red seeds, and while juicy and edible are not palatable like the true strawberries. 

The plant is frequently mistaken for true strawberries, but they can be differentiated by the yellow flowers (strawberries have white petals), and the red seeds on the fruits (strawberry seeds are a golden color).

==Ecology==
&lt;!--distribution, invasiveness, allelopathy, noxious weed status, etc.--&gt;

==Uses==
&lt;!--garden, crop, fodder, medicinal, material etc.--&gt;

==Control==
{{wikiversity-bc|Duchesnea indica}}
{{commons|Duchesnea indica}}
Control can be difficult if it is mixed in with other plants, and can confuse even the most experienced gardener when it grows intermingled with true strawberries. In some situations (such as where there are no other small plants present) it can simply be tolerated as a ground cover.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Harmonica tabs can be considered the basic building blocks of playing well-known tunes on the harmonica. Typically, since a harmonica is cheap, the person coming into possession of the harmonica tends to have little to no experience reading music. Thus, the harmonica tabs allow one to easily play recognizable tunes.

==Reading==
On a chromatic and diatonic harp, the instrument itself is numbered for each hole: 1, 2, 3, etc. Unfortunately, aside from this,''' there are no standarization''' on breath indications. So far, there are the few following ways:
#'''Using a single sign''': Unsigned means draw; hole number accompanied by a &quot;+&quot; sign means blow.  This is common in Mel Bay publishing and its webzine, Harmonica Sessions. The origin of this notation is due to the use of second position in Blues Harp, which use draw most of the time.
#'''Using two signs''': Number with a &quot;+&quot; sign is a blow, a number followed by  a &quot;-&quot; is a draw. So:
:1+ 1- 1+ 1- 2+ 2- 3- 
:would  be, &quot;blow draw blow draw blow draw draw&quot;. 
These two case may also derive numerous variations, such as the unsigned number is blow, or use arrows to indicate breath direction.

Aside from these, some also have additional notation to indicate button pushing or bending. For example,  &quot;2+&lt;&quot; for &quot;blow hole 2 with button in.&quot;

For bending, there are quite numerous system exist too. Example would be &quot; 3'' &quot; meaning a &quot;draw double bend on hole 3&quot;, or .  For those that are signed of the draw note (e.g.: negative number for draw), it maybe common for a bend is written typically with more &quot;-&quot; signs to indicate how deep the bend. 
An overblow also has a similar symbol beside it, though this symbol tends to vary as an overblow isn't a very widely used technique (and usually, by the time you have master this technique, you can also read music and don't care about sheet music at all). A tilde (~) is typically used, though some just go with &quot;OB&quot;.

Ultimately, it's best to look at a tablature guide, if there is one.

Even if a tablature exists, it's always best to get one that accompanies a score with traditional notation, since straight tablatures for harmonica typically do not provide much timing information, if at all, which can make a piece of music sound horrible.

In the end, the tablature is still nothing more than training wheels. For those that want to get more songs to play with, one should also learn how to read music itself, since tablatures for harmonica is quite lacking; also, fake books only come in traditional notations.

==Writing and Arranging==
Writing tablature is a bit more difficult, as it requires knowledge of music theory and the ability to read music. Each number on a natural key diatonic corresponds to a certain diatonic scale, and so does the songs to be made into tablature.

However, just because the song and the harmonica is in the same key does not mean you can just translate these notes into the corresponding numbers of the harmonica tablature.  For example: a song in the key of D that is actually in the dorian mode is a lot easier to play if it's played on a C harmonica (3rd position). Also, while one can use bend to achieve all the notes of the appropriate scale, it could be a good idea to transpose the song up or down an octave for ease of playing.

In general, Asian Pop music would be best to transpose to the middle octave and use little to no bending, while blues music is best to remain the same octave, and if possible, play in second position.

Jazz is best to transposed to a range such that the harmonica can play, but if it does not need to transpose, you do not have to. Classical, however, should not be transposed at all.

Lastly, it depends whether you are arranging the music merely for the ease of playing, or arranging a song so a certain harp can play. Do keep in mind that most first harps are in the Major C, and thus, even when considering bending, may have to transpose the arrangement into different keys, or even make sacrifices.  For example, St james Infirmary is to be played on Bb originally, but can actually be transpose to a key of C if needed.

Finally, try to find a way to indicate timing and beat.  A simple way is to use spacing between note at a certain interval, and assume a certain normal space is equal a quarter note.

==Tablature example==
Notation:

*X+ = blow
*X = draw
*(X+) = blow, slide in
*(X) = draw, slide in

===Fur Elise===
 6+ (5) 6+ (5) 6+     |4 5 4+  3 |
 1+ 2+ 3 4 | 2+ (3+) 4 4+ |&lt;br&gt;
 6+ (5) 6+ (5) 6+     |4 5 4+  3 |
 1+ 2+ 3 4 | 2+ 4+ 4 3 |&lt;br&gt;
 4 5+ 5 6+ | 3+ 6 6+ 5 |
 2 6+ 5 5+ | 2+ 5 5+ 4 |&lt;br&gt;
 2+ 2+ 6+ 2+ 6+ 6+ 10+ (5) | 6+ 5 6+ (5) 6+ 5 6+ (5) |  &lt;br&gt;

== Please contribute ==

Should links to books that exists be here at all? I think all blue links should be removed. Some of them have a &quot;please contribute&quot; added to them, but the wishlist is not the place for those kind of requests, is it?
*Some are little more than stubs or outlines, and have very little if any real content. A blue link in these cases indicates that at least someone has an interest in contributing, which means any new people contributing probably won't be alone. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 15:35, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
**This seems a bit odd.  This is certainly not where I would have looked for new books to contribute to.  It seems better to put stub books with all the other books so people will actually see them. [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 05:43, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

== Digital museum ==

Where should be a ''Digital Museum (museum of the digital history)''.



== Remove blue links ==

== Idea to tidy up this page ==

This page is too big and it looks so cluttered.  Might it be a good idea to split it into several different sections like 'Requests for Arts books', 'Requests for Science books', etc.  This will also make it easier for potential authors to find particular requested items.  Any thoughts?  [[User:Xania|Xania]] 21:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
:Agreed, it's huge. '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 03:35, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

== Ideas to Tidy Up Page ==

Personally, I think it seems like a good idea to keep all requests on one page, because it perhaps might makes it easier to attain ideas on books to start, if they are all in one place. This presumes however, that the page is organized and structured elegantly. I will make it elegant. I am open to suggestions on other ways to do it. If someone thinks they can do it better than myself, please feel free to take it over. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi0o]] 21:29, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

== Combine ==

Can I combine some requests into one topic? For example the Urban planning section, I mean several of these topics have a lot of information on them but they would become very bare &quot;books&quot; which is why they are perfect encyclopedic articles.

== Governmental Accounting ==

I've added a requested book on Introduction to Governmental Accounting - USA.  I am a CPA, Masters in Accountancy, and work for a local government.  When I need to teach new employees how governmental accounting works, it's almost imposible using existing sources.  All introductory accounting books teach financial accounting for businesses, not for local government.  While the very basics are the same, you rapidly reach a point where the rules are different enough that existing textbooks are more confusing than illuminating.

Basically, accounting majors only learn governmental accounting after about 2 years of financial accounting, so the governmental accounting textbooks assume a huge amount of prior knowledge.  The problem is that most people hired as governmental accountants/bookkeepers were not accounting majors, so they don't have the huge pool of knowledge to understand governmental accounting text books.

So what I'm proposing is an Introductory Accounting text book which is oriented towards governmental accounting, not towards business accounting.

The reason I specified USA in the title is that each country has it's own set of standards.  The accounting standards for local and state governments in the United States are set by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).  Attempting to create a text book that covers every single country's rules seems like a huge project.  This is big enough.

I have the book listed in the Business section, but I suppose that once the book project is started, it could be cross listed both in Business and in Government/Politics (or where ever Public Administration fits) since it is intimately related to Public Administration.

== Mathematics for left-brain people ==

I have added a request for a book on maths for left-brained people.
I have almost no capacity for thinking in terms of pictures which
makes the standard explanations of algebra and calculus incomprehensible.

I suspect there are a number of other people who would  benefit from a
book that explains maths in terms of language rather than the usual visual
metaphors.
If someone else could start it I'll help in anyway that I can.

# a movement toward [[w:declarative programming|declarative programming]] which is easier to learn, maintain and debug
# a rich set of user interface controls for handling complex things such as dates, numbers and ranges
# compatibility with XML standards such as [[w:Cascading Style Sheets|Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), [[w:XML Schema|XML Schema]] and [[w:XPath|XPath]]
# extensibility

XForms can be run today from almost any web browser by either using an downloadable plugin or extension (such as the Firefox extension) or by loading a JavaScript file.  For more information see the [[../Benefits/]] section of this book.

== About this book ==
This book is intended to be a tutorial and cookbook with many complete running XForms examples.  The initial examples are designed to teach the fundamental concepts of XForms.  The more advanced examples are designed to solve specific tasks and reduce the amount of JavaScript necessary to write high-quality forms.

We would like to have the examples ordered from simple to complex.  At the end of the cookbook there are integration examples of how to extend and integrate XForms with other systems such as web services.

The philosophy behind this book centers around the fact that people often learn best by taking a fully-functioning program and making slight modifications to it to understand how it works.

== Guidelines for contributors ==
Please feel free to add your own examples to this tutorial and cookbook!  Here are a few suggestions for contributors:

=== Focus on Tutorial Examples ===
The first set of examples should focus on new XForms users. Please keep tutorials on foundational concepts (XPath and XML Schema) in a separate area so that users already familiar with these concepts can skip these sections.

=== Focus on Reducing JavaScript ===
One of the goals of this book is to help forms developers move away from hard-to-maintain scripting languages such as [[w:JavaScript|JavaScript]].  Any examples that focus on getting rid of commonly used JavaScript functions are very much appreciated.

=== Testing ===
Please tell us what XForms systems you have used to test your examples.  If you can, we recommend testing using the major browsers (Internet Explorer and Firefox) using either an extension, plug-in or a JavaScript translator such as FormFaces.  See also the [[../Installing XForms in Firefox/]].

We would like to eventually have a small box in the upper right corner that tells what systems each example was tested under.

=== Avoid Duplication ===
Try to avoid duplication with other example programs in this cookbook and other Wikibooks on CSS, XML Schemas and XPath.  That being said, sometimes the cookbook needs small samples of CSS and XPath to demonstrate how they are integrated with XForms.

=== [[../Naming Conventions/]] ===
Our first goal is to get as many complete working examples installed for new users of XForms.  After they are working, they should hopefully be made as consistent as possible.  This document describes an initial attempt at some of the naming conventions used in previous examples.

==Contents==
*[[/Introduction/]]
*[[/Getting content/]]

== Stage 1 - Content Preparation ==
Text is prepared using a Word Processor such as Microsoft Word. Ideally the text should be proof-read by a third party before sending on for layout using specialist tools such as Adobe's InDesign or Quark XPress, however, other programs, such as Microsoft's Publisher, may suffice for more simple-based work.

Images should be at high resolution at 300ppi at the size you intend to print at. Less resolution will cause images to blur when printed –– you could get away with resolutions as low as 150ppi although commercially it isn't recommended.

Supplying files as RGB JPGs will speed transfer between systems but will be converted into a format which can be read by commercial pre-press systems such as TIFF or EPS.

== Stage 2 - Assemble the magazine ==
To assemble the magazine from the content supplied, you should used a commercial design pro-tool such as InDesign or Quark XPress. The knowledge of the user will ensure the images are replicated properly and the type laid out to enable the copy to be read with ease.

Keep font differences to a minimum. Preferably use a serif font for bulk text, leave sans for headings and labels. Avoid over-use of colours. Check out a professional magazine for ideas. Leave plenty of 'white space' around the text and avoid placing copy over images as this can lead to visual interference. Professional publications avoid clashing of elements. KISS (Keep It So Simple).

Work to columns. Text spread right across pages can make reading the document hard work. Breaking into thinner columns will make reading easier and more efficient.

== Stage 3 - Print the magazine ==
There are variety of ways to print the magazine but in all cases you need to work the pages in sets of fours. Optimum pagination groups would be to work in 8pp or 16pp sections.

You can print on your own printer using the printer settings in your program or better still, for small numbers, print the document digitally at your local print or copy centre. For larger scale publications a commercial printing company would be required to print your magazine. If the latter is the route you wish to take then best to contact the printer first so you have a clear route on what you need to supply to achieve the results rather than giving them something they can't work with after all the hard work you put in.

In most cases it would be advisable to use a professional magazine production artist to deliver your job without technical issues in turn would save time, money and deliver a better looking magazine which would be better received by the reader.

== Stage 4 - Send the files to the printer ==
At one time Quark XPress files were collected with its elements and dispatched on a Syquest drive to produce a four colour set of film before dispatching to the printing company. By today's standards, PDF files are now exported from InDesign to commercial print specifications and uploaded via IP directly into the printing company's pre-press system, equally files can be uploaded by FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or supplied on CD via post.

== Common sense notes ==
Talk to your printer. Keep the layout simple. Emphasise on ease of reading ability than over-designing the page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background ==

The XForms standard arose from the desire of many people to use the web for more than just linking documents.  The original design of the world wide web standard introduced many innovative concepts including the URL, the HTML markup language and the HTTP protocol.

But innovation aside, elegant form processing was not one of the design goals of the initial HTML language.  In fact, many of the advanced input fields were added to the HTML specification after it became popular.

One thing is clear: the introduction of clean [[w:Model-View-Controller|MVC]] concepts were never part of the original HTML specification.  Many attempts were made to introduce better controls into browsers and the HTML language, but most of these additions fell short for four reasons:
# They were either browser or vendor specific solutions to a specific problem
# They did not integrate mainstream developments in XML Schema, XPath and CSS
# They did not take into account the need for clear [[w:Separation of concerns|separation-of-concerns]]
# They did not meet the rigorous needs of application architects that understood the benefits of MVC architectures

As a result, many of these point-solutions have been discarded or have seen only niche use by some vendors.

Around 1997 the W3C started to address the concerns of these users and studied how web forms could be processed in a better way.  They realized that validating data elements was a large concern and that re-inventing the validation tools already present in XML Schema would only duplicate efforts.

The first XForms draft specification was published on April 6, 2000.  Since then it has been revised with the most recent version (1.1) appearing in March of 2006.

Today the XForms standard addresses several web forms development issues:
# Model-View-Binding architecture
# Advanced functionality
# Precise specification for all browsers to integrate
# Extensibility without resorting to JavaScript programming
# Built-in assumptions about how form elements get updated

== The Dependency Graph ==

Embedded within every XForms application is the ability to automatically recalculate values when a form element changes.  If you have a complex form with calculation rules then this feature becomes critical for avoiding writing manual recalculation code.  Most JavaScript forms libraries require the author to specify not only form rules, the order these rules must be executed.  This slow and painful form-author-specified recalculation order is replaced in XForms by an automated method to determine the order of recalculation.

The way XForms applications do this is by doing ''automated determination of recalculation order based on optimal graph algorithms''.

One of the most important papers about how XForms is designed come from the following paper:

[http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2007/isbn9789512285662/article3.pdf The XForms Computation Engine: Rationale, Theory and Implementation Experience]
[http://pages.pacificcoast.net/~lightning/XFormsComputes_IASTEDFinalManuscript.htm html version]

If you have a simple form with just a few elements and no calculation rules, HTML forms might be a good solution for you.  If you have forms with rules such as sum and total calculations in a purchase order, then XForms might be the ideal fit for your web form.

For the current working draft of the XForms specification you can go to the  w3 web site:

==What is Data and Information?==

You may have used the words '''data''' and '''information''' to mean the same thing in everyday conversation, but it is very important that you know the difference between the two when it comes to computers.  Roughly speaking data is the raw stream of 1s and 0s inside the computer and information is when the computer makes sense of this stream.  It is interpretation of data in computers and different ways of storing information, that we shall now cover.

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;toccolours&quot; style=&quot;float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;&quot;&gt;Consider data as an encoded form of information and information as any form of communication that provides understandable and useful knowledge to the recipient. - AQA[http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/pdf/AQA-5511-6511-W-SP-07.PDF]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Data==

&quot;'''Data consists of the raw facts and figures that a computer will process into useful information'''&quot;

===Sources of Data===
Data can come from a wide variety of areas, but a good way to think about it is data comes from anywhere where there is an input into a computer.  This may be from a keyboard, a scanner, a microphone or a disk drive, amongst many others.

===Direct and Indirect Data===
Data may be collected with a desired purpose in mind, for example collecting data from a weather station.  This kind of data collection is called '''direct''' data collection.  Other times data may become useful for reasons that it was not originally collected for.  This is called '''indirect''' data collection.  An example of this could be, &quot;The data collected above is used to record where a particular video is&quot; this would be an example of '''direct''' data and example of '''indirect''' data would be &quot;The data collected is used to build up a profile of the members for targeted advertising&quot;.

===Information===
Information is meaningful data

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to store lists in the model, not in the user interface.  This allows a list to be used many places in a form and also enables lists to be read from external files (see the next example).

== Screen Image ==
[[Image:XForms-select-from-model.jpg|frame|center]]

== Execute Sample XForms Application ==

[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/02-controls/05a-Select-from-model/select-items-from-model.xhtml Load XForms Application]

== Sample Program ==

This example shows how to use the XForms '''&lt;code&gt;itemset&lt;/code&gt;''' element to get data from the selection list directly from the model.  Note that itemset is very similar to the group command in syntax: the outer loop tells you where to get your data and the inner loop binds a data element to a form value or item.

                    &lt;ItemColorCode&gt;red&lt;/ItemColorCode&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
            &lt;/xf:instance&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
This is a much more flexible way to manage lists.  The instance document may be fetched dynamically from a remote database and the form does not need to be updated when lists change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Using CSS to Align Form Fields ==
Forms are much easier to use if they are aligned.  This example uses CSS table structures to align our form.  It turns groups into tables, inputs into rows and labels and values into cells.

&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
This style sheet only covers the XForms &lt;xf:input&gt; tags.  It will need additions if you want to align select, select1, textarea and other controls.  A full CSS file for doing this is described later on in this cookbook.

Note that you MUST put inputs inside of a group element for this stylesheet to work.

Also note that the table can grow if the labels get too long.

Note that the display: table properties work in FireFox but may not work in older browsers that do not support table layout.

== Alternative layout strategy using float:left ==
You can control the width of the label column by the odd interaction of the float:left CSS control and the block display.  Basically if you try to control
the width of a block it may not work unless you also add the float:left to label.

Here is the CSS that works for this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
/* This line ensures all the separate input controls appear on their own lines */
xf|input, xf|select, xf|select1, xf|textarea {display:block; margin:5px 0;}

/* Makes the labels right aligned in a 250px wide column that floats to the left of the input controls. */
xf|input &gt; xf|label, xf|select &gt; xf|label, xf|select1 &gt; xf|label, xf|textarea &gt; xf|label 
{text-align:right; padding-right:10px; width:250px; float:left; text-align:right;}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that some older browsers do not support the child (greater than) selector correctly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{HornNavTechnique}}
When you breathe for air when playing the horn, make sure that you do so, grabbing as much air as possible  in the shortest time possible, without changing your embouchure. A good way to do this is though the nose, or on the sides of the mouth, if your mouth is big enough. But it is important that you never 'fall' from a note to take a breath.

What you can do to conserve more air, is to sit at the very tip-corner right side of the chair. Cushions (sofas, loveseats, ect.) are unnacceptable because it is to easy to slouch, even when you do not realize it. So, it is best to play on a actual 'chair', ideally with no backing.

It is often the best to include several breathing exercises in your daily warm-up routine. All are done in common time. When inhaling, make your mouth wider, but when exhaling, make it smaller, so that you have to push air though your mouth. Here are some exercises:

Assume 'b' is beat
Assume 'c' is crescendo
Assume 'dcr' is decrescendo


Breathe in for 4b, release for 4b

Breathe in for 4b, release for 8b

Breathe in for 4b, release for 12bc

Breathe in for 2b, release for 4b

Breathe in for 4b, release for 10bcd

and so forth.

== Types of Computer Storage ==

Before learning about what different storage devices are available, we need to have an understanding of the types of storage in a computer. The two types of storage are called primary and secondary storage. In devices that provide primary storage capability, the information is only stored temporarily and is easily accessible for processing. These are known as RAM chips (standing for “Random Access Memory”) and are connected to the motherboard as well as video cards. The devices that provide secondary storage capabilities are able to store information permanently, although the information that is stored is not as easily accessible as in primary storage but can still be accessed. Secondary storage devices would include hard drives, CDs, flash drives and the less common floppy disks. To distinguish the important difference between primary and secondary storage, think of being inside the kitchen of your own home. You are preparing a meal out of the family cookbook which you have laid out on top of your kitchen island along with your ingredients and tools sitting within reach. Your kitchen island is your primary storage because it keeps the items that you need to process within easy reach (you can think of yourself as the CPU) but those items do not remain there permanently. Your refrigerator, pantry and kitchen cabinets can be thought of as your secondary storage since items can be kept in these areas permanently, but would take more of your time when trying to cook a meal since you would have to search through them to find what you need. 


[[File:DDR2 ram mounted.jpg|thumb|Here is an example of RAM chips connected to the motherboard]]
[[File:USB Flash Drives.jpg|thumb|Here is an example of flash drives, which enable portable permanent storage]]


==Floppy==
A soft magnetic disk. It is called floppy because it flops if you wave it (at least, the 5¼-inch variety does). Unlike most hard disks, floppy disks (often called floppies or diskettes) are portable, because you can remove them from a disk drive. Disk drives for floppy disks are called floppy drives. Floppy disks are slower to access than hard disks and have less storage capacity, but they are much less expensive. And most importantly, they are portable. 
Floppies come in three basic sizes: 

8-inch: The first floppy disk design, invented by IBM in the late 1960s and used in the early 1970s as first a read-only format and then as a read-write format. The typical desktop/laptop computer does not use the 8-inch floppy disk. 
5¼-inch: The common size for PCs made before 1987 and the predecessor to the 8-inch floppy disk. This type of floppy is generally capable of storing between 100K and 1.2MB (megabytes) of data. The most common sizes are 360K and 1.2MB. 
3½-inch: Floppy is something of a misnomer for these disks, as they are encased in a rigid envelope. Despite their small size, microfloppies have a larger storage capacity than their cousins -- from 400K to 1.4MB of data. The most common sizes for PCs are 720K (double-density) and 1.44MB (high-density). Macintoshes support disks of 400K, 800K, and 1.2MB.

Floppy disk at the time was the only option of removable storage.  One major problem with the disk was it was flimsy and easily destroyed.  If you touched the exposed area your data could be completely destroyed.  You had to use extreme caution when handling it.

The floppy disk evolved to a slightly more durable storage medium.  The problem with it was if the metal piece was moved it exposed the data to elements that would destroy the data saved.

==Zip==
The Zip drive is a medium-capacity removable disk storage system, introduced by Iomega in late 1994. Originally it had a capacity of 100 MB, but later versions increased this to first 250 MB and then 750 MB.

The format became the most popular of the super-floppy type products but never reached the status of a quasi-standard to replace the 3.5-inch floppy disk. It has been superseded by flash-drive systems as well as rewritable CDs and DVDs, and is fading in popularity. The Zip brand was also used for internal and external CD writers known as Zip-650 or Zip-CD.

==Hard Drive==
A hard disk drive (HDD, also known as hard disk, hard drive, or the now-near-obsolete terms fixed disk, fixed drive, fixed disk drive, hard file) is a digitally encoded non-volatile storage device which stores data on the magnetic surfaces of hard disk platters.

Hard disks were originally developed for use in connection with, or later inside, a single computer. Later, as a way of guarding against hard disk failure, they were arranged into configurations such as redundant array of independent disks (RAID). RAID is a method of storing data on two or more hard drives that work together. One common RAID technique which RAID1 uses is disk mirroring. Disk mirroring is when data is written to two duplicate hard drives at the same time. This way if one hard drive files, the date automatically moves to the other hard drive where you can access it. This technique greatly reduces the chance of loss of data and/or service.
[[File:RAID 1.svg|100px|thumb|RAID 1]]

Hard disks are also found in network attached storage (NAS) devices, but for large volumes of data may be most efficiently used in a storage area network (SAN). Over time, applications for hard disk drives have expanded beyond computers to include video recorders, audio players, digital organizers, and digital cameras. In 2005 the first cellular telephones to include hard disk drives were introduced by Samsung and Nokia.

The capacity of hard drives has grown exponentially over time. With early personal computers, a drive with a 20 megabyte capacity was considered large. In the latter half of the 1990s, hard drives with capacities of 1 gigabyte and greater became available. As of 2006, the &quot;smallest&quot; desktop hard disk still in production has a capacity of 40 gigabytes, while the largest-capacity internal drives are a 3/4 terabyte (750 gigabytes), with external drives at or exceeding one terabyte by using multiple internal disks. These new internal drives increased their storage capacities with Perpendicular recording.

The most traditional hard drives are magnetic hard drives, which contains one or more round pieces of metal coated with a magnetisable substance. These hard drives have heads which are used to store and retrieve the data, which directly attached to the access mechanism that helps the heads to move in and out over the surface of hard disk. Different types of hard drives are used for different type of computers. For example desktop computers use 2.5 inch or 3.5 inch hard drives, whereas mobile phones, portable digital media players and other small devices use 1.5 inch or smaller hard drives. But, no matter what the size of the hard drive is, each and every hard drive contains a stack of hard disk.

In recent years the development of network attached hard drives has also increased dramatically, this is commonly referred to as Network Attached Storage (NAS), it's most useful form is the storage area network (SAN) where a single computer hosts many disks and shares access to those disks (presents) them over the network, where they appear as if they were local to the client computer.
A good example of this is given at [http://www.cheapsan.com/ Building A Low Cost SAN].

Solid state drives are a newer type of hard drive that contain no moving parts allowing data to be stored on flash memory technology.  Solid state drives or SSDs come in smaller sizes, 64-256GB, compared to traditional hard drives.  SSDs are becoming more popular as they perform several times faster than a traditional SSD and have become more popular in ultra light netbooks and notebooks. The prices for SSDs are also coming down as the flash technology becomes more advanced and keeps current with SATA 6Gbit/s speeds.  [[File:Disassembled_HDD_and_SSD.JPG|100px|thumb|HDD and SSD]]


==External Hard Drive==
[[File:Seagate-FreeAgent-Go-120-GB.jpg|100px|thumb|External Hard Drive]]

External(portable) hard drives are usually powered by USB.  The current capacity limit for a single magnetic hard drive(typical hard drive with moving parts inside) is 500 gigabytes, but a single external hard drive can utilize several internal disks and exceed one terabtye(1,024 gigabytes) of storage.  The current capacity limit for SSD(solid state drive) hard drives is 128 gigabytes.  External drives are useful for backing up data and keeping it safe.


Hybrid hard drives are composed of a standard magnetic hard drive and a solid state drive (see Flash Memory below).  This configuration allows for increased performance, aka speed, of the drive while not sacrificing size.  The use of a flash drive can significantly decrease the amount of time it takes for the computer to boot and load applications.  These devices are more expensive than standard hard drives, but may be suitable for power users.







'''USB Flash Drive'''                     [[File:USB_Flash_Drive_animated.gif|100px|thumb|USB Flash Drive]]

USB flash drives sometimes called USB flash memory drives, thumb drives, or jump drives consist of flash memory media integrated into a self contained unit that connects to a computer or other device via a standard USB port and is powered via USB port. USB flash drives are designed to be very small and portable. In order to appeal to a wide variety of users, USB flash drives are available in a range of sizes, colors and appearances – including those designed to be attached to backpacks or worn around the neck, those built into necklaces, wristbands or wristwatches, those thin enough to fit easily into a wallet and those are made into custom shapes.  When the USB flash drive is built into a consumer product such as watch, sunglasses or a Swiss Army knife, a retractable cord is used to connect the device to a computer when needed. They are used so widely, additional hardware related to USB flash drives are becoming available such as USB duplicator systems used by educators to copy assignments or other materials to and from a large collection of USB flash drives at one time. To Read or write, you just need to plug it into a USB port. If the USB flash drive is being used with a computer, then it is assigned a drive letter by the computer just like any other type of attached drive and files can be read from or written to the USB flash drive until it is unplugged from the USB port. The capacity of most USB flash drive today ranges from 1 GB to 64 GB. It is most useful to all students, employees to transport files from one computer to another as well as quickly backup important files.

==USB keys==
USB keys are the new mobile storage unit. It is a flash memory stick with a casing that slides nicely into a computer's USB port for data transfer. USB keys can vary in size, smallest being the 32 MB and the max is currently 4 GB. It can carry any type of data such as your music files, word applications, and even powerpoint presentations, with little problems. USB keys are safer than their predecessors, the floppy drive and zip drive, in fact some USB keys have survived trips through washing machines! The USB keys are compatible to work with windows 98 or higher. They are also Mac and Linux compliant.

==Tape Drives==
Tape drives research began in 1949 by IBM. The whole process was to find a suitable replacement for punch cards. The necessities being the replacement should be compact, faster, cheaper and reusable. The big difference between a tape drive and a audio cassette tape is in the machinery. The drives themselves are much quicker and more accurate than a home cassette player. The tapes store data in a continuous string of bits, also known as, sequential data, and the need to find a particular part of the information that is being searched for requires a mechanically efficient and accurate machine. They are able to fast-forward and rewind to a particular spot on the tape with high speed and accuracy. This is the image of the large reel-to-reel machines seen in old television and movies, and are still used today for their cost effectiveness for backups. Backups are the recording of data from a computer hard drive to another secondary storage device. Although compact discs are gaining in popularity, tape drives are still widely available. The improvement in tape drives has been dramatic since their inception. The original tape drive, IBM 701 Tape Drive, could store 100 bpi (bits per inch), run at a speed of 70 ips (inches per second) and could be as long as 1400 feet. Since then tapes have evolved to run 200, 556, 800, 1600, and even 6250 bpi. They run at greater speeds than original, and have lengths up to 3600 feet. Tape drives were at their prime up until the 1990's. Then the flexibility, speed, and storage abilities of hard drives overtook tape drives. As mentioned earlier, tape drives are still available, but are now relegated to inexpensive backups of vast amounts of data.

=='''Smart Cards'''==


A smart card is a pocket-sized card with an embedded chip inside of it.  There are many uses for these cards from printing applications, Identification, storing memory, credit card and banking. Smart Cards are also being used in SIMS for mobile phones, authorization cards for pay television, high-security identification and access-control cards, and public transport payment cards.  

Recently smart cards are starting to be used as electronic wallets.  The smart card chip can be loaded with funds which can be spent in parking meters and vending machines or at various merchants.  SMart cards are highly effective with all the applications listed above as they are low in cost yet highly effective solution to handle data.  

Smart cards store a small amount of data or for identification purposes. The increase in technology have greatly increase the capabilities for the smart cards. They can be used to enhance security at places like an office building. Smart cards are also used worldwide for student id cards. In some smart cards, there is even biometrics data in the card for an even higher level of security. Biometric data is used to ensure authenticity of the card’s user before the smart card releases any data to the user. 

In order to use a smart card, you must insert the smart card into the card reader or place it near a card reader. Once the smart card have been verified, the user will be able to complete any transaction they want to make. 
  

==Flash memory==
Flash memory refers to a memory chip that holds its content without power and that can be electronically erased and reprogrammed without being removed from the circuit board, often used in fax machines. It is called Flash memory  because the microchip is organized so that a section of memory cells are erased in a single action or &quot;flash.&quot; Flash memory is used in digital cellular phones, digital cameras, LAN switches, PC Cards for notebook computers, digital set-up boxes, embedded controllers, and other devices. 

There are three forms of flash memory: 1)flash memory card, 2)flash memory sticks and 3)flash memory drives. first of all, flash memory cards are also known as flash ram. It can be inserted in the memory port of the digital cameras, handheld Pc, or other mobile devices. Moreover, this flash cards are removable storage and it doesn't have processor. 
The second kind of flash memory is the flash memory stick that is small and holds more than one gigabyte of data. this is inserted into a memory stick port in different devices as digital cameras, camcorders, notebooks, PC among others. 
The last form is flash memory drive which is also called USB drive flash card. This is  typically small, lightweight, removable and rewritable. It  also holds more data, and may be more reliable. The capacity of storage is up to 2 gigabytes, so people do not have to carry their laptops, this flash card can be inserted into computer's USB port or USB hub

==Online secondary storage==
Do you know that there is another way to storage information besides zip drive, memory stick, and floppy disk?. This is online secondary storage. People also can back up info using this service on internet. This way is utilized by companies to save their information as a backup. In the past, companies have lost lot of information when they experienced flood and fire. Some services are free, but another you have to pay. Some online storage companies offer internet backup as a service online.  These companies are Driveway, Magical Desk and Backup among others. Online storage means that companies can storage confidential information in a safety way on internet and they will have a copy if they lost the original information. Also, this info can be shared with employees that are in different parts of the world and can be updated in anywhere. Some companies have decided to store information due to the fact that they are lost very important information due to virus, hardware theft, or when the software is not working properly. This storage is reliable, how does internet backup work? First, people have to buy a software and install it in its hard drive

== Holographic Storage==
Holographic Storage is just what you can imagine it to be. A type of 3D storage system that records images/data on a holographic disk or cartridge. Why would you use this besides it sounding awesome? It's insanely fast and holds a lot of space. This is possible because this type of storage uses light to send data. One single flash of light holds over one million bits of data. This is what makes it fast and can hold a substantial amount. A hologram is also stored through the thickness of the medium. For example, a disk has a spiral track that holds its data. A hologram on the other had is layered over it almost like a stack of sliced cheese, except much more miniscule. 
So how is this done? A holographic drive splits the light it is receiving into two beams.  The angle of the reference beam determines where the data will be stored. The other beam called the signal beam goes through a device (spatial light modulator) and translates the data in the light into a 3D model. 
The image describes this process. [[File:Hologram maken (1).svg|thumb|Hologram maken (1)]]
#Laser beam used to write or read data
#This is where the beam is split
#This is the reference beams path.
#This is where the signal beam passes through the spacial light modulator and translates the data
#This is where the data is read and it is projected onto a detector to be reconstructed


==Cloud Storage==
Cloud storage is a remote storage device accessed through the internet. This storage can be accessed on demand therefore bringing convenience to you. There are some applications out there like Google Docs and Flickr where you can store things and access. Typically users of site like these would create an password protected account and choose files to be private or shared with specific individuals. This type of storage is increasing in users because of the availability of their files. They can log on to any computer or mobile device to access their files and this ensures that no matter where you are you have your important files with you. Online storage is also convenient because you can back up your files regularly therefore protecting your files even if your computer crashes. Most of these sites offer this type of storage for free.

'''Deployment'''[[File:Cloud computing types.svg|409x242px|right]]

There are also different types of cloud deployment.  There is a public cloud in which a provider make the storage accessible to the public either for free or at a fee.  Private clouds are used by single organization and are only accessible to users granted access in that organization.  Private clouds are either operated internaly or externally depending on the organization's needs and capabilities.  Community clouds are used by users over a number of organizations that have common concerns such as security, compliance etc.  Hybrid models are made up of 2 or 3 of the different types of clouds but still remaining unique in their own opperations but offering communication between the different types without losing their original integrity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Algebra Page}}
A Quadratic function is a [[Algebra/Polynomials|polynomial]] where the highest power is two. The basic form of this function is: F(X) = ax² + bx + c. Where, ax² is the ''quadratic term'', bx is the ''linear term'' and c is the ''independent term'' or &quot;constant&quot;, which does not depend on the variable, x. The letters a and b are called &quot;coefficients&quot;, a being the &quot;leading coefficient&quot;. The standard form is F(X) = ax² + bx + c.
The x-intercepts of the function are:


&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{ 2a} &lt;/math&gt;  OR  &lt;math&gt; x = \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} &lt;/math&gt; 


The independent term is also the y-coordinate of the point of intersection with the y-axis (when X=0, F(X)=C).

A quadratic function has a &quot;vertex&quot; or &quot;turning point&quot;, which is the point where the function has either a maximum or minimum value.  If a is greater than zero, then there will be a minimum and the curve will be convex.  If a is less than zero, then there will be a maximum and the curve will be concave.  If a = 0, then we have a linear function rather than a quadratic function.The x-coordinate of the vertex is &lt;math&gt; x = -\frac{b}{2a} &lt;/math&gt; The y-coordinate of the vertex is &lt;math&gt; F(-\frac{b}{2a}) &lt;/math&gt;

The general form of a quadratic equation is actually F(X) = ax² + bxy + cy² + dx + ey + f = 0, which can take many shapes including circles, ellipses and parabolas, but in most Western high schools, quadratic equation refers only to those of the form F(X) = ax² + bx + c, which forms a parabola.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{useful|WJ:SG}}

This page describes how to write good content for Wikijunior. It is not intended to substitute for or contradict anything in the Wikibooks [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]. Rather it is intended to clarify and help editors write for the intended audience of Wikijunior.

===Think about Your Readers===
First, think about your audience. [[Wikijunior]] books are for children. Children do not have the same interests or capabilities as adults. Also a twelve year old child has vastly different capabilities to process written information from a six year old child. Each book should discuss its intended audience including the specific age of the expected readership.

===Think about the Whole Book===
Remember that each individual article or chapter is part of a larger book. Use a writing style and format that is consistent with the rest of the book. Don’t repeat information given in other articles or chapters.

===Style===
The writing style you use should be simple and direct. Writing so that children can understand is very important. Write conversationally, as you would speak to another person. Write positively and with enthusiasm.

* Use active voice. 
::For example: Write &quot;The cat ate the bird.&quot; instead of &quot;The bird was eaten by the cat.&quot;
* Use correct grammar and spelling.
* Keep sentences short. Break long sentences into smaller sentences.

===Vocabulary=== 

Use common words whenever possible. Do not use big words when simpler language would work.   

* Define words that are not common within the article itself, or in a glossary.  

* Define technical vocabulary or jargon as it is used. 

* Do not use slang, figures of speech or local idioms. 

* Effective use of adjectives and adverbs make your writing more compelling.  

::For example: In the sentence &quot;She wept bitterly.&quot; the verb &quot;wept&quot; is intensified by the adverb &quot;bitterly&quot;.

===Accuracy===
It is important that Wikijunior books are accurate. Wikijunior books should use Neutral Point of View (NPOV) as defined and practiced by all Wikimedia projects. This does not mean that all points of view need to be represented, just that no point of view is given undue weight. If there is a well-known controversy about a subject, simply mentioning that there is a controversy without going into detail may be appropriate. 

If the book is about a science topic it should reflect scientific consensus. When you use words and phrases like “probably”, “might have”, and “experts think that”, give more information to explain why people think what they do. 

:For example:  Instead of “Experts think Velociraptor had feathers.” you could say “Experts think that Velociraptor had feathers because related dinosaurs had them. ”

Sometimes it is necessary to simplify an idea to make it more understandable for children. If you can explain a concept with Newtonian physics, it's not necessary to explain it with quantum physics. However it is important that these simplifications be identified as such within the text. 

Analogies can help young people understand complex or unusual concepts. When explaining a challenging concept, think about ways in which it is similar to something kids are likely to have experienced, and write that analogy.

===Information to Include===
Authors should concentrate on the most important concepts and interesting facts rather than writing about every minor detail. Keep individual articles and chapters concise. Include unique and interesting facts about the subject, facts that could strike the imagination of young readers.

===Pictures and Diagrams===
Children like books with pictures. Sometimes a photo can convey important and interesting facts about a subject that would be difficult to express in text. Use pictures to help explain ideas and illustrate the subject of the text frequently, whenever it makes sense. Pictures should illustrate what things look like. Captions should explain the photograph or diagram and also include some interesting information about the subject. For example: 

:Instead of “A picture of a lion.” a better caption would be “A sleeping lion. Lions sleep up to 20 hours a day.”</text>

      <comment>moved [[Wikijunior talk:Style Guide]] to [[Wikijunior talk:Style guide]]: Consistency</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Comments==
This is in rough draft form, but I thought it was needed so I put it up hoping that others can help me clean it up. Comments? --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 01:31, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

I have put up a set of topics for discussion related to the Style Guide. They are there because I am not sure of the answers. Any constructive input is welcome. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 14:42, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

==Audience==
Is there anything additional we should say about the audience for the book? Should we mandate that books describe the intended audience?

: From [[Wikijunior]]:
:: ''The aim of this project is to produce a series of full-color booklets for children aged 8 to 11.''
: I think this is fine. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 11:46, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

==Reading Levels==
The reading capabilities of 8 year olds are very different from 12 year olds, do we need to be more specific about the audience of each book?

: This does makes sense. Unfortunately, however, I'm not sure that the majority of contributors will have a good understanding of what these reading capabilities are. I also think it would be close to impossible to specify any further the audience within the current three or four year range. The Style Guide can certainly mention this dilemma (just avoid [[Wikibooks:Instruction Creep|instruction creep]]).
: I imagine some topics may appeal more to children at a certain level and there contributors should strive to match the text to the most likely audience. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 12:02, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

==Talking down==
Should we mention that talking down should be avoided? How can talking down be recognized/avoided? 

==Grade Level==
Is there any way to quantify the reading level that we should mention here? 

I'm not sure how useful something like Flesch Grade level is. In the article on Velociraptors, if you change the word velociraptor into a nonsense 2 syllable word like &quot;veepo&quot; It drops the grade level of the text by 1.5 grades. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:06, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

==Common Words==
What constitutes a common word? Should we try to limit ourselves using lists of common words? I don't think so, but it is helpful for me to use http://www.online-utility.org/english/simple_basic_helper.jsp to identify words that might be problematic. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:06, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

: I don't think so either. This should probably be up to the discretion of the contributors. If that tool is mentioned, it should also be noted that it is by no means normative and simply an aid. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 12:06, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

==American or British English==
Are American or British English spellings to be used? Should it be mixed or different from book to book?

: Consistent within a book. Chosen by principle author. This should be in the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]]. --12:11, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

==NPOV==
Is [[w:WP:NPOV|Neutral Point of View]] appropriate for writing for children? -- &quot;All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by a reliable source.&quot; 

Do we really want to represent '''all significant''' views? The contrasting points of view seem like they might be confusing and frustrating for kids. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:06, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

: No, we don't need to represent everything. NPOV is a requirement that those points represented aren't represented unfairly. So if you think there is too much clutter, just reduce the presentation of all evenly, pointing out common threads and just mentioning the areas of disagreement or discreptancy. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 12:14, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

==Scientific Consensus==
Does the term scientific consensus need to be defined?

: I fear that it cannot be defined. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 12:16, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

==Weasel Words ==
Should [[w:WP:AWW|Weasel words]] be discussed here? 

The example Concerning velociraptor's feathers is a weasely statement. Is the suggestion to stipulate the reasoning when using weasel words adequate? I don't know and would like to hear other opinions. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:06, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

: Difficult one. I'd propose we don't explicitly say anything about this and address it when we have some more experience with the issues specific to Wikijunior texts. My initial impression is that these aren't really a problem because the WJ modules won't cover as controversial topics as other Wikibooks and thus weasel words will automatically be conservatively used. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 12:24, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

==Scientific Simplification==
Is simplification of scientific concepts advisable? Should we write things that are not strictly true in order to make them more easily understood?

I think scientific simplification will be necessary. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:06, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

: No. Never should concepts be simplified beyond truth! What use is there in understanding something which has no existance in &amp;mdash; only mere similarity to &amp;mdash; reality. If parallels are drawn with more conventionally understood concepts, the limits should (as with any audience) be mentioned so that readers don't draw unwarranted conclusions. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 12:43, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
:: I agree. Teaching falsehoods will only hurt readers, who will later have to learn the truth. Also, it may embarrass them if they tell an oversimplified fact to a teacher. If something cannot be simplified, it should not be included. [[wikipedia:user:pcu123456789|PCU123456789]] ([[wikipedia:user_talk:pcu123456789|talk]]) 01:04, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

==Interesting facts==
How does one identify which facts are interesting to kids?

: Ask some or think back to when you were one? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 12:44, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

==Pictures==
Is there anything else we should say about pictures?</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Fibrosarcoma'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Benign Fibrous Histologies==
*Nodular fasciitis: rapid growth over several weeks, pain, tenderness. Plump mature fibroblasts. Self-limiting process; recurrence uncommon after excision
*Fibroma: nonspecific term. Dense fibrous nodule. Simple excision
*Elastofibroma: rare, slow-growing benign tumor. Typically lower portion of the scapula. Repetitive manual tasks. Considered reactive lesions. Swollen eosinophilic collagen and elastic fibers. Simple excision
*Superficial fibromatosis: arise from fascia or aponeuroses, small and slow growing
**Palmar fibormatosis ([[Radiation Oncology/Benign/Dupuytrens|Dupuytren's contracture]]) most common
**Penile fibromatosis ([[Radiation Oncology/Benign/Peyronie's Disease|Peyronie's disease]]) relatively rare, though more common in men who have palmar fibromatosis
*Deep fibromatosis: clinically diverse, deep-seated fibrous neoplasms
**For more detail, please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Benign/Desmoid|Desmoid tumor]] page


==Fibrosarcoma Epidemiology==
*2-6% of primary malignant bone lesions
*Arise most commonly in tubular long bones, usually femur or tibia
*Most patients are 30-70; equal men and women
*Predisposing factors (~30% cases) include Paget's, fibrous dysplasia, osteomyelitis, bone infarcts, bone cysts, benign giant cell tumors, desmoplastic fibromas, or previous RT treatment


==Natural History==
*Locally aggressive
*Metastatic potential related to grade
**High grade similar to osteosarcoma: 5-year OS ~25%
**Low grade: 5-year (and 10-year) OS ~50%. Mets rate 5-15%
*Survival: 5-year 34%, 10-year 28%, 20-year 25%
*Children have relatively milder prognosis


==Diagnosis==
*Lytic with no reactive sclerosis
*High grade lesions show cortical destruction and periosteal reaction; sometimes with soft-tissue mass
*Radiographically very similar to [[Radiation_Oncology/Sarcoma/Osteosarcoma|osteosarcoma]]


==Staging==
*Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Bone/Staging|bone staging]] page


==Treatment Overview==
*Aggressive surgical resection
*Not considered highly radiosensitive, but RT recommended for inoperable tumors, residual disease, and palliation
*Perez (4th ed) recommends dosese 66-70Gy with shrinking-field technique</text>

      <comment>Smartcards</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A smart card is a small credit card sized microprocessor that enables us to conduct daily activities much faster and simpler.  The inside of a smart card is embedded with a microprocessor (like a brain of a computer) that is responsible for keeping track of the information on the card and processes the use of the smart card.  Currently, some smart cards here in North America have magnetic stripes to track the information.  The problem with this is that the stripe can be hacked into and read, re-written over, deleted, and changed.  In Europe, all smart cards have actual intelligence, where the microprocessor is placed under a contact pad on the back of the card and it is read by computer networks for verification and processing.  Smart cards have different amounts of RAM and programmable ROM.  The card reader powers it up and reads the information while updating it with every use.  Some places you use a smart card include entrance into a building (you scan the card for the door to open every time you enter), banking machines, vending machines, gas pumps, air miles, and even your Mount Royal ID is a smart card.

==Contact Smart Cards==
Contact Cards require insertion into a smart card reader with a direct connection to a conductive micro-module on the surface of the card.

The basic idea of a smart-card is to transfer and save date to a single chip sized storage. This gives people the freedom of downloading more content compared to not having one and downloading to phone space. Smart cards are made of plastic, generally polyvinyl chloride. They also provide a strong firewall to keep data safe from outsiders. Since smart-cards have become very popular, society has been forced to create numerous smart-card readers ranging from laptop readers to ATM cards. Smart-cards give the best possible way to carry data with such a small chip that can be held by anything you desire.

==Contactless Smart Cards==

A smart card that uses radio frequencies to provide a wireless connection to the reader. The transmission range is only a couple of inches, but allows the card to be quickly passed by a reader in applications such as secured entrances.

Contactless smart cards use radio frequency (RF) technology to interact with a reader. The market for these cards is growing rapidly, creating tremendous new opportunities for issuers. Popular applications include transit cards for fare payment, employee IDs in government and corporate environments, e-passports and other secure travel documents, and cards for cashless payment. Other high-security applications will appear soon. [http://www.datacard.com/pages/ssc_subpage.jhtml?contentId=403097717spY0KHMLlX]

==Smart Card/RFID tag Privacy Concerns==

While there are many advantages to RFID technology, there are also some disadvantages.  Privacy is a concern and because RFID technology is still in the early stages of development, the flaws in security are still prevalent.  Until some of the privacy concerns are addressed and resolved RFID/Smart Card technology will have a difficult time gaining widespread acceptance.


RFID will have a difficult time gaining widespread acceptance due to the issues of privacy. What will this type of technology mean for consumers?  When consumers buy products, there is a possibility that they can be tracked.  Some states are issuing driver licenses with RFID chips, so which mean any driver can be located. It is a fear that RFID can track a person's movement and make that information readily available, and compromise a person's anonymity.  It is also a fear of fraud and identity theft.  RFID will have a difficult time gaining widespread acceptance until some security measures are put in place.</text>

Needs a little something about dual flush, saving water perhaps. [[User:Brucelaidlaw|Brucelaidlaw]] ([[User talk:Brucelaidlaw|talk]]) 03:21, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

Most of the toilets I have seen use a flapper valve mechanism for dumping water from the tank to the bowl, instead of a siphon.  Maybe worth discussing the alternative mechanism, or at least mentioning that it exists.
[[User:Roger wilco|Roger wilco]] ([[User talk:Roger wilco|talk]])

The illustrations are great - nice job. However, one might benefit from an animated GIF. Would someone be able to take the models and do that?

               '''There are 3 types of files in Qbasic:'''

                      1. Sequential files
                      2. Random-Access files
                      3. Binary files
--------------------------------------------------------------------
'''Sequential''' files are the simplest. None too surprisingly, these save records in sequence - like lines in a book. The information in Sequential files is stored as ASCII text, so everything you can see on the screen exists in the computer's memory, and these files can be processed by text editors as well as by Qbasic.

how come there is not a  summary for wise children on chapter four?

== A wise child!!  ==

In chapter 4 of Wise childre, the there is a sense of higher negativity from Carter. we are told of Lady' a's accident and what happen to her, hence the name &quot;wheelchair&quot;. On pager 165, low brow gets even lower. Dora and Noras high life decreases to alot less high brow shows such as pantomines in

== Expanding Plot Summary for Chapters 3 and 4  ==
noticed that the plot summary on this Wikibook was a mere sentence or two for these chapters, yet the Wikipedia article has a fuller explaination. I've therefore copied them over into this article. I'm personally a little hazy on these chapters, so I can't write my own, and I'm not sure on the policy on copying chunks of information from Wikipedia (articles from both websites are licenced the same), but if there are any objections feel free to revert back.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;Font face=&quot;schwaben alt&quot; color=&quot;007600&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; The Conjugation of Nominals
== What are Nominals? ==


In Finnish Grammar, nominals are those words that can take a ''case form'' ('''sijamuoto''') usually in either singular or the plural. 

These words are in the following word groups

* Nouns  -  the names of things (physical or conceptual) e.g. car, factory, love, wonder.
* Adjectives – words that add description to nouns e.g. big, green, deep, dark, heavy.
* Numbers – one, two, three, hundred, thousand,  etc. 
* Pronouns – me, you, she, they, it etc. 

==What are case forms?==

Case forms in Finnish add extra description according to the situation. Each case is explained in a different section of this book. The grammatical term for adding a case to a word is known as “inflection”. The Finnish word for this is “taivutus” derived from the word ‘’taivuttaa’’  ‘to bend’. Finnish is a highly inflected language. There are as many as 15 different case forms in Finnish although not every case form can be applied to every word. English by comparison has very few case inflections. The most common in English is the plural s (so cat &gt; cats) and the genitive ‘s (cat &gt; cat’s) and the plural genitive s’ (cat &gt; cats’).

==Nominative – the Dictionary Form==

Because Finnish has so many case forms, dictionaries usually show just one case form for each word.  In the case of NOMINALS, this case form is the NOMINATIVE SINGULAR. It is sometimes called the citation form because it is the declarative form. 

If in Finnish we ask &quot;what is this?&quot;, and the answer is &quot;a table&quot;, the word for table come back in the NOMINATIVE or citation form.
*'''Mikä tämä on?  Se on pöytä.'''
**''What is this?  It is a table.''
***'''Pöytä''' ''table'' (nominative singular) 
 
Because the nominative singular has no special ending and is the citation form, it is the basic form found in the dictionary.

==Stems and endings==

Most words when modified according to case (or situation), the word can be thought of as having two parts. The first part called '''the stem''' (in Finnish: '''vartalo'''), and the second part called '''the ending''' (in Finnish: '''pääte''').

Some words have stem forms that are identical to their citation form. For example, the imported word '''auto''' meaning ''car'' or ''automobile.

'''Auto'''   (nominative singular case) ''car''

'''Autot'''  (nominative plural case)  ''cars''

'''Auton'''   (genetive singular case)  ''car's''

'''Autossa'''  (inessive singular case)  ''In the car''

Here we can see that this word has a stem form

'''Auto-''' 

onto which the case form ending is added. The nominative plural ending for example is -t and is simply added to the stem. 

==Plural Stems==

In the preceding section we saw that the nominative plural is made by adding the -t ending is added to the stem. But oddly enough, this stem is in fact the singular stem. Most nominals in fact, also have a plural stem. For example if we wanted to say &quot;in the cars&quot; we cannot mix the -t nominative plural ending with the -ssa inessive case. Only one case ending can be added to a word. So instead we add the -ssa case ending to the plural stem.

The plural stem is usually formed by adding the letter i to the singular stem. 

'''Autoissa'''  (inessive plural case)  ''In the cars''
*''Auto + i + ssa

So car has a singular stem auto- and a plural stem autoi-.  In fact this word has an alternate plural stem autoj- because when the letter i appears between two vowels its pronunciation is more like the y in the word yellow, which in Finnish morphology is written as j. Because Finnish has a letter for this sound, the transcription of the written form of the word follows this pattern.

Thus

'''Autoja''' (partitive plural case) = auto + i + a &gt; autoja (because the i in '''oia''' is pronounced as '''j''' and is therefore spelled that way.


==Stem modifications==

Because of phonetic modifications, especially the effect known as Consonant Gradation, some words have more than one stem form, though with practise it is usually easy to determine what they are.

'''tehdas'''  (nominative singular case) ''factory''  (tehdas)

'''tehtaat'''  (nominative plural case) ''factories''  (tehtaa- + -t)

'''tehdasta'''  (partitive singular case) ''factory''  (tehdas + -ta)

'''tehtaan'''  (genitive singular case) ''factory’s''  (tehtaa- + -n)

'''tehtaiden'''  (genitive plural case) ''factories’''  (tehtai- + -den)

'''tehtaasta'''  (elative singular case)  ''from the factory''  (tehtaa- + -sta)

'''tehtaista'''  (elative plural case)  ''from the factories'' (tehtai- + -sta)
 
**Note that despite appearances, tehdasta is a partitive form and not an elative form!  

So we can see that the Finnish word meaning factory basically has a stem tehtaa- in the singular and tehtai in the plural, but an alternative stem form tehdas- which is only seen in the nominative and partitive singular. 

In other words, the behaviour of this word is seemingly quite unlike auto.

==Do I have to learn the inflections of words?==

Yes!  

Consider a sentence in English like 'yesterday I bought some expensive new boots'. You will probably find all these words in an English dictionary. If it is a very small dictionary, you may not find the word ''bought'' because it is an inflected form of the verb ''buy''. So if you were learning English, you would need to learn the inflections of the verbs, but most nominals would be easy as they are easily recognised even if they are inflected. Not so Finnish. 
Eilen mä ostin uudet kalliit saappaat. You will only find eilen in the dictionary. Mä is not inflected but is in a common abbreviated form and all the other words are in inflected forms. It is only when you understand how words &quot;bend&quot; into these forms that you can effectively learn to &quot;unbend&quot; them.  Eventually you will get the hang of it.

==How do I know how to inflect nominals correctly?==

This is a good question!  

The answer in part is that many words like tehdas follow a pattern, and once you have learned to recognise the pattern, you can follow the rule and apply it to other words of the same type.  In the case of tehdas , the rule affects all nominals ending in –is or –as.  Most of the sections under the heading of Inflection of Nominals in this book detail the patterns you need to recognise and how to inflect the words. 

The bad news is that there are some classes of words where it is completely impossible to tell from looking at the nominal or dictionary form how it will behave. The biggest class of these are words ending in –i, of which there are rather a lot. Most of them fall under one of two headings and which of the two they belong to is a matter of sheer learning and familiarity.  It is possible to buy dictionaries that show the correct form (For example the Nykysuomen Keskeinen Sanasto (ISBN 951-20-6686-6) or when you find a new word in a text and see how it is used, just remember the way that it was inflected so that you yourself can inflect it correctly the next time you need to use it. So it is not so bad. 

Now read on to see how the various types of word inflect. 

Good luck!

      <comment>/* Bipolar Motors */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Electronic_component_stepping_motors.jpg|thumb|300px|Usual stepper motors from a HDD, scanner and printers]]

'''Stepper Motors''' are devices that turn a shaft by a small set angle (usually between 1 and 5 degrees) at a time. This is done very precisely, and so they are very useful for application requiring motion that does not have any feedback to govern the motor speed. However, they cannot be simply driven by a DC or AC voltage like simpler motors; they need more complex circuitry to drive them.

For more information on stepper motors, please visit [[Electric Motors And Generators#Stepper | the &quot;Stepper&quot; page in the ''Wikibook of Electric Motors and Generators.'']] For this book, we will just look at the basics. There are two kinds of stepper motor - '''unipolar''' and '''bipolar'''. Bipolar motors are the simplest, so we will look at those first.

==Bipolar Motors==

Bipolar motors have two coils, each with a connection at each end, giving a total of four wires. It is possible to identify which wires are which, as the resistance between wires of different coils will be infinite. Generally, the connections are named in schematics, 1a and 1b being the two connections for one coil and 2a and 2b being for the other coil.

To drive a bipolar stepper motor by one step, the coils have to be energized in a particular sequence. Consider just one coil; if 1a is held high and 1b is held low, the coil is said to conduct forwards. If 1a is at ground and 1b is high, then it conducts backwards. To drive the stepper motor, the coils have to be switched from conducting forwards to conducting backwards alternately.

The input voltages to the four wires in order to drive the motor forward on step are shown in the table below. The coil polarities generated by this sequence are shown on the far right of the table.

{| class=wikitable  style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; align=center
!rowspan=5|[[Image:Stepper_Motor_Bipolar_Coils.svg]]!!Seq.!!width=40|1a!!width=40|1b!!width=40|2a!!width=40|2b!!Coil 1 Polarity!!Coil 2 Polarity

|2||-||+||+||-||Backwards||Forwards
|-
|3||-||+||-||+||Backwards||Backwards
|-
|4||+||-||-||+||Forwards||Backwards
|}

There are many ways to produce this sequence, from using basic logic to incorporating the control into a micro-controller. Below is the circuit diagram for a motor controller made of simple logic components. Every time there is a low-to-high transition on the STEP input, the circuit advances the output on stage. The DIR input controls the direction of the step; if it is high, it steps one way, if it is low it steps the other way.

[[Image:Stepper_Motor_Driver_CD.png|center|550px]]

However, this circuit cannot drive a stepper motor by itself, as the logic outputs cannot supply nearly enough current. Some sort of amplification is needed. A dual [[/Practical Electronics/H-Bridge|H-Bridge]] arrangement can provide the necessary current and voltage reversal:

[[Image:Bipolar_Stepper_Motor_H-bridge.png|centre|400px]]
 
Recommended transistors for driving stepper motors are MOSFETs IRF510 or IRF530 (N-channel) and IRF9520 or IRF9530 (P-channel). These have built in clamping diodes, so the D1-D8 in the above circuit are unnecessary. If you are operating at high currents, it is wise to keep them for added protection. However any kind of power transistor (FET or BJT) should be suitable for this, as long as the current required to drive the motor does not exceed the rating of the transistor.

==Unipolar Motors==

Unipolar motors have a more complex system of coil windings, but a simpler method of driving. Instead of having two connections, a unipolar motor coil has three - there is a centre tap on each coil. Unipolar motors have six leads therefore, in two groups of three. Sometimes there are just five, as the centre taps may be joined internally.

To identify unmarked leads, first find the two triplets of wires - there will be no connection at all between the triplets. Then, find the centre tap - this is the wire with equal resistance between it and the other two wires in the triplet. If the centre taps are joined together internally, this will be more difficult, but by trial and error, it should be possible. Usually, however, the connection can be worked out by looking carefully as the wires as they come out of the motor - they will often be physically grouped into triplets or connected to a small PCB with the connections laid out logically.

By holding this centre tap at a common voltage (probably ground) and switching the voltage used to power to motor from one end of the coil to the other, the direction of voltage flow can be reversed.

{| align=center
|[[image:Stepper Motor Unipolar Coils.svg|200px]]||[[image:Stepper_Motor_Unipolar_Coil_Reversal.svg]]
|}

The windings in unipolar motors are '''bifilar''', meaning there are two coils wound on top of each other - one connecting the &quot;a&quot; connector to the centre tap and one connecting the &quot;b&quot; connector to the centre tap. Because each half of the bifilar winding is as big as one coil in a bipolar motor, unipolar motors tend to be wider than bipolar motors.

The advantage of unipolar motors is that there is no need for H-bridge drivers because all that needs to be done is to apply a high voltage to one of the connectors when the coil is to be energised - the other end does not need an opposite treatment, it can just be disconnected rather than having to be connected to the opposite power rail.

The sequence of voltages applied to connectors 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b is the same as before, so the system of XOR gates and JK flip-flops (or PIC, etc) can be used for unipolar motors. The transistor driver circuit is simpler, however:

[[Image:Unipolar_Stepper_Motor_Driver.png|centre|400px]]

Any kind of power transistor (FET or BJT) should be suitable for this, as long as the current required to drive the motor does not exceed the rating of the transistor. Suggested transistors are IRF520, TIP31, TIP120, etc. Again, if the transistors have built in clamping diodes, the separate diodes are not needed, but will not do any damage if left in (suitable is any diode with voltage and forward current values similar to the transistor).

If need be, unipolar motors can have the centre taps ignored and be used as bipolar motors. This will result in less torque as the coils are twice as long and so have twice the resistance and half the current. Alternatives, ignore one of the end connections and use one half of the winding. This should provide exactly the same characteristics as the motor when used normally. However, care should be taken to insulate the dangling wire as it will act like an auto-transformer and double the voltage applied to the lower half-coil.

Here is what the user interface would look like:

         &lt;xf:label&gt;Password: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
      &lt;/xf:secret&gt;
      &lt;/fieldset&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Testing ==
The login characters should be echoed back but the password field should just echo a &quot;*&quot; character for every character the user types.

== Discussion ==
The values for the login and password are stored directly in the model.

This example uses a CSS style sheet to put the labels and fieldset legend in bold and align the login and password labels.

By default the fieldset box stretches the entire width of the page.  You can make it static by adding a style attribute with the width set to 250 pixels like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;fieldset style=&quot;width: 250px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Scientists classify all living things into different groups. This helps to see what some animals have in common and how related some animals are. It is like building a family tree for living things. They classify cats as well. All cats are in the family Felidae.

In English, a Puma may be called a cougar in one place or a mountain lion somewhere else.  Animals also have different names in other languages like Russian, Greek and Spanish.  To prevent confusion, scientists agree on a single Latin name for each animal.  Some early humans did draw pictures of mammoths, mastodons, and European cave lions, but any common names for these extinct animals are forgotten.  That's why many fossil big cats have an odd scientific name like ''Miraconyx inexpectatus'' instead of a short, graceful name like ''Cheetah''.

'''''Euphorbia maculata''''', variously called '''Spotted spurge''' or '''Prostrate spurge''', is an annual plant in the family [[../Euphorbiaceae/]], native to North America. It grows in sunny locations and a variety of soils, and frequently found as a weed of gardens and lawns, and can also grow well in the cracks of hardscapes or walls.

==Description==
''Euphorbia maculata'' is a low-growing, spreading, annual plant with reddish stems. The leaves are bluish-green on the margins, and red along the midribs. The flowers are tiny, and are produced within a few weeks of germination, quickly followed by the small seeds. 

==Ecology==
&lt;!--distribution, invasiveness, allelopathy, noxious weed status, etc.--&gt;

==Uses==
&lt;!--garden, crop, fodder, medicinal, material etc.--&gt;

==Control==
Early action is crucial with this weed because of the short period between germination and the setting of seeds. The seeds will germinate in wood and stone mulches as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Updating the Model ==
Many developers of traditional JavaScript-based forms are not accustomed to variables automatically updating for them.  With XForms, you can easily create a complex system where XForms automatically figures out what cells to update.  This is similar to using a spreadsheet.  A dependency graph is automatically created for you and the appropriate cells are automatically updated if an input they depend upon changes.

Here is an example program that demonstrates this.

== Screen Image ==
Here is a screen capture of the application:

[[Image:XForms-spreadsheet-update.jpg|frame|center]]

Note that top grid is actually just unlabeled input cells.  Below that is a sample output inside a table.  You should be able to change any of the input cells, enter a tab, and see the output and the footer calculations change.

            &lt;/tbody&gt;
         &lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;/xf:group&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
Due to limitations with some of the XForms implementations this example does not use the &quot;repeat&quot; command but just addresses each cell directly by its address.

== Suggested Improvements ==
This example could be a lot simpler if we used the repeat-nodeset statement in a table.  This currently does not work with input cells using FormFaces.

== Recipe for Perfect Roast Beef with Roast potatoes ==

Roast Beef has been a staple of many countries diets for centuries, as noted, for example in the English ballad, &quot;[[:Wikipedia:The Roast Beef of Old England|The Roast Beef of Old England]], written between 1731 and 1751:

:''When mighty Roast Beef was the Englishman's food''
:''It ennobled our brains and enriched our blood.''
:''Our soldiers were brave and our courtiers were good''
:''Oh the Roast Beef of old England and old English Roast Beef''

==Ingredients==
===For the Roast beef===
*1 Joint of Rib or rolled rib beef of good quality (about 3 pounds or 1.5 kg, for 4 people)
*if possible, some extra beef bones
*1/2 cup of sifted flour
*1 teaspoon (5ml) salt (rock salt preferred)
*1 pinch of ground black pepper (as much as can be held between the finger/thumb)
*1/4 cup olive oil or other good cooking oil
*2 cups of water
*1 onion
*1 glass of red wine

===For gravy===
*1 teaspoon (45 ml) of red jam (mix with a little water and strain out the seeds if using raspberry or blackberry)
*1 pinch of nutmeg
*1 teaspoon (5 ml) of Lea and Perrin's Worcestershire Sauce and/or Maggi stock
*1 more glass of red wine

===For the Roast potatoes===
*Preferably use Maris Piper potatoes. The quantity of potatoes depending on how many people are coming to table. 3 pounds or 1.5 kg. of potatoes for 4 people.
*1 tablespoon (15 ml) of flour
*2 tablespoons (30 ml) of goose fat.

===Recommended Accompaniments===
*[[Cookbook:Yorkshire Pudding|Yorkshire pudding]]
*Roast parsnips
*Boiled or steamed green beans
*Cabbage with a little bacon

===Condiments===
*Horseradish sauce or creamed horseradish
*English mustard (preferably mixed from dry ground mustard. Colemans in the yellow tin is still the best)

== Buying...==

Best buy a 'joint' of Rib, Wing Rib or Sirloin Beef (I believe in the U.S. it is called Prime Rib, and is usually excellent) from a reliable butcher, and preferably not from a supermarket. If rolled, the Sirloin should come preferably 'bone in'. The word 'joint' is used in the U.K. to refer to any large lump of meat for roasting, whether or not it actually contains a joint (hip or shoulder) of an animal.

A boneless 3 pound or 1.5 kg 'joint' will be enough for 4 people with some left over. If the meat is bone-in (still has bones in it) then double the weight required.

Also best you don't buy simply for the number of people expected at table. Cold roast beef is also delicious.  Allow for 'fridge thieves', cold lunches and at least 3 rounds of Beef and Horseradish Sandwiches in the days to come. So, let's be straight here, the larger the joint, the better!

==Identifying...==
Make sure your joint has a good quantity of 'marbling' - cream-coloured fat both around the outside, as well as some through the meat itself. If the joint is coloured bright red, steer clear. It has not been hung long enough. It may be cheaper, but such a cut will sacrifice quality.

Supermarket meat has often been treated with a harmless chemical to make it look bright red, before it is sealed in plastic. It is difficult to determine the condition of such meat so unless you have no choice, buy from a specialist butcher.

All meat, and in particular, beef must be well hung. At least 20 days, so the colour of the meat is more a dark maroon, rather than bright red. If a ribbed joint looks just a little shrivelled, that's fine too.

==When to buy...==
If you're planning your roast beef for a Sunday lunch, please remember to buy the joint by Thursday lunchtime. Most butchers sell out fast thereafter as the weekend quickly approaches.

When purchased, place the roast high in the fridge on a dish - its best not to freeze it - together with the bones and a quartered onion, and cover with foil. Turn it over occasionally making sure you don't drain any juices which may seep out.

==Roasting...==
On the morning of cooking, get the Beef joint out of the fridge, and let it stand to warm up to room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) and place the roasting tin you propose to use in the oven to heat up. If you have a spare one, place another onion in the tin as it heats up. Try and use a cast-iron roasting tin. They conduct heat better.

Now, mix some plain flour, a little rock-salt and a good pinch of ground pepper, and 'dust' the fatty edges of the joint with the mixture, moistening the fat first by wiping it with a damp cloth, so the flour sticks better.

In a large frying pan, heat some olive oil, then seal (i.e. briefly fry) the fatty edges of the meat until they are a dark brown colour. You may need to hold the joint with a fork whilst you do this to ensure an 'all over tan'. It is a good idea, at this point, to brown the surface of the meat itself. This will trigger Maillard reactions (browning of sugars and amino acids), giving the meat a brown colour, and improving the flavour immensely. At the same time add the spare bones to the frying pan, and make sure these are also well browned too. 

At the end of this process, remove joint and bones from the frying pan. Add a generous glass of a full bodied red wine to the frying pan and 'deglaze' it well. Be careful as the wine might catch on fire! Remember to lower the heat before adding the wine. 

Using the spare beef bones, make a 'bed' for the joint on the bottom of the roasting tin (preferably cast iron) which has been heating up in the oven, adding a coarsely chopped onion to the “bed” . If you have been unable to get some extra bones, see if you can find a roasting rack and place it in the tin. Alternatively, you can sit the joint on roughly chopped vegetables (preferably sweet ones, such as carrots and onions. Also add some leeks and a little bit of celery. Too much celery, however, will add a bitter note to the gravy), which will later help the gravy. The idea is to keep the joint a little raised from the bottom of the tin. It does not need to sit ''in'' the cooking juices. Add a cupful of water and pour the contents of the deglazed frying pan, including the onion, over the joint.

Place the joint on its bed, or on the rack, and put near the top shelf of the oven. Leave the meat to cook, without opening the oven for about 15 minutes.

After 15 minutes at the preheated 200°C (400°F), open the oven and baste the joint, at the same time turning the oven down to about 180°C (350°F). You no longer need to baste the joint now.  

Depending on the way you like your beef, leave the joint in the oven for the following time:

*''for 15 minutes per pound (~450g) if you like it rare''
*''for 20 minutes per pound (~450g) if you like it medium''
*''for 25 minutes per pound (~450g) if you like it well done''

==Letting the meat rest is very important!==

Once the cooking has completed, take the joint out of the roasting tin and place it on its own separate dish, cover it loosely with lots of tin-foil and leave it to &quot;rest&quot; for about 15 minutes in a warm part of the kitchen. If the joint can be stood up, sprinkle a very little rock salt over the top. Adds to the taste.

Resting is absolutely essential, as the juices, which has been drawn towards the surface of the joint will &quot;relax&quot; and diffuse back into the joint. 

The resting time also gives you time to make a delicious gravy and start baking the [[Cookbook:Yorkshire Pudding|Yorkshire pudding]], if that is required.

==A note on carving==

A large sharp carving knife is of course essential, and it may well need a little resharpening during the carving process (remember to wipe the blade on a cloth before re-attacking the meat other you smother the first slice in metal shavings!) 

If you are carving the joint with the bone in, it is regarded as &quot;''de rigueur''&quot; to carve from the outside of the joint parallel to the bone. Very difficult to do, difficult to produce uniform, thin slices, and extremely dangerous as often a small slice of finger or knuckle will add to the taste !!

I suggest carving ''across'' the shortest cross section of the joint, with the joint lying on its side. It is much easier, neater, and affords greater control over the thickness and size of slices you carve. A purist may disagree, but who cares!

== Gravy ==

Place the roasting dish on the stove (if need be light 2 rings, one for either end) and allow the juice to heat up a little. Add a large cup of red wine to the dish, and thoroughly deglaze the dish on a high heat. This will also evaporate the alcohol from the wine. 

Add a little water (if you are cooking vegetables, add a little of their water) and, if to hand, some Worcestershire Sauce or Maggi stock, and once again bring to a low boil.

Now add 1 generous teaspoon of red jam (doesn’t really matter what flavour) a small teaspoon of mustard, and a generous scrape of Nutmeg, and stir in. If you are really feeling naughty, you can add some [[Cookbook:Crème fraîche|Crème fraîche]]!

Continue to heat everything on the stove, adding water (or cream or more red wine, depending on taste) until the gravy begins to thicken just a little, (on its own ''please'' - don't add cornflour!) then carefully sieve the lot, with the gravy reserved in a bowl (don't do what I once did and, without thinking, sieved the gravy over the kitchen sink....!)  

Remember you need ''enough'' gravy for the number of people at the table, and they will take loads of gravy.... it's that good!

By this time, the meat will be ready to carve (thin slices please) and will be delicious served with the roast potatoes, as well as 3 or more side vegetables, for example, roast parsnips, green beans, and cabbage with a little bacon.

Oh... and don't forget some good quality (or better still home made) creamed horse-radish sauce, and Coleman's mustard (mixed from dry powder, ''not'' the ready made mustard) goes with this dish as well, as does of course, [[Cookbook:Yorkshire Pudding|Yorkshire pudding]] which is a savoury batter also cooked in the oven.

== Perfect roast potatoes ==

Start preparing the potatoes about 1 hour before the Beef joint roasting will be finished. 

Buy some floury potatoes that aren't too big (but then that aren't too small) Whatever you do DON'T buy &quot;new&quot; potatoes and try and roast them. It may be very trendy, but they are revolting. 

Peel the potatoes and trim them so that they are (more or less) the same size. Retain the peelings.

Put them into a large saucepan which already has plenty of water on a &quot;lively boil&quot;, having added salt and a little olive oil. If you can, place the peelings in a muslin sack and add to the boiling water to give the potatoes a little more taste! (Thanks to Heston Blumenthal for this brilliant idea).

While you are doing this, get a large metal frying pan that can also go in the oven (and if you haven't got one.... buy one!) and heat up some goose fat.

Boil the potatoes for 5 minutes only - no more - and take them off the heat, drain them, and return them to the saucepan... dry.

''Immediately'' add about 1 heaped tablespoon of flour to the saucepan, cover with a well fitting lid, and, holding the lid in place, pretty violently shake the saucepan for about 15 seconds. The purpose of this dramatic action is:
*to impress anyone watching with your sense of implied violence!
*to coat the potatoes with the flour
*to produce a rough and slightly spiky exterior to the potatoes, so they roast better with a crispy exterior.

Now... using a large metal spoon, lift the potatoes, one by one, out of the saucepan, and place them in the, now hot, goose fat in the frying pan. Roll them around gently so that they take on a little colour. This may take 5-10 minutes.

When they have all been in the frying pan... (''who said cooking Sunday lunch was an easy and relaxed affair?!'') drain the oil from the pan, and separate the potatoes a little, or move them carefully onto a rack '''above''' a roasting dish in the oven, i.e. don't place them flat onto a roasting dish or they will tend to become soggy. There should be a gap of about one inch (2.5cm) between each potato. This is vital to let air to circulate thus enabling them to become crispy.

The temperature of the oven really depends on what stage the roast beef is at, about 180°C (350°F). They will take about 30-40 minutes to cook and they should have a golden brown crust.

About twice during the cooking process, take out the tray of potatoes, and with a fork, gently turn them through 90 or so degrees so they become cooked all over. This is not as easy as it sounds, as the potatoes may have formed a crust, so operate carefully. When finished, they will be crispy on the outside, and delightfully fluffy on the inside.

One last point... anything cooked, will produce steam. So, when you are ready to serve them, and if you possibly can, try and find a serving dish where the potatoes can be laid out NEXT to each other, rather than piled upon each other. This will stop any steam they produce from making them soggy. Sometimes, laying them around the Beef joint will serve the purpose.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Deleting an item from a list ==

Here is a sample program to delete an item from a list of items.  The selected item can be deleted by selecting the row you wish to delete and selecting the &quot;Delete&quot; button.  This trigger has the following format:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:trigger&gt;
  &lt;xf:label&gt;Delete&lt;/xf:label&gt;
    &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xf:delete ref=&quot;//Person[index('person-repeat')]&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/xf:action&gt;
&lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

There are two attributes to the delete element.  The nodeset indicates what set of nodes you select the item from and the at indicates the node number.  We used the index function to get the number of the selected node.

The form has a list of people.  You can add and delete to the selected row.

===CSS stylesheet===
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
* {
	font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
label, legend {
  	font-weight: bold;
}
contextcontainer {
	display: table-row;
}
input {
	display: table-cell;
	color: white;
	background-color: gray;
}
/* Display for the selected line */
.xf-repeat-index input {
   color: black;
   background-color: white;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
Note that you can still select a row and insert a new record after it. But you can also select any row and now delete it.

To keep this example simple the header of table columns have been forgotten (see  [[../Repeat into table/]] how the table should behave).

The code for the selected line should be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
*::repeat-index input {
   color: black;
   background-color: white;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
but this doesn't work with Firefox 2.0.0.14 + Mozilla XForms 0.8.5

== To Do ==
Figure out how to modify the style sheet so that the selected row is hilighted.  The XForms documentation implies that ::value is the active areas, ::repeat-item is a single item from a list of repeating sequence and that ::repeat-index is the current item of a repeating sequence

These do not appear to work with the style sheet under FireFox 0.6.

Potential problem: when you have deleted all the nodes, the insert trigger does not work anymore. This is because the nodeset selection on the insert element is empty in that situation. If the nodeset selector is empty, the insert trigger has no meaning (see the first rule in [http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/#action-insert 'rules for insert processing'])

'''''Ailanthus altissima''''' ('''Tree of Heaven''' or '''Ailanthus''') is a member of the quassia family, [[../Simaroubaceae/]], native to northeast and central China, but now present as an invasive weed throughout much of the world.  It is a deciduous tree which grows rapidly and can reach up to 25 m tall, rarely 35 m, with a trunk up to 1 m diameter, rarely 1.5 m diameter. The common name is a direct translation of the Indonesian name ''ailanto'' for a closely related species in the same genus. Other common names include china sumac, copal tree, stinktree and ghetto palm.

The tree is occasionally planted in heavily polluted areas as it is tolerant of both particulate and chemical pollutants, as well as saline soils. Outside those areas, it should never be planted due to its invasive nature.

==Description==
The bark of the tree is smooth and light grey, while the stems are reddish or chestnut. Its large, compound leaves are arranged alternately on the stem, and can be 30-60 cm long (occasionally up to 1 m long on vigorous young sprouts) and contain 11-33 leaflets, occasionally up to 41 leaflets. Each leaflet has one to three teeth on each side, close to the base. This helps distinguish it from sumacs (''Rhus'' spp.).

The flowers are small, yellow-green to reddish, produced in late spring to mid summer in panicles up to 30 cm long. It is dioecious, with trees being either all male or all female. The seed is 5 mm diameter, encapsulated in a samara 4 cm long and 1 cm broad; the samara is twisted, making it spin as it falls, assisting wind dispersal. Female trees can produce more than 300,000 seeds in a year. All parts of the tree produce an unpleasant odour, suggestive of rancid cashews, with male flowers having the strongest smell.

In overall appearance, it is somewhat similar to some species of sumac; Staghorn Sumac ''[[../Rhus typhina/]]'' can be distinguished by sumac's red and slightly hairy stems, as well as leaves that are serrated, instead of having the base teeth of ''A. altissima''. Smooth Sumac ''[[../Rhus glabra/]]'', also lacks the base teeth of ''A. altissima''.  Ailanthus also grows much taller than all sumac species. Seedlings of the Black walnut (''[[../Juglans nigra/]]'') can also sometimes be mistaken for this plant, but their trunks are more slender as a sapling.

==Ecology==
[[Image:Ailanthus altissima1.jpg|350 px|left|Unripe seeds]]
Ailanthus is an opportunistic species, thriving in full sun and in disturbed areas. It does, however, exhibit some shade tolerance. It spreads aggressively both by seeds and vegetatively, through root sprouts. It can resprout rapidly after being cut. Ailanthus is among the most tolerant of all tree species to pollution, including sulfur dioxide, and high soil acidity such as that from acid mine drainage (as low as pH 4.1). It has been noted as drought-tolerant, storing water in its root system. It is frequently found along highways and railroad tracks, in abandoned lots in cities, on abandoned mining sites, and in other areas where few trees can survive. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present.

Ailanthus produces allelopathic chemicals, which inhibit the growth of other plants. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure; populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. A few plants are resistant to these chemicals and form associations with Ailanthus in areas where it is dominant, such as along highways.

People have suggested many factors to Ailanthus' success at naturalising, including the absence of insects eating the plant, lack of exposure of native plants to the Ailanthus' allelopathy, and the widespread human disturbances which favour the tree. Regional variation has begun to show throughout its range, with trees in the colder northern regions producing heavier seeds than those in warmer regions.

==Uses==
Tree of Heaven is a popular ornamental tree in China, valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions, and its uses in Chinese traditional medicine. The bark is used to treat dysentery and other bowel ailments. A tincture of the root-bark has been used successfully in cardiac palpitation, asthma and epilepsy. The leaves are also used to feed silkworms of the moth ''[[w:Samia cynthia|Samia cynthia]]'', which produces silk that is stronger and cheaper than mulberry silk, although with inferior gloss and texture. There are also records of the wood from this tree being used in China. Under the synonymous name &quot;''A. glandulosa''&quot;, an extract of the bark is sometimes touted as an herbal homeopathic remedy for various ailments. However, taken in large doses, the bark extract is highly toxic.

It was first introduced to Europe (France and England) by a French Jesuit priest returning from Nanking in 1751. It was brought to the United States by William Hamilton, a gardener in Philadelphia in 1784 and soon became a favoured ornamental tree in parks and gardens. By 1840, it was available in many nurseries and was planted as an ornamental. The tree arrived in the Western U.S. with the Chinese immigrants who worked the gold mines in California. To this day many abandoned mines have large colonies of it.

In the landscape these trees can cause problems because of their aggressive nature and weak branching habits. As a rule, they should not be planted outside of their native range, and female trees should be killed or kept cut to the ground to prevent further seed production. Male trees can be grown as a fast-replenishing postwood crop or hedge by coppicing at the ground every few years.

==Control==
Tree-of-heaven has become a problematic invasive species in many areas with warm temperate climates, especially in North America, due to its aggressive spread, vigorous growth and allelopathic chemicals. It often grows directly up against a building or structure, where the roots can damage sewers and housing foundations. The trees grow rapidly and produce many offspring in their root vicinity. They also shed many small branches at regular intervals. It is an agricultural pest as well.&lt;ref name=control/&gt; These undesirable qualities often lead land and business owners to eradicate the plant.  

Many different methods of control have been attempted and the best involve prevention as well as eradication. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological, or chemical. A combination of these can be most effective, though they must be compatible. Physical methods are desirable due to their high selectivity, but are very labour intensive and thus more expensive. Hand-pulling is a highly effective way to remove young seedlings before the development of a tap root, but thereafter it is ineffective. Cutting and hand digging are options for larger trees, but the former will produce stump sprout which will need to be controlled later and the latter is very time consuming and is only practical for small infestations. Girdling, the removal of the cambial tissue with a hand axe or machete, is effective for very large trees, though re-sprouting often occurs. Thermal control, i.e. controlled burning, is also effective at removing the visible portion of trees, but sprouts will occur shortly after. These methods can be counter-productive if not performed regularly. On their own they are most effective in places with small infestations or in areas with fairly strong shade or competition.&lt;ref name=control&gt;{{cite web| last =Swearingen| first =Jil M. | authorlink =| coauthors =Pannill, Phillip| title =Tree-of-heaven| work =Plant Conservation Alliance's Alien Plant Working Group| publisher =National Park Service| date =2006| url =http://www.nps.gov/plants/alien/fact/aial1.htm| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root systems will eventually become exhausted and die if mechanical or thermal control is done thoroughly and consistently, though this may take several years.

Managerial control is not effective with controlling ailanthus as native trees cannot compete easily with the tree and it is unpalatable to animals that could potentially graze on it. Biological control, the use of insects or diseases, is also not in use for ailanthus eradication. Chemical control, however, is quite successful, especially when combined with mechanical methods. Foliar herbicide sprays are very effective when plants are in full leaf, but are difficult to use when desirable plants are in the vicinity. Also very large trees will be out of reach. Herbicides for this use include the non-selective glyphosate, though care must be taken as it is mildly toxic to animals and especially to aquatic life. Its trade names include ''Accord'' and ''Roundup'', though the latter contains other harmful surfactants which may be more toxic than the herbicide itself. Triclopyr is another option and is selective for woody plants, making it a better choice for sensitive areas. It is also non-toxic to fish, though it can be toxic to waterfowl. It is sold under brand names such as ''Garlon''. Foliar applications of glyphosphate have been shown to be slightly more effective than triclopyr. Dicamba, imazapyr and metsulfuron methyl are also effective, but have not been tested extensively with ailanthus.&lt;ref name=control/&gt;

Other chemical methods for controlling ailanthus include a basal bark application of oil-soluble triclopyr in late winter or early spring. This method requires no cutting, but is only effective on trees with a diameter of 15 cm (6 inches) or less. For larger trees, an effective method is to cut off strips of bark at the trunk during the summer and spray a 100% concentration of triclopyr, only about 1 or 2 ml per cut, within a few minutes. The tree should not be cut all the way around in a ring, but rather only a ring with 3 to 6 cm (1 to 2 inch) pieces of living bark in between each cut. Cutting a full ring will kill the upper part of the tree and cause root suckers to sprout. Lastly, trees can be cut down and the stump treated with any of the above herbicides, though they must be applied immediately after cutting. This is most effective during the growing season.&lt;ref name=control/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
It is very often useful to highlight the selected row.  This is done with a xform-repeat-index pseudo element in the style sheet.

== CSS ==
By adding the following to your CSS the selected row will be highlighted in blue:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
     .xforms-repeat-index {
        background-color: blue;
      }
&lt;/source&gt;


== Screen Image ==
This example highlights the background of the selected row.
[[Image:Xforms-hilight-index.jpg]]

This example was run using the FormFaces system.

== Program Code ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;

&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==

Note that this only works when you select a row an click your cursor on the input field.  The result is that the value of the index for the selected list will change.  This can be used by the functions that add or delete a selected row.

== Known bugs ==

This appears to not be functional under the FireFox extension as of 0.6.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Descartes didn't find much truth throughout his entire life.  In fact, the only things he really accepted were 1) The fact that he existed (Cogito ergo sum - I think, therefore I am), 2) Reason/logic, 3) Math, and 4) Theological dogma (he was a devout christian).

When he was trying to find truth in something, he was always looking for it to have as much certainly as mathematics; math is ALWAYS the same, regardless of whether or not we're in a dream.  That is, you cannot be dreaming and trust in anything except the fact that  you exist and 2+2=4.  2+2 is always 4 and a triangle is always a three sided shape whose interior angles add up to 180 degrees.</text>

One of the reasons that we have been careful to store all of our data in the model is that once this is done it makes it easy for a web client to simply serialize this model into XML and send it to a file, a web service, or possibly to a database.

This is all done by using a simple '''&lt;code&gt;submit&lt;/code&gt;''' command.  submit is really just a trigger with an attribute of submission that points to a submission element in the model.  This is usually a button with the word &quot;Submit&quot; or &quot;Save&quot; on it that appears at the end of the form.

On many HTML forms you fill out the form and press a button at the bottom of the form called &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Submit&quot;.  You pressed the button and hoped your data would get saved.  This is the same concept.  But in this case the submit command can be triggered in many ways other that just a button being pressed and there are explicit ways of getting feedback from the receiver that the submission process succeeded.

The submit event behaves exactly like a trigger but with one key exception, the '''&lt;code&gt;xforms-submit&lt;/code&gt;''' event is also dispatched.

A model can have more than one submission identified by ''id''

*''&lt;code&gt;&lt;xforms:submission id=&quot;s001&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;action.php&quot;/&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''
*''&lt;code&gt;&lt;xforms:submission id=&quot;s002&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;action2.php&quot; replace=&quot;instance&quot;/&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''
*''&lt;code&gt;&lt;xforms:submission id=&quot;s003&quot; method=&quot;put&quot; action=&quot;file:///tmp/final.xml&quot;/&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''

The first submission sends the data to the specified action, while the second one will expect to get a return xml to update the current document/instance.
The third one will save the file locally to the given location '''/tmp/final.xml'''

== Screen Image ==
The interface is very simple.  It is just a simple &quot;Save&quot; button created by a trigger called submit.

[[Image:XForms-save-button.jpg|center|frame|XForms save button]]

== Sample Program ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;
   xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;XForms Submit Example&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;xf:model&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;MyData&gt;
               &lt;Data1&gt;One&lt;/Data1&gt;
               &lt;Data2&gt;Two&lt;/Data2&gt;
               &lt;Data3&gt;Three&lt;/Data3&gt;
            &lt;/MyData&gt;
         &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
         &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;save&quot; method=&quot;put&quot; action=&quot;myData.xml&quot; ref=&quot;/MyData&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;xf:submit submission=&quot;save&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:label&gt;Save&lt;/xf:label&gt;
      &lt;/xf:submit&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Testing ==
When you press the Save button it will create a file in the same directory that the form was in called &quot;myData.xml&quot;.  This file will contain the XML instance data in your model.

Contents of &quot;myData.xml&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;MyData
  xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;
   xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;&gt;
     &lt;Data1&gt;One&lt;/Data1&gt;
     &lt;Data2&gt;Two&lt;/Data2&gt;
     &lt;Data3&gt;Three&lt;/Data3&gt;
&lt;/MyData&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that this program works easily when the form and the instance data are on a local file system.  Getting this example to save to a web server is a much more complex process due to security concerns.

== Analysis ==

The save button is really just a trigger with the name of &quot;submit&quot; and an attribute called submission.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:submit submission=&quot;save&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The attribute '''&lt;code&gt;submission=&quot;save&quot;&lt;/code&gt;''' points to the ID of the submission element inside the model.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;save&quot; method=&quot;put&quot; action=&quot;myData.xml&quot; ref=&quot;/MyData&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that because we used a &quot;relative file name&quot; (relative to the directory that the form was in) it will save the data in the same directory location that the form was located.

== Discussion ==
You can also use absolute path names but you must be careful about how you describe a letter drive since there are no standards for this.

The following format worked for a Microsoft Windows system using the FireFox browser:

&lt;pre&gt;
   &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;save&quot; method=&quot;put&quot; action=&quot;file:/C:/tmp/myData.xml&quot; ref=&quot;/MyData&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Web Server Configuration ==

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Note: This section was written by a person that does not know much about web server administration.  Read at your own risk and make sure a security professional reviews any changes to your public web servers.&lt;/font&gt;

Most of the examples in this tutorial are about learning XForms, not web server administration.  That being said there are a few things we thought might be useful.

By default web servers are usually not configured to write files to your web server.  Especially by un-authorized users.  If this were the case hackers might use your web server to store their adult content.

To get XForms to save instance using &quot;put&quot;, you should only allow writing to authorized users.  To do this you will need to be able to administer your web server correctly.

=== Apache 2.2 Intranet Configuration with DAV ===
If you have a computer that is '''only''' accessible by internal users (usually called an Intranet) you can access, you can add the following to your Apache configuration file (usually called httpd.config and located in /usr/local/etc or similar location):

First, the following modules may have to be loaded:
 mod_dav, mod_dav_fs, mod_dav_svn, mod_authz_svn.

This can be done by adding the following lines to your httpd.conf file:

&lt;pre&gt;
LoadModule dav_module libexec/apache22/mod_dav.so
LoadModule dav_fs_module libexec/apache22/mod_dav_fs.so
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;Directory &quot;usr/local/www/apache22/data/forms/read-write-test&quot;&gt;
   DAV on
   AllowOverride None
   Order allow,deny
   Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

By turning on DAV you will enable all of the WebDAV operations including &quot;PUT&quot;.

=== IIS Configuration ===

To be done...

=Optical Microscopy=

==The Abbe diffraction limit==
Observation of sub-wavelength structures with microscopes is difficult because of the [http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/timeline/people/abbe.html Abbe diffraction limit]. Ernst Abbe found in 1873 that light with wavelength λ,travelling in a medium with refractive index n and converging to a spot with angle φ will make a spot with radius

:&lt;math&gt;d=\frac{0.61 \lambda}{n sin \phi}&lt;/math&gt;

The denominator nsinφ is called the numerical aperture (NA) and can reach about 1.4 in modern optics, hence the Abbe limit is roughly d=λ/2. With green light around 500nm the Abbe limit is 250nm which is large compared to most nanostructures or biological cells with sizes on the order of 1μm and their internal organelles being much smaller. To increase the resolution, shorter wavelengths can be used such as UV and X-ray microscopes. These techniques offer splendid resolution but are expensive, suffer from lack of contrast in biological samples, and also tend to damage the sample.

==The optical microscope==
{{Wikipedia|Microscope}}

[[Image:OpticalMicroscope.jpg|thumb|300px|Sketch of an optical microscope]]

===Bright Field===
The light is sent to the sample in the same directions as you are looking - most things will look bright unless they absorb the light.
===Dark Field===
Light is sent towards the sample at an angle to your viewing direction and you only see light that is scattered. This makes most images appear dark and only edges and curved surfaces will light up.
===Polarized Light===

===DIC vs H===

=Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM)=
[[w:Confocal_laser_scanning_microscopy| Confocal laser scanning microscopy]] is a technique that allows a much better resolution from optical microscopes and three dimensional imaging. A review can be found in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=10572648&amp;dopt=Abstract              Paddock, Biotechniques 1999]

Using a high NA objective also gives a very shallow depth of focus and hence the image will be blurred by structures above or below the focus point in a classical microscope. A way to circumvent this problem is the confocal microscope, or even better the Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (LSCM). Using a laser as the light source gives better control of the illumintaion, especially when using fluorescent markers in the sample. The theoretical resolution using a 1.4 NA objective can reach 140nm laterally and 230nm vertically &lt;ref&gt;Confocal laser scanning microscopy, Paddock SW, Biotechniques , vol. 27 (5): 992 NOV 1999&lt;/ref&gt; while the resolution quoted in ref &lt;ref&gt;A new UV-visible confocal laser scanning microspectrofluorometer designed for spectral cellular imaging, Favard C, Valisa P, Egret-Charlier M, Sharonov S, Herben C, Manfait M, Da Silva E, Vigny P, Biospectroscopy , vol. 5 (2): 101-115 1999&lt;/ref&gt; is 0.5×0.5×1μm. The image in the LSCM is made by scanning the sample in 2D or 3D and recordning the signal for each point in space on a PC which then generates the image.

=X-ray microscopy=
[[w:X-ray_microscope| X-ray microscopy]] uses X-rays to image with much shorter wavelength than optical light, and hence can provide much higher spatial resolution and use different contrast mechanisms. X-ray microscopy allows the characterization of materials with submicron resolution approaching the 10's of nanometers.  X-ray microscopes can use both laboratory x-ray sources and synchrotron radiation from electron accelerators.  X-ray microscopes using synchrotron radiation provide the greatest sensitivity and power, but are unfortunately rather large and expensive. X-ray microscopy is usually divided into two overlapping ranges, referred to as soft x-ray microscopy (100eV - 2keV) and hard x-ray microscopy (1keV-40keV).  All x-rays penetrate materials, more for higher energy x-rays.  Hence, soft x-ray microscopy provides the best contrast for small samples. Hard x-rays do have the ability to pass nearly unhindered through objects like your body, and hence also give rather poor contrast in many of the biological samples you would like to observe with the x-ray microscope. Nevertheless, hard x-ray microscopy allows imaging by phase contrast, or using scanning probe x-ray microscopy, by using detection of fluorescent or scattered x-rays.  Despite its limitations, X-ray microscopy is a powerful technique and in some cases can provide characterization of materials or samples that cannot be done by any other means.

=Electron microscopy=
An overview:

Electron microscopes uses electrons instead of photons, because electrons have a much shorter wavelength than photons and so allows you to observe matter with atomic resolution.

There are two general types of electron microscopes: the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) that scans an electron beam over the surface of an object and measures how many electrons are scattered back, and the Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) that shoots electrons through the sample and measures how the electron beam changes because it is scattered in the sample.

[[Image:SimpleSEMandTEM.jpg|thumb|300px|
A very simple sketch of a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) compared to an optical transmission microscope and a cathode ray tube (CRT) TV screen - both systems have many things on common with the electron microscope.
The optical microscope uses lenses to control the lights pathway through the system and is in many ways built up like a TEM - only the TEM uses electromagnetic lenses to direct the beam of electrons. The CRT uses electromagnetic lenses as the TEM and SEM to control the electron beam, and generates an image for the viewer by scanning the beam over a fluorescent screen - in the same way the a SEM generates an image by scanning the electron beam over a small sample.]]

Using electron beams however requires working in a vacuum environment, and this makes the instruments considerably larger and expensive. All electron microscope work under at least low pressures and usually in high vacuum chambers to avoid scattering the electrons in the gas. In environmental electron microscopes, differential pumping systems are used to actually have gasses present by the sample together with the electron beam.

==Introduction to Electron Microscopy==
For imaging of nanoscale objects, optical microscopy has limited resolution since the objects are often much smaller than the wavelength of light. The achievable resolution for a wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; is often given by the diffraction limit &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; as

{{anchor|eq_diff_limit}}
:&lt;math&gt;d=0.61 \frac {\lambda}{(NA)}&lt;/math&gt; ''(r.g., diffraction limit)''

with numerical aperture &lt;math&gt;NA&lt;/math&gt;, which can be approximated by the largest angle of incidence &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of the wavefront towards the sample, &lt;math&gt;NA \approx \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;\alpha \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; for the present purposes, we can approximate &lt;math&gt;\sin(\alpha)\approx \tan(\alpha)\approx \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;NA \approx \alpha \approx r_{a}/r_{wd}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;r_{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the objective lens aperture and &lt;math&gt;r_{wd}&lt;/math&gt; the working distance.

Optical microscopes can often reach a resolution of about &lt;math&gt;d=200&lt;/math&gt; nm. For nanoscale resolution this is unfortunately not sufficient to distinguish for instance a single nanotube from two adhering to each other, since they have diameters of less than 100 nm.

The figure below gives an overview typical magnifications achievable by the different electron microscopes compared to a light microscope.

[[Image:AntsAndAtomsWithScaleBars.jpg|thumb|400px|The different methods for microscopy cover a range of magnification roughly indicated by the bars in the figure. The resolution of optical microscopy is limited to about 200 nm. a) SEM image of the head of an ant facing a microfabricated chip with a pair of microfabricated grippers. The grippers are barely visibly at the tip of the arrow. b) SEM image of a gripper approaching a large bundle of carbon nanotubes. c) Closeup in SEM of the gripper and nanotubes. d) TEM image of a carbon nanotube suspended between two grippers. e) TEM closeup of the shells of carbon atoms in a carbon nanotube. On the nanometer scale this particular carbon nanotube does not show a well defined carbon shell structure.]]

Electron optical systems use electrical and magnetic fields to control the electron beam. Although the law of refraction in optics is exchanged with the Lorentz force in electrodynamics, the electron optical system has similar diffraction limits as optical systems, since they depend on the wave nature of the electron beam.

One can achieve a considerable improvement in resolution with instruments such as the transmission electron microscope and the scanning electron microscope that use electrons with De Broglie wavelength much smaller than that of visible light.
The De Broglie wavelength λ of an electron with momentum p is

{{anchor|eq_de_broglie_wavelength}}
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac {h}{\sqrt{2m_{e}E_{b}}}, &lt;/math&gt; ''(Eq. De Broglie wavelength)''

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is Plancks constant. The electron has rest mass &lt;math&gt;m_{e}&lt;/math&gt; and energy &lt;math&gt;E_{e}=m_{e}c^2=511 keV&lt;/math&gt;.

If an electron with charge &lt;math&gt;q_{e}&lt;/math&gt; is accelerated from rest by an electrical potential &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, to the electron beam energy &lt;math&gt;E_{b}=q_{e}U&lt;/math&gt;, it will have a wavelength of 1 nm at 1 eV decreasing to 1 pm at 100 keV where it will be travelling with 50% the speed of light.

This chapter will briefly review fundamental issues for electron microscopy that are similar for SEM and TEM: the limitations imposed by the electron optical beam system in the microscope column; the interaction of the electron beam with the sample; the standard image formation method in SEM and TEM. These issues are essential to understand the results and limitations reached in SEM and TEM microscopy.

For further details, please refer to reviews of electron microscopes and their applications, such as Goldstein et al. &lt;ref&gt;J. Goldstein, D. Newbury, P. Echlin, D. C. Joy, A. D. Romig, C. E. Lyman, C. Fiori, and E. Lifshin. Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-Ray Microanalysis, 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
that contains a thorough review of SEM, while Goodhew and Humphreys
&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Goodhew and F. J. Humphreys. Electron Microscopy and Analysis, 2rd Ed. Taylor and Francis, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
is a more general introduction to both SEM and TEM.

=The Electron Optical System=

For high resolution imaging, a well focused beam is required, just as in optical microscopy. Due to the short wavelength of electron beams with keV energies, as given by the [[#Eq de Broglie wavelength]], the properties of the electron optical system and the electron emitter mainly defines the limits on the achievable beam diameter. The current density in the electron beam can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution of current density j [A/m²] as function of radius, r, from the beam center

:&lt;math&gt;I_{b}=j_0 \pi r_{0}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The electron optics impose a limit on the achievable beam current density and radius by the brightness of the electron emitter &lt;math&gt;\beta_{e}&lt;/math&gt;, which is conserved throughout the system 
&lt;ref&gt;S. Humphries. Charged Particle Beams. John Wiley and Sons, 1990. PDF version available at http://www.fieldp.com/cpb/cpb.html.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Brightness, ß, is a measure of the current per area normal to the beam direction and per element of solid angle &lt;ref&gt;P. W. Hawkes and E. Kasper. Principles Of Electron Optics. Academic Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;. At the center of the Gaussian beam,

&lt;div id=&quot;eq SEM current density&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;eq beam brightness&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta=\frac{j_0}{\pi \alpha^2} &lt;/math&gt;

and the brightness is related to the current density in eq SEM Gaussian beam profile. The emitter brightness &lt;math&gt;\beta_{e}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the type of electron emitter and the beam energy &lt;math&gt;E_{b}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;L. Reimer. Transmission electron microscopy: Physics of image formation and microanalysis, 3rd Ed. Springer-Verlag, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\beta_{e}=\frac{j_{e}E_{b}}{\pi \Delta E}&lt;/math&gt;

with emission current density for W-filament sources about &lt;math&gt;j_{e}&lt;/math&gt;~3 A/cm², for LaB6 sources about 100 A/cm², while field emission guns (FEG) can reach 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;A/cm². The energy spread of the electrons from the sources are about ΔE~1 eV and slightly lower for FEGs. Due to conservation of the brightness in the system, the beam diameter depends on current as

&lt;div id=&quot;eq SEM beam diameter&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;math&gt;r_{0}=\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{r_{wd}}{r_{a}}\sqrt{\frac{I_{b}}{\beta_{e}}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The ideal beam probe size determined by the conservation of brightness cannot be obtained in a real system. Effects such as aberration will make the minimum achievable beam diameter larger. Equation [[#eq SEM beam diameter]] however seem to adequately describe the beam diameter for the present discussion. Apart from the additional beam widening contributions, the image detection method imposes limits on useful values for the parameters in Eq. SEM beam diameter which differ for SEM and TEM.

=Electron Range=

The electron optical system sets limitations to the achievable primary beam current and radius. The expected image resolution set by the primary beam cannot be reached if the signal detected for imaging is caused by electrons scattered far in the sample. The trajectory of an electron penetrating a bulk solid is a complex trajectory due to multiple elastic and inelastic collision events. As the primary electron (PE) penetrates into the sample it will gradually change direction and loose energy in collisions. The mean free path due to elastic and inelastic collisions, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{mfp}&lt;/math&gt;, depends on the atomic number of the material and the PE energy. At 100 keV &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{mfp}=150 nm&lt;/math&gt; for carbon and 5 nm for gold 
&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Goodhew and F. J. Humphreys. Electron Microscopy and Analysis, 2rd Ed. Taylor and Francis, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;.
For samples thinner than &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{mfp}&lt;/math&gt; the main part of the PE will pass relatively unaffected through the sample, which is the basis for TEM.
    
[[Image:Electron_Scattering_in_solid_samples.jpg|thumb|300px|Overview of electron electron scattering processes in bulk and tip-shaped specimens. The PE are scattered within the interaction volume, defined the electron range in the material. The range is longer than the mean free path &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{mfp}&lt;/math&gt;. The SE have a very short range, and only those created within that range from the surface can escape the material. This defines the SE escape depth.]]

SEM can be used for thicker specimens. The electrons that escape from the sample in a new direction compared to the PE due to elastic collisions are called backscattered electrons (BSE).

For samples thicker than &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{mfp}&lt;/math&gt;, the volume interacting with the scattered PE defines the range of the electrons in the material, and this is considerably larger than the minimum achievable primary beam diameters.

The electron range is about 1 µm at 10 keV for carbon, decreasing with higher atomic number for the material. Both the high energy PE and BSE generate secondary electrons (SE) by inelastic scattering events. The SE are generally defined as having energy below 50 eV while the BSE have energies up to the PE energy. The range of SE is typically 1 nm for metals and about 10 nm for insulators &lt;ref&gt;J. Goldstein, D. Newbury, P. Echlin, D. C. Joy, A. D. Romig, C. E. Lyman, C. Fiori, and E. Lifshin. Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-Ray Microanalysis, 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The short range of the SE make the yield of SE highly dependent on the energy lost by the PE within the SE range from the surface, and this makes high Z substances efficient generators of SE. The main emission of SE takes place in the region where the PE strikes the surface and within the SE escape depth from this region.
    
[[Image:Electron_microscopy_and_effect_of_the_e-beam_energy.jpg|thumb|300px|The electron range increases with beam energy. The internal structure of the EEBD deposits can be examined at high electron beam energies in SEM. At 5 kV with shallow penetration depth, the surface of the tips is clearly visible while at higher energies a core of more dense material becomes increasingly visible. At 100 keV and above, TEM images can achieve atomic resolution where the lattice planes in nanocrystals such as the gold nanocrystal in (c). The gold crystal is embedded in amorphous carbon with no clear lattice pattern.]]

=Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)=
*Wikipedia: [[w:Scanning_electron_microscope| Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)]]

In a scanning electron microscope a beam is scanned over the sample surface in a raster pattern while a signal is recorded from electron detectors for SE or BSE. The PE energy is kept relatively low (1-30 keV) to limit the interaction volume in the specimen that will contribute to the detected signal. Especially low energy PE will provide high sensitivity to surface composition as they cannot penetrate far into the sample.

The figure above showed the effect of PE penetration depth of a carbonaceous nanostructure with a gold core, where only the surface is visible at low PE energies, while the carbon becomes increasingly transparent and the core visible at high PE energies.

The low energy SE can easily be attracted and collected by a positively charged detector and are hence an efficient source for an image signal. The standard SE detector is an Everhart-Thornley (ET) detector where a positively charged grid attracts the SE and accelerates them to sufficiently high energies to create a light pulse when striking a scintillator. The light pulse is then amplified by a photomultiplier. Despite the complex construction, the ET detector is remarkably efficient, but requires large &lt;math&gt;r_{wd}&lt;/math&gt; for effective collection of the SE by the charged grid.

Another SEM detector is the in-lens detector, where SE passing through the column aperture are accelerated towards a solid state detector. The in-lens detector complements the ET by being more efficient at short &lt;math&gt;r_{wd}&lt;/math&gt;.


==Environmental SEM (ESEM)==

[[Image:ESEMsystem.jpg|thumb|300x|Simple sketch of an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM), where a differential pumping system with two pressure limiting apertures between the ultra high vacuum SEM column and the low vacuum sample chamber allows high pressures up to 10 hPa around the sample. This is enough to have liquid water at moderate cooling of 5 deg. C.]]

The ESEM makes it possible to use various gasses in the sample chamber of the microscope since there are narrow apertures between the sample chamber and the gun column, and a region in between that is connected to a differential pumping system. Pressures up to about 10 Torr are normally possible in the sample chamber.

The standard Everly-Thornhart SE detector would not work under such conditions since it would create a discharge in the low pressure gas. Instead a &quot;gaseous secondary electron detector (GSD)&quot; is used, as shown in the figure below. The GSD measures the current of a weak cascade discharge in the gas, which is seeded by the emission of electrons from the sample.

[[Image:ESEMimages.jpg |thumb|300px| Two examples of images from an ESEM. Taken with a Philips XL-30 FEG. The first shows a electron beam deposited nanowire between two microelectrodes that has burnt after sustaining a high bias current. The other shows a multiwall carbon nanotube sample. Shorter working distances often improves image quality and so does a low beam current but it also increases the image acquisition time]]

In the ESEM one can work with for instance water vapour or argon as the environmental gas, and it is possible to have liquid samples in the chamber if the sample stage is cooled sufficiently to condense water.

=Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)=
*[[w:Transmission_electron_microscopy| Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)]]
*[[w:High_Resolution_Transmission_Electron_Microscopy| High Resolution Transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)]]


[[Image:TEM_philips_EM_430.jpg|thumb|100px| A Philips EM 430 TEM]]

When the specimen thickness is about the mean free path, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{mfp}&lt;/math&gt;, TEM can be used to achieve high resolution images such as the image above where the atomic lattice of a gold nanocrystal is visible. Since the detected electrons are transmitted PE where the energy can be in the 100 keV range, the resolution is not limited by the issues regarding secondary electrons. The electron beam optics can be optimized for higher current densities (Eq. [[#eq SEM current density]]) at higher energies compared to SEM.

To achieve optimal imaging conditions for the thin TEM samples, the working distance has been made short. In most TEMs, the space for the sample holder is only about (5 mm)³ between the two objective lenses for the incoming and transmitted beam. Before reaching a CCD camera, the transmitted beam is sent through several magnification lenses to achieve the high magnification (500.000X is not unusual).

The image formation in TEM can be based on several principles, but practically all images used in this work were made by phase contrast imaging, here called High Resolution TEM or HRTEM. At sufficiently high brightness, electron sources can produce coherent electron beams due to the point-like emitter surface area and small energy spread &lt;ref&gt;P. W. Milonni and J. H. Eberly. Lasers. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;. The coherent electron beam can be considered as a spherical wave propagating from the emitter and out through the electron optical system, much like a laser beam would propagate through an optical system.

The HRTEM images are often based on the interference of the electron wavefront after it has passed through the sample and reaches a CCD detector to give a phase contrast image of the sample. The image will have a resolution determined of course by the wavelength of the electrons (Eq. [[#eq SEM de broglie wavelength]]) but mainly by the imperfections of the electron optics which also perturbs the wavefront. The optimal imaging condition is for a sample thickness about &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{mfp}&lt;/math&gt;, where the wavefront is only slightly perturbed by passing through the sample. TEM instruments are normally easily capable of resolving individual shells of a carbon nanotubes. The fine-tuning of the electron optical system to the required resolution can be achieved in about 30 min for many microscopes.

[[Image:TEMvsHAADFSTEM.jpg|thumb|300px|TEM images of the same nanostructure using standard 'bright field' TEM vs HAADF STEM. The sample is a gold nanoparticle containing environmental electron beam deposited rod. 
]]

=Electron Holography=

In special TEM microscopes, the diffracted beam can be combined with a part of the original electron beam from the electron gun, and the image that is recorded is an interference pattern that depends on how much the phase of the diffracted beam was changed. By recording such images, one can measure how the electron wave function changes as it passes through or nearby a nanostructure - and this allows you to measure the electric and magnetic fields surrounding nanostructures.

=Electron Tomography=

By recording numerous TEM images of an object at many different angles, these images can in a computer be combined to create a three-dimensional model of the object. The technique is time consuming but allows you to see nanostructures in 3D.

=Scanning probe microscopy=
[[w:Scanning_probe_microscopy| Scanning probe microscopy]] covers the methods where a sharp tip is scanned over a surface in a raster pattern and the interaction with the surface is recorded in each pixel to form an image of the interaction. There are a multitude of methods and interactions in SPM. Broadly speaking, there are three main categories:

[[Image:SPM_overview.jpg|thumb|400px|
Overview of the main types of Scanning Probe Microscope types:

'''Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)''' - using the tunneling current I between the outermost atom of a conducting probe within an atomic distance from a substrate to map out the sample topography and electrical properties.

'''Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)''' - using the van der Waals forces or contact forces between a tip and the sample to measure the sample topography or mechanical properties.

'''Scanning Near-field Optical Microscope (SNOM)''' -  using the scattered light through a sub-wavelength aperture to form an image.
]]

*In scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), one uses an atomically sharp metallic tip and records the minute tunneling current between the tip and the surface, when the tip is hovering so close to the surface that electrons can move between the surface and the tip.
*In Atomic force microscopy (AFM), a cantilever with a sharp tip - somewhat like the needle of an old record player - is scanned over the surface and the topography or surface softness can be recorded.
*In Scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) a probe with a smalle aperture is scanned over the surface collecting the light comming from regions much smaller than the wavelength of the light used.

Point-Projection Microscopes are a type of [[w:Field emission microscope|field emission microscope]]&lt;ref&gt;Rochow, Theodore George, and Paul Arthur Tucker. &quot;Emissions Microscopies&quot;. Introduction to Microscopy by Means of Light, Electrons, X-Rays, or Acoustics (Chapter 16, page 329) 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;, and consists of three components: an electron source, the object to the imaged, and the viewing screen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.future-fab.com/documents.asp?grID=216&amp;d_ID=1210 The Future of the SEM for Image and Metrology]&lt;/ref&gt;.

=Low energy electron diffraction (LEED)=
LEED is a technique for imaging surfaces, and has two principle methods of use: qualitative and quantitative.  The qualitative method measures relative size and geometric properties, whereas the quantitative method looks at diffracted beams as a way of determining the position of atoms.

*[[w:Low_energy_electron_diffraction| Low energy electron diffraction (LEED)]]
*[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/surfaces/scc/scat6_2.htm LEED intro]

=Reflection High Energy Electron diffraction=
[[w:RHEED| RHEED]] is similar to LEED but uses higher energies and the electrons are directed to the be reflected on the surface at almost grazing incidence. This way the high energy electrons only penetrates a few atomic layers of the surface.

=X-ray Spectroscopy and Diffraction=
[[w:X-ray_spectroscopy| X-ray Spectroscopy]] refers to a collection of techniques including, but not limited to [[w:X-ray_absorption_spectroscopy| X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy]] and [[w:X-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopy| X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy]].

[[w:X-ray| X-rays]] can be used for [[w:X-ray_crystallography| X-ray crystallography]].

=Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)=
[[w:Auger_electron_spectroscopy| Auger Electron Spectroscopy]] is a technique that takes advantage of the Auger Process to analyze the surface layers of a sample&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/surfaces/scc/scat5_2.htm Auger Electron Microscopy]&lt;/ref&gt;.

=Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)=
*[[w:Nuclear_magnetic_resonance| Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)]] - in a magnetic field the spin of the nuclei of molecules will precess and in strong fields (several tesla) this happens with rf frequencies that can be detected by receiving rf antennas and amplifiers. The precession frequency of an individual nucleus will deviate slightly depending on the its surrounding molecules' electronic structure and hence detecting a spectrum of the radiofrequency precession frequencies in a sample will provide a finger print of the types of molecules in that sample.
*[[w:Nuclear_quadrupole_resonance| Nuclear quadrupole resonance]] is a related technique, based on the internal electrical fields of the molecules to cause a splitting of the nuclear magnetic moments energy levels. The level splitting is detected by rf as in NMR. Its is used mainly for experimental explosives detection.

=Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) or Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)=
[[w:Electron_Spin_Resonance| Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)]] measures the [[w:Microwave| microwave frequency]] of [[w:Paramagnetic| paramagnetic]] ions or molecules&lt;ref&gt;[http://ierc.med.uiuc.edu/epr.html What is EPR?]&lt;/ref&gt;
.

=Mössbauer spectroscopy=
[[w:Mossbauer_spectroscopy| Mössbauer spectroscopy]] detects the hyperfine interactions between the nucleus of an atom, and the ambient environment.  The atom must be part of a solid matrix to reduce the recoil affect of a gamma ray emission or absorption&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/Membership/Networking/InterestGroups/MossbauerSpect/Intropart1.asp Introduction to Mossbauer Spectroscopy: Part 1]&lt;/ref&gt;.

=Non-contact Nanoscale Temperature Measurements=
Heat radiation has infrared wavelengths much longer than 1 µm and hence taking a photo of a nanostructure with e.g. a thermal camera will not provide much information about the temperature distribution within the nanostructure (or microstructure for that sake).

Temperatures can be measured locally by different non-contact methods:
*Spectroscopy on individual quantum dots [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl071606p].
*Spectra of laser dyes incorporated in the structure
*Raman microscopy (the temperature influences the ratio of stokes and anti-stokes lines amplitude, the width of the lines and the position of the lines.)
*Transmission electron microscopy can also give temperature information by various techniques [http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1893-nanothermometer-takes-molecular-temperatures.html]
*Special AFM probes with a temperature dependent resistor at the tip can be used for mapping surface temperatures

=Types of nanometal synthesis=
The most common types of nanometal synthesis deal with 'wet' methods in which metal nanoparticles are produced in a colloid with an organic material of some sort.

Gold nanoparticles can be produced by either:

1) Reduction of HAuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in a solution of sodium citrate, then boiling it, causing gold nanoparticles to form in a wine-red solution.
 
2) Mixing HAuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in water, which produces a solution that is subsequently transferred into toluene using tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB), a phase transfer catalyst. Phase transfer catalysts help reactants dissolve in organic (carbon-containing) material where the reactant otherwise couldn't w/o the PTC. Afterwards, the solution is stirred with sodium borohydride, in the presence of certain alkanes, which bind to the gold in the solution, allowing for the formation of gold nanoparticles.

Synthesis of other metal nanoparticles can possibly be achieved by reducing metal salts in organic solvents such as ethanol, or by variations of the above methods which synthesize gold nanoparticles. &lt;ref&gt; Luis M Liz-Marzán. &quot;Nanometals formation and color&quot;, ''Materials Today'', February 2004, page 27.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Phase transfer catalyst-Wikipedia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transfer_catalyst &lt;/ref&gt;

=Nanotubes=
Certain compounds are capable of forming nanotubes where the tube consists of round shell of a single layer of atoms in a cylindrical lattice. Carbon nanotubes is the most famous example, but also other materials can form nanotubes such as Boron-nitride, Molybdenum sulfide and others.

Nanotubes can also be made by etching the core out of an shell structured rod, but such tubes will normally contain many atomic layers in the wall and have crystal facets on the sides.

=Carbon Nanotubes=
Carbon nanotubes are fascinating nanostructures. A sheet of graphene as in common graphite, but rolled up in small tubes rather than planar sheets.

Carbon nanotubes have unique mechanical properties such as high strength, high stiffness, and low density &lt;ref&gt;qian2002&lt;/ref&gt; and also interesting electronic properties. A single-walled carbon nanotube can be either metallic or semiconducting depending on the atomic arrangement 
&lt;ref&gt;hamada1992&lt;/ref&gt;.

This section is a short introduction to carbon nanotubes. For a broader overview the reader is referred to one of the numerous review articles or books on carbon nanotubes 

&lt;ref&gt;avouris2003&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;dresselhaus2001&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;saito1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric Structure==
The simplest type of carbon nanotube consists of just one layer of graphene rolled up in the form of a seamless cylinder, known as a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) with a typical diameter of just a few nanometers. Larger diameter nanotube structures are nanotube ropes, consisting of many individual, parallel nanotubes closed-packed into a hexagonal lattice, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) consisting of several concentric cylinders nested within each other.

[[Image:Fe-cat_CVD_MWCNT_SEM_overview_mats_with_scalebar.jpg|thumb|300px|

===Single walled Carbon Nanotube===
The basic configuration is thus the SWCNT. Its structure is most easily illustrated as a cylindrical tube conceptually formed by the wrapping of a single graphene sheet. The hexagonal structure of the 2-dimensional graphene sheet is due to the &lt;math&gt;sp^{2}&lt;/math&gt; hybridization of the carbon atoms, which causes three directional, in-plane &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; bonds separated by an angle of 120 degrees.

The nanotube can be described by a chiral vector &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; that can be expressed in terms of the graphene unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\textbf{a}_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textbf{a}_{2}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\textbf{C}=n\textbf{a}_{1}+m\textbf{a}_{2}&lt;/math&gt; with the set of integers &lt;math&gt;(n,m)&lt;/math&gt; uniquely identifying the nanotube. This chiral vector or 'roll-up' vector describes the nanotube circumference by connecting two crystallographically equivalent positions i.e. the tube is formed by superimposing the two ends of &lt;math&gt;\textbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

Based on the chiral angle SWCNTs are defined as zig-zag tubes (&lt;math&gt;\theta =0 deg \leftrightarrow m=0&lt;/math&gt;), armchair tubes (&lt;math&gt;\theta =30 deg \leftrightarrow n=m&lt;/math&gt;), or chiral tubes (&lt;math&gt;0 deg &lt; \theta  &lt; 30 deg &lt;/math&gt;).

===Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes===
MWCNTs are composed of a number of SWCNTs in a coaxial geometry. Each nested shell has a diameter of &lt;math&gt;d=\sqrt{3}a_{C-C}(m^{2}+n^{2}+mn)^{1/2}/\pi&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a_{C-C}&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the carbon-carbon bond which is 1.42 Å. The difference in diameters of the individual shell means that their chiralities are different, and adjacent shell are therefore in general non-commensurate, which causes only a weak intershell interaction.

The intershell spacing in MWCNTs is &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; 0.34 nm - quite close to the interlayer spacing in turbostratic graphite
&lt;ref&gt;dresselhaus2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic Structure==
The electronic structure of a SWCNT is most easily described by again considering a single graphene sheet. The 2-D, hexagonal-lattice graphene sheet has a 2-D reciprocal space with a hexagonal Brillouin zone (BZ). 

The &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; bonds are mainly responsible for the mechanical properties, while the electronic properties are mainly determined by the &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; bands. By a tight-binding approach the band structure of these &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; bands can be calculated
&lt;ref&gt;saito1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor with an occupied &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; band and an unoccupied &lt;math&gt;\pi^{*}&lt;/math&gt; band meeting at the Fermi level at six &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; points in the BZ, thus it behaves metallic, a so-called semimetal.

Upon forming the tube by conceptually wrapping the graphene sheet, a periodic boundary condition is imposed that causes only certain electronic states of those of the planar graphene sheet to be allowed. These states are determined by the tube's  geometric structure, i.e. by the indices &lt;math&gt;(n,m)&lt;/math&gt; of the chiral vector. The wave vectors of the allowed states fall on certain lines in the graphene BZ.

Based on this scheme it is possible to estimate whether a particular tube will be metallic or semiconducting. When the allowed states include the &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; point, the system will to a first approximation behave metallic. However, in the points where the &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\pi^{*}&lt;/math&gt; bands meet but are shifted slightly away from the &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; point due to curvature effects, which causes a slight band opening in some cases
&lt;ref&gt;hamada1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

This leads to a classification scheme that has three types of nanotubes:

*Metallic: These are the armchair tubes where the small shift of the degenerate point away from the &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; point does not cause a band opening for symmetry reasons.

*Small-bandgap semiconducting: These are characterized by &lt;math&gt;n-m = 3j&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; being an integer. Here, the wave vectors of the allowed states cross the &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; point, but due to the slight shift of the degenerate point a small gap will be present, the size of which is inversely proportional to the tube diameter squared with typical values between a few and a few tens meV
&lt;ref&gt;zhou2000&lt;/ref&gt;

*Semiconducting: In this case &lt;math&gt;n-m \neq 3j&lt;/math&gt;. This causes a larger bandgap, the size of which is inversely proportional to the tube diameter: &lt;math&gt;E_{g}=k/d&lt;/math&gt; with experimental investigations suggesting a value of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of 0.7-0.8 eV/nm
&lt;ref&gt;wildoer1998,odom1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically the bandgap of the type 2 nanotubes is so small that they can be considered metallic at room temperature. Based on this it can be inferred that 1/3 of all tubes should behave metallic whereas the remaining 2/3 should be semiconducting. However, it should be noted that due to the inverse proportionality between the bandgap and the diameter of the semiconducting tubes, large-diameter tubes will tend to behave metallic at room temperature. This is especially important in regards to large-diameter MWCNTs.

From a electrical point of view a MWCNT can be seen as a complex structure of many parallel conductors that are only weakly interacting. Since probing the electrical properties typically involves electrodes contacting the outermost shell, this shell will be dominating the transport properties
&lt;ref&gt;frank1998&lt;/ref&gt;
In a simplistic view, this can be compared to a large-diameter SWCNT, which will therefore typically display metallic behavior.

==Electrical and Electromechanical Properties==
Many studies have focused on SWCNTs for exploring the fundamental properties of nanotubes. Due to their essentially 1-D nature and intriguing electronic structure, SWCNTs exhibit a range of interesting quantum phenomena at low temperature
&lt;ref&gt;nygard1999,dresselhaus2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion here will so far, however, primarily be limited to room temperature properties. 

The conductance &lt;math&gt;~G~&lt;/math&gt; of a 1-dimensional conductor such as a SWCNT is given by the Landauer formula
&lt;ref&gt;datta1995&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;~G=G_{0}\sum_{i}T_{i}~&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;~G_{0}=2e^{2}/h = (12.9 \rm k\Omega)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;~1/G_{0}~&lt;/math&gt; is the conductance quantum;&lt;br&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;~T_{i}~&lt;/math&gt; is the transmission coefficient of the contributing channel &lt;math&gt;~i~&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:c60 isosurface.png|thumb|right|160px|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; with isosurface of ground state electron density as calculated with [[w:Density functional theory|DFT]]]]
[[Image:Fussball.jpg|thumb|right|160px|An [[w:association football]] is a model of the Buckminsterfullerene C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]

'''Buckminsterfullerene''' ([[w:IUPAC|IUPAC]] name '''(C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;)[5,6]fullerene''') is the smallest fullerene molecule in which no two pentagons share an edge (which can be destabilizing, as in [[w:pentalene|pentalene]]). It is also the most common in terms of natural occurrence, as it can often be found in [[w:soot|soot]].

The structure of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[w:w:Truncated icosahedron|truncated (T = 3) icosahedron]], &lt;!-- elaborate later. --&gt; which resembles a [[w:football (ball)#Association football|soccer ball]] of the type made of twenty hexagons and twelve pentagons, with a carbon atom at the vertices of each polygon and a bond along each polygon edge.

The [[w:van der Waals diameter]] of a C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecule is about 1 [[w:nanometer|nanometer]] (nm). The nucleus to nucleus diameter of a C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecule is about 0.7&amp;nbsp;nm.

The C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecule has two bond lengths. The 6:6 ring bonds (between two hexagons) can be considered &quot;[[w:double bond|double bonds]]&quot; and are shorter than the 6:5 bonds (between a hexagon and a pentagon).  Its average bond length is 1.4 angstroms.

Silicon buckyballs have been created around metal ions.

===Boron buckyball===
A new type of buckyball utilizing [[w:boron|boron]] atoms instead of the usual carbon has been predicted and described by researchers at Rice University.  The B-80 structure, with each atom forming 5 or 6 bonds, is predicted to be more stable than the C-60 buckyball.&lt;ref&gt;''Bucky's brother -- The boron buckyball makes its début'' Jade Boyd April '''2007''' eurekalert.org[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-04/ru-bbt042307.php Link]&lt;/ref&gt;  One reason for this given by the researchers is that the B-80 is actually more like the original geodesic dome structure popularized by Buckminster Fuller which utilizes triangles rather than hexagons. However, this work has been subject to much criticism by quantum chemists&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencedirect.com&quot;&gt;''The boron buckyball has an unexpected Th symmetry'' G. Gopakumar, Nguyen, M.

Another fairly common buckminsterfullerene is C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/Depts/Chemistry/MOTM/buckyball/c60a.htm Buckminsterfullerene: Molecule of the Month&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but fullerenes with 72, 76, 84 and even up to 100 carbon atoms are commonly obtained.

In [[w:mathematics|mathematical]] terms, the structure of a '''fullerene''' is a [[w:Valence (chemistry)|trivalent]] convex [[w:polyhedron|polyhedron]] with pentagonal and hexagonal faces.  In [[w:graph theory|graph theory]], the term '''fullerene''' refers to any 3-[[w:Regular graph|regular]], [[w:planar graph|planar graph]] with all faces of size 5 or 6 (including the external face). It follows from [[w:Euler characteristic|Euler's polyhedron formula]], |V|-|E|+|F| = 2, (where |V|, |E|, |F| indicate the number of vertices, edges, and faces), that there are exactly 12 pentagons in a fullerene and |V|/2-10 hexagons.

The smallest fullerene is the [[w:dodecahedron]]--the unique C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;. There are no fullerenes with 22 vertices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-275900-0 Goldberg Variations Challenge: Juris Meija, Anal.

For instance, there are 1812 non-isomorphic fullerenes C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;.  Note that only one form of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, the buckminsterfullerene alias [[w:truncated icosahedron]], has no pair of adjacent pentagons (the smallest such fullerene).  To further illustrate the growth, there are 214,127,713 non-isomorphic fullerenes C&lt;sub&gt;200&lt;/sub&gt;, 15,655,672 of which have no adjacent pentagons.

[[w:Trimetasphere]] carbon nanomaterials were discovered by researchers at [[w:Virginia Tech]] and licensed exclusively to [[w:Luna Innovations]]. This class of novel molecules comprises 80 carbon atoms (C80) forming a sphere which encloses a complex of three metal atoms and one nitrogen atom. These fullerenes encapsulate metals which puts them in the subset referred to as [[w:metallofullerenes]]. Trimetaspheres have the potential for use in diagnostics (as safe imaging agents), therapeutics and in organic solar cells.{{citation needed|date=June 2008}}

=Semiconducting nanowires=
Semiconducting nanowires can be made from most semiconducting materials and with different methods, mainly variations of a chemical vapor deposition process (CVD).

There are many different semiconducting materials, and heterosrtuctures can be made if the lattice constants are not too incompatible. Heterostructures made from combinations of materials such as GaAs-GaP can be used to make barriers and guides for electrons in electrical systems.

Low pressure metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) can be used to grow III-V nanowires epitaxially on suitable crystalline substrates, sucha s III-V materials or silicon with a reasonably matching lattice constant.

Nanowire growth is catalyzed by various nanoparticles, which are deposited on the substrate surface, typically gold nanoparticles with a diameter of 20-100nm.

To grow for instance GaP wires, the sample is typically annealed at 650C in the  heated reactor chamber to form an eutectic with between the gold catalyst and the underlying substrate.

Then growth is done at a lower temperature around 500C in the presence of the precursor gasses trimethyl gallium and phosphine. By changing the precursor gasses during growth, nanowire heterostructures with varying composition can be made

==Nanophotonics and nanooptics==

With the increasing demand for smaller, faster, and more highly integrated optical and electronic devices; as well as extremely sensitive detectors for biomedical and environmental applications; a field called nano-optics or nano-photonics is emerging - studying the many promising optical properties of nanostructures.

Like nanotechnology itself, it is a rapidly evolving and changing field – but because of  strong research activity in optical communication and related devices, combined with the intensive work on nanotechnology, nano-optics appears to be a field with a promising future.

Nanophotonics is seen as a crucial technology for extending Moore's Law into the next few decades. In the past few years nanophotonics researchers worldwide have developed, On Chip Silicon Lasers, Gigahertz Silicon Electro Optic Switches, and Low Loss Highly Integratable Compact Nanowires (With waveguides of 100’s of nanometers' width).

Nanophotonics is mainly expected to play a complementary role to micro/nano electronics on chip and extend the capacity of telecommunication networks into the Terabit/s regime. One of the major emphasis’s in the last few years has been developing on-chip interconnects to break the bottle neck for higher data rates within integrated chips.

In conjugation with Nanofluidics, Nanophotonics is also finding applications in biomedical sensors, Medical diagnosis, etc.

Nanophotonic components such as Microcavities with ultra high life time of trapped photons are expected to find applications in fundamental experimental physics such as gravitational wave detection.

Intel, IBM, Lucent, and Luxtera have highly functional and well funded nanophotonic research groups. A number of universities in: US, UK, Japan, Italy, China, Belgium, etc. have been actively pursuing nanophotonics. Apart from a growing number of hits on the word in publication databases like &quot;Web of Science&quot;, which shows it is already getting increased attention, it is also increasingly mentioned in the aims of the funding agencies, which will surely add to the activity in the field as increased economical support becomes available.

==Electrooptic modulators==
Electro-optic modulators are devices used to modulate, or modify a beam of light. Currently they are mainly used in the information technology and telecommunications industries (e.g. fiber-optic cables). EOM’s have good potential in nanophotonics. Nanoscale optical communication devices will have increased speed and efficiency, once they can be engineered and used. Nano-size electrooptic modulators will be an integral part of a nanoscale communications network.

===Photodetector===
Photodetectors respond to radiant energy. They are basically sensors of light or other electromagnetic energy. 
A sensor is a electronic device that converts one type of energy to another for various reasons. Nanoscale size photodetectors will be an integral part of a theoretical nanoscale optical information network.

===Electrooptic switches===
Electrooptic switches change signals in optical fibers to electrical signals. Typically semiconductor-based, their function depends on the change of refractive index with electric field. This feature makes them high-speed devices with low power consumption. Neither the electro-optic nor thermo-optic optical switches can match the insertion loss, back reflection, and long-term stability of opto-mechanical optical switches. 
The latest technology combines all-optical switches that can cross-connect fibers without translating the signal into the electrical domain. This greatly increases switching speed, allowing today's telcos and networks to increase data rates. However, this technology is only now in development, and deployed systems cost much more than systems that use traditional opto-mechanical switches.
&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Switches.&quot; www.fiber-optics.info. 2005. Force, Incorporated. 27 Jun 2007 &lt;http://www.fiber-optics.info/articles/switches.htm&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Photonic crystals==
&quot;Photonic crystals are composed of periodic dielectric or metallo-dielectric nanostructures that are designed to affect the propagation of electromagnetic waves (EM) in the same way as the periodic potential in a semiconductor crystal affects the electron motion by defining allowed and forbidden electronic energy bands. Simply put, photonic crystals contain regularly repeating internal regions of high and low dielectric constant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonic_crystal&lt;/ref&gt; Photonic crystals are used to modify or control the flow of light. Photonic crystals may have a novel use in optical data transmission but are not extremely prominent. They may be used to filter for interference in a fiber optic cable, or increase the quality of the transmission. In addition, they can be used to divide different wavelengths of light. Photonic crystals can already be manufactured at close to the nanoscale.

==Sensors==
Nanotechnology creates many new, interesting fields and applications for photonic sensors. Existing uses, like digital cameras, can be enhanced because more ‘pixels’ can be placed on a sensor than with existing technology. In addition, sensors can be fabricated on the nano-scale so that they will be of higher quality, and possibly defect free. The end result would be that photos would be larger, and more accurate.
As part of a communication network, photonic sensors will be used to convert optical data (photons) into electricity (electrons). Nanoscale photonic sensors will be more efficient and basically recieve simillar advantages to other materials constructed under the nanoscale.

==Multiplexers==
A [[Wikipedia:multiplexer|multiplexer]] is a device for converting many data streams into one single data stream, which is then divided into the separate data streams on the other side with a demultiplexer. The main benefit is cost savings, since only one physical link will be needed, instead of many physical links. In nano-optics, multiplexers will have many applications. They can be used as part of a communication network, as well as utilized on a smaller scale for various modern scientific instruments.

==Vanadium dioxide==
Vanadium dioxide has the interesting property of changing from a transparent state to a reflective, mirror-like state in less than 100 femtoseconds&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vanderbilt.edu/exploration/stories/vo2shutter.html&lt;/ref&gt; (1/10 of a trillionth of a second). Vanderbilt University discovered the transition at 68 degrees celsius. The temperature that the transition happens can be changed by adding small amounts of impurities, and it is possible to lower the temperature by as much as 35 degrees celsius. However, there is a size limit, the change will not occur in particles that are smaller than 20 atoms across, or 10 nanometers. This property has many applications. Possibilities are a 'solar shade' window that changes from letting light in, to reflecting light back automatically when the temperature starts rising. Also, nanosensors could be created which could measure the temperature at different locations in human cells. However, most importantly, this transition can be utilized in creating an 'ultrafast' optical switch which could be used in communications or computing. Currently, researchers are seeing if they can put a layer of vanadium dioxide nanoparticles on the end of an optical fiber to create a very high speed link.

== Quantum dots ==
Quantum dots have several applications.  One of the first applications found was their ability to emit very specific wavelengths of light.  This is different from other light emitting bulbs since quantum dots could be tuned across the visible and ultraviolet spectrums very precisely. Researchers have found that if they put about 2,000 quantum dots together, they would have a finely tuned LED.  Researchers have tried for an extremely long time to get these dots to emit light. In the 1990’s someone was able to get a dark red light.  Since then other researchers have been able to tune the dots to a higher frequency, thus gaining blue and green light.  The applications for this would be beneficial so that we could make full color screens and moniters.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.llnl.gov/str/Lee.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

(Edward Arnold, London, 1995).
&lt;/ref&gt;
, is a new technology which is still in its infancy, but also brings hope for truly atomic scale electronic systems in the future.

One of the more promising applications of molecular electronics was proposed
by the IBM researcher Ari Aviram and the theoretical chemist Mark Ratner
in their 1974 and 1988 papers
''Molecules for Memory, Logic and Amplification'', 
(see [[w:Unimolecular_rectifier|Unimolecular rectifier
]])

A. Aviram, ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'', &lt;b&gt;110&lt;/b&gt; 5687-5692 (1988)
&lt;/ref&gt;
.
This is one of many possible ways in which a molecular level diode / transistor might
be synthesized by organic chemistry.
A model system was proposed with a spiro carbon structure giving a molecular
diode about half a nanometre across which could be connected by polythiophene 
molecular wires. 
Theoretical calculations showed the design to be sound in principle and
there is still hope that such a system can be made to work.

However one researcher,
experimentalist Jan Hendrik Schön, could not wait for the necessary technical progress and at a time when he
was publishing one scientific paper a week and winning scholarships, heading for the top in nanotechnology,
it was discovered he had fabricated both the experiment where such a device worked and several other
potentially important milestones in the field.
This incident is discussed by [[W:David_Goodstein|David Goodstein]] in ''Physics World''
[http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dg/The_physicists.pdf].
However it seems only a matter of time before something like this proposed elegant solution
to the problem demonstrates the behavior of a diode.

=Quantum Computing=
A [[w:Quantum_computer|quantum computer]] would be incredibly fast compared to microelectronics. It would also be able to use the properties of quantum mechanics to be in fuzzy states which could represent many numbers at once allowing a massive density of memory. How such devices would be nano-fabricated is however way beyond current technology.

The first working 2-qubit quantum computer was demonstrated in 1998.

In 2006, the first working [[12 qubit]] quantum computer was demonstrated.

Ferrofluids are a form of colloidal suspensions. They are tiny iron particles covered with a liquid coating, also surfactant, that are then added to water or oil, which gives them their liquid properties.
Ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions. Those are materials with properties of more than one state of matter. In this case, the two states of matter are the solid metal and liquid it is in.
This ability to change phases with the application of a magnetic field allows them to be used as seals, lubricants, and may open up further applications in future nanoelectromechanical systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Compound Inequalities ==

In the previous section we dealt with inequalities with one specific constraint - that is, only one solution set. However, there is a good chance that real-world situations will require multiple constraints. For example, computer manufacturers will want their products to be sold within certain ranges so that customers will continue to buy their computers.

Such situations are also bound to happen in algebra, and can be represented using compound inequalities. A '''compound inequality''' is a statement that puts two constraints on a constant, variable, or expression. For example, the inequality -4 &lt; x &lt; 3 indicates that x has two constraints: it must be (a) greater than -4 ''and'' (b) less than 3. These compound inequalities are often referred to as &quot;and&quot; inequalities because they require that the expression in the center meets the two restraints.

Using the graphing methods covered in the last lesson, we can show the solution set of -4 &lt; x &lt; 3 on the number line:

                                     O--------------------O
                               &lt;--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--&gt;
                                 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5

Notice that the solution is bounded by the two values.

On the other hand, a compound inequality can have one out of two constraints. These inequalities are called &quot;or&quot; inequalities - the expression can satisfy either one of the conditions. If, for example,
x &lt; 3 or x &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; 7, then x is equal to any number less than 3 or greater than or equal to 7. Any number between 3 and 7 will not satisfy either condition. 

Represented graphically, the inequality x &lt; 3 or x &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; 7 looks like this:

                      &lt;--------------------------------O           *--&gt;
                      &lt;--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--&gt;
                        -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7

Notice that, as opposed to the inequality in the previous example, the two constraints travel in opposite directions. This is a key principle of compound inequalities, and one that should be kept in mind when graphing solutions.


=== Solving Compound Inequalities ===

Because compound inequalities are two separate constraints combined into one, all operations must be performed on ''all sides of the inequality''. 

'''Example 1:''' Solve for x: -7 &lt; 2x + 4 &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; 12.

Stop for a second and pretend that the statement above was two separate inequalities. The logical first step would be to subtract 4 from both sides. Because the two are now put into one, however, we must subtract 4 ''from all sides''. Therefore:

                              
&lt;center&gt;-7 &lt; 2x + 4 &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; 12&lt;/center&gt;      


&lt;center&gt;-7 - 4 &lt; 2x + 4 - 4 &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; 12 - 4&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;-11 &lt; 2x &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; 8&lt;/center&gt;


Now divide all sides by 2.

&lt;center&gt;-11 &lt; 2x &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; 8&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac {-11}{2} &lt; \frac {2x}{2} \le \frac {8}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;-5.5 &lt; x &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; 4&lt;/center&gt;

'''Example 2:''' Solve for x: -3 &gt; -x + 7 or 2x - 6 &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; -4.

Because the two inequalities act as separate entities, solve each one separately. Start by subtracting 7 from both sides in the first inequality, and add 6 to both sides in the second.

                -3 &gt; -x + 7                  or                    2x - 6 &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; -4
     
               -10 &gt; -x                                                2x &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; 2

Finish by dividing by respective coefficients (-1 and 2).

               -10 &gt; -x                                              2x &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; 2

                 x &gt; 10                      or                       x &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; 1

      <text xml:space="preserve">== NOTE ==
These examples do not appear to work with the FireFox 3 XForms addition. Sliders are hidden with XSLTForms (r406).

== Motivation ==
You want to use a range control or &quot;slider&quot; to set a numeric value in your form.

== Selecting from a continuous range of values ==
The range is a control that is part of the XForms specification.  It allows the user to select a numeric value from a range of values without using the keyboard.  This is ideal for instructors that use interactive learning environments such as a SmartBoard.

The XForms range has four attributes:
* '''start''' - the lower bound of the range
* '''end''' - the upper bound of the range
* '''step''' - the increment of output change
* '''incremental''' - true if the form should send continuous values to the model or false otherwise.  The default is false.

These attributes MUST be bound to an element that has a numeric datatype.  To do this you must add the following bind statements to your model:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;/data/my-int&quot; type=&quot;xs:integer&quot;/&gt;

&lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;/data/my-decimal&quot; type=&quot;xs:decimal&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== User Interface ==
There are three range controls in this application.  The value of the range is on the right side.

        &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;data1&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt; Value= &lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:output&gt;

        &lt;xf:range ref=&quot;data2&quot; start=&quot;1&quot; end=&quot;10&quot; step=&quot;1&quot;  incremental=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Data2: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:range&gt;
        &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;data2&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt; Value= &lt;/xf:label&gt;

            &lt;xf:label&gt;Data3: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:range&gt;
        &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;data3&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt; Value= &lt;/xf:label&gt;
        &lt;/xf:output&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Testing ==
Select one of the three range controls with the mouse.  Drag the value to the right or left.  You should notice that the values at the right also are updated.

The first control just selects decimals from 1 to 5.  The second uses the step to return only integers.  The last has a range of 1 to 100 in increments of 5.  Note that the value is 66 and you cannot set a value from 62 to 65.

== Discussion ==
The upper and lower values of the range control can also be set directly in the model.  XML Schema provides a minValue and a maxValue that can be used to adjust the range control limits.

== W3C Specification ==

Here is the specificaion from the W3C web site:
[http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/slice8.html#ui-range W3C range specification]

=Top-down and bottom-up approaches=
*Top-down refers to the traditional workshop or microfabrication method where tools are used to cut, mill and shape materials into the desired shape and order.
*Bottom-up refers to methods where devices 'create themselves' by selfassembly. Chemical synthesis is a good example. Bottom-up should broadly speaking be able to produce devices in parallel and much cheaper than top-down methods, but getting control over the methods is difficult when things become larger and more bulky than what is normally made by chemical synthesis. Of course nature has had time to evolve and optimize self-assembly processes that can do wonders.

=Microfabrication made smaller=
Much of nanotechnology is based on methods from [[w:Microfabrication| Microfabrication]].

The highly focused electron beam in a SEM is used for imaging nanostructures, but it can also be used to make nanoscale deposits. In the presence of carbonaceous or organometallic gasses in the SEM chamber, electron beam induced deposition (EBID or electron beam deposition (EBD)) can be used to construct three-dimensional nanostructures or solder/glue nanostructures.

[[Image:Slip-stick_piezo_actuator.jpg|thumb|300px|A slip stick actuator that provides coarse and fine positionoing modes. Coarse positioning provides long range but low precision, while fine positioning provides high precision and short range. The slip stick principle: Slow actuation of the piezo element leads to fine positioning. A combination of rapid contraction and slow extension can make the actuator move in coarse steps Δx because the force on the base becomes larger than the static friction force between the base and base plate. Reversing the direction is done by using slow contractions instead.]]

=AFM manipulation=
With AFM nanostructures such as nanotubes and nanowires lying on surfaces can be manipulated to make electrical circuits and measure their mechanical properties and the forces involved in manipulating them.

=STM manipulation=
Using an STM individual atoms can be manipulated on surface this was first demonstrated by Eigler et al. Here Xe atoms were manipulated on Ni to spell out IBM. This was then extended by Crommie et al, where Fe atoms were moved to create quantum corals. Here the electron standing waves created inside the corral are imaged by the STM tip. The probably demonstrates the higest resolution nanomanipulation.

=In-situ SEM manipulation=

To monitor a three-dimensional nanomanipulation process, in-situ SEM or TEM manipulation seems preferable. AFM (or STM) does have the resolution to image nanoscale objects, even down to the sub-atomic scale, but the imaging frame rate is usually slow compared to SEM or TEM and the structures will normally have to be planar. SEM offers the possibility of high frame rates; almost nanometer resolution imaging of three-dimensional objects; imaging over a large range of working distances; and ample surrounding volume in the sample chamber for the manipulation setup. TEM has a much more limited space available for the sample and manipulation systems but can on the other hand provide atomic resolution. For detailed studies of the nanowires' structure, TEM is a useful tool, but for the assembly of nanoscale components of a well defined structure, such as batch fabricated nanowires and nanotubes, the SEM resolution should be sufficient to complete the assembly task.

As the STM and AFM techniques opened up completely new fields of science by allowing the investigator to interact with the sample rather than just observe, development of nanomanipulation tools for SEM and TEM could probably have a similar effect for three-dimensional manipulation. Recently, commercial systems for such tasks have become available such as the F100 Nanomanipulator System from Zyvex in October 2003. Several research groups have also pursued developing such systems.

To date the tools used for in-situ SEM nanomanipulation have almost exclusively been individual tips (AFM cantilever tips or etched tungsten tips), sometimes tips used together with electron beam deposition have been used to create nanowire devices. Despite the availability of commercial microfabricated grippers in the last couple of years, little has been reported on the use of such devices for handling nanostructures. Some electrical measurements and manipulation tasks have been performed in ambient conditions with carbon nanotube nanotweezers.

==The Optimal SEM Image for Nanomanipulation==
As the typical SEM image is created from the secondary electrons collected from the sample, compromises must always be made to obtain the optimal imaging conditions regarding resolution and contrast. The contrast in a SEM SE image depends on the variations in SE yield from the different surface regions in the image and the signal to noise level. The resolution depends on the beam diameter and is at least some nm larger due to the SE range.

The optimal solution is always to use as good an emitter as possible (high ß_{e} in Eq. &lt;ref&gt;eq SEM beam diameter&lt;/ref&gt;). This means using FEG sources. Working at short r_{wd} gives a narrow beam (Eq. &lt;ref&gt;eq SEM beam diameter&lt;/ref&gt;), but will usually shield the standard ET detectors from attracting sufficient secondary electrons. Nanomanipulation often requires working with high resolution between two large manipulator units which further limits the efficiency of signal detection.

The manipulation equipment must be designed to make the end-effector and samples meet at short r_{wd}, and without obstructing the electron path towards the detector. A short r_{wd} also gives a short depth of focus, which can be a help during nanomanipulation because it makes it possible to judge the working distance to various objects by focussing on them. The operator can use this to get an impression of the height of the objects in the setup. Generally, for nanomanipulation, the above considerations indicate an inlens detector often can be advantageous.

Reducing the beam current to narrow the electron beam necessarily limits the number of detected electrons and make the signal-to-noise ratio low, unless one makes very slow scans to increase the number of counts

&lt;footnote&gt;The signal to noise ratio S/N for Poisson distributed count measurements n is S/N=vn and high counts are necessary to reduce noise in the images.
&lt;/footnote&gt;.

When used for in-situ nanomanipulation one needs a fast scan rate to follow the moving tools (preferably at rates approaching live video) and this requires high beam currents. The acceleration voltage is also important, and too high PE energy can make the sample transparent (such as the carbon coating in Fig. &lt;ref&gt;fig INTRO 3 e depth&lt;/ref&gt;b) while low energy usually make the image susceptible to drift due to charging and similar effects.

=In-situ TEM manipulation=
TEM offers atomic 3D resolution but the extreme requirements on stability combined with very limited sample space makes the contruction of in-situ TEM manipulation equipment quite a task.
With such systems, people have observed freely suspended wires of individual atoms between a gold tip and a gold surface; carbon nanotubes working as nanoscale pipettes for metals and a wealth of other exotic phenomena.

==DNA Biosensors==

In the future, DNA will find use as a versatile material from which scientists can craft biosensors. DNA biosensors can theoretically be used for medical diagnostics, forensic science, agriculture, or even environmental clean-up efforts. No external monitoring is needed for DNA-based sensing devises. This is a significant advantage. DNA biosensors are complicated mini-machines—consisting of sensing elements, micro lasers, and a signal generator. At the heart of DNA biosensor function is the fact that two strands of DNA stick to each other by virtue of chemical attractive forces. On such a sensor, only an exact fit—that is, two strands that match up at every nucleotide position—gives rise to a fluorescent signal (a glow) that is then transmitted to a signal generator.

=Nanotoxicology: Health effects of nanotechnology=

The environmental impacts of nanotechnology have become an increasingly active area of research.

Until recently the potential negative impacts of nanomaterials on human health and the environment have been rather speculative and unsubstantiated&lt;ref&gt;Y. Gogotsi , How Safe are Nanotubes and Other Nanofilaments?, Mat. Res. Innovat, 7, 192-194 (2003) [http://www.springerlink.com/index/Q7TG2YM26W5QH5FY.pdf]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, within the past number of years several studies have indicated that exposure to specific nanomaterials, e.g. nanoparticles, can lead to a gamut of adverse effects in humans and animals &lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes Cristina Buzea, Ivan Pacheco, and Kevin Robbie &quot;Nanomaterials and Nanoparticles: Sources and Toxicity&quot; Biointerphases 2 (1007) MR17-MR71.]&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref name=&quot;Lam1&quot;&gt;Lam, C. W.; James, J. T.; McCluskey, R.; Hunter, R. L. Pulmonary toxicity of single-wall carbon nanotubes in mice 7 and 90 days after intratracheal instillation. Toxicol. Sci. 2004, 77 (1), 126-134.&lt;/ref&gt;,

This has made some people very concerned drawing specific parallels to past negative experiences with small particles
&lt;ref name=&quot;etc3&quot;&gt;ETCgroup Down on the farm: the impact of nano-scale technologies on food and agriculture; Erosion, Technology and Concentration: 04.&lt;/ref&gt;,
&lt;ref name=&quot;enn4&quot;&gt;The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties; The Royal Society: London, Jul, 04.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Some types of nanoparticles are expected to be benign and are FDA approved and used for making paints and sunscreen lotion etc. However, there are also dangerous nanosized particles and chemicals that are known to accumulate in the food chain and have been known for many years:
*[[w:Asbestos| Asbestos]]
*[[w:Diesel_Particulate_Matter| Diesel particulate matter]]
*[[w:ultra fine particles|ultra fine particles]]
*[[w:DDT|DDT]]
*[[w:lead|lead]]

The problem is that it is difficult to extrapolate experience with bulk materials to nanoparticles because their chemical properties can be quite different. For instance, anti-bacterial silver nanoparticles dissolve in acids that would not dissolve bulk silver, which indicates their increased reactivity&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist 14 july 2007 p.41&lt;/ref&gt;.

The peer-reviewed journal [http://www.tandf.co.uk/Journals/titles/17435390.asp Nanotoxicology] is dedicated to Research relating to the potential for human and environmental exposure, hazard and risk associated with the use and development of nano-structured materials. Other journals also report on the research, for see the full [[Nanotechnology/Overviews#Peer_reviewed_Journals|Nano-journal list]] in this book.

==Nanoecotoxicology==
In response to the above concerns a new field of research has emergence termed [[w:nanoecotoxicology|“nano(eco-)toxiciolgoy”]] defined as the “science of engineered nanodevices and nanostructures that deals with their effects in living organisms”
&lt;ref name=&quot;Oberdorster5&quot;&gt;Oberdorster, G.; Oberdorster, E.; Oberdorster, J. Nanotoxicology: An emerging discipline evolving from studies of ultrafine particles. Environmental Health Perspectives 2005, 113 (7), 823-839.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In the following we will first try to explain why some people are concerned about nanomaterials and especially nanoparticles. This will lead to a general presentation of what is known about the hazardous properties of nanoparticles in the field of the environment and nanoecotoxicology. This includes a discussion of the main areas of uncertainty and gaps of knowledge.

==Human or ecotoxicology== 
The focus of this chapter is on the [[w:ecotoxicology|ecotoxicological]] - and environmental effects of nanomaterials, however references will be made to studies on human toxicology where it is assumed that such analogies are warranted or if studies have provided new insights that are relevant to the field of nanoecotoxicology as well. As further investigations are made, more knowledge will be gained about human toxicology of nanoparticles.

=Production and applications of nanotechnology=

At present the global production of nanomaterials is hard to estimate for three main reasons:
*Firstly, the definition of when something is “nanotechnology” is not clear-cut.
*Secondly, nanomaterials are used in a great diversity of products and industries and
*Thirdly, there is a general lack of information about what and how much is being produced and by whom.  

In 2001 the future global annual production of carbon-based nanomaterials was estimated to be several hundred tons, but already in 2003 the global production of nanotubes alone was estimated to be around 900 tons distributed between 16 manufacturers
&lt;ref name=&quot;kleiner6&quot;&gt;Kleiner, K.; Hogan, J. How safe is nanotech. New Scientist Tech 2003, (2388).&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Japanese company, Frontier Carbon Corp, plan to start an annual production of 40 tons of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]
&lt;ref name=&quot;Mraz7&quot;&gt;Mraz, S. J. Nanowaste: The Next big threat? http://www.machinedesign.com/ASP/strArticleID/59554/strSite/MDSite/viewSelectedArticle.asp 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;.

It is estimated that the global annual production of nanotubes and fiber was 65 tons equal to €144 million worth and it is expected to surpass €3 billion by 2010 representing an annual growth rate of well over 60%
&lt;ref name=&quot;CNPS8&quot;&gt;Cientifica Nanotube Production Survey. http://www. cientifica. eu/index. php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37&amp;Itemid=74 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Even though the information about the production of carbon-based nanomaterials is scarce, the annual production volumes of for instance quantum dots, nano-metals, and materials with nanostructured surfaces are completely unknown.

The development of nanotechnology is still in its infancy, and the current production and use of nanomaterials is most likely not representative for the future use and production. Some estimates for the future manufacturing of nanomaterials have been made. For instance the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering
&lt;ref name=&quot;enn4&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;
estimated that nanomaterials used in relation to environmental technology alone will increase from 10 tons per year in 2004 to between 1000-10.000 tons per year before 2020. However, the basis of many of these estimations is often highly unclear and the future production will depend on a number of things such as for instance: 

#Whether the use of nanomaterials indeed entails the promised benefits in the long run;  
#which and how many different applications and products will eventually be developed and implemented; 
#And on how nanotechnology is perceived and embraced by the public? 

With that said, the expectations are enormous. It is estimated that the global market value of nano-related products will be U.S. $1 trillion in 2015 and that potentially 7 million jobs will be created globally
&lt;ref name=&quot;rs9&quot;&gt;The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering Nanosciences and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties; The Royal Society: London, 04. &lt;/ref&gt; ,

In The Nano-Micro Interface: Bridging the Micro and Nano Worlds, Edited by Hans-Jörg Fecht and Matthias Werner, Ed.; WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA: Weinheim, 2004 pp 1-10. &lt;/ref&gt;

=Exposure of environment and humans=
Exposure of nanomaterials to workers, consumers, and the environment seems inevitable with the increasing production volumes and the increasing number of commercially available products containing nanomaterials or based on nanotechnology
&lt;ref name=&quot;pen11&quot;&gt;Project of Emerging Nanotechnologies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars A Nanotechnology Consumer Product Inventory. http://www. nanotechproject. org/44 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Exposure is a key element in risk assessment of nanomaterials since it is a precondition for the potential toxicological and ecotoxicological effects to take place. If there is no exposure – there is no risk. Nanoparticles are already being used in various products and the exposure can happen through multiple routes.

Human routes of exposure are:
*dermal (for instance through the use of cosmetics containing nanoparticles);
*inhalation (of nanoparticles for instance in the workplace);
*ingestion (of for instance food products containing nanoparticles);
*and injection (of for instance medicine based on nanotechnology). 

Although there are many different kinds of nanomaterials, concerns have mainly been raised about free nanoparticles
&lt;ref name=&quot;enn4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;,
&lt;ref name=&quot;ecn12&quot;&gt;European Commission Nanotechnologies: A Preliminary Risk Analysis on the Basis of a Workshop Organized in Brussels on 1-2 March 2004 by the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate General of the European Commission; European Commission Community Health and Consumer Protection: 04.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Free nanoparticles could either get into the environment through direct outlet to the environment or through the degradation of nanomaterials (such as surface bound nanoparticles or nanosized coatings).

Environmental routes of exposure are multiple.

One route is via the wastewater system. At the moment research laboratories and manufacturing companies must be assumed to be the main contributor of carbon-based nanoparticles to the wastewater outlet.

For other kinds of nanoparticles for instance titanium dioxide and silver, consumer products such as cosmetics, crèmes and detergents, is a key source already and discharges must be assumed to increase with the development of nanotechnology.

However, as development and applications of these materials increases this exposure pattern must be assumed to change dramatically. Traces of drugs and medicine based on nanoparticles can also be disposed of through the wastewater system into the environment.

Drugs are often coated, and studies have show that these coatings can be degraded through either metabolism inside the human body or transformation in environment due to UV-light
&lt;ref name=&quot;Oberdorster13&quot;&gt;Oberdorster, G.; Oberdorster, E.; Oberdorster, J. Nanotoxicology: An emerging discipline evolving from studies of ultrafine particles. Environmental Health Perspectives 2005, 113 (7), 823-839.&lt;/ref&gt;. Which only emphasises the need to studying the many possible process that will alter the properties of nanoparticles once they are released in nature.

Another route of exposure to the into the environment is from wastewater overflow or if there is an outlet from the wastewater treatment plant where nanoparticles are not effectively held back or degraded.

Additional routes of environmental exposure are spills from production, transport, and disposal of nanomaterials or products
&lt;ref name=&quot;rs9&quot;&gt;The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering Nanosciences and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties; The Royal Society: London, 04.&lt;/ref&gt;.

While many of the potential routes of exposure are uncertain scenarios, which need confirmation, the direct application of nanoparticles, such as for instance nano zero valent iron for remediation of polluted areas or groundwater, is one route of exposure that will certainly lead to environmental exposure. Although, remediation with the help of free nanoparticles is one of the most promising environmental nanotechnologies, it might also be one the one raising the most concerns. The Royal Society and The Royal Academy of Engineering
&lt;ref name=&quot;enn4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
actually recommend that the use of free nanoparticles in environmental applications such as remediation should be prohibited until it has been shown that the benefits outweigh the risks. 

The presence of manufactured nanomaterials in the environment is not widespread yet, it is important to remember that the concentration of xenobiotic organic chemicals in the environment in the past has increased proportionally with the application of these
&lt;ref name=&quot;Colvin14&quot;&gt; Colvin, V. The potential environmental impact of engineered nanomaterials. Nature Biotechnology 2003, 21 (10), 1166-1170.&lt;/ref&gt;
– meaning that it is only a question of time before we will find nanomaterials such as nanoparticles in the environment – if we have the means to detect them. 

The size of nanoparticles and our current lack of metrological methods to detect them is a huge potential problem in relation to identification and remediation both in relation to their fate in the human body and in the environment &lt;ref name=&quot;Mraz7&quot;&gt;Mraz, S. J. Nanowaste: The Next big threat? [http://www.machinedesign.com/ASP/strArticleID/59554/strSite/MDSite/viewSelectedArticle.asp] 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Once there is a widespread environmental exposure human exposure through the environment seems almost inevitable since water- and sediment living organisms can take up nanoparticles from water or by ingestion of nanoparticles sorbed to the vegetation or sediment and thereby making transport of nanoparticles up through the food chain possible
&lt;ref name=&quot;rs10&quot;&gt;The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering Nanosciences and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties; The Royal Society: London, 04.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=Nanoecotoxicology=
Despite the widespread development of nanotechnology and nanomaterials through the last 10-20 years, it is only recently that focus has been turned onto the potential toxicological effects on humans, animals, and the environment through the exposure of manufactured nanomaterials
&lt;ref name=&quot;colvin14&quot;&gt;Colvin, V. The potential environmental impact of engineered nanomaterials. Nature Biotechnology 2003, 21 (10), 1166-1170.&lt;/ref&gt;.

With that being said, it is a new development that potential negative health and environmental impacts of a technology or a material is given attention at the developing stage and not after years of application
&lt;ref name=&quot;colvin15&quot;&gt;Colvin, V. Responsible nanotechnology: Looking beyond the good news. Eurekalert 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The term “nano(eco-)toxicology” has been developed on the request of a number of scientists and is now seen as a separate scientific discipline with the purpose of generating data and knowledge about nanomaterials effects on humans and the environment
&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorster, G.; Oberdorster, E.; Oberdorster, J. Nanotoxicology: An emerging discipline evolving from studies of ultrafine particles. Environmental Health Perspectives 2005, 113 (7), 823-839.&lt;/ref&gt;,
&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, J. Safe as sunshine? The Engineer 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
Toxicological information and data on nanomaterials is limited and ecotoxicological data is even more limited. Some toxicological studies have been done on biological systems with nanoparticles in the form of metals, metal oxides, selenium and carbon
&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) Opinion on The appropriateness of existing methodologies to assess the potential risks associated with engineered and adventitious products of nanotechnologies Adopted by the SCENIHR during the 7th plenary meeting of 28-29 September 2005;SCENIHR/002/05; European Commission Health &amp; Consumer Protection Directorate-General: 05.&lt;/ref&gt;,
however the majority of toxicological studies have been done with carbon fullerenes
&lt;ref&gt;Colvin, V. The potential environmental impact of engineered nanomaterials. Nature Biotechnology 2003, 21 (10), 1166-1170.&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
Only a very limited number of ecotoxicological studies have been performed on the effects of nanoparticles on environmentally relevant species, and, as for the toxicological studies, most of the studies have been done on fullerenes. However, according to the European Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks
&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) Opinion on The appropriateness of existing methodologies to assess the potential risks associated with engineered and adventitious products of nanotechnologies Adopted by the SCENIHR during the 7th plenary meeting of 28-29 September 2005;SCENIHR/002/05; European Commission Health &amp; Consumer Protection Directorate-General: 05.&lt;/ref&gt;
results from human toxicological studies on the cellular level can be assumed to be applicable for organisms in the environment, even though this of cause needs further verification. In the following a summary of the early findings from studies done on bacteria, crustaceans, fish, and plants will be given and discussed.

==Bacteria==
The effect of nanoparticles on bacteria is very important since bacteria constitute the lowest level and hence the entrance to the food chain in many ecosystems
&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) Opinion on The appropriateness of existing methodologies to assess the potential risks associated with engineered and adventitious products of nanotechnologies Adopted by the SCENIHR during the 7th plenary meeting of 28-29 September 2005;SCENIHR/002/05; European Commission Health &amp; Consumer Protection Directorate-General: 05.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The effects of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] aggregates on two common soil bacteria E. coli (gram negative) and B. subtilis (gram positive) was investigated by Fortner et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Fortner, J. D.; Lyon, D. Y.; Sayes, C. M.; Boyd, A. M.; Falkner, J. C.; Hotze, E. M.; Alemany, L. B.; Tao, Y. J.; Guo, W.; Ausman, K. D.; Colvin, V. L.; Hughes, J. B. C-60 in water: Nanocrystal formation and microbial response. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2005, 39 (11), 4307-4316.&lt;/ref&gt;
on rich and minimal media, respectively, under aerobe and anaerobe conditions. At concentrations above 0.4 mg/L growth was completely inhibited in both cultures exposed with and without oxygen and light. No inhibition was observed on rich media in concentration up to 2.5 mg/L, which could be due to that [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] precipitates or gets coated by proteins in the media. The importance of surface chemistry is highlighted by the observation that hydroxylated [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] did not give any response, which is in agreement with the results obtained by Sayes et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Sayes, C. M.; Fortner, J. D.; Guo, W.; Lyon, D.; Boyd, A. M.; Ausman, K. D.; Tao, Y. J.; Sitharaman, B.; Wilson, L. J.; Hughes, J. B.; West, J. L.; Colvin, V. L. The differential cytotoxicity of water-soluble fullerenes. Nano Letters 2004, 4 (10), 1881-1887.&lt;/ref&gt; 
who investigated the toxicity on human dermal- and liver cells. The antibacterial effects of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] has furthermore been observed by Oberdorster
&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorster, E. Manufactured nanomaterials (Fullerenes, C-60) induce oxidative stress in the brain of juvenile largemouth bass. Environmental Health Perspectives 2004, 112 (10), 1058-1062.&lt;/ref&gt;
, who observed remarkably clearer water during experiments with fish in the aquarium with 0.5 mg/L compared to control. 

Lyon et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, D. Y.; Adams, L. K.; Falkner, J. C.; Alvaraz, P. J. J. Antibacterial Activity of Fullerene Water Suspensions: Effects of Preparation Method and Particle Size . Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2006, 40, 4360-4366.&lt;/ref&gt;
explored the influence of four different preparation methods of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] (stirred [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]], THF-[[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]], toluene-[[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]], and PVP-[[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]) on Bacillus subtilis and found that all four suspensions exhibited relatively strong antibacterial activity ranging from 0.09 ± 0.01 mg/L- 0.7 ± 0.3 mg/L, and although fractions containing smaller aggregates had greater antibacterial activity, the increase in toxicity was disproportionately higher than the associated increase in surface area.

Silver nanoparticles are increasingly used as antibacterial agent

A number of studies have been performed with the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna, which is an important ecological important species that furthermore is the most commonly used organisms in regulatory testing of chemicals.

The organism can filter up to 16 ml an hour, which entails contact with large amounts of water in its surroundings. Nanoparticles can be taken up via the filtration and hence could lead to potential toxic effects

&lt;ref&gt;Lovern, S. B.; Strickler, J. R.; Klaper, R. Behavioral and Physiological Changes in Daphnia magna when Exposed to Nanoparticle Suspensions (Titanium Dioxide, Nano-[[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]HxC70Hx). Environ. Sci. Technol. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
observed some mortality after 48 hours of exposure to 35 mg/L [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] (produced by stirring and also known as “nano[[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]” or “n[[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]”), however 50% mortality was not achieved, and hence an LC50 could not be determined

A considerable higher toxicity of LC50 = 0.8 mg/L is obtained when using n[[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] put into solution via the solvent tetrahydrofuran (THF) – which might indicate that residues of THF is bound to or within the [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]-aggreggates, however whether this is the case in unclear at the moment. The solubility of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] using sonication has also been found to increase toxicity
&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, S. Q.; Oberdorster, E.; Haasch, M. L. Toxicity of an engineered nanoparticle (fullerene, C-60) in two aquatic species, Daphnia and fathead minnow. Marine Environmental Research 2006, 62, S5-S9.&lt;/ref&gt;, 
whereas unfiltered [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] dissolved by sonication has been found to cause less toxicity (LC50 = 8 mg/L). This is attributed to the formation of aggregates, which causes a variation of the bioavailability to the different concentrations. Besides mortality, deviating behavior was observed in the exposed Daphnia magna in the form of repeated collisions with the glass beakers and swimming in circles at the surface of the water

Changes in the number of hops, heart rate, and appendage movement after subtoxic levels of exposure to [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] and other [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]-derivatives

Environ. Sci. Technol. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;.
However, Titanium dioxide (TiO2) dissolved via THF has been observed to cause increased mortality in Daphania magna within 48 hours (LC50= 5.5 mg/L), but to a lesser extent than fullerenes, while unfiltered TiO2 dissolved by sonication did not results in a increasing dose-response relationship, but rather a variation response

Lovern and Klaper
&lt;ref&gt;Lovern, S. B.; Klaper, R. Daphnia Magna mortality when exposed to titanium dioxide and fullerene ([[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]) nanoparticles. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 2006, 25 (4), 1132-1137.&lt;/ref&gt;
have furthermore investigated whether THF contributed to the toxicity by comparing TiO2 manufactured with and without THF and found no difference in toxicity and hence concluded that THF did not contribute to neither the toxicity of TiO2 or fullerenes. 

Experiments with the marine species Acartia tonsa exposed to 22.5 mg/L stirred n[[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] have been found to cause up to 23% mortality after 96 hours, however mortality was not significantly different from control25. And exposure of Hyella azteca by 7 mg/L stirred n[[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] in 96 hours did not lead to any visible toxic effects – not even by administration of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] through the feed

Only a limited number of studies have investigated long-term exposure of nanoparticles to crustaceans. Chronic exposure of Daphnia magna with 2.5 mg/L stirred n[[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] was observed to cause 40% mortality besides causing sub-lethal effects in the form of reduced reproducibility (fewer offspring) and delayed shift of shield

Templeton et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Templeton, R. C.; Ferguson, P. L.; Washburn, K. M.; Scrivens, W. A.; Chandler, G. T. Life-Cycle Effects of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWNTs) on an Estuarine Meiobenthic Copepod. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2006, 40 (23), 7387-7393.&lt;/ref&gt; 
observed an average cumulative life-cycle mortality of 13 ± 4% in an Estuarine Meiobenthic Copepod Amphiascus tenuiremis after being exposed to SWCNT, while mean life-cycle mortalities of 12 ± 3, 19 ± 2, 21 ± 3, and 36 ± 11 %  were observed for 0.58, 0.97, 1.6, and 10 mg/L. 

Exposure to 10 mg/L showed:
# significantly increased mortalities for the naupliar stage and cumulative life-cycle;
# a dramatically reduced development success to 51% for the nauplius to copepodite window, 89% for the copepodite to adult window, and 34% overall for the nauplius to adult period;
# a significantly depresssed fertilization rate averaging only 64 ± 13%.
Templeton also observed that exposure to 1.6 mg/L caused a significantly increase in development rate of 1 day faster, whereas a 6 day significant delay was seen for 10 mg/L. 

==Fish==
A limited number of studies have been done with fish as test species. In a highly cited study Oberdorster
&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorster, E. Manufactured nanomaterials (Fullerenes, C-60) induce oxidative stress in the brain of juvenile largemouth bass. Environmental Health Perspectives 2004, 112 (10), 1058-1062.&lt;/ref&gt; 
found that 0.5 mg/L [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] dissolved in THF caused increased lipid peroxidation in the brain of largemouth bass (Mikropterus salmoides). Lipid peroxidation was found to be decreased in the gills and the liver, which was attributed to reparation enzymes. No protein oxidation was observed in any of the mentioned tissue, however a discharge of the antioxidant glutathione occurred in the liver possibility due to large amount of reactive oxygen molecules stemming from oxidative stress caused by [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]

For Pimephales promelas exposured to 1 mg/L THF-dissolved [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]], 100 % mortality was obtained within 18 hours, whereas 1 mg/L [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] stirred in water did not lead to any mortality within 96 hours. However, at this concentration inhibition of a gene which regulates fat metabolism was observed. No effect was observed in the species Oryzia latipes at 1 mg/L stirred [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]], which indicates different inter-species sensitivity toward [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]

observed a dose-dependent rise in ventilation rate, gill pathologies (oedema, altered mucocytes, hyperplasia), and mucus secretion with SWCNT precipitation on the gill mucus in juvenile rainbow trout.

Smith et al. also observed: 
*dose-dependent changes in brain and gill Zn or Cu, partly attributed to the solvent;
*a significant increases in Na+K+ATPase activity in the gills and intestine;
*a significant dose-dependent decreases in TBARS especially in the gill, brain and liver;
*and a significant increases in the total glutathione levels in the gills (28 %) and livers (18 %), compared to the solvent control (15 mg/l SDS).
*Finally, they observed increasing aggressive behavior; possible aneurisms or swellings on the ventral surface of the cerebellum in the brain and apoptotic bodies and cells in abnormal nuclear division in liver cells.

Recently Kashiwada
&lt;ref&gt;Kashiwada, S. Distribution of nanoparticles in the see-through medaka (Oryzias latipes). Environmental Health Perspectives 2006, 114 (11), 1697-1702.&lt;/ref&gt;29 
reported observing 35.6% lethal effect in embryos of the medaka Oryzias latipes (ST II strain) exposed to 39.4 nm polystyrene nanoparticles at 30 mg/L, but no mortality was observed during the exposure and postexposure to hatch periods at exposure to 1 mg/L. The lethal effect was observed to increase proportionally with the salinity, and 100% complete lethality occurred at 5 time higher concentrated embryo rearing medium. Kashwada also found that 474 nm particles showed the highest bioavailability to eggs, and 39.4 nm particles were confirmed to shift into the yolk and gallbladder along with embryonic development. High levels of particles were found in the gills and intestine for adult medaka exposed to 39.4 nm nanoparticles at 10 mg/L, and it is hypothesized that particles pass through the membranes of the gills and/or intestine and enter the circulation.

==Plants==
To our knowledge only one study has been performed on phytotoxicity, and it indicates that aluminum nanoparticles become less toxic when coated with phenatrene, which again underlines the importance to surface treatments in relation to the toxicity of nanoparticles
&lt;ref&gt;Yang, L.; Watts, D. J. Particle surface characteristics may play an important role in phytotoxicity of alumina nanoparticles. Toxicology Letters 2005, 158 (2), 122-132.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=Identification of key hazard properties=
Size is the general reason why nanoparticles have become a matter of discussion and concern. 

The very small dimensions of nanoparticles increases the specific surface area in relation to mass, which again means that even small amounts of nanoparticles have a great surface area on which reactions could happen. 

If a reaction with chemical or biological components of an organism leads to a toxic response, this response would be enhanced for nanoparticles. This enhancement of the inherent toxicity is seen as the main reason why smaller particles are generally more biologically active and toxic that larger particles of the same material
&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) Opinion on The appropriateness of existing methodologies to assess the potential risks associated with engineered and adventitious products of nanotechnologies Adopted by the SCENIHR during the 7th plenary meeting of 28-29 September 2005;SCENIHR/002/05; European Commission Health &amp; Consumer Protection Directorate-General: 05.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Size can cause specific toxic response if for instance nanoparticles will bind to proteins and thereby change their form and activity, leading to inhibition or change in one or more specific reactions in the body
&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, J. Taming high-tech particles. Science News 2002, 161 (13), 200.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Besides the increased reactivity, the small size of the nanoparticles also means that they can easier be taken up by cells and that they are taken up and distributed faster in organism compared to their larger counterparts
&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorster, G.; Oberdorster, E.; Oberdorster, J. Nanotoxicology: An emerging discipline evolving from studies of ultrafine particles. Environmental Health Perspectives 2005, 113 (7), 823-839.&lt;/ref&gt;,
&lt;ref&gt;Depledge, M.; Owen, R. Nanotechnology and the environment: risks and rewards. Marine Pollution Bulletine 2005, 50, 609-612.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Due to physical and chemical surface properties all nanoparticles are expected to absorb to larger molecules after uptake in an organism via a given route of uptake
&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) Opinion on The appropriateness of existing methodologies to assess the potential risks associated with engineered and adventitious products of nanotechnologies Adopted by the SCENIHR during the 7th plenary meeting of 28-29 September 2005;SCENIHR/002/05; European Commission Health &amp; Consumer Protection Directorate-General: 05.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Some nanoparticles such as fullerene derivates are developed specifically with the intention of pharmacological applications because of their ability of being taken up and distributed fast in the human body, even in areas which are normally hard to reach – such as the brain tissue
&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering Nanosciences and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties; The Royal Society: London, 04.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Fast uptake and distribution can also be interpreted as a warning about possible toxicity, however this need not always be the case
&lt;ref&gt;Colvin, V. The potential environmental impact of engineered nanomaterials. Nature Biotechnology 2003, 21 (10), 1166-1170.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Some nanoparticles are developed with the intension of being toxic for instance with the purpose of killing bacteria or cancer cells
&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, J. Rice finds 'on-off switch' for buckyball toxicity. Eurekalert 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;, 
and in such cases toxicity can unintentionally lead to adverse effects on humans or the environment. 

Due to the lack of knowledge and lack of studies, the toxicity of nanoparticles is often discussed on the basis of ultra fine particles (UFPs), asbestos, and quartz, which due to their size could in theory fall under the definition of nanotechnology
&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorster, G.; Oberdorster, E.; Oberdorster, J. Nanotoxicology: An emerging discipline evolving from studies of ultrafine particles. Environmental Health Perspectives 2005, 113 (7), 823-839.&lt;/ref&gt;,
&lt;ref&gt;	The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering Nanosciences and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties; The Royal Society: London, 04.&lt;/ref&gt;.

An estimation of the toxicity of nanoparticles could also be made on the basis of the chemical composition, which is done for instance in the USA, where safety data sheets for the most nanomaterials report the properties and precautions related to the bulk material
&lt;ref&gt;	Colvin, V. The potential environmental impact of engineered nanomaterials. Nature Biotechnology 2003, 21 (10), 1166-1170.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Within such an approach lies the assumption that it is either the chemical composition or the size that is determining for the toxicity. However, many scientific experts agree that that the toxicity of nanoparticles cannot and should not be predicted on the basis of the toxicity of the bulk material alone
&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) Opinion on The appropriateness of existing methodologies to assess the potential risks associated with engineered and adventitious products of nanotechnologies Adopted by the SCENIHR during the 7th plenary meeting of 28-29 September 2005;SCENIHR/002/05; European Commission Health &amp; Consumer Protection Directorate-General: 05.&lt;/ref&gt;,
&lt;ref&gt;Lam, C. W.; James, J. T.; McCluskey, R.; Hunter, R. L. Pulmonary toxicity of single-wall carbon nanotubes in mice 7 and 90 days after in&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The increased surface area-to-mass ratio means that nanoparticles could potentially be more toxic per mass than larger particles (assuming that we are talking about bulk material and not suspensions), which means that the dose-response relationship will be different for nanoparticles compared to their larger counterparts for the same material. This aspect is especially problematic in connection with toxicological and ecotoxicological experiments, since conventional toxicology correlates effects with the given mass of a substance
&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) Opinion on The appropriateness of existing methodologies to assess the potential risks associated with engineered and adventitious products of nanotechnologies Adopted by the SCENIHR during the 7th plenary meeting of 28-29 September 2005;SCENIHR/002/05; European Commission Health &amp; Consumer Protection Directorate-General: 05.&lt;/ref&gt;,

Inhalation studies on rodents have found that ultrafine particles of titanium dioxide causes larger lung damage in rodents compared to larger fine particles for the same amount of the substance. However, it turned out that ultra fine- and fine particles cause the same response, if the dose was estimated as surface area instead of as mass
&lt;ref&gt;SCENIHR The appropriateness of the risk assessment methodology in accordance with the Technical Guidance Documents for new and existing substances for assessing the risks of nanomaterials; European Commission: 07.&lt;/ref&gt;.

This indicates that surface area might be a better parameter for estimating toxicity than concentration, when comparing different sizes of nanoparticles with the same chemical composition5. Besides surface area, the number of particles has been pointed out as a key parameter that should be used instead of concentration
&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) Opinion on The appropriateness of existing methodologies to assess the potential risks associated with engineered and adventitious products of nanotechnologies Adopted by the SCENIHR during the 7th plenary meeting of 28-29 September 2005;SCENIHR/002/05; European Commission Health &amp; Consumer Protection Directorate-General: 05.&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
Although comparison of ultrafine particles, fine particles, and even nanoparticles of the same substance in a laboratory setting might be relevant, it is questionable whether or not general analogies can be made between the toxicity of ultrafine particles from anthropogenic sources (such as cooking, combustion, wood-burning stoves, etc.) and nanoparticles, since the chemical composition and structure of ultrafine particles is very heterogeneous when compared to nanoparticles which will often consists of specific homogeneous particles
&lt;ref&gt;Colvin, V. The potential environmental impact of engineered nanomaterials. Nature Biotechnology 2003, 21 (10), 1166-1170.&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
From a chemical viewpoint nanoparticles can consist of transition metals, metal oxides, carbon structures and in principle any other material, and hence the toxicity is bound to vary as a results of that, which again makes in impossible to classify nanoparticles according to their toxicity based on size alone

Finally, the structure of nanoparticles has been shown to have a profound influence on the toxicity of nanoparticles. In a study comparing the cytotoxicity of different kinds of carbon-based nanomaterials concluded that single walled carbon nanotubes was more toxic that multi walled carbon nanotubes which again was more toxic than [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]

=Hazard identification=

In order to complete a hazard identification of nanomaterials, the following is ideally required
*ecotoxicological studies
*data about toxic effects
*information on physical-chemical properties
**Solubility
**Sorption
*biodegradability
*accumulation 
*and all likely depending on the specific size and detailed composition of the nanoparticles

In addition to the physical-chemical properties normally considered in relation to chemical substances, the physical-chemical properties of nanomaterials is dependent on a number of additional factors such as size, structure, shape, and surface area. Opinions on, which of these factors are important differ among scientists, and the identification of key properties is a key gap of our current knowledge

There is little doubt that the physical-chemical properties normally required when doing a hazard identification of chemical substances are not representative for nanomaterials, however there is at current no alternative methods. In the following key issues in regards to determining the destiny and distribution of nanoparticles in the environment will be discussed, however the focus will primarily be on fullerenes such as [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]].

==Solubility==

Solubility in water is a key factor in the estimation of the environmental effects of a given substance since it is often via contact with water that effects-, or transformation, and distribution processes occur such as for instance bioaccumulation.

Solubility of a given substance can be estimated from its structure and reactive groups. For instance, Fullerenes consist of carbon atoms, which results in a very hydrophobic molecule, which cannot easily be dissolved in water.
 
Fortner et al.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortner&quot;&gt;Fortner, J. D.; Lyon, D. Y.; Sayes, C. M.; Boyd, A. M.; Falkner, J. C.; Hotze, E. M.; Alemany, L. B.; Tao, Y. J.; Guo, W.; Ausman, K. D.; Colvin, V. L.; Hughes, J. B. C-60 in water: Nanocrystal formation and microbial response. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2005, 39 (11), 4307-4316.&lt;/ref&gt; 
have estimated the solubility of individual [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] in polar solvents such as water to be 10-9 mg/L. When [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] gets in contact with water, aggregates are formed in the size range between 5-500 nm with a greater solubility of up to 100 mg/L, which is 11 orders of magnitude greater than the estimated molecular solubility. This can, however, only be obtained by fast and long-term stirring in up to two months. Aggregates of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] can be formed at pH between 3.75 and 10.25 and hence also by pH-values relevant to the environment
&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortner&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
As mentioned the solubility is affected by the formation of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] aggregates, which can lead to changes in toxicity
&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortner&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Aggregates form reactive free radicals, which can cause harm to cell membranes, while free [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] kept from aggregation by coatings do not form free radical

Gharbi et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Gharbi, N.; Pressac, M.; Hadchouel, M.; Szwarc, H.; Wilson, S. R.; Moussa, F. [60]Fullerene is a powerful antioxidant in vivo with no acute or subacute toxicity. Nano Lett. 2005, 5 (12), 2578-2585.&lt;/ref&gt; 
point to the accessibility of double bonds in the [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] molecule as an important precondition for its interactions with other biological molecules. 

The solubility of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] is less in salt water, and according to Zhu et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, S. Q.; Oberdorster, E.; Haasch, M. L. Toxicity of an engineered nanoparticle (fullerene, C-60) in two aquatic species, Daphnia and fathead minnow. Marine Environmental Research 2006, 62, S5-S9.&lt;/ref&gt; 
only 22.5 mg/L can be dissolved in 35 ‰ sea water. Fortner et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Fortner, J. D.; Lyon, D. Y.; Sayes, C. M.; Boyd, A. M.; Falkner, J. C.; Hotze, E. M.; Alemany, L. B.; Tao, Y. J.; Guo, W.; Ausman, K. D.; Colvin, V. L.; Hughes, J. B. C-60 in water: Nanocrystal formation and microbial response. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2005, 39 (11), 4307-4316.&lt;/ref&gt; 
have found that aggregate precipitates from the solution in both salt water and groundwater with an ionic strength above 0.1 I, but aggregates would be stable in surface- and groundwater, which typically have an ionic strength below 0.5 I.
 
The solubility of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] can be increased to about 13,000-100,000 mg/L by chemically modifying the [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]–molecule with polar functional groups such as hydroxyl
&lt;ref&gt;Sayes, C. M.; Fortner, J. D.; Guo, W.; Lyon, D.; Boyd, A. M.; Ausman, K. D.; Tao, Y. J.; Sitharaman, B.; Wilson, L. J.; Hughes, J. B.; West, J. L.; Colvin, V. L. The differential cytotoxicity of water-soluble fullerenes. Nano Letters 2004, 4 (10), 1881-1887.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The solubility can furthermore be increased by the use of sonication or the use of none-polar solvents. 

[[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] will neither behave as molecules nor as colloids in aqueous systems, but rather as a mixture of the two
&lt;ref&gt;Fortner, J. D.; Lyon, D. Y.; Sayes, C. M.; Boyd, A. M.; Falkner, J. C.; Hotze, E. M.; Alemany, L. B.; Tao, Y. J.; Guo, W.; Ausman, K. D.; Colvin, V. L.; Hughes, J. B. C-60 in water: Nanocrystal formation and microbial response. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2005, 39 (11), 4307-4316.&lt;/ref&gt;,
&lt;ref&gt;Andrievsky, G. V.; Klochkov, V. K.; Bordyuh, A. B.; Dovbeshko, G. I. Comparative analysis of two aqueous-colloidal solutions of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] fullerene with help of FTIR reflectance and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Chemical Physics Letters 2002, 364 (1-2), 8-17.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The chemical properties of individual [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] such as the log octanol-water partitioning coefficient (log Kow) and solubility are not appropriate in regard to estimating the behavior of aggregates of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Instead properties such as size and surface chemistry should be applied a key parameters
&lt;ref&gt;Fortner, J. D.; Lyon, D. Y.; Sayes, C. M.; Boyd, A. M.; Falkner, J. C.; Hotze, E. M.; Alemany, L. B.; Tao, Y. J.; Guo, W.; Ausman, K. D.; Colvin, V. L.; Hughes, J. B. C-60 in water: Nanocrystal formation and microbial response. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2005, 39 (11), 4307-4316.&lt;/ref&gt;18. 

Just as the number of nanomaterials and the number of nanoparticles differ greatly so does the solubility of the nanoparticles. For instance carbon nanotubes have been reported to completely insoluble in water
&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety Executive Health effects of particles produced for nanotechnologies;EH75/6; Health and Safety Executive: Dec, 04.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
It should be underlined that which method is used to solute nanoparticles is vital when performing and interpreting environmental and toxicological tests.

==Evaporation==
Information about evaporation of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] from aqueous suspensions has so far not been reported in the literature and since the same goes for vapor pressure and Henry’s constant, evaporation cannot be estimated for the time being. Fullerenes are not considered to evaporate – neither from aqueous suspension or solvents – since the suspension of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] using solvents still entails [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] after evaporation of the solvent
&lt;ref&gt;Fortner, J. D.; Lyon, D. Y.; Sayes, C. M.; Boyd, A. M.; Falkner, J. C.; Hotze, E. M.; Alemany, L. B.; Tao, Y. J.; Guo, W.; Ausman, K. D.; Colvin, V. L.; Hughes, J. B. C-60 in water: Nanocrystal formation and microbial response. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2005, 39 (11), 4307-4316.&lt;/ref&gt;,
&lt;ref&gt;Deguchi, S.; Alargova, R. G.; Tsujii, K. Stable Dispersions of Fullerenes, [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] and C70, in Water. Preparation and Characterization. Langmuir 2001, 17 (19), 6013-6017.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Sorption== 
According to Oberdorster et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorster, G.; Oberdorster, E.; Oberdorster, J. Nanotoxicology: An emerging discipline evolving from studies of ultrafine particles. Environmental Health Perspectives 2005, 113 (7), 823-839.&lt;/ref&gt; 
nanoparticles will have a tendency to sorb to sediments and soil particles and hence be immobile because of the great surface area when compared to mass. Size alone will furthermore have the effect that the transport of nanoparticles will be dominated by diffusion rather than van der Waal forces and London forces, which increases transport to surfaces, but it is not always that collision with surfaces will lead to sorption
&lt;ref&gt;Lecoanet, H. F.; Bottero, J. Y.; Wiesner, M. R. Laboratory assessment of the mobility of nanomaterials in porous media. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2004, 38 (19), 5164-5169.&lt;/ref&gt;.
  
For [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] and carbon nanotubes the chemical structure will furthermore result in great sorption to organic matter and hence little mobility since these substances consists of carbon. However, a study by Lecoanet et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Lecoanet, H. F.; Bottero, J. Y.; Wiesner, M. R. Laboratory assessment of the mobility of nanomaterials in porous media. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2004, 38 (19), 5164-5169.&lt;/ref&gt;45 
found that both [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] and carbon nanotubes are able to migrate through porous medium analogous to a sandy groundwater aquifer and that [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] in general is transported with lower velocity when compared to single walled carbon nanotubes, fullerol, and surface modified [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The study further illustrates that modification of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] on the way to - or after - the outlet into the environment can profoundly influence mobility. Reactions with naturally occurring enzymes
&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Nanotechnologies: A Preliminary Risk Analysis on the Basis of a Workshop Organized in Brussels on 1-2 March 2004 by the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate General of the European Commission; European Commission Community Health and Consumer Protection: 04.&lt;/ref&gt;, 
electrolytes or humid acid can for instance bind to the surface and make thereby increase mobility
&lt;ref&gt;Brant, J.; Lecoanet, H.; Wiesner, M. R. Aggregation and deposition characteristics of fullerene nanoparticles in aqueous
systems. Journal of Nanoparticle Research 2005, 7, 545-553.
&lt;/ref&gt;, 
just as degradation by UV-light or microorganisms could potentially results in modified [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] with increased mobility
&lt;ref&gt;Lecoanet, H. F.; Bottero, J. Y.; Wiesner, M. R. Laboratory assessment of the mobility of nanomaterials in porous media. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2004, 38 (19), 5164-5169.&lt;/ref&gt;45.

==Degradability==
Most nanomaterials are likely to be inert
&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, J. Taming high-tech particles. Science News 2002, 161 (13), 200&lt;/ref&gt;, 
which could be due to the applications of nanomaterials and products, which is often manufactured with the purpose of being durable and hard-wearing. Investigations made so far have however showed that fullerene might be biological degradable whereas carbon nanotubes are consider biologically non-degradable
&lt;ref&gt;Colvin, V. Responsible nanotechnology: Looking beyond the good news. Eurekalert 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;,
&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety Executive Health effects of particles produced for nanotechnologies;EH75/6; Health and Safety Executive: Sudbury, Suffolk, UK, Dec, 04.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
According to the structure of fullerenes, which consists of carbon only, it is possible that microorganisms can use carbon as an energy source, such as it happens for instance with other carbonaceous substances.

Fullerenes have been found to inhibit the growth of commonly occurring soil- and water bacteria
&lt;ref&gt;Fortner, J. D.; Lyon, D. Y.; Sayes, C. M.; Boyd, A. M.; Falkner, J. C.; Hotze, E. M.; Alemany, L. B.; Tao, Y. J.; Guo, W.; Ausman, K. D.; Colvin, V. L.; Hughes, J. B. C-60 in water: Nanocrystal formation and microbial response. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2005, 39 (11), 4307-4316.&lt;/ref&gt;,
&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorster, E. Manufactured nanomaterials (Fullerenes, C-60) induce oxidative stress in the brain of juvenile largemouth bass. Environmental Health Perspectives 2004, 112 (10), 1058-1062.&lt;/ref&gt;
, which indicates that toxicity can hinder degradability. It is, however, possible that biodegradation can be performed by microorganisms other than the tested microorganisms, or that the microorganism adapt after long-term exposure. 
Besides that [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] can be degraded by UV-light and O
&lt;ref&gt;Fortner, J. D.; Lyon, D. Y.; Sayes, C. M.; Boyd, A. M.; Falkner, J. C.; Hotze, E. M.; Alemany, L. B.; Tao, Y. J.; Guo, W.; Ausman, K. D.; Colvin, V. L.; Hughes, J. B. C-60 in water: Nanocrystal formation and microbial response. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2005, 39 (11), 4307-4316.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
UV-radiation of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] dissolved in hexane, lead to a partly or complete split-up of the fullerene structure depending on concentration
&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, R.; Parsons, J. P.; Avent, A. G.; Rannard, S. P.; Dennis, T. J.; Hare, J. P.; Kroto, H. W.; Walton, D. R. M. Degradation of C60 by light. Nature 1991, 351 (6324), 277.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Bioaccumulation==
Carbon based nanoparticles are lipophilic which means that they can react with and penetrate different kinds of cell membranes
&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, S. Q.; Oberdorster, E.; Haasch, M. L. Toxicity of an engineered nanoparticle (fullerene, C-60) in two aquatic species, Daphnia and fathead minnow. Marine Environmental Research 2006, 62, S5-S9.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Nanomaterials with low solubility (such as [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]) could potentially accumulate in biological organisms
&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) Opinion on The appropriateness of existing methodologies to assess the potential risks associated with engineered and adventitious products of nanotechnologies Adopted by the SCENIHR during the 7th plenary meeting of 28-29 September 2005;SCENIHR/002/05; European Commission Health &amp; Consumer Protection Directorate-General: 05.&lt;/ref&gt;
, however to the best of our knowledge no studies have been performed investigating this in the environment. Biokinetic studies with [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] in rats result in very little excretion which indicates an accumulation in the organisms
&lt;ref&gt;Yamago, S.; Tokuyama, H.; Nakamura, E.; Kikuchi, K.; Kananishi, S.; Sueki, K.; Nakahara, H.; Enomoto, S.; Ambe, F. In-Vivo Biological Behavior of A Water-Miscible Fullerene - C-14 Labeling, Absorption, Distribution, Excretion and Acute Toxicity. Chemistry &amp; Biology 1995, 2 (6), 385-389.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Fortner et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorster, G.; Oberdorster, E.; Oberdorster, J. Nanotoxicology: An emerging discipline evolving from studies of ultrafine particles. Environmental Health Perspectives 2005, 113 (7), 823-839.&lt;/ref&gt; 
estimates that it is likely that nanoparticles can move up through the food chain via sediment consuming organisms, which is confirmed by unpublished studies performed at Rice University, U.S.
&lt;ref&gt;Brumfiel, G. A little knowledge. Nature 2003, 424 (6946), 246-248.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Uptake in bacteria, which form the basis for many ecosystems, is also seen as a potential entrance to whole food chains
&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D. Nano Litterbugs? Experts see potential pollution problems. [http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Nanotech/NANO%20LITTERBUGS.htm] 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=Surface chemistry and coatings=
In addition to the physical and chemical composition of the nanoparticles, it is important to consider any coatings or modifications of a given nanoparticles
&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) Opinion on The appropriateness of existing methodologies to assess the potential risks associated with engineered and adventitious products of nanotechnologies Adopted by the SCENIHR during the 7th plenary meeting of 28-29 September 2005;SCENIHR/002/05; European Commission Health &amp; Consumer Protection Directorate-General: 05.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A study by Sayes et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Sayes, C. M.; Fortner, J. D.; Guo, W.; Lyon, D.; Boyd, A. M.; Ausman, K. D.; Tao, Y. J.; Sitharaman, B.; Wilson, L. J.; Hughes, J. B.; West, J. L.; Colvin, V. L. The differential cytotoxicity of water-soluble fullerenes. Nano Letters 2004, 4 (10), 1881-1887.&lt;/ref&gt; 
found that the cytotoxicity of different kinds of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]-derivatives varied by seven orders of magnitude, and that the toxicity decreased with increasing number of hydroxyl- and carbonyl groups attached to the surface. According to Gharbi et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Gharbi, N.; Pressac, M.; Hadchouel, M.; Szwarc, H.; Wilson, S. R.; Moussa, F. [60]Fullerene is a powerful antioxidant in vivo with no acute or subacute toxicity. Nano Lett. 2005, 5 (12), 2578-2585.&lt;/ref&gt;, 
it is in contradiction to previous studies, which is supported by Bottini et al.
&lt;ref&gt;Bottini, M.; Bruckner, S.; Nika, K.; Bottini, N.; Bellucci, S.; Magrini, A.; Bergamaschi, A.; Mustelin, T. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes induce T lymphocyte apoptosis. Toxicology Letters 2006, 160 (2), 121-126.&lt;/ref&gt; 
who found an increased toxicity of oxidized carbon nanotubes in immune cells when compared to pristine carbon nanotubes. 

The chemical composition of the surface of a given nanoparticle influences both the bioavailability and the surface charge of the particle, both of which are important factors for toxicology and ecotoxicology. The negative charge on the surface of [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] is suspected to be able to explain these particles ability to induce oxidative stress in cells
&lt;ref&gt;Sayes, C. M.; Fortner, J. D.; Guo, W.; Lyon, D.; Boyd, A. M.; Ausman, K. D.; Tao, Y. J.; Sitharaman, B.; Wilson, L. J.; Hughes, J. B.; West, J. L.; Colvin, V. L. The differential cytotoxicity of water-soluble fullerenes. Nano Letters 2004, 4 (10), 1881-1887.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The chemical composition also influences properties such as lipophilicity, which is important in relation to uptake through cells membranes in addition to distribution and transport to tissue and organs in the organisms5. Coatings can furthermore be designed so that they are transported to specific organs or cells, which has great importance for toxicity
&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering Nanosciences and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties; The Royal Society: London, 04.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

It is unknown, however, for how long nanoparticles stay coated especially inside the human body and/or in the environment, since the surface can be affected by for instance light if they get into the environment. Experiments with non-toxic coated nanoparticles, turned out to be very cell toxic after 30 min. exposure to UV-light or oxygen in air
&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorster, E. Manufactured nanomaterials (Fullerenes, C-60) induce oxidative stress in the brain of juvenile largemouth bass. Environmental Health Perspectives 2004, 112 (10), 1058-1062.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=Interactions in the Environment=
Nanoparticles can be used to enhance the bioavailability of other chemical substances so that they are easily degradable or harmful substances can be transported to vulnerable ecosystems
&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering Nanosciences and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties; The Royal Society: London, 04.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Besides the toxicity of the nanoparticles itself, it is furthermore unclear whether nanoparticles increases the bioavailability or toxicity of other xenobiotics in the environment or other substances in the human body. Nanoparticles such as [[w:buckyball|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] have many potential uses in for instance in medicine because of their ability to transport drugs to parts of the body which are normally hard to reach. However, this property is exactly what also may be the source to adverse toxic effects
&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering Nanosciences and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties; The Royal Society: London, 04.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Furthermore research is being done into the application of nanoparticles for spreading of contaminants already in the environment. This is being pursued in order to increase the bioavailability for degradation of microorganisms
&lt;ref&gt;Masciangioli, T.; Zhang, W. X. Environmental technologies at the nanoscale. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2003, 37 (5), 102A-108A.&lt;/ref&gt;54, 
however it may also lead to increase uptake and increased toxicity of contaminants in plants and animals, but to the best of our knowledge, no scientific information is available that supports this
&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering Nanosciences and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties; The Royal Society: London, 04.&lt;/ref&gt;,
&lt;ref&gt;Depledge, M.; Owen, R. Nanotechnology and the environment: risks and rewards. Marine Pollution Bulletine 2005, 50, 609-612.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=Conclusion=
It is still too early to determine whether nanomaterials or nanoparticles are harmful or not, however the effects observed lately have made many public and governmental institutions aware of 
#the lack of knowledge concerning the properties of nanoparticles
#the urgent need for a systematic evaluation of the potential adverse effect of Nanotechnology
&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society &amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering Nanosciences and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties; The Royal Society: London, 04.&lt;/ref&gt;,
&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Nanotechnologies: A Preliminary Risk Analysis on the Basis of a Workshop Organized in Brussels on 1-2 March 2004 by the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate General of the European Commission; European Commission Community Health and Consumer Protection: 04.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Furthermore, some guidance is needed as to which precautionary measures are warranted in order to encourage the development of “green nanotechnologies” and other future innovative technologies, while at the same time minimizing the potential for negative surprises in the form of adverse effects on human health and/or the environment. 

It is important to understand that there are many different nanomaterials and that the risk they pose will differ substantially depending on their properties. At the moment it is not possible to identify which properties or combination of properties make some nanomaterials harmful and which make them harmless, and properly it will depend on the nanomaterial is question. This makes it is extremely difficult to do risk assessments and life-cycle assessment of nanomaterials because, in theory, you would have to do a risk assessment for each of the specific variation of nanomaterial – a daunting task!

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In a multi-threaded environment, when more than one thread can access and modify a resource, the outcome could be unpredictable.  For example, let's have a counter variable that is incremented by more than one thread.

Beware! ''Synchronization'' is an ambiguous term. It doesn't consist of making all threads executing the same code section at the same time. It is the opposite. It avoids any two threads to execute a same code section at the same time. It synchronizes the end of a processing with the beginning of a second processing.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 1.1: Counter implementation'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
int counter = 0;
...
counter += 1;
&lt;/source&gt;}}
The above code is built up by the following sub-operations:
* '''Read''' ; read variable &lt;code&gt;counter&lt;/code&gt;
* '''Add''' ; add 1 to the value
* '''Save''' ; save the new value to variable &lt;code&gt;counter&lt;/code&gt;
Let's say that two threads need to execute that code, and if the initial value of the &lt;code&gt;counter&lt;/code&gt; variable is zero, we expect after the operations the value to be 2.

; Critical Section : In the above example the code &lt;code&gt; counter+=1 &lt;/code&gt; must be executed by one and only one thread at any given time. That is called '''critical section'''. During programming, in a multi-threading environment we have to identify all those pieces of code that belongs to a critical section, and make sure that only one thread can execute those codes at any given time. That is called synchronization.

; Synchronizing threads : The thread access to a critical section code must be '''synchronized''' among the threads, that is to make sure that only one thread can execute them at any given time.

; Object monitor : Each object has an ''Object monitor''. Basically it is a ''semaphore'', indicating if a critical section code is being executed by a thread or not. Before a critical section can be executed, the thread must obtain an ''Object monitor''. Only one thread at a time can own '''that''' object's monitor.

; A thread becomes the owner of the object's monitor in one of three ways : 
:* By executing a synchronized instance method of that object. See {{java:synchronized}} keyword.
:* By executing the body of a synchronized statement that synchronizes on the object. See {{java:synchronized}} keyword.
:* For objects of type Class, by executing a synchronized static method of that class.

; The Object Monitor takes care of the synchronization, so why do we need the &quot;wait() and notify() methods&quot;? : For synchronization we don't really need them, however for certain situations it is nice to use them. A nice and considerate thread will use them. It can happen that during executing a critical section, the thread is stuck, cannot continue. It can be because it's waiting for an IO and other resources. In any case, the thread may need to wait a relatively long time. It would be selfish for the thread to hold on to the object monitor and blocking other threads to do their work. So the thread goes to a 'wait' state, by calling the &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; method on the object. It has to be the same object the thread obtained its object monitor from. 
: In the other hand though, a thread should call the &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; method only if there is at least one other thread out there who will call the &lt;code&gt;notify()&lt;/code&gt; method when the resource is available, otherwise the thread will wait for ever, unless a time interval is specified as parameter.

:Let's have an analogy. You go in a shop to buy some items. You line up at the counter, you obtain the attention of the sale-clerk - you get her &quot;object-monitor&quot;. You ask for the item you want. One item needs to be brought in from a warehouse. It'll take more than five minutes, so you release the sales-clerk (give her back her &quot;object-monitor&quot;) so she can serve other customers.  You go into a '''wait''' state.  Let's say there are five other customers already waiting. There is a sale-clerk, who brings in the items from the warehouse. As she does that, she gets the attention of the first sales-clerk, getting her object-monitor and '''notifies''' one or all waiting customer(s), so the waited customer(s) '''woke''' up and line up again to get the attention of the first sales-clerk.

: Note the synchronization between the waiting customer and the sale-clerk who brings in the items.  This is kind of producer-consumer synchronization.
: Also note that there is only one object-monitor, belonging to the first sales-clerk. That object-monitor/the attention of clerk needs to be obtained first before a '''wait''' and a '''notify''' can happen.


; &lt;code&gt;{{java:final}} void wait()&lt;/code&gt; method : The current thread must own this object's monitor. The thread releases ownership of this monitor and waits until another thread notifies threads waiting on this object's monitor to wake up either through a call to the notify method or the &lt;code&gt;notifyAll&lt;/code&gt; method. The thread then waits until it can re-obtain ownership of the monitor and resume execution.

; &lt;code&gt;{{java:final}} void wait(long time)&lt;/code&gt; : The same as wait, but the thread wakes after the specified time passes, regardless of whether there was a notify or not.

; &lt;code&gt;{{java:final}} void notify()&lt;/code&gt; : This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor. Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor. If any threads are waiting on this object, one of them is chosen to be awakened. The choice is arbitrary and occurs at the discretion of the implementation. A thread waits on an object's monitor by calling one of the wait methods. 
: The awakened thread will not be able to proceed until the current thread relinquishes the lock on this object. The awakened thread will compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might be actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example, the awakened thread enjoys no reliable privilege or disadvantage in being the next thread to lock this object. 

; &lt;code&gt;{{java:final}} void notifyAll()&lt;/code&gt; : Same as &lt;code&gt;notify()&lt;/code&gt;, but it wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor.


; What are the differences between the sleep() and wait() methods? :

:; &lt;code&gt; Thread.sleep(millis) &lt;/code&gt; : This is a static method of the Thread class. Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease execution) for the specified number of milliseconds. The thread does not lose ownership of any monitors. It means that if the thread has an object-monitor, all other threads that need that monitor are blocked. This method can be called regardless whether the thread has any monitor or not.

:; &lt;code&gt; wait() &lt;/code&gt; : This method is inherited from the {{java:Object}} class.  The thread must obtain the object-monitor of that object first before calling the wait() method.  The object monitor is returned by the wait() method, so it does not block other threads wanting this object-monitor, while waiting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Characteristics of Action Potentials==


There are a few components to the action potential. On a graph, plotting membrane potential vs. time, the slope become steep and the potential goes over 0 mV in the overshoot phase. After it comes back down, the potential undershoots, and the resting potential returns.

===Experimental Generation===

Action potentials are generated at the axon hillock. Their frequency can vary but usually not the amplitude. If a recording electrode is placed close to the cell, it allows recording the action potentials across the membrane. Charge may be injected via the electrode, which causes a depolarization that, when the membrane potential reaches the threshold, causes a spike. In regular firing neurons, the cell continues to generate action potentials as long as the membrane potential stays above threshold. Also, if the depolarization is increased to a more positive potential, these cells fire at a faster rate. Other neurons cease firing action potentials during prolonged depolarization, and are therefore termed &quot;bursters&quot;. Their firing mode is a very simple form of adaptation.

===Action Potential Current=== 

A current clamp can be used to monitor current. The injection electrode will trigger an action potential by injecting a suprathreshold voltage, but the potential across the membrane is held steady. The negative deflection represents the influx of a positive charge and the positive deflection represents the efflux of positive charge. Huxley used TTX(terodotoxin) to block voltage gated Na channels. They found that that blocked the inward component of the action potential. Using TEA(tetraethylammonium, an antagonist for K channels) they suppressed the outward component of the action potential, and they could look at the current vs. time graph of an action potential and extrapolate the current v. time graphs for K and Na individually. When suprathreshold potential is applied, Na channels open and then close even though membrane is depolarized. K v-channels do not close as long as depolarization is sustained. Na v-channel current is a 'non-inactivating'/'trangent' current and the K v-channel current a 'sustained' and 'inactivating' current. 
	
===Positive Na+/Negative K+ Feedback===

If both Na and K channels are open, there is flow in both directions but the permeability is different. During the depolarization, Na rapidly depolarizes the membrane and then stops. It would gradually leak back to equilibrium. K flow repolarizes the membrane but is slower to flow. When enough Na channels let in enough Na that the efflux of K can't balance the depolarization, the depolarization continues and action potential occurs. Subthreshold, K channels open to increase the K+ current. At threshold depolarization, the negative feedback cycle doesn't stop, but is simply overwhelmed. If there were no Na flooding in, K wouldn't move across the membrane very quickly.

==Measurement Techniques==

===Current Clamp Technique===

A capillary pipet can be fired on the end to melt the tip to a micrometer size opening to give a useful capillary and then filled with a salt solution. The pipet tip is put toward a membrane, and using negative pressure, it can pull in a area of the membrane. An impermeable seal is created, prevented ions from entering or leaving. Enables the measurement of the current of a single channel. Graphed, the current is a square shape. Positive or negative current indicates direct of current flow and can identify which ion is flowing. Depending on the type of channel, one can use voltage or neurotransmitter to control the opening and closing of a particular channel. Channels are either open or closed. The more the channel is open, the longer charge flows across the membrane. 

===Voltage Clamp Technique===

The rapid, large change in potential is the result of the activities of ion channels. The purpose of the voltage clamp technique allows the recording of membrane current (as opposed to potential. Uses two electrodes: one to inject voltage and one to monitor membrane potential. Connecting these two electrodes is a error-correcting amplifier. This amplifier injects a set voltage into the cell and uses the monitor electrode to detect changes and compensate at the injection electrode. The purpose to electrically force the membrane to stay at one potential and then monitor the feedback to see what currents pass through the membrane. 

==Mechanisms of Action Potentials==

===Voltage-Gated Channels===

They have a voltage sensor in their protein structure. They contain charged amino acids that react to a change in membrane voltage. When there is a more positive charge on the membrane, positively amino acids within the protein are repelled creating a force internal to the protein that will cause a change in conformation. When membrane is at -10mV, the channel is open 10-15% of the time. When at -10mV 80%, at 20mV 95%. 

===Whole-Cell Currents===

A sum of all the single-channel currents. If recording a single Na channel, depolarization increases the occurrence of an open channel. Add two more channels to the sum, and the larger possible total current increases. As the number goes up, the curve represents the whole cell current curve of the Na portion of the total curve. Three graphs showing the current of K, the current of Na and the total current during one action potential; the graph lines up action potential curve with graph of current of Na and K channels independently so one can see which portion of the action potential is caused by a particular ion channel. After AP leak channels return resting potential. When the peak depolarization is reached, the Na channels have closed and the K channels have opened, quickly falling from the peak. Influx of Na causes rising part of action potential and the efflux of K brings the membrane potential back down

===K and Na Channel Differences===

Na Channel Has a quick onset and quickly turns off: inactivating channel. K is the opposite with slow onset and slow turn off: noninactivating channel. This difference is caused by differences in the two proteins. The Na channel has two gates: the activation gate and the inactivation gate. The activation gate is sensitive to the potential. When the activation gate is closed the inactivation gate is closed. When the inside of the cell is depolarized, the activation gate quickly opens. The inactivation gate, composed of negative proteins, slowly is repelled by the positive change in the intracellular environment, so it closes the channel by find its way into the pore of the channel. 

K Channel. Has a single gate activated by the membrane potential, so it will stay open all the time the membrane has a certain potential.
Na and K Conductances Na's conductance is characterized by a rapid onset and a rapid offset. K's conductance is characterized by a slow onset and a slow offset. Membrane potential line up temporally with a graph of conductance of K and Na on different lines. The upward rise of the AP is corresponds to the Na conductance change and the downward fall of the AP corresponds to the K conductance. K's slow offset creates an undershoot. This sets up a refractory period during which another AP cannot be generated because an action potential during the undershoot requires a much greater Na influx than during resting potential. Also, if the ball on the Na channel hasn't been released, the Na channel cannot conduct current creating a absolute refractory period during which no action potential can be generated, regardless of membrane potential. After the protein complex blocking the Na channel has been released is the relative refractory period where is more difficult. 

===Other types of Voltage-Gated Channels===
Ca ion can keep the peak for a relatively long time before K brings the potential back. Ca can activate Ca-activated Na channels that help generate action potential waveforms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Mountain lion kittens.jpg|thumb|left|Mountain lion siblings]] Cats can have anywhere from one to eight cubs or kittens in a litter, but most of them only have about two or three. Some of the smaller cats may have more, from four to seven. Cub is usually what you call young big cats, and kitten what you call young small cats. Cubs or kittens born in the same litter are called siblings.

Because most cats live in tropical locations, it doesn’t matter what time of the year they have their young, because food will usually be plentiful. However, for cats that live in places that get cold in the winter, they will usually have their young in the spring.

[[Image:A little cheetah lieying on his mom A.jpg|thumb|right|A little cheetah lying on its mother.]] The father almost never has any part in raising the young. Male lions take the job of protecting the pride instead of taking care of the young, but most fathers will leave completely. This may sound selfish, but it is not. In the animal world, the sole responsibility for finding food and for the young rests upon the female. As carnivores, most would be too noisy hunting in pairs, so they would have less of a chance to catch their prey. 

When the young are born, they are blind and keep their eyes closed. They will open their eyes in about 10 days to 14 days after birth. Most young also have different markings from their parents when they are born. Lion and puma cubs have spots or splotches that disappear as they get older. Clouded leopard cubs have dark spots that eventually change into the shape of the adult spots. Cheetahs are one kind of cat in which the cubs have the same spots as the adults.

It can be very dangerous for the young of many big cats. Many cheetah cubs are killed by a lack of food or their natural enemies (lions and hyenas). Lion cubs may be killed if a new male lion takes over a pride.

The young are not able to eat meat right away; they usually must drink their mother’s milk anywhere from one to two months for the smaller cats and up to seven months in bigger cats. When they reach an age of about two to three months, the mother can start taking the young out and teaching them how to hunt. 

[[Image:Two lynxes playing.jpg|thumb|right|Two lynx kittens playing]] At a few months of age, cubs and kittens become very playful. They chase one another and pounce on anything that moves. This play teaches them basic hunting techniques, which helps them to become successful hunters as adults.

Most cats will leave their mother after one or two years. Smaller types of cats may leave earlier, as soon as four or five months in the case of the wild cat. Sometimes the mother will chase her cubs or kittens away so that they can become independent. Often, the siblings will usually stay together for a few more months or years and work together before completely splitting up. Rogue lions and male cheetahs are especially known for staying together after leaving the mothers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Every day everyone makes a myriad of decisions, choosing between two or ten or even hundreds of different possibilities. Action tends to be the best indicator of preference, of what people actually want, but in doing so people deny themselves all other options. This is the essence of scarcity: everyone can't have everything all at once.

With every expressed preference there exists a next-best option: something you would have done if the first option wasn't available. This is called the '''opportunity cost'''. Because you do one thing, you've lost the opportunity to do something else. Opportunity costs can be thought of as a sort of regret, pain people bear as they imagine what they could be enjoying even if they are enjoying what they are doing right now more. Another way to think about opportunity costs is money value; profit you would have made if you did something else, such as a business venture.

==Understanding Opportunity Cost and Benefit==
Opportunity Cost can be understood by looking at the first four of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Gregory_Mankiw Mankiw's] Principles of Economics

* People face tradeoffs.
* The cost of something is what you give up to get it.
* Rational people think at the margin.
* People respond to incentives.

To exemplify these four principles we will use the following example:&lt;br&gt;
It is a Friday night and you have the following options of things to do, in order of how much you want to do them (most enthusiasm to least enthusiasm):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
1.)See a movie with a partner.&lt;br&gt;
2.)See a movie with your buddies.&lt;br&gt;
3.)Buy new jumper cables.&lt;br&gt;
4.)Play chess against yourself.&lt;br&gt;
5.)Study.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

By putting the partner first, you have already faced the &lt;b&gt;tradeoff&lt;/b&gt; of friends vs more-than-friends. How was this tradeoff made? By weighing &lt;b&gt;costs and benefits&lt;/b&gt;. Your &lt;b&gt;benefit&lt;/b&gt; in this &lt;b&gt;tradeoff&lt;/b&gt; is that you may be entering into a romantic relationship, rather than simply keeping the platonic ones you already have. But what about the costs?

Each of the above options has the &lt;b&gt;cost&lt;/b&gt; of time. You only have one Friday night until next week, so, for now, you only have time to do one thing. Both of your top two options have the added cost of spending money at the cinema. However, &lt;b&gt; the benefits of these options &lt;/b&gt;(namely being social and having fun with others)&lt;b&gt; outweigh the costs&lt;/b&gt;  so you have placed them above the others.

As stated before, for each of your top two options your &lt;b&gt;opportunity costs&lt;/b&gt; include Time and Money. How do we know this? Because &lt;b&gt;The Cost of Something is What You Give Up to Get It.&lt;/b&gt; Another way to remember this is with the adage &quot;There Is No Such Thing As A Free Lunch,&quot; which means that there is some built-in cost for everything so nothing is truly free of charge. For each of the above options, you are spending your time and your money which could have been used on a multitude of different things. If you choose option one, you miss out on the next best option. That is, by choosing option one, you are giving up the opportunity of option two and it is therefore an &lt;b&gt;opportunity cost&lt;/b&gt;. If you choose any option, you are giving up the other options to &quot;get&quot; your option.

The next thing to think about before making your final decision on what to do this fateful Friday would be does the opportunity benefit of option one outweigh the opportunity cost of option two? This is called &lt;b&gt;thinking at the margin&lt;/b&gt; and is how rational decisions are made. In this example, if you choose option one, your friends might look down on you and say that you abandoned them to see your partner. Inversely, if you choose option two, you risk losing your partner to have fun with your buddies. For argument's sake, we will assume that although your friend's will hassle you for ditching them, they wont leave you and if you abandon you partner instead, he/she will leave you or be very angry with you. Therefore, seeing your buddies has a much greater opportunity cost than seeing your acquaintance does, so seeing your partner would be the rational decision - the decision made at the margin.

However, what if we throw in a twist to this example? What if option two has an &lt;b&gt;incentive&lt;/b&gt; that makes option two a more rational decision than option one? This incentive could be that your friends want your partner to come with you if you decide to go with them? And they'll pay for your movie tickets? And give you a new car? These are incentives, and &lt;b&gt;people respond to incentives&lt;/b&gt;. 

=== Production possibility curve ===
Opportunity cost is the substance of production possibility curves , the opportunity cost of choices in current resource deployment on current production and future production capability.

The production possibility curve is a quarter curve 12pm-3pm , on a graph of two competing possibilities of production, with each product's quantity being the X and Y axes respectively. 

Anything within the region left and under the curve, is the production possibilities , and represents what can be produced given the available resources. 

Production is fully '''efficient''' on points lying on the curve, as resources are fully allocated, including employment. 

If X is the horizontal axis quantity, then the right most lowest point of the curve, shows maximum production of X, and no production of Y. Conversely, the left most, highest point, shows maximum production of Y, and no production of X. 

The curve can grow outward, if relevant technology increases, or resources increase, the former representing increased maximum efficiency achievable. 

An illustrative example might be X is the production of cars, and Y is the production of mobile consumer items. Assuming that enlarging the production possibility curve is good, what is the optimal current production of X and Y, that will increase the production possibility curve of X and Y in the future ? 

Another way of framing the example, X is the production of cars and mobile electronic consumer items, Y is education, completed research papers, public-owned solar panel production companies , and public, independent labor legislation ( to increase productivity by reducing health-damaging effects of work commitments) .

==Bone==

Bone is the tissue that makes us vertebrates. The stiffness and rigidity of our body is due to the presence of bone. Bone provides our body structural form and gives us the shape that we so often refer to as the human body. It is the internal scaffolding on which the rest of the body is built. Due to its ability to absorb force, bony structures also protect vital organs in the body. Bone is the unit that makes up the skeleton in vertebrates. Several bones join together in specialised areas, termed joints, to form the skeleton. Alongwith the muscle tissue, tendons and ligaments  bones are able to move on one another at the joints and produce movement of various parts of the body. This also permits the movement of the human body from one location to another - locomotion.&lt;/br&gt; 

Bones are a storehouse for two important minerals in our body - calcium and phosphorus.  Matabolic activity in the bones is intimately related to the balance of these two minerals. Any alteration in the levels of calcium or phosphorus, as they do occur in many disease processes,  is reflected  on the human skeleton. Bones are also the site for production of red blood cells, haematopoiesis.&lt;/br&gt;

In this chapter we try to understand important biological processes involving the bones. Understanding the basic anatomical tissue will provide us a sound ground for comprehending the pathological states they may be invovled in.&lt;/br&gt;

'''''Digitaria''''' is a genus of about 300 species of grass (family [[../Poaceae/]]) native to tropical and warm temperate regions. Common names include '''crabgrass''', '''finger-grass''', and '''fonio'''. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. ''Digitus'' is the Latin word for &quot;finger&quot;, and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce.

==Description==
All crabgrasses have similar growth habits and flowering structures, but species are separated by minor differences in the flower structures and leaf pubescence. They typically have spreading stems with wide flat leaf blades that lay on the ground with the tips ascending. The inflorescence is a panicle in which the spike-like branches are arranged in digitate fashion. The spikelets are arranged in two rows on an angled or winged rachis. Each spikelet has two florets, only one of which is fertile. The first bracts at the base of the spikelets are either very minute or absent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.umn.edu/herbarium/Grasses/grass%20text/digitaria%201.htm Museum of Natural History, University of Minnesota] by A.F. Cholewa and J.F. Bell&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Ecology==
Crabgrass seed has a long germination period; if conditions are right, it can germinate throughout the growing season. Crabgrasses occur in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions of both hemispheres.

The most prevalent species of ''Digitaria'' in North America are Large Crabgrass (''D. sanguinalis'') and Smooth Crabgrass (''D. ischaemum''), which often become problem weeds in lawn and gardens. They are annual plants, and one plant is capable of producing 150,000 seeds per season. The seeds germinate in the late spring and early summer and outcompete the domesticated lawn grasses and expand outward in a circle up to 12 inches in diameter. In the fall when the plants die they leave large voids in the lawn. The voids then become prime areas for the crabgrass seeds to germinate the following season. Crabgrasses also have a different texture and color that often interrupts the uniformity of a lawn. In vegetable gardens, crabgrass can quickly out-compete desirable plants, causing yield reductions.

==Uses==
Despite their weediness, crabgrasses do have a few redeeming qualities. The seeds, most notably those of fonio, can be toasted and ground into a flour, which can be used to make porridge or fermented to make beer. Fonio has been widely used as a staple crop in parts of Africa. It also has decent nutrient qualities as a forage for cattle.

==Control==

| Pre-emergents (synthetic) = Crabgrasses as controlled with pre-emergent herbicides that interfere with a key enzyme, that is only active when a seed germinates. These herbicides must be applied at a critical time. If they are applied to the soil too early, they get washed too deep into the soil by rainwater. If they are applied too late the key enzyme inhibited is no longer active. The rule of thumb is to apply when the local forsythia blooms are wilting.

A '''flame weeder''' is a propane torch used for weed control, primarily in organic gardens and farms. They come in various sizes for different sorts of applications, from hand-held models to backpack versions to tractor-towed agricultural types. 

Flame weeding has both advantages and disadvantages over other methods. 

*Pops seeds
*Safe in lawns: lawn grasses are adapted to fire

As a teacher I would use Wikibooks to excite my students. I know that I would use it in any of my high school English classes;however, middle school is another thing. I want to make sure that my students are mature enough to handle the work that will go into making a book together. I'm observing in a 7th grade English class right now and I don't know if they would want to do it. They groan about having to read novels that are no more than 180 pages so I can all image what that will say about having to post their work somewhere else. 

Now in my high school classes I'll require for the students to analyze a short story or poem and write a paper. After grading the papers I'll give them a chance to correct them and fix them up before requiring them to post in Wikibooks. That way anyone else who maybe writing a paper or researching on a specific poem or short story can use the information they have written to support something that they want to put into their own paper.

I enjoyed the list of interesting documents on [[User:Vuara]].

Did you know that many of those documents are available on Wikisource?

For example,

[[User:Vuara/HOW THE ALPHABET WAS MADE|HOW THE ALPHABET WAS MADE]] is a copy of [[wikisource:How_the_First_Letter_Was_Written]] [[wikisource:How_the_Alphabet_Was_Made]].

&lt;big&gt;'''Ocular Melanoma'''&lt;/big&gt;


*''Subpage: [[Radiation_Oncology/Eye/Ocular_melanoma/Randomized|Randomized evidence]]''


==Epidemiology== 
*US incidence 1,350 cases/year  (0.7 per 100,000)
*Most common primary intraocular malignancy (75%) [#2  retinoblastoma (13%)]
*Median age is 55 yr 
*More common in caucasians (8 to 1 caucasian to AA; 3 to 1 caucasian to asian)
*Arise from uveal melanocytes which originate from neural crest cells 


==Risk Factors==
*Intensive UV light exposure - RR  4.0-7.0 
*Increasing age 
*Ocular and oculodermal melanocytosis (ie. nevus of Ota) - malignant transformation in 4.6%
*Pigmented iris nevus
*Familial - rarely occurs in dysplastic nevus syndrome
*Family history of cutaneous or ocular melanoma
*Light iris color
*Light skin pigmentation &amp; tendency to sunburn - RR  2.0


==Clinical Presentation==
[[Image:Conjunctival_Melanoma.jpg|thumb|right]]
*Approximately 1/3 patients asymptomatic, as incidental finding
*Visual symptoms are variable, depending on location
*Diagnosis is typically not based on histopathology due to high risk of obtaining tissue and the risk of tumor dissemination, combined with high diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound
**Clinical diagnostic accuracy rate in oncology centers is ~99%
*Unpredictable clinical course, with late (46 years) fulminant failures possible
*Metastatic spread on presentation is rare (~1%) and is typically to liver (60-90%), subcutaneous nodules, lung
**Work-up should include chest x-ray and liver LFTs and CT scan

==Anatomy==
[[Image:Schematic_diagram_of_the_human_eye_en.svg|thumb|right]]
*Melanomas develop in the uveal tract: 
**Vascular support layer located between the sclera and the retina
**Divided into iris, ciliary body, pars plana and choroid
*Melanoma location:
**80% choroid
**10-15% ciliary body
**&lt;10% iris
*Size:
**Precise size should be obtained by ultrasound
**Size can be estimated in average optic disc diamters (1 dd = 1.5 mm)
**Height can be estimated in diopters (3 diopters = 1mm)
*Can bulge into the retina, giving rise to pathognomonic &quot;collar button&quot; deformity

==Pathology==
*''Spindle Cell'' (30%):  
**Type A - Best prognosis, 5-yr OS rate = 95%
**Type B - Intermediate prognosis, 5-yr OS rate = 85%
*''Mixed Cell'' (65%):  
**Contains spindle and epithelioid cells, 5-yr OS rate = 83%
*''Epithelioid Cell'' (5%):	
**Worse prognosis, 5-yr OS rate = 60%


==Treatment Overview==
*Survival after development of metastatic disease is poor (median 7 months), so main goal of treatment is cure while disease is confined to the eye 
*Historically, enucleation was the standard of care; however, as many as 20% cases were clinically misdiagnosed 
*Review of data published in 1978 suggested that enucleation may increase risk of metastasis, and subsequent death. Subsequent analyses challenged this observation, but search for alternative treatments was on
*Retrospective studies in 1980's suggested similar outcomes between radiation therapy (protons or cobalt plaque) and enucleation
*A randomized trial comparing Helium ions and I-125 plaque brachytherapy showed that 70 Gy delivered at the I-125 dose rate is insufficient for control
*The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) is a set of clinical trials that was carried out in 1980's - 1990's to evaluate the role of radiation therapy in management of ocular melanoma:
**Small tumors (height 1 - 3 mm, diameter &gt;5 mm) were prospectively observed
**Medium tumors (height 2.5 - 10.0mm and diameter &lt;=16 mm) were randomized to I-125 plaque brachytherapy (85 Gy) compared with enucleation
**Large tumors (height &gt;=10 mm or diameter &gt;=16 mm) were randomized to pre-enucleation EBRT 20/5 vs. enucleation only
*The COMS &quot;Small&quot; study showed that with prospective follow-up, overall survival is comparable to general population
*The COMS &quot;Medium&quot; randomized trial showed that the overall survival and risk of death from metastatic disease were comparable between enucleation and plaque brachytherapy, establishing plaque brachytherapy as a reasonable primary treatment
*The COMS &quot;Large&quot; randomized trial revealed that pre-enucleation RT does not provide any additional benefit.
*While there have been efforts at non-enucleation treatment approaches for large lesions, none have sufficiently long follow up. Also, the benefit of greater useful vision preservation appears unlikely
*to be continued ...

==Natural History==
*'''COMS Declined Treatment; 2003''' PMID 12834669 -- &quot;Mortality after deferral of treatment or no treatment for choroidal melanoma.&quot; (Straatsma BR, Am J Ophthalmol. 2003 Jul;136(1):47-54.)
**Prospective. Patients eligible for COMS who deferred treatment. 77 patients deferred, 45 enrolled in this study, 42 medium melanoma. Median F/U 5.3 years
**Outcome: 52% had subsequent melanoma treatment. 5-year medium melanoma OS 70% compared with enrolled COMS patients 82% (NS). Risk of death 1.54X (0.93-2.56). Metastatic disease in 42% deaths
**Conclusion: Greater mortality and higher risk of death if initially observed, trending toward significant

*'''COMS Small Tumors''' (1986-1989) 
**Prospective. 204 patients, small choroidal melanoms (height 1.0 - 3.0 mm, diameter &gt;= 5.0 mm) not eligible for COMS. Treatment: 8% treated at enrollment, further 33% treated during follow-up. Median F/U 7.7 years
**'''Outcome; 1997''' PMID 9230829 -- &quot;Mortality in patients with small choroidal melanoma. COMS report no. 4. The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study Group.&quot; ([No authors listed], Arch Ophthalmol. 1997 Jul;115(7):886-93.)
***Outcome: 5-year OS 94% (compared with expected general population mortality of 12%; however, patients with serious diseases excluded from COMS), 8-year OS 85%; 22% deaths due to metastatic melanoma and 67% occurred &gt;5 years
***Conclusion: Low risk of dying from small melanoma
**'''Predictors; 1997''' PMID 9400787 -- &quot;Factors predictive of growth and treatment of small choroidal melanoma: COMS Report No. 5. The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study Group.&quot; ([No authors listed], Arch Ophthalmol. 1997 Dec;115(12):1537-44.)
***Outcome: growth to be eligible for entry to COMS 2-years 21%, 5-years 31%
***Negative factors: height and diameter, orange pigment, absence of [[w:Drusen|drusen]], absence of retinal pigment adjacent to tumor
***Conclusion: ~30% will grow by 5 years

==Surgery==
*Historically the only treatment modality
*Review of data published in 1978 suggested that enucleation may increase risk of metastasis, and subsequent death. Subsequent analyses challenged this observation, but search for alternative treatments was on. Randomized data from COMS Medium show no difference in rate of mets between enucleation and brachytherapy (12-years 17% vs. 21%)
*Treatment approaches:
**Eyewall (trans-scleral or lamellar) tumor resection - May be used in highly selected patients, typically together with adjuvant RT
**Enucleation - Historically gold standard. Indications today include patient request, failure of alternative therapy, tumor &gt;40% intraocular volume, tumor in a blind or painful eye, marked neovascularization. Should not be offered with metastatic disease, unless the eye is painful
**Exenteration - Indication if diffuse extraocular extension, without metastases


*'''Meta-Analysis; 1992''' (1966-1988) PMID 1531290 -- &quot;A review of mortality from choroidal melanoma. II. A meta-analysis of 5-year mortality rates following enucleation, 1966 through 1988.&quot; (Diener-West M, Arch Ophthalmol. 1992 Feb;110(2):245-50.)
**Pooled analysis. 8 studies that reported 5-year mortality by size
**5-year survival after enucleation: 
***Small tumors: 84%
***Medium tumors: 68%
***Large tumors: 47%

*'''Review; 1978''' PMID 352389 -- &quot;Does enucleation of the eye containing a malignant melanoma prevent or accelerate the dissemination of tumour cells.&quot; (Zimmerman LE, Br J Ophthalmol. 1978 Jun;62(6):420-5.)
**Review of survival data suggesting that 1) mortality prior to enucleation is ~1% per year, 2) mortality rises abruptly after enucleation to ~8% during second year, 3) ~2/3 of deaths can be attributed to dissemination of tumor emboli at the time of surgery

==Enucleation vs. RT==
'''Randomized'''
*'''COMS Medium''' (1987-1998)
**Randomized. 1317 patients. Choroidal melanoma, height 2.5 - 10.0 mm, size &lt;=16.0 mm. Ineligible if contiguous with optic disc. Arm 1) Enucleation vs. Arm 2) I-125 brachytherapy
**''Brachytherapy'': episcleral plaque, 2-3 mm margin beyond base of tumor (i.e. 4-6 mm larger than maximum basal diameter). If near optic nerve, allowed notches. Dosimetry based on TG43. If tumor height 2.5-4.9 mm, prescription 5 mm from interior surface of sclera; if tumor height &gt;=5 mm, prescription to apex. Dose 85 Gy (dose rate 0.42-1.05 Gy). Organs at risk sclera (1mm from surface of plaque), optic nerve (center of optic disc), macula (foveola), opposite retina (22 mm from scleral surface along diameter of globe)
**'''5-years; 2001''' PMID 11448319 -- &quot;The COMS randomized trial of iodine 125 brachytherapy for choroidal melanoma, III: initial mortality findings. COMS Report No. 18.&quot; (Diener-West M, Arch Ophthalmol. 2001 Jul;119(7):969-82.). Minimum F/U 2 years, 81% F/U 5+ years, 32% F/U 10+ years
***Outcome: 5-year OS enucleation 81% vs. I-125 82% (NS); Risk of death from metastatic disease 11% vs. 9% (NS)
***Predictors: age, height, diameter, distance to optic disc, smoking
***Toxicity: I-125 5-year visual acuity &lt;20/200 63%, &lt;5/200 45%, enucleation 12%
***Conclusion: No difference in mortality between enucleation and I-125 brachytherapy
**'''Second cancers; 2005''' PMID 15883277 -- &quot;Second primary cancers after enrollment in the COMS trials for treatment of choroidal melanoma: COMS Report No. 25.&quot; (Diener-West M, Arch Ophthalmol. 2005 May;123(5):601-4.)
***Subset analysis. 2320 patients, routinely followed on protocol
***Outcome: 8% developed second primary (prostate 23%, breast 17%); 51% died (33% with metastatic melanoma)
***RT: No increased risk
***Conclusion: Routine medical surveillance is important
**'''QOL; 2006''' PMID 16476893 -- &quot;Quality of life after iodine 125 brachytherapy vs enucleation for choroidal melanoma: 5-year results from the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study: COMS QOLS Report No. 3.&quot; (Melia M, Arch Ophthalmol. 2006 Feb;124(2):226-38.)
***Subset analysis. 209 patients; telephone interview
***Outcome: both groups significantly worse difficulty with vision-oriented activities and bodily/ocular pain. Small differences between arms; brachytherapy better for driving and peripheral vision at 2 years, no difference by 3-5 years after treatment
***Side effect: Brachytherapy worse for anxiety scores
***Conclusion: Brachytherapy better visual function during first 2 years, then no difference, but worse anxiety
**'''12-years; 2006''' PMID 17159027 -- &quot;The COMS randomized trial of iodine 125 brachytherapy for choroidal melanoma: V. Twelve-year mortality rates and prognostic factors: COMS report No. 28.&quot; (COMS, Arch Ophthalmol. 2006 Dec;124(12):1684-93.). Minimum F/U 5 years, 39% F/U 12+ years
***Outcome: 12-year OS enucleation 59% vs. I-125 57% (NS); Risk of death from metastatic disease 17% vs. 21%
***Predictors: age, diameter
***Conclusion: No survival difference between enucleation and I-125 brachytherapy


'''Retrospective'''
*'''MGH; 1990''' (1965-1984) PMID 2374681 -- &quot;Relative survival rates after alternative therapies for uveal melanoma.&quot; (Seddon JM, Ophthalmology. 1990 Jun;97(6):769-77.)
**Retrospective. 1051 patients with uveal melanoma: 556 treated with proton beam (median F/U 5.3 years), compared with 238 patients treated with enucleation (median F/U 8.8 years, same time period), compared with 257 patient enucleated previously (median F/U 17.0 years)
**Outcome: RR for all-cause mortality earlier decade surgery 1.6, current decade surgery 1.2 compared with proton beam; SS at 2 years, no difference after 6 years
**Conclusion: No difference in survival between enucleation and proton beam

*'''Manhattan Eye &amp; Ear; 1988''' PMID 3415941 -- &quot;Cobalt plaque versus enucleation for uveal melanoma: comparison of survival rates.&quot; (Adams KS, Br J Ophthalmol. 1988 Jul;72(7):494-7.)
**Retrospective. 639 patients with uveal melanoma; 223 treated with cobalt plaque (median F/U 4.3 years), compared with 416 patients treated with enucleation
**Outcome: No difference in survival
**Predictors: location of tumor, largest tumor dimension
**Conclusion: No difference in survival between enucleation and cobalt plaque


==Enucleation +/- neoadjuvant RT==
*'''COMS Large''' (1986-1994)
**Randomized. 1003 patients. Choroidal melanoma, height &gt;2 mm and diameter &gt;=16 mm, or height &gt;=10 mm regardless of diameter, or height &gt;=8 mm and close (&lt;2mm) to optic disc. Ineligible if &gt;=2 mm extrascleral extension. Arm 1) enucleation alone vs. Arm 2) EBRT 20/5 followed by enucleation on last day of treatment. Target choroidal melanoma, posterior half of globe, 1cm margin
**'''5-years; 1998''' PMID 9645716 -- &quot;The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) randomized trial of pre-enucleation radiation of large choroidal melanoma II: initial mortality findings. COMS report no. 10.) ([No authors listed], Am J Ophthalmol. 1998 Jun;125(6):779-96.)
***5-year outcome: OS enucleation alone 57% vs. RT + enucleation 62% (NS); death from melanoma 28% vs. 26% (NS)
***Prognostic factors: age and diameter
***Conclusion: No survival benefit to neoadjuvant RT using 20/5
**'''Complications; 1998''' PMID 9744369 -- &quot;The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) randomized trial of pre-enucleation radiation of large choroidal melanoma III: local complications and observations following enucleation COMS report no. 11.&quot; ([No authors listed], Am J Ophthalmol. 1998 Sep;126(3):362-72.)
***Complications: Acute complications more with RT (8% vs. 4%), but all minor. 5-year complications: poor prosthetic mobility control 16% vs. RT 19%
***Conclusion: Complications infrequent, minor, and comparable
**'''10-years; 2004''' PMID 15629284 -- &quot;The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) randomized trial of pre-enucleation radiation of large choroidal melanoma: IV. Ten-year mortality findings and prognostic factors. COMS report number 24.&quot; (Hawkins BS, Am J Ophthalmol. 2004 Dec;138(6):936-51.). Minimum F/U 5 years
***10-year outcome: OS 39% both arms (NS); death with melanoma mets RT+surgery 45% vs. surgery alone 40%
***Predictors of death: age &gt;60, diameter &gt;=18 mm. If both, 10-year OS 20%; if neither, OS 58%
***Conclusion: No survival advantage to pre-enucleation RT

==Transscleral tumor resection (TTR) vs. brachytherapy==
'''Retrospective'''
*'''Germany; 2002''' PMID 12359606 -- &quot;Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy versus transscleral tumor resection in the treatment of large uveal melanomas.&quot; (Bechrakis NE, Ophthalmology. 2002 Oct;109(10):1855-61.)
**Retrospective. 152 patients with large uveal melanoma. Treated with transsclear tumor resection or I-125 brachytherapy. Mean height 9.4 mm, mean diameter 14.5 mm, mean distance to optic disc 9.9 mm. Mean F/U 2.3 years
**Outcome: Visual acuity &gt;20/200 TTR 61% vs. I-125 brachytherapy 6% (SS). No difference in eye retention or mortality
**Toxicity: Secondary glaucoma 6% vs. 33% (SS)
**Conclusion: TTR better visual function and less glaucoma than I-125 brachytherapy


==Plaque brachytherapy==
*'''ABS recommendations; 2003''' - PMID 12738332 &amp;mdash; &quot;The American Brachytherapy Society recommendations for brachytherapy of uveal melanomas.&quot; Nag S et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2003 Jun 1;56(2):544-55.
**Patient selection: ''Small melanoma'' (&lt;2.5 mm height, &lt;10 mm diameter): observe for growth. ''Medium melanoma'' (2.5 - 10 mm height, &lt;16 mm diameter): episcleral plaque, tissue sample not required. ''Large melanoma'' (&gt;10 mm height or &gt;16 mm diameter): some patients may be plaque candidates. ''Not suitable for brachytherapy'': gross extrascleral extension, ring melanoma, &gt;50% ciliary body involvement
**Dose: minimum I-125 dose 85 Gy to apex, dose rate 0.6-1.05 Gy/h using TG-43 (assumes point source approximation, no anisotropy corrections, no side attenuation or backscatter from shield, and Silastic insert)
**Guidelines specified for patient selection, dose, isotope selection, prescription, plaque design and fabrication, and complication 


'''Isotope considerations'''
*'''I-125''': standard, low-energy, was mandated in COMS trials
*'''Pd-103''': lower energy than I-125, with faster dose fall-off. Seeds equivalent size as I-125
*'''Ru-106''': even more rapid dose fall-off, which allows to spare more normal ocular structures. Minimal scleral radiation dose of 300–400 Gy and a minimal apex dose of 80–100 Gy to the tumor apex is reasonable for cure. Parameters can be met if tumor apex &lt;= 5 mm, good choice for small melanomas. '''Bertil Damato;2005''' PMID 15913907 &amp;mdash; &quot;Local tumor control after Ru-106 brachytherapy of choroidal melanoms&quot; Damato B. Int. J. Radiation Oncology Biol. Phys., Vol. 63, No. 2, pp. 385–391, 2005.
*'''Co-60''': high-energy gamma, which may result large dose to unaffected ocular structures, and health care providers
*'''Ir-192''':  same as Co-60


'''Visual complications'''
*'''Thomas Jefferson; 2000''' PMID 10980767 &amp;mdash; &quot;Plaque radiotherapy for uveal melanoma: long-term visual outcome in 1106 consecutive patients.&quot; Shields CL. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000 Sep;118(9):1219-28.
**1106 pts w/ upfront visual acuity better than 20/100 tracked for change in vision.  Loss of visual acuity (&lt;20/200) seen in 34% at 5 yrs and 68% at 10 yrs.
**Factors predicting poor visual acuity included increasing tumor thickness, proximity to foveola &lt;5 mm, patients &gt; 60 y.o, recurrence, and cobalt.
**Conclusions: Visual acuity best preserved for small tumors &gt;5 mm from foveola/optic disk, and w/ I-125.


'''''Macular Edema'''''
*May be seen as early as 4 months after plaque RT, with peak incidence 12-18 months
*Associated with significant vision loss
*Randomized trial from Thomas Jefferson shows significant benefit for periocular triamcinolone


*'''Thomas Jefferson''' (2005-2005) -- Plaque RT +/- periocular triamcinolone
**Randomized. 163 patients, new diagnosed uveal melanoma, I-125 plaque brachytherapy. Arm 1) control vs. Arm 2) periocular injection of triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg in 1 ml) at time of plaque insertion, 4 months, and 8 months later. Optical coherence tomography
**'''2009''' PMID 19481812 -- &quot;Periocular Triamcinolone for Prevention of Macular Edema after Plaque Radiotherapy of Uveal Melanoma A Randomized Controlled Trial.&quot; (Horgan N, Ophthalmology. 2009 May 28.) Mean F/U &gt;1.5 years
***Outcome: Macular edema control 58% vs. triamcinolone 36% (SS). NNT 4.5 patients. Moderate vision loss 48% vs. 31% (SS), severe vision loss 15% vs. 5% (SS)
***Toxicity: elevated IOP (NS), cataract progression (NS)
***Periocular triamcinolone beneficial in reducing risk of macular edema, and moderate/severe vision loss

==Gamma Knife==
*'''Tufts; 2009''' (2000-2007) PMID 19286331 -- &quot;Dose de-escalation with gamma knife radiosurgery in the treatment of choroidal melanoma.&quot; (Schirmer CM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Sep 1;75(1):170-6. Epub 2009 Mar 13.)
**Retrospective. 14 patients, treated with SRS. Mean marginal dose 22 Gy (20-25). Mean tumor volume 1.1 cc
**Outcome: Local control 93%. Intraocular and DM spread in 1 patient
**Toxicity: Visual preservation in 36%
**Conclusion: Choroidal melanoma can be safely treated with marginal dose &lt;25 Gy


==Proton Therapy==
*'''Nice Hospital; 2010''' (1991-2007) PMID 19910136 -- &quot;Proton beam radiotherapy for uveal melanomas at nice teaching hospital: 16 years' experience.&quot; (Caujolle JP, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Sep 1;78(1):98-103. Epub 2009 Nov 10.)
**Retrospective. 886 patients, uveal melanoma T1 4%, T2 47%, T3 46%, T4 2%. Median F/U 5.3 years
**Outcome: Local control 5-years 94%, 10-years 92%. 5-year OS T1 92%, T2 89%, T3 67%, T4 62%; 10-year OS 86%, 78%, 43%, 41%. Ocular preservation 5-years 91%, 10-year 87%. Predictors for death: higher age, higher thickness, larger basal diameter, higher volume, and higher volume/eyeball ratio
**Conclusion: Outcomes reported

*'''Harvard''' (1989-1998) -- Protons 70 CGE vs Protons 50 CGE
**Randomized. 188 patients with small/medium choroidal melanoma (&lt;15mm diameter, &lt;5mm height), within 4 disc diameters of optic disc or macula. Arm 1) 50 CGE vs. Arm 2) 70 CGE
**'''2000''' PMID 10865313 -- &quot;A randomized controlled trial of varying radiation doses in the treatment of choroidal melanoma.&quot; (Gragoudas ES, Arch Ophthalmol. 2000 Jun;118(6):773-8.)
***5-year outcome: visual acuity &gt;20/200 similar at 55%; tumor regrowth similar at ~3%; mets similar at ~8%
***Toxicity: 50 CGE significantly less visual loss; no difference in radiation papillopathy or maculopathy
***Conclusion: Lower dose resulted in similar outcome, similar visual acuity loss, but improved visual field loss

==Heavy Ions==
*'''UCSF; 1993''' PMID 8414414 -- &quot;Helium ions versus iodine 125 brachytherapy in the management of uveal melanoma. A prospective, randomized, dynamically balanced trial.&quot; (Char DH, Ophthalmology. 1993 Oct;100(10):1547-54.)
**Randomized. 184 patients, diameter &lt;15mm, thickness &lt;10 mm. Arm 1) helium ion with vs. Arm 2) I-125 plaque brachytherapy. Dose 70 Gy in both arms, but significantly different in delivery: Helium ion given 70/5 over 2 minutes each vs. I-125 continuous LDR 0.7-0.75 Gy /hr
**Outcome: local failure He 0% vs. 13%; enucleation 2x more common after plaque. No difference in survival
**Toxicity: More anterior segment complications after He.
**Conclusion: RT can be used to manage uveal melanoma, with eye retention. Better control with He ion
**Comment: Results led to increase in dose and dose-rate of plaque treatments 


==Treatment Toxicity==

Acoustics is the science that studies sound, in particular its production, transmission, and effects. Sound can often be 

considered as something pleasant; music is an example. In that case a main application is room acoustics, since the purpose 

of room acoustical design and optimisation is to make a room sound as good as possible. But some noises can also be 

unpleasant and make people feel uncomfortable. In fact, noise reduction is actually a main challenge, in particular in the 

industry of transportations, since people are becoming increasingly demanding. Furthermore, ultrasounds also have applications 

in detection, such as sonar systems or non-destructive material testing. The articles in this wikibook describe the 

fundamentals of acoustics and some of the major applications.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In 1990s, the trend was moving away from [[w:Mainframe computer|Mainframe computing]] to Client/Server, as the price of Unix servers dropped. The database access and some business logic were centralized on the [[w:Front-end and back-end|back-end]] server, collecting data from the user program was installed on the [[w:Front-end and back-end|front-end]] users' &quot;client&quot; computers. In the Java world there are three main ways the front-end and the back-end could simply communicate. 
* The client application using JDBC to connect the data base server, (Limited business logic on the back-end, unless using [[w:Stored procedure|Stored procedures]])
* The client application using RMI ([[Java Programming/Remote Method Invocation|Remote Method Invocation]]) to communicate with the back-end.
* The client application using [[w:Server socket|socket connection]] to communicate with the back-end.

== Socket Connection Example ==

[[Image:Java client server.jpg|thumb|530px|Figure 1:Simple Client Server Implementation]]

In this page there is an example for socket connection.

=== Create a Server ===
Java language was developed having network computing in mind. For this reason it is very easy to create a server program. A server is a piece of code that runs all the time listening on a particular port on the computer for incoming request. When a request arrives, it starts a new thread to service the request.
See the following example:
{{Clr}}
==== Listening on a port ====
; ComServer : class is for listening on a port for a client. 

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.1: ComServer'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
/**
 * -- Main Server Class; Listening on a port for client; If there is a client,
 * starts a new Thread and goes back to listening for further clients. --
 */
public class ComServer 
{
static boolean  GL_listening = true;
   /**
    * -- Main program to start the Server --
    */
   public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
   {
      ComServer srv = new ComServer();
      srv.listen(); 
   } // --- End of Main Method ---

   /**
    * -- Server method; Listen for client --
    */
   public int listen() throws IOException
   {
    ServerSocket serverSocket = null;
    int iPortNumber = 9090;

       // --- Open the Server Socket where this should listen ---
       try {
           System.out.println( &quot;*** Open the listening socket; at:&quot;+ iPortNumber + &quot; ***&quot; );
           serverSocket = new ServerSocket( iPortNumber );
       } catch (IOException e) {
           System.err.println(&quot;Could not listen on port:&quot;+iPortNumber );
           System.exit(1);
       }
       while ( GL_listening )
       {
        ComServerThread clientServ; 
           // --- Listening for client; If there is a client start a Thread -
           System.out.println( &quot;*** Listen for a Client; at:&quot;+ iPortNumber + &quot; ***&quot; );
           clientServ = new ComServerThread( serverSocket.accept() );
           // --- Service a Client ---
           System.out.println( &quot;*** A Client came; Service it ***&quot; );
           clientServ.start();   /* --- Use for multy Threaded --- */
      //     clientServ.run();    /* --- Use for Single Threaded --- */
       }

       // --- Close the Server socket;  Server exiting ---
       serverSocket.close();
    return 0;
   } // --- End of listen Method --- 
}  // --- End of ComServer Class ---
&lt;/source&gt;}}

; ServerSocket( iPortNumber ) : Creates a server socket, bound to the specified port.
; serverSocket.accept() : Listens for a connection to be made to this socket and accepts it. The method blocks until a connection is made. It returns a new Socket.

==== Service One Client ====
; ComServerThread : This class extended from a Thread; Responsible to service one client. The Socket connection will be open between the client and server. A simple protocol has to be defined between the client and server, the server has to understand what the client wants from the server. The client will send a ''terminate'' command, for which the server will terminate the socket connection.  The ComServerThread class is responsible to handle a  client request, until the client sends a ''terminate'' command.
{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.2: ComServerThread'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
 /**
  * -- A class extended from a Thread; Responsible to service one client --
  */
 class '''ComServerThread''' extends Thread

:# The client initiate the connection.
:# The server accepts it and sends an acknowledgment notifying that it's ready 
:# The client sends a request
:# The server response based on the request
:...
:# The client sends a &lt;code&gt;BYE&lt;/code&gt; request
:# The server acknowledge the &lt;code&gt;BYE&lt;/code&gt; request and disconnects the socket connection
:# The client gets the acknowledgment to the &lt;code&gt;BYE&lt;/code&gt;
:...
:# The client sends a &lt;code&gt;SHUTDOWN&lt;/code&gt; request
:# The server acknowledge the &lt;code&gt;SHUTDOWN&lt;/code&gt; request and disconnects and also stops listening of other clients.
:# The client gets the acknowledgment to the &lt;code&gt;SHUTDOWN&lt;/code&gt;

===About Me===
Hello, my name is Ryan, but I always prefer to go with my username &quot;'''''Minun'''''&quot;. I was once a Wikipedia editor but, due to a problem (trust me, you do not want to hear it) I have moved to Wikibooks. My interests are video games, however, Jimbo Wales doesn't like the video game guides, so I have moved them all the my own wiki at http://wikidream.elwiki.com

Second conjugation: how can we to make first prson form of &quot;держать&quot;?, If we have not an ending &quot;-у&quot;?
My English is poor, so I have a question, if Someboidy works on this article?
Во втором спряжении окончания могут быть и немного другие, у меня не очень хороший английский, потому вопрос - кто-нибудь над этим разделом сейчас работает?
И не надо говорить, что &quot;держать&quot; - первого спряжения - молю!

== &quot;Держать&quot; ==

&quot;Держать&quot; is an exception, it ends to -ать, but belongs to the first type. The right variant is держу.
Сейчас здесь работаю я. Собираюсь добавить несколько неочвидных исключений.

N.B.: лучше говорить не &quot;молю&quot;, а &quot;умоляю&quot;. Глагол &quot;молить&quot; больше характерен для XIX века, в современном русском в том же значении употребляется &quot;умолять&quot;

== Nonsensical sentence ==

I do not speak Russian and thus cannot correct this. However, the latter part of the following sentence should be fixed:

&lt;cite&gt;If you want to know the right way to conjugate a verb in indicative, you must know it's three basic forms: muscle formof past tens, prent form to pronoun &quot;I&quot; and to pronoun &quot;HE/SHE/IT&quot;.&lt;/cite&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Limitations of PowerPoint for E-Learning'''

There are none. 

A number of vendors of more complex, more expensive authoring tools would have you believe that quality, interactive, e-learning is beyond the capabilities of PowerPoint. The advent of motion path and trigger animations (post-2002 versions)has made PowerPoint an attractive alternative to higher-end, longer-learning-curve authoring tools. Thoughtful instructional design, use of meaningful art and graphics, and carefully planned hyperlinking can provide excellent interactive simulations (especially instructionally sound as they allow learners to see the consequences of their decisions and actions), engaging games and other interactions. 

Plenty of bad e-learning exists, much of it created with products costing many times more than the version of PowerPoint most training professionals already have. As Jane Bozarth (see &quot;E-Learning on a Shoestring&quot;) says: &quot;Good e-learning is about design, not software.&quot;

For those still not sure of the remarkable capabilities of PowerPoint, see the PowerPoint Heaven site: [http://www.http://pptheaven.mvps.org/].

== Overview ==

'''''Magical Paintings''''' or portraits are normal paintings, except that the people portrayed in them move and interact within the painted scene, with other adjacent paintings, and with the outside world.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Characters in the paintings can move from one frame to another adjacent one; at several points, a character is seen flitting from painting to painting to spread news, and in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], one character, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sir Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]], travels from painting to painting to show [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] the way to class.

The characters in several paintings are mentioned by name and are characters in their own right: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|The Fat Lady]] who guards the Gryffindor common room, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sir Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]], are the most prominent among them.

It is also apparently possible for the subject of a painting to move to any other painting in which he or she is portrayed. While it is certain that the portraits that hang in the Headmasters' study at Hogwarts have this ability, we never learn whether other portraits are able to do this. In some cases, notably that of Phineas Nigellus, there is one inhabitant for, in this case, two pictures. This means that there is always one 'empty' painting. While it might seem odd to Muggles to have a painting without an inhabitant, this is apparently fairly common in the Wizarding world; Ron remarks, when Harry comments about his Famous Wizards card being blank, &quot;Well, you can't expect him to hang about all day.&quot;

The two paintings can be at any distance apart, but the inhabitants will still be able to switch. In several cases, people depicted in paintings in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s office travel instantaneously to their images in London. This switching can be useful to carry messages between the locations of the different pictures, or report on what is going on in one of the other places.

Apparently, the inhabitants can travel from portrait to portrait within a given Wizard building; we see this both at Hogwarts and at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's]]. Note that the portraits in the Headmaster's office cannot travel from frame to frame once they have left Hogwarts; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], the portrait of Phineas Nigellus does say that the portrait of Dumbledore cannot travel to the canvas that Phineas is using to visit them. We are led to believe that the portrait of Phineas Nigellus can travel from portrait to portrait within his erstwhile home at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]], but we never actually see him do so.

== Analysis ==

The limitation on where portraits can travel is clearly necessary, as without these limits, any subject of any painting could visit any other painting. This would provide, in this story, something of a ''deus ex machina'', as Harry would be able to summon and interrogate a portrait of Dumbledore no matter where he was. Dumbledore's absence is vital for Harry's maturation.

One must wonder about the case of a subject who has been painted multiple times, such as, we presume, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]. If there are twenty portraits of him scattered about the Wizarding world, does he appear in each of them in turn? Or are there multiple Dumbledores spread out among the portraits? And would it be possible for them to collide, such that you would have, perhaps, two or three different-aged Dumbledores appear in your portrait occasionally?

== Overview ==

'''''Magical photographs''''' are similar to Muggle photographs, except that the people portrayed in them are animate, moving, waving, and apparently dropping out of the picture occasionally to attend to other business. They act in many ways as their originator would in similar situation: a photograph of a girl develops spots on her nose at one point and starts trying to hide her face under the picture frame, for instance.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

While very similar to magical [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Paintings|Paintings]], photographs seem to be lesser variants of the breed; while the characters are animate, they do not seem to interact with occupants of other photos, and they do not seem to interact much with the people outside the photograph (in fact, they don't seem to be able to speak at all) – although in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order_of_the_Phoenix/Chapter_9|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor_Moody|Alastor Moody]] does instruct the characters in a photograph to &quot;move aside&quot;, and they apparently do so. Printed images behave similarly to photographs; the pictures in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|The Daily Prophet]], for instance, move but don't speak either.

'''Chicken Bog''' is a southern delicacy made of chicken, rice and sausage from the Pee Dee area of South Carolina. On the third weekend in October, Loris, South Carolina, is host to the annual Loris Bog-off Festival held in Downtown Loris.

=Variant 1=

Serves 10
==Ingredients==
*1 5lb to 6 lb fat [[Cookbook:chicken|hen]] 
*1 small [[Cookbook:onion|onion]] (about the size of a lemon or smaller) 
*1 small green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]] 
*1 stick [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (1/4 lb.), if needed 
*2 lb. long grain white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] ''(not instant rice)''
*1/4 lb [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] 
*salt and black pepper 

==Procedure==

Use a heavy aluminum pot with lid (use lid while cooking for all steps except the bacon.)

#Put chicken in pot and cover with hot water. Be sure there is enough water so that there will be at least six cups of broth after cooking chicken. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until chicken is very tender (an hour or more).
#While the chicken is cooking: Slice and chop one bell pepper into very small pieces. Put 4 cups of rice into a bowl, cover with cold water and let soak.
#When chicken is very tender, remove pot from stove and let cool until the chicken can be handled. 
#Take chicken from pot, and pull meat from bones in large pieces; do not cut it up. Discard any fat heavy skin.  
#Pour broth from pot into a bowl (if chicken was very fat and broth is very fat, pour off about 1 cup of fat from broth).
#Wash pot, then put bacon in pot and cook slowly until bacon is crisp. 
#Take bacon from pot and drain; leave bacon grease in pot. 
#Put in chopped onion, green pepper and brown slightly. 
#Add 6 cups chicken broth to pot, and season to taste with salt and pepper (at least a tablespoon of each -- use a heavy hand since rice will absorb salt). 
#Increase heat, bring broth to a boil, and put chicken in pot. 
#Drain rice and put rice in pot.  
#Add a stick of butter and mix well. Reduce heat and simmer very slowly for about an hour.

To avoid gooey rice, avoid stirring. When rice is tender and has absorbed the liquids, remove from stove. Serve hot. You can crumble bacon for a topping, according to taste.

Chicken bog can be kept in refrigerator and reheated or it can be frozen and later reheated.

=Grand Strand Chicken Bog=

#Rinse the chicken and place on top of the other ingredients in the pot. Add enough water to cover the chicken and bring to a boil, uncovered, over medium-high heat. 
#Reduce heat, cover and simmer for about 1 hour, or until juices run clear when the chicken is pricked with a fork. 
#Remove chicken to a platter to cool. Strain broth from pot (you should have about 8 cups; if you have more, set aside for another use).

#Cook 20 minutes, stirring occasionally and keeping an eye on the pot to be sure it does not cook dry. Add more of the broth if necessary.
#While the rice is cooking, skin and remove chicken meat from the bones; discard bones and skin. Cut meat into bite-sized pieces and set aside. 
#When the rice is cooked, add the boneless chicken and butter. Stir together carefully, taste to correct seasoning and serve. Or keep pot covered over low heat until ready to serve.

Written by: Anna Bodenhamer

There is no one answer to the school/community disconnect.  There are many disconnecting pieces to the puzzle.  The three major pieces are the family structure, the schools, and the communities we live in.  Each piece plays a major role in a child’s life. So if you plan on teaching for a profession prepare for an exciting, unpredictable, rewarding and many times very stressful career.  

Today the family structure has many components.  They are culturally diverse, single parents, blended families and low-income families that are very unstable.  Instability is the worst and the hardest on kids especially when they are constantly on the move from school to school.  Social workers call the moves, “stealth moves” to stay ahead of landlords looking for overdue rent (Education vital signs, 2006).  Overall, mobility rates are highest in large, predominantly minority urban school districts (American school board journal).  Mobility rates keep climbing.  According to the Chicago Public Schools twenty-three percent of students who entered first grade in 1999 had changed schools by the end of the year.  Four years after entering first grade, more than fifty percent had changed schools (Education vital signs, 2006).  The negative effects of high mobility are well documented; but how can schools address students’ needs amid the pressure of accountability (Susan Black, 2003)?  Schools are under tremendous pressure to meet accreditation and are held accountable for their SOL scores.  So we all know what that means, “teachers are under the microscope” in hopes their students achieve passing scores on the SOL tests.  This is not an easy achievement with students moving in and out and than back in again. It is not surprising that many highly mobile students suffer academically (American school board journal).

Schools are a major piece of the puzzle in shaping our future.  Teaching is becoming a very stressful occupation.  The No Child Left Behind Act, signed into law January 2002, aims to make sure that all children achieve academic proficiency and gain the educational skills necessary to succeed later in life (Child trends data bank, 2003).  In theory this is a wonderful idea but in reality it is not easy to accomplish.  In one classroom you may have as many as twenty-five to thirty-two students with half being two to three years below grade level.  Then there is the SOL pacing guide you must follow and complete by the end of the year.  So your students take the SOL test and you hold your breath, in hopes that their scores are passing or at least not embarrassingly low!   Then the so call specialist scrutinizes your class scores without giving concrete advice or guidance in how to achieve higher scores.  They tell you what you need to accomplish but not how.  It is very frustrating!  There are just too many specialists that have never stepped into a classroom to experience the teacher’s reality of teaching students of “today”.

Students are a product of their environment.  Classrooms are full of cultural diversity and socio-economic levels.  Many homes and communities often accept and encourage behaviors that are incompatible with the behaviors in the school setting (Bos and Vaughn, 2006).  For instance, aggressive and highly emotionally charged behavior may be expected of African American males at home and in their community but are unacceptable in the class setting.  Hispanic students are viewed as dependent and passive (Bos and Vaughn).  This is very confusing to the student when they receive a reprimand and told the behavior is unacceptable at school.  The lack of respect and opposition to authority is increasing every year.  They reason by saying, “My momma says it’s OK!”  Social skills are definitely lacking in society.  When parents are called in for a conference, the teachers immediately realize, “The apple does not fall far from the tree.”  These days it is falling on the schools to teach the social skills our parents, a generation ago, taught us at home.  Teaching students to solve interpersonal problems has been very successful with a wide range of populations (Platt and Spivack, 1972).  The goal of interpersonal problem-solving training is to teach students how to employ a wide range of strategies that allow them to develop and maintain positive relationships with others, cope effectively with others, solve their own problems, and resolve conflict with others.  

'''FAST''' is a strategy that is taught to students with learning disabilities who have been identified as having social skills problems (Vaughn and Lancelotta, 1990; Vaughn, Lancelotta, and Minnis, 1988; Vaughn, McIntosh, and Spencer-Rowe, 1991).  
This is a wonderful strategy for all students.  The idea is to get students to consider:
 
FREEZE and think! What is the problem? 
ALTERNATIVE? What are my possible solutions?                   SOLUTION evaluation choose the best solutions:  Safe? Fair?       TRY It! Slowly and carefully does it work? Soulutions that is 
effective in the long run.
               
'''SLAM''' is another strategy used to assist students in 
accepting and assimilating negative feedback and comments
from other people (McIntosh, Vaughn, and Bennerson, 1995).
It stands for:

STOP—Stop whatever you are doing.
LOOK—Look the person in the eye.
ASK—Ask the person a question to clarify what he/she means.    
MAKE—Make an appropriate response to the person.

When students master these strategies they will have learned a very valuable lesson.  They realize there are laws to abide by and rules to follow in society and to learn to do so will enable them to live a safer, peaceful, and successful life.  

So as you can see “schools” are a major piece of the puzzle.  Teachers educate, nurture, and become surrogate parents to all their students.  The disconnection between schools and communities is wide and the responsibilities on schools seem to grow every year.  A person who becomes a teacher is unselfish, dedicated, and caring.  We all know the profession will not create wealth in our lives but we will enjoy many rewards.  Especially the few students that come back to say, “Thanks for everything you taught me”.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is less predestination than we expect. We can change our destinies in many ways - big and small. Starting with flipping a coin and ending with choosing a wife.  Having or not having a kid or kids could start a lot of causual chains.

Important part - not to go crazy.  And not to become too ridgid.
Predestination could be fixed patern of reactions in given circumstances.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;SQL in DVX&lt;/h2&gt;
DVX is based on Transact-SQL, Microsoft's and Sybase's interpretation of a structured language used for querying databases. By using SQL you can either select (view or export) or process (update or remove) database segments satisfying certain criteria. The former is called SQL Select; the latter is called SQL Execute. The different editions of DVX offer the following support for SQL:&lt;p&gt;
DVX Editor - none.&lt;p&gt;
DVX Standard - SQL Select (see the [http://www.atril.com/docs/DVX/DVX%20Standard.pdf DVX Standard manual]).&lt;p&gt;
DVX Professional - SQL Select and SQL Execute (see the [http://www.atril.com/docs/DVX/DVX%20Pro.pdf DVX Professional manual]).&lt;p&gt;
DVX Workgroup - SQL Select and SQL Execute (see the [http://www.atril.com/docs/DVX/DVX%20Workgroup.pdf DVX Workgroup manual]).&lt;p&gt;
By using SQL you can for example remove all database segments that were made by user John between January 2nd 2004 and January 10th 2004 13:07, provided said strings do not contain the word 'dog'. Or if certain database segments have been linked to a certain client A, you can change the name of client A into client B after client B decides to take over client A. The examples can be made as complex as you want.&lt;p&gt;
Using SQL in DVX is a very advanced topic, about which a lot has been written. The above manuals are very good sources about the usage of SQL in DVX. Another very good source is [http://www.necco.ca/dv/docs/A%20Tinkerer%27s%20Guide%20to%20SQL%20in%20DVX.pdf A Tinkerer's Guide to SQL in DVX], by Michael Farrell.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Examples of SQL usage in DVX memory databases&lt;/h2&gt;
Note that SQL Select statements are entered via SQL Select on the mid left of the screen, while SQL Execute statements are entered via Database &gt; Execute SQL. The underlined parts need to be filled in by yourself.&lt;p&gt;
'''Change usernick A into usernick B''' &lt;p&gt;
UPDATE Sentences SET UserNick = '&lt;u&gt;newnick&lt;/u&gt;' WHERE UserNick = '&lt;u&gt;oldnick&lt;/u&gt;'&lt;p&gt;
'''Change client A into client B''' &lt;p&gt;
UPDATE Translations SET Client = '&lt;u&gt;newclient&lt;/u&gt;' WHERE Client LIKE '*&lt;u&gt;partofoldclientsname&lt;/u&gt;*'&lt;p&gt;
'''Update client names based on actual project names or part of them (and not PrjID)''' &lt;p&gt;
UPDATE Translations SET Client='&lt;u&gt;newclient&lt;/u&gt;' WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM Translations WHERE PrjID in (SELECT Projects.Prjid FROM Projects WHERE ((Projects.PrjTitle) LIKE &quot;*&lt;u&gt;partOfProjectName&lt;/u&gt;*&quot;)))&lt;p&gt;
'''Update client names based on datestamps''' &lt;p&gt;
UPDATE Translations SET Client='&lt;u&gt;newclient&lt;/u&gt;' WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM Sentences WHERE DateStamp &gt;= #&lt;u&gt;mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm&lt;/u&gt;# AND DateStamp &lt; #&lt;u&gt;mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm&lt;/u&gt;#)&lt;p&gt;
You have to specify a date range, as the datestamp also includes information about the time. You can leave out the time part (hh:mm) if needed. &lt;p&gt;
'''Remove numbers and the following tab in the beginning of sentences'''&lt;p&gt;
Also, it is possible to include functions in SQL statements that add even more flexibility. The statement below could be useful for records that have been added to the database with alignment, in which case some weird patterns may occur. For example, it is possible  that some records start with a number, followed by a tab (which appears as a long space in the database).&lt;p&gt;
UPDATE Sentences SET Sentence=RIGHT(Sentence,LEN(Sentence)-instr(Sentence,chr(9))) WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID from Sentences WHERE Sentence LIKE '[0-9]*'+chr(9)+'*')&lt;p&gt;
The above instructions can be converted to SQL Select statements (just for viewing or exporting) by omitting everything up to and including the first instance of &lt;i&gt;WHERE&lt;/i&gt;. It is &lt;b&gt;highly&lt;/b&gt; recommended to first test the SQL by making selections, before actually executing said statements.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Examples of SQL usage in DVX projects&lt;/h2&gt;
The following SQL queries are used for checking target segments in a project where English is the source language and Dutch is the target language. For other languages codes, please check the DVX manual or on-line Help.

'''Checking punctuation'''&lt;br&gt;
Open the Row Selector, select SQL Statement, paste the query listed below, and select Apply.&lt;br&gt;
target_1043 like '* .*' OR &lt;br&gt;
target_1043 like '* ,*' OR &lt;br&gt;
target_1043 like '* ;*' OR &lt;br&gt;
target_1043 like '* :*' OR &lt;br&gt;
target_1043 like '* [?]*' OR &lt;br&gt;
target_1043 like '* [!]*' &lt;br&gt;
This will select all segments where a &quot;.&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, &quot;!&quot; is preceded by a space. 

'''Checking spaces in front of closing brackets and after opening brackets'''&lt;br&gt;
Open the Row Selector, select SQL Statement, paste the query listed below, and select Apply.&lt;br&gt;
target_1043 like '* )*' OR&lt;br&gt;
target_1043 like '* []]*' OR&lt;br&gt;
target_1043 like '* &gt;*' OR&lt;br&gt;
target_1043 like '*( *' OR&lt;br&gt;
target_1043 like '*[[] *' OR &lt;br&gt;
target_1043 like '*&lt; *'&lt;br&gt;
This will select all segments where a &quot;)&quot;, &quot;]&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot; is preceded by a space or &quot;(&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot; is followed by a space.&lt;br&gt;

'''Source includes period while target does not''' &lt;br&gt;
source like &quot;*.*&quot; and target_1043 not like &quot;*.*&quot; &lt;br&gt;

'''Target includes opening bracket but no closing bracket'''&lt;br&gt;
target_1043 like &quot;*(*&quot; and target_1043 not like &quot;*)*&quot; &lt;br&gt;

'''Source includes opening bracket while target does not'''&lt;br&gt;
source like &quot;*(*&quot; and target_1043 not like &quot;*(*&quot; &lt;br&gt;

'''Source includes closing bracket while target does not'''&lt;br&gt;
source like &quot;*)*&quot; and target_1043 not like &quot;*)*&quot; &lt;br&gt;

'''Target segment is longer than source'''&lt;br&gt;
LEN(target_1043) &gt; len(source)

'''Target segment is longer than a specific value (useful for e.g. subtitles or software strings)'''&lt;br&gt;
LEN(target_1043) &gt; 38

'''Space on position 4 of target'''&lt;br&gt;
InStr(1,target_1043,&quot; &quot;,1)=4

'''Source starts with Upper case while target starts with lower case'''&lt;br&gt;
(asc(left(source,1)) between 96 and 122) AND (asc(left(Target_1043,1)) between 65 and 90) &lt;br&gt;
(One statement!)

{{wikibooks|An Awk Primer}}
The name 'awk' is derived from the names of the three people who originally developed it - Aho, Weinberger and Kernighan. It is a programming language which uses a pattern-action expression that transforms the input to the output. It processes the input (usually a file of data), searching each line for the given pattern. Any line that matches the given pattern has the action applied to it and this constitutes the output. A line that does not match is ignored.

Each input line is divided into fields by a separator character (default is space) and patterns can be matched to these fields as they are referenced in the usual Unix style - $1 being field 1, $2 being field 2 etc. $0 means the entire input line.

If no pattern is specified then all input lines are selected. If no action is specified, the default action is to print the entire line. Therefore if you just want to print a subset of the input, you just need to supply a pattern that will produce the desired results, Awk will print the input as found.

However, you can also specify which fields are to be output in the same way e.g. print $1.

A simple example:

awk '$1 ~ /A/ { print $2 &quot; &quot; $3 }' /etc/passwd

=== Program Structure ===
'''awk''' programs consist of a sequence of one or more 
pattern-action statements:
&lt;pre&gt;
pattern   { action }
pattern   { action }
 :
 :
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''awk''' scans input lines of data and performs actions on those lines that match any of the specified patterns.



=== Running AWK ===

Here we call '''awk''' from a shell script 
'''awk1.sh''':

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash

# awk1.sh
awk '
       { print }
' $1
&lt;/pre&gt;

There is no ''pattern'', so every line fed into 
'''awk''' is matched and the action is invoked.
Which results in every line of the file
being printed on the screen. Thus '''awk1.sh'''
behaves similar to '''cat'''.

To demonstrate, create the file '''numeric.dat'''
with the contents:

&lt;pre&gt;
1 one   i
2 two   ii
3 three iii
4 four  iv
5 five  v
6 six   vi
7 seven vii
8 eight viii
9 nine  ix
10 ten  x
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run '''awk1.sh''' on '''numeric.dat''' (don't forget to
make the script executable):

 '''./awk1.sh numeric.dat'''
 1 one   i
 2 two   ii
 3 three iii
 4 four  iv
 5 five  v
 6 six   vi
 7 seven vii
 8 eight viii
 9 nine  ix
 10 ten  x

(Notice how &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ./ &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is being used to execute a script.)

=== Expressions ====

If the first field is equal to one then print the entire line
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh
# awk1.sh
awk '
    $1 == 1 { print $0 }
' $1
&lt;/pre&gt;

Results in:
&lt;pre&gt;
1 one i
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the second field is equal to &quot;two&quot; then print the entire line:
&lt;pre&gt;
$2 == &quot;two&quot; { print $0 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Results in:
&lt;pre&gt;
2 two ii
&lt;/pre&gt;
If the first field is greater than 5 then print the third field
&lt;pre&gt;
$1 &gt; 5 { print $3 }
&lt;/pre&gt;
Results in
&lt;pre&gt;
 vi
 vii
 viii
 ix
 x
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Regular Expressions ===

Print the input line if the pattern &quot;ix&quot; is matched in any field
&lt;pre&gt;
/ix/ { print $0 } 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Results in:

&lt;pre&gt;
6 six   vi
9 nine  ix
&lt;/pre&gt;

Print the input line if the pattern &quot;ix&quot; is matched 
in the third field:

&lt;pre&gt;
$3 ~ /ix/ { print $0 } 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Results in:
&lt;pre&gt;
9 nine  ix
&lt;/pre&gt;
Print the input lines that do not contain the pattern &quot;x&quot; 
&lt;pre&gt;
$0 !~ /x/ { print }
&lt;/pre&gt; 
Results in:
&lt;pre&gt;
1 one   i
2 two   ii
3 three iii
4 four  iv
5 five  v
7 seven vii
8 eight viii
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Compound expressions===
Print lines where the third field matches the pattern &quot;x&quot; OR the first field is less than or equal to 3.
&lt;pre&gt;
$3 ~ /x/ ||  $1 &lt;= 3  { print $0 }
&lt;/pre&gt;
Results in:
&lt;pre&gt;
1 one   i
2 two   ii
3 three iii
9 nine  ix
10 ten  x
&lt;/pre&gt;

Print lines where the third field matches the pattern &quot;vi&quot; AND the second field begins with the letter &quot;s&quot;.
&lt;pre&gt;
$3 ~ /vi/ &amp;&amp; $2 ~ &quot;^s&quot;  { print $0 }
&lt;/pre&gt;
Results in:
&lt;pre&gt;
6 six   vi
7 seven vii
&lt;/pre&gt;
=== Ranges ===
Print lines where the second field equals &quot;three&quot; and where the third field equals &quot;vii&quot; and all subsequent lines in between:
&lt;pre&gt;
$2 == &quot;three&quot;, $3 == &quot;vii&quot; { print $0 }
&lt;/pre&gt;
Results in:
&lt;pre&gt;
3 three iii
4 four  iv
5 five  v
6 six   vi
7 seven vii
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== BEGIN and END ===
BEGIN is a special pattern which matches before the first input line. Similarly END matches after the last input line.
&lt;pre&gt;
BEGIN { print &quot;start at 3...&quot; }
$2 == &quot;three&quot;, $2 ~ /^e/ { print $1 }
END { print &quot;...and end at eight&quot; }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Results in
&lt;pre&gt;
start at 3...
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
...and end at eight
&lt;/pre&gt;

The '''Baroque flute'''  was popular from the 1670's up until the 1900's. Its main use was from the 1670's until the late 18th to early 19th centuries, when more keys started being added. Even though multi-keyed flutes gradually supplanted the Baroque flute at the end of the 18th Century, these multi-keyed flutes were more widely in use by professionals than amateurs, who continued to use one-keyed flutes even up until the 1900's (although multi-keyed flutes, and eventually Boehm flutes, grew in popularity among amateurs as well).  

It is known by several names:
* '''Traverso'''
* '''German flute'''
* '''One-keyed (or single-keyed) flute'''
''Traverso'' is the name preferred by many for historical reasons. This book will also use ''Baroque flute'' because it accurately names the instrument for modern readers.

 
In general, the Baroque flute has the following characteristics: 
* It is made of wood, of which the most commonly used are boxwood, ebony, and grenadilla.
* It has a conical bore that is wide at the end with the embouchure hole and tapers to become significantly more narrow at the bottom.
* It has relatively small embouchure and finger holes. Earlier flutes have embouchure holes that are almost exactly circular, and later flutes have more oval embouchure holes.
* It has 6 finger holes plus a 7th hole on the far end that is closed unless opened by a single key.
* Its body is divided into 3 or 4 joints: a headjoint that contains the embouchure hole, 1 or 2 middle joints with 6 finger holes divided among them, and a footjoint having a 7th hole and key.
 
The Baroque flute  returned to popularity in the 20th Century as part of the HIP (historically informed performance) movement, where interest grew in music, instruments, and performance practices of earlier times. 
While it is easier to find information about the Baroque flute now than in previous decades, that information tends to be scattered across a variety of sources, much of it in the form of an &quot;oral tradition&quot; passed among the community of makers and players. Much of the information on the traverso itself and musical style comes from treatises of the time, (eg. Quantz, Hotteterre, CPE Bach, Leopold Mozart, etc). Even among experts, opinions on some matters vary widely.
For the newcomer, this can be at times confusing and frustrating. 
The purpose of this handbook is to collect some of this material in one place, hoping it will be useful for beginners as well as more advanced players.

== Roast leg of lamb ==

'''Identifying good lamb'''

The secret of buying lamb is quite simple: not too much fat on the outside of the joint, as few white pieces of sinew as possible, and then, the absolute lamb buying mantra.... Pink... Pink...Pink ! The meat should be pink, not red and the joint should be firm to the touch.

'''Buying lamb'''

If you're planning your Lamb for a Sunday lunch, please remember to buy the joint by Thursday lunchtime. Most butchers sell out fast thereafter; to efficient housewives on a Friday, to us less efficient mortals on a Saturday morning!! 

The quality of a Lamb joint generally is, it seems to me, more uniform than, say, Beef, but of course it is best to buy your Lamb joint from a source when the lambs have been allowed to frisk about joyfully, are fed good grasses and, as in France, fresh herbs. The latter is a relatively new phenomenon and adds significantly to the flavour of the meat.

Contrary to my recipe for Roast Beef, where I suggest the larger the better is terms of joint size, with roast lamb I suggest (and many will disagree) that a very large leg of lamb will have significantly less flavour than a small one. I also suggest that cold Roast Lamb, and almost anything made from it - apart from possibly lamb and mint sandwiches - is not nice. So, buy according to the number of people you are expecting.

When you get your lamb joint home, place it in the fridge, if possible wrapped in silver foil. Add a few tablespoons of Olive oil, some Rosemary, some Thyme, and even some fresh Lavender inside to foil and fold the edges together. If you like garlic, stab the skin of the joint with a small, sharp knife in at least 8 places, and insert a peeled garlic clove into the hole. This process will add a delicious flavour. Try and remember to turn the joint occasionally so the herbs infuse into all parts of the joint.

'''Roasting'''

Preheat the oven to about 180 - 200 C. If possible, use a roasting tin with a lid and before putting in the joint place as many herbs (see above) as you can on the bottom of the dish. Pour over some Olive oil and leave for a few minutes. 

Season the joint well, not being too restrained with the salt, and place in the roasting tin on its bed of herbs. I personally do not &quot;seal&quot; lamb before roasting it.

At this point ''add slightly less than 1/2 pint (say 400cc's) of cold water'' to the joint, and a similar amount of white wine. The purpose of this is to keep the meat moist as it roasts, otherwise there can be the tendency for the meat to dry out during cooking. Don't worry, the liquid will evaporate.

Basting is not as important as with other meats, as the garlic and the herbs already in the meat will contribute their own flavours, and the water/wine will keep the meat moist, but it is worth checking the joint every now and then, and slopping some of the liquids over the meat.

Cooking times vary a little with lamb. Lamb which is cooked rare is predominately the way the French do it, with blood oozing all over the place and turning their roast potatoes red. 

I have always had my doubts as to whether people who eat rare lamb, actually enjoy it or rather feel it contributes to their air of garlic sophistication, but if you like your lamb rare, give it about 17 minutes per pound (450 grams). 

In my humble opinion lamb should be pink in the middle, with the meat cooked to a nutty brown colour around the outside. To achieve this, give the meat about 20 minutes per pound (450 Grams) with an extra 15 minutes for luck.

'''An alternative way to roast lamb: slow roasting'''

I tried this out today and have to say the results were wonderful. If you are aiming for lunch at say 1pm, haul yourself out of bed at 7am and turn on the oven to about 70C (160F) and place the lamb, wrapped up in foil, into the oven. Leave for 3 hours, and then turn up the oven a little to about 140C for another couple of hours, and then finally turn up again to 180C and at this point open the foil package to expose the meat. Leave for the final hour and then remove from the oven, recover in foil and let rest (see below) - the meat will be so wonderfully tender and moist. It is a wonderful alternative ! Enjoy

'''Letting the meat rest'''

Once the cooking has completed, take the joint out of the roasting dish and place it on its own separate dish, cover it loosely with tin-foil and leave it to “rest” for about 15 minutes in a warm part of the kitchen. This is absolutely essential as the juices, which has been drawn towards the surface of the joint will “relax” and diffuse back into the joint. The resting time also gives you time to make a delicious gravy.

== Gravy for lamb ==

Gravy for lamb is not quite the same gravy as the one for Roast Beef. Place the roasting dish on the stove (if need be light 2 rings onto a very low heat, one for either end) and allow the juice to heat up a little.

Add a cup of a dry white or red wine (white wine makes the gravy more subtle, red wine more potent) to the roasting tin, and thoroughly deglaze it on a high heat. This will also evaporate the alcohol from the wine.

Add a little water (if you are cooking vegetables, add a little of their water!) and, if to hand, some Worcester Sauce or Maggi, and a flat teaspoon of store bought mint sauce, and once again bring to a low simmer.

Now add 1 generous teaspoon of orange marmalade,  or sweet jelly, a small teaspoon of mustard, and a generous scrape of Nutmeg, and stir in. If you are really feeling naughty, you can add some crème fraiche!

Continue to heat everything on the stove, adding small amounts of water (or cream or more wine, depending on taste)  waiting til the gravy begins to thicken on its own (please don't add cornflour!) - Lamb gravy is actually more of a ''Jus'' - and then carefully sieve the lot, with the gravy reserved in a bowl (don't do what I once did and, without thinking, sieved the gravy over the kitchen sink).

Remember you need enough gravy for the number of people at the table, and they will take loads of gravy... it's that good.

'''Mint sauce'''

Well, I am an Englishman so for me, a few hand-torn mint-leaves, mixed with a little warm Greek honey and a ''good quality'' vinegar is a delightful addition to Roast Lamb, but... there are those that don't like the idea, and are very vociferous in their sneering opinions.

My suggestion is in the same vein as the instructions on the side of a packet of spot-remover. Try a little to see if it works for you !! If you don't like it, then... don't have it ! 

However where I draw the line is at those who proceed to slosh it all over the lamb, as I am afraid some of my fellow countrymen do. I prefer to delicately dip the lamb into a tiny dish by my plate containing mint-sauce en route to my mouth.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Breaking In a Flute ==

Baroque flutes are made of wood.
When played, moisture condenses out of the breath to settle on the flute's inner bore.
The wood inside the bore absorbs this moisture and expands.
Wood on the exterior of the flute stays relatively dry and does not expand.
That difference of expansion produces stress that (in the worst case) is relieved by cracks.
Most at risk are new instruments and instruments that have dried out because of infrequent playing.
(It can take as little as a week or two between playing sessions for a flute to return to its
original dried-out condition.)

To make a new or unplayed flute's transition from dry to damp as stress-free as possible,
the player must follow a break-in routine that gradually increases the amount of moisture absorbed (and retained) by the flute.
The key idea is to minimize moisture by playing the flute for only a small amount of time at first,
and then gradually increase that time, and thus also the amount of moisture absorbed by the wood,
until the instrument reaches a point of equilibrium at which it can be played for extended periods (within reason).
There are various schedules recommended for this process, 
but all follow the same pattern: a gradual increase of moisture to which the instrument is exposed.
The following sections outline several representative schedules.{{ref|breakin}}

* Day 6: 35 min
* Day 7: 40 min
* Day 8: 45 min
* Day 9: 50 min
* Day 10+: 60 min

=== Folkers &amp; Powell ===

* Week 1–2: 10 min twice a day
* Week 3–4: 30 min/day
* Week 5 and after: 60 min/day

== Oiling ==

The inner bore of a flute must be oiled periodically.
The thin layer of oil acts as a buffer.
It allows some moisture to pass from the breath into the wood, but not too much or too quickly.
Some authorities  claim that oil alters the sound and playability of the flute for the better,
but they  provide few specifics as to either the mechanisms or the effects.
Oil could make the interior more smooth by filling in between ridges left during the boring process.
That could, plausibly, alter sound and playability.
In the absence of solid, quantified research, suffice it to say that oil does provide a measure of protection for the instrument
and it may even improve sound and playability.
Even if the improvements were to be found largely  placebo effects, they would be  improvements nonetheless.
In the final analysis, you should oil your flute. Certainly for the protection. Perhaps for sound and playability.
And last, but not least, because it is a regular checkup that turns up unnoticed issues and shines your instruments back to their peak.

===What oil to use? ===

Two kinds of oils are used on wooden flutes: hardening and non-hardening. 

* '''Hardening oils''' (also known as '''drying oils''') dry to a finish and leave a semi-permanent layer on the wood. ''Linseed oil'' is a hardening oil.
* '''Non-hardening oils''' (also known as '''non-drying oils''') do not dry. 

Most vegetable oils (almond oil, olive oil, peanut oil, etc.) are said to be non-hardening, though in reality they simply are slower to harden. 
There are many reasons to select a particular oil,
including whether or not the oil is prone to going rancid, 
or even preferences as to the taste of an oil. 

When shopping for oils, it's important to know that they are not always sold under the same name commonly used
in the traverso world.
Linseed oil is often sold as ''flaxseed oil,''
while rapeseed oil has been renamed (for marketing reasons) ''canola oil.''

==== Almond oil ====

Almond oil is popular, but some people have problems with it going rancid.
Mixing vitamin E with the oil is sometimes advised as a way to prevent this.
About one capsule of vitamin E per 8 to 10 oz. is a recommended mix.
It's still a good idea to store almond oil in a cool place.
Even with the use of vitamin E, some people have reported problems with the oil  applied to an
instrument later becoming sticky and rancid.
One theory (not confirmed to this author's knowledge) is that there are two grades of almond oil, food and pharmaceutical,
and that  pharmaceutical grade  should be used to avoid problems.

==== Linseed oil ====

Linseed oil (raw, unboiled) is a hardening oil.
It's also a controversial oil.
Some swear by it.
Others reject its use entirely.
It's not entirely clear why this is so.
Perhaps it's because some early authors, especially Tromlitz,{{ref|trom}} discouraged its use, 
saying it left a crust inside the instrument that alters the bore.
On the other hand, many players of that time believed almost superstitiously
in the ability of oil to improve the playing characteristics of an instrument
and were prone to use more than liberal quantities.
Were linseed oil to be used in this way,
it's not surprising that it might get a bad reputation.
However, when used properly, it has much to recommend it
because of its hardening qualities.
One must simply not use it too often, in too large a quantity,
or let the unabsorbed oil sit for too long unswabbed.{{ref|linuse}}

==== Non-vegetable oils ====

While not &quot;historically authentic,&quot; some people do use non-vegetable oils containing petroleum distillates or other chemicals.
These are the sorts of bore oils you are likely to find in music stores. 
Lacking evidence to the contrary, it seems the vegetable oils do just as good a job (and they won't make you sick or kill you if ingested). 

'''Another opinion:''' vegetable oils all tend to rancidity (which is not good to consume even in very small doses) and become gummy (harden) and (as Tromlitz observed) build up on the surface of the wood after a time. The vegetable oils sold as tung oil and &quot;boiled&quot; linseed oil (which some flute makers do use) also often have additives that can be quite toxic.  On the other hand, mineral oil which is intended to be taken internally as a laxative is sold in pharmacies: the small amounts one might ingest from playing a mineral-oiled flute are unlikely to have any effect at all on the ingestee. Mineral oil is chemically close to inert, and does not oxidize or harden, yet it soaks into the cells of wood and limits the amount of moisture that can be absorbed. In other words, mineral oil seems to provide all the benefits sought from oiling without the drawbacks of rancidity, hardening and surface buildup that are inherent with vegetable oils.

=== How often to oil? ===

Opionions on this topic seem to depend on whether a hardening or non-hardening oil is being advocated,
though about once a month is the median point for both camps. 
For non-hardening oils on instruments played frequently, it may be necessary to oil more often.
For hardening oils on instruments played infrequently, oiling less often may be a good idea to minimize 
any problems with accumulation in the bore.

=== How to oil? ===

qqq

== Polishing ==

Carnauba wax mixed half-and-half with Vaseline makes a good polish for the outside of the flute. 
It is also found in car polishes, but they don't say in what proportions.
Carnauba wax can be purchased in hard-flake, pure form from wood finishing suppliers.
After melting it with  Vaseline, rub it on the wood and polish with a soft cloth especially good around the mouth-hole.

A simpler approach: rub some of the bore oil on the outside of the instrument, allow to soak in, then polish with a soft cloth or chamois.

== Reaming and Reboring ==

Reaming and reboring are the process of sending a flute back to its maker on occasion to have its inner profile restored what it was when 
it first left the shop and had not yet been altered through the ravages of moisture and playing.
There are two schools of thought with regard to this process: most believe it is an essential part of wooden flute maintenance;
a few find it to be a highly questionable practice.

this passage is not built on accurate information.
it is exactly the opposite: most builders DO NOT suggest re-reaming flutes after playing in.
I would like to see the clear evidence that the majority opinion is for re-reaming, since the top builders I know in the EU: Tutz, Tardino, Weemaels and Wenner are all against it - UNLESS there is an issue to be resolved.
As far as I know, only Cameron and Folkers &amp; Powell (who have stopped making flutes) are for re-reaming, and therefore the minority view.



=== Reaming and Reboring: The Majority Opinion ===

Most makers hold that
the inner bore of a traverso may need to be reamed back to its original profile on occasion.
Wood changes shape, especially when it goes through the wet and dry cycles of playing.
The inner bore may distort a bit.
This can change the pitch of the instrument and the octave spacing between some notes.  
The distortion may be slight, but it can still alter the instrument's performance. 
To the player, it can feel like a stiffness or inflexibility in the instrument,
either it cannot be pushed to play louder, 
or it may feel &quot;wooden,&quot; with a somewhat coarse tone is difficult to play softly.
Because the traverso allows for playing with great variations in pitch, 
one may not notice the small pitch shifts that have made the instrument inherently out of tune, 
but will instead find it simply uncomfortable to play. 
This can be hard to notice since the changes are usually gradual.

Instrument makers all have their own procedures to deal with this.
It's usually a matter of re-reaming the instrument once the instrument has been broken in and 
played regularly for 3 to 6 months. 
After the re-reaming, the instrument must be broken in again as if it were new.
This usually works, though some instruments may need more work,
just with the passing of time, 
or because the wood out of which it was made was not adequately dried in the first place, 
or because the wood itself is persnickety (boxwood being the most notorious in this regard).

=== Reaming and Reboring: The Minority Opinion ===

The minority opinion, as stated by flutemaker Simon Polak, makes a case against reboring that can't be dismissed out of hand.
A full discussion may be found on his webpage.&lt;ref name=&quot;no-ream&quot;&gt;[http://www.earlyflute.com/earlyflutenew7/pages/reboring.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
He observes that his flutes improve as they are played in and as their players &quot;play in&quot; on them. 
In his experience, instruments that return to his workshop after a year play very much better than when they were new: &quot;more open, easier all over (not just the upper octave) and warmer.&quot;
He reasons that if the instrument is getting better on its own, there's no reason to go around making unnecessary changes.

As for the practice of  standard reboring of the new flute after some period of time, he provides an amusing thought experiment in which he imagines the reaction of a famous player of an equally famous original 18th century traverso to the suggestion that his instrument be rebored with reamers that can be proved to be the originals for that instrument. 
It seems more likely than not that the famous player, having found a comfortable place with the flute on his own, will emphatically reject the proposed surgery.
While few players  own rare instruments such as this, it does provide a perspective that other flute players might want to consider when they are faced with the decision to ream or not to ream.

Polak's bottom line seems to be that one should rebore only if it seems unequivocably necessary and not as part of standard maintenance and that it should be very much the exception for most flutes. In this he quotes Rachel Brown from ''The Early Flute'': &quot;Many makers understandably want to rebore the instrument ... Obviously this is a very personal matter ... It is my humble opinion that the bore changes according to the way the instrument is played, and if it is working well it is preferable not to tamper with it.&quot;

== Adjustments ==

=== Adjusting the Cork ===

Between the embouchure-hole and the closed end of the traverso is a cork
which may be moved to adjust an instrument's intonation.{{ref|cork-intonation}}
For those of an engineering bent,
there are various rules for placing the cork based on parameters
such as the diameter of the flute, for example, 
that the cork should be as far away from the
There are several problems with rules such as these:

* The variations of bore, embouchure dimension, and finger-hole dimensions vary so much from one traverso to another that it is, for all practical purposes, impossible to devise a &quot;one size fits all&quot; rule.

* The bore of a traverso is conical, larger at the embouchure end than the open end, so there are a lot of diameters from which to choose. The rules never seem to state which is the correct choice.

* It's actually easier just to place the cork where things &quot;sound right&quot; (which we'll get to shortly) than it is to use measurements and such.

The basic idea behind cork placement is that you want to get 
octaves on the traverso in tune with themselves.{{ref|traverso-intonation}}


* A (sort-of) mnemonic for which way to adjust the cork when you change middle sections: 
Push the cork the same direction as the change in flute length. 
A longer section moves the end of the flute away from the head; 
the cork moves down the headjoint, towards the embouchure-hole. 
A shorter section moves the end of the flute toward the head; 
the cork moves up the headjoint, away from the embouchure-hole. 
The foot register moves in the same direction as the cork: 
big section, pull out; smaller section, push in.

* Fine tuning of the cork: Play G 1 and G 2 . 
If they’re too close ( G 1 sharp and G 2 flat), 
push the cork towards the mouth-hole. 
If they’re too far apart ( G 1 flat and G 2 sharp), 
push the cork away from the mouth-hole. 
Do the same with A 1 and A 2 . 
Another (sort-of) mnemonic visualization: 
The two notes come out the end the flute. 
If they’re too close, 
they need to be “expanded” by pushing the cork in towards the end, 
sort of like inflating a balloon. 
If they’re too far apart, 
they need to be “collapsed” by pulling the cork away from the end, 
sort of like sucking the air out of a balloon.

* Everyone seems to blow a little differently. 
Something, somewhere on the flute will be out of tune, 
the best thing to do is find the best compromise position with the least out of tune notes. 
Try and make sure at first with any instrument you are playing for the first time after a restoration or some repair, 
that the octave Gs, As, and Bs are somewhat in tune. 
The Ds are often unreliable, being frequently flat in the bottom end, 
the middle Ds being sharp, flat or in tune with the bottom one. 
Then try blowing with the mouth-hole covered or open to different degrees 
and with differing breath pressures to find where the instrument responds, tunes and sounds best. 
One rule of thumb that I had heard in the past 
was that the distance of the cork from the center of the embouchure-hole 
should be the same as the bore size. 
This does not seem to work on most of the flutes I encounter. 
Usually they need to be a good bit farther away than their head joint bore size.



* Most modern players don’t push the cork in far enough because they uncover the embouchure-hole more than 18th century players did. 
This makes the high register sharp and the low register flat. 
To compensate, they position the cork further out, 
which makes the high register speak less easily. 
They should push the cork in a bit more and cover more of the mouth-hole 
(or turn the headjoint in more to accomplish the same thing) 
in order to narrow the octaves and, at the same time, make the high register easier to play.

=== Adjusting the Foot Register ===

* First make sure the cork is properly adjusted. 
Play the D 3 first fingered -23 456 - and then -23 --- K . 
If the first is higher than the second, pull the register out. 
If lower, push the register in.

* Why it works: The first fingering uses the full length of the flute. 
If it's too high, pulling the register out will make the flute longer and pull the pitch for that fingering down. 
And vice versa.

=== Adjusting the Bottom Joint ===

On some flutes, especially the 3-joint Hotteterre, 
it can be difficult to adjust the bottom joint 
so that the key can be reached easily 
while not at the same time interfering with hole 6. 
This can happen if the little finger on the right hand is lying on and moving the key while flat,
or starting curved and then going flat. 
If this occurs, the bottom joint may need to be rotated upward for the finger to operate the key, 
thus getting in the way of the 6 th hole. 
The solution is to curve the little finger, pressing the key with the tip. 
It is then possible to roll the bottom joint down out of the way of hole 6. 
Further, if the little finger remains curved while pressing the key, 
with the only motion occurring as a pivot of the joint where the finger meets the hand, 
fingerings that use the key will have less movement and be quicker.

# {{note|breakin}} It's possible that one should be more conservative when breaking in a traverso made of a less dense wood. Boxwood, for example, while popular, can be more prone to warping than denser woods.

# {{note|trom}} Johann George Tromlitz (translated by Ardal Powell). ''The Virtuoso Flute-Player.'' Cambridge University Press, 1991.

# {{note|linuse}} Once a month, just enough to coat the inside of the instrument, left for 2 hours or so and then swabbed out are good guidelines for its use.

# {{note|cork-intonation}} Intonation with itself, not with other instruments. Assuming the cork is placed correctly, you can pull the headjoint out a little to flatten a traverso that is sharp relative to other instruments in an ensemble. But you can't go too far because this alters the bore profile and the instrument will become increasingly difficult to play. If the instrument is flat, the only choices are to use the embouchure to play sharper, have everyone else tune themselves to you, or, if you're playing on a 4-joint traverso, replace the 2nd joint with one that is slightly shorter. The last is probably not as viable an option as it once was, since most traversos made today  offer only a few choices for the 2nd joint (typically one or more of the following: A440, A430, A415, A410 or thereabouts, and A392).

# {{note|traverso-intonation}} Or, as much as possible. Like the natural horn (or natural &quot;French horn&quot; if you prefer), the traverso is an instrument that requires careful attention and adjustments by the performer if it is to be to played in tune. Furthermore, just as with the natural horn, being &quot;in tune&quot; can be just a little different for some notes than it would be if you were following the modern system of equal temperament. And also, as with the natural horn, many notes, especially those which might be considered most &quot;out of tune&quot; by modern standards, have unique personalities of their own. These variations of quality from one note to another and one key to another were among the reasons why the traverso and natural horns maintained their advocates even &quot;improved&quot; forms were devised. These provided consistency of tone quality and intonation across keys and across the instrument's range. At the same time, much of the individuality of each note and key was lost.

Buying Online vs. Buying from Brick and Mortar Store
You already know the advantages of buying online. For Halloween Costumes, in particular, the main advantage of online shopping is the Choice. Some of the online retailers such as www.costumes4less.com  carry over 10,000+ styles, colors, sizes on their web site. Such a wide range of choice is selection is impossible to find in any brick-and-mortar stores. 

What to look for in an Online Retail Store  
With thousands of web sites on the Internet today and new ones springing up every day, how do you decide where to buy from?  As most online shoppers are aware, the security of your online transaction and credit card information is a very important factor. How long a web site has been business is usually a good indicator of how dependable the online merchant is. Since most web sites today offer safe &amp; secure online shopping, one must consider other factors such as customer service, quality of merchandise, reputation of online merchant, their price guarantee for choosing the online merchant. Companies specializing in costumes such as costumes4less.com will generally offer a much larger selection of costumes.
 
When to Buy Halloween Costumes
Every year, a large number of shoppers are disappointed because they are not able to find the costume of their choice. You don’t need the frustrations of “out of stock” notices and the stress of site hopping, looking for a costume. Another advantage of buying early is that if the costume doesn’t fit or if you got the wrong costume, you will have time to exchange it or fix it in time.

What size to Buy 
Unlike street clothes, costumes are made in limited sizes. Elastic materials are usually used to provide flexibility of sizing.  If you are not sure about the size, buy the next larger size.
Quality vs. Price for Halloween Costumes
  Higher price doesn’t necessarily mean a better quality costume. Online retailers such as http://www.costumes4less.com/ have built-in cost efficiencies in their operation which they are able to pass to their customers and still make a handsome profit! Their automated systems enable them to do a high transaction volume and offer quality costumes at unbelievable prices.
All costumes are not created equal. Even if you plan to wear your costume only for one occasion, quality is important, specially if it doesn’t cost any more! www.Costumes4less.com has a unique price guarantee. Check it out.
Costume Accessories 
Don’t forget to get accessories to go with your costume. Some of the accessories may be included as part of the costume. Other accessories may be available for purchase from the same online store. Sometimes, you may need to use your creativity to match your shoes, hat, scarves or any other accessories, which you may already have it your closet!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kings and Queens of ENGLAND? Surely the monarchy of England was abolished in 1707 when England and Scotland formed the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1801 Ireland was incorporated to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Other Wikipedia sites confirm this. Please get this right.


Quite right !!!!!!!

== Not  appropriate for the site run by the commoners for the commoners as featured books ==

I presume this site is run by the people, for the people and the elites though out the history to this day did nothing good to the commoners but tried to plundered them and kept them ignorant as slaves.

I really doubt the whole initiative is managed by the common people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Query about capital letters==

I am new to Wikibooks. I am impressed with the content. However, reading this article I am confused about the use of capital letters. It seems that many phrases like ''wise mind'', ''core mindfulness skills'' etc have been given a capital letter. They are not proper nouns and they are not capitalised in the textbook that is the reference for this Wikibook. --[[User:Vincej|Vincej]] 10:01, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

==Book licensed under GFDL==
 DBT is based upon the work of Marsha M. Linehan, Ph.D
Can the book be under GFDL and be based on the work of the above person? [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] ([[User talk:Logictheo|talk]]) 20:48, 22 March 2009 (UTC)

=== Copyright ===

From: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/US_Internet_Law/Fair_Use

The Copyright Act sets out four factors for courts to look at (17 U.S.C. § 107):

#The purpose and character of the use. Transformative uses are favored over mere copying. Non-commercial uses are also more likely fair.
#The nature of the copyrighted work. Is the original factual in nature or fiction? Published or unpublished? Creative and unpublished works get more protection under copyright, while using factual material is more often fair use.
#The amount and substantiality of the portion used. Copying nearly all of a work, or copying its &quot;heart&quot; is less likely to be fair.
#The effect on the market or potential market. This factor is often held to be the most important in the analysis, and it applies '''even if the original is given away for free'''. If you use the copied work in a way that substitutes for the original in the market, it's unlikely to be a fair use; uses that serve a different audience or purpose are more likely fair. Linking to the original may also help to diminish the substitution effect. Note that criticism or parody that has the side effect of reducing a market may be fair because of its transformative character. In other words, if your criticism of a product is so powerful that people stop buying the product, that doesn't count as having an &quot;effect on the market for the work&quot; under copyright law.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright Wikipedia Copyright]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Copyright law covers only the particular form or manner in which ideas or information have been manifested, the &quot;form of material expression&quot;. It is not designed or intended to cover the actual idea, concepts, facts, styles, or techniques which may be embodied in or represented by the copyright work.

Given that publishers commonly now obtain the copyright from the authors as a condition of mass reproduction of a work, one of the criticisms of the current system is that it benefits publishers more than it does authors. This is one of the chief arguments in favor of peer-to-peer file sharing systems, making an analogy with the changes wrought by printing.

The case of Donaldson vs Beckett, in 1774, brought disagreements on the length of copyright to an end. The outcome of the case resulted in the decision that Parliament could, and had, put a limit on copyright length. This decision reflected a shift in English ideas of copyright. The English lords who made the decision in 1774 decided that it was not in the public's best interest to have London publishers control books in perpetuity, particularly as English publishers commonly kept prices high. There were some notions that this was a cultural or class issue. Works in perpetual copyright were seen to have limited access by some citizens to the cultural history of their own land.

Critics of copyright as a whole fall broadly into two camps: Those who assert that the very concept of copyright has never been of net benefit to society, and has always served simply to enrich a few at the expense of creativity; and those who assert that the existing copyright regime must be reformed to maintain its relevance in the new Information society.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A copyright covers the expression of an idea, not the idea itself — this is called the idea/expression or fact/expression dichotomy. For example, if a book is written describing a new way to organize books in a library, a copyright does not prohibit a reader from freely using and describing that concept to others; it is only the particular expression of that process as originally described that is covered by copyright. One might be able to obtain a patent for the method, but that is a different area of law. Compilations of facts or data may also be copyrighted, but such a copyright is thin; it only applies to the particular selection and arrangement of the included items, not to the particular items themselves. In some jurisdictions the contents of databases are expressly covered by statute.

In some cases, ideas may be capable of intelligible expression in only one or a limited number of ways. Therefore even the expression in these circumstances is not covered. In the United States this is known as the merger doctrine, because the expression is considered to be inextricably merged with the idea. Merger is often pleaded as an affirmative defense to charges of infringement. That doctrine is not necessarily accepted in other jurisdictions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/US_Internet_Law/Copyright_General#WHAT_IS_NOT_PROTECTED_BY_COPYRIGHT.3F]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
WHAT IS NOT PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT?

Several categories of material are generally not eligible for federal copyright protection. These include among others:

Works that have not been fixed in a tangible form of expression (for example, choreographic works that have not been notated or recorded, or improvisational speeches or performances that have not been written or recorded)

Titles, names, short phrases, and slogans; familiar symbols or designs; mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring; mere listings of ingredients or contents

Ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts, principles, discoveries, or devices, as distinguished from a description, explanation, or illustration

Works consisting entirely of information that is common property and containing no original authorship (for example: standard calendars, height and weight charts, tape measures and rulers, and lists or tables taken from public documents or other common sources)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merger_doctrine]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In United States copyright law, the merger doctrine holds that if an idea and the way to express it are so intricately tied that the ways of expression have little possible variation, there will not be copyright infringement, lest the copyright prevent others from expressing the same idea. The overall principle is that of the idea-expression divide, which is that one can hold a copyright in an expression, but not in an idea.

One case involving this was Ets-Hokin v. Skyy Spirits Inc., 225 F.3d 1068 (9th Cir. 2000) [1], in which the court ruled that the whole vodka bottle in that case was driven by function, was not subject to copyright, and could not be protected by copyright law for that reason. While the label might have been protected by copyright, it was ruled to be incidental to the use and not significant.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Re: Note on Rob's Page ==

I figure I will get back to you about your note, because Rob has not been as active lately, and I would like you to get a timely response to your question.

If a book isn't on a bookshelf, I would hardly call that &quot;nefarious&quot;, but typically new users who are not familiar enough with wikibooks to know about the bookshelves probably do not know enough to create a &quot;good&quot; book. Also, most new books that are created are done so simply because the user did not find one of the existing books on the subject. In general, I would say that users who don't know enough about wikibooks probably shouldn't be starting a new book, because many books created in these ways are doomed to stagnate and eventually be deleted. Of course, there is no policy saying that people ''can't create a new book'' any time they see fit, but it generally isn't recommended. 

If a book is a stub, or if it contains stubs, typically we are very tolerant of that. However, there is a difference between a stub that &quot;is likely to attract future contributors&quot;, and a stub that is &quot;not likely to ever attract new contributors&quot;. The second group of books are typically deleted after a certain period of time, while the former type of books typically are not. Some of the things that would make a book unlikely to attract new contributors are:
*The book is hard to find because it has a bad, incorrect, verbose, or esoteric title.
*The book structure is difficult to expand or completely non-existant.
*The current content of the book is so poor that fixing it would take as much work, if not more, then creating a new &quot;better&quot; book.
*The current content of the book is either comprised or arranged in such a way as to be following an arbitrary or external outline, that new contributors may not understand or agree with (for instance, books created as companions to a particular university class).
The key to making a good book that is going to flourish, and not get deleted, is to excercise a good amount of forethought before you create any pages, or write any content. I've written an essay on the topic of creating a new book, and if you are seriously thinking about creating one, I would suggest you read it (or at least part of it): [[User:Whiteknight/New Book Guide]]. Let me know if you have any other questions. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:07, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
===Thanks for the info===
I read your page above and that is what brought me to Rob's page.

== Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1 ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette|Wikibooks gazette home]] | [[Wikibooks talk:Wikibooks gazette|Discuss]] | [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board|Bulletin board]] | [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians|Subscription list]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== Your question about monobook/common.css on the staff lounge ==

Harriska, while I browsing through the staff longe, I noticed your question, ''Then how might I be able to get my style added so that others can see it?'' Administrators are able to edit modules within the MediaWiki namespace. You would be interested in [[MediaWiki:Common.css]]. I am unsure if an administrator would add a change like that, since any Wikibooks user (or reader) with an account could apply it to their own style sheet or any reader with Firefox could download an extension to apply the css style. But it's worth a shot; you may consider asking an administrator at the [[wikibooks:administrators' noticeboard|administrators' noticeboard]] or contacting one individually.

== What is Free Direct Instruction Curriculum and Training (Free DICT) [[File:100%.svg]]==

'''Free Direct Instruction Curriculum and Training''' is an electronic form of curriculum for parents and teachers in Science, Reading, and Math based on the teaching principles of Direct Instruction (DI). It is a scripted curriculum that ensures an efficient teaching of skills and knowledge to mastery.  Don't let the scripted nature of the curriculum give you a sense of simplicity.  There is much research and history in the principles of DI.

Currently there are no finished curriculum products.  Hopefully Science K (Kindergarten Science) will be finished by the end of 2007.  If there is help from the DI community then it could be finished much sooner.

Math will likely be next because there is a great need for quality math instruction at low cost (what better than free!).  It will likely take 2–4 years and has not yet begun.  Again, with help from the DI community, it could be done quicker.

To truly understand and participate in this community, it would be best to review the following sites:
*Definition of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum curriculum]
*Definition of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_instruction Direct Instruction] or DI
*Definition of Free Curriculum - read and extrapolate from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation Free Software Foundation (FSF)].  I realize that FSF is for software but you can use your imagination to extrapolate.
*Definition of [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|GNU Free Documentation Licence]] (GFDL)
*How do I know what makes a DI program really based on DI? [[Direct Instruction Approach Specifications|The DI Approach and Specifications]]

== Direct Instruction Documentation ==
* [[/Instructional Design|Instructional Design and Criteria]]
* [[/Specifications|Direct Instruction Approach Specifications]]

== Benefits of wikibooks [[File:100%.svg]]==
By placing curriculum into an electronic media you gain the following benefits:
*'''Adaptable''' - if a set of instructions is weak, a teacher using the curriculum or a field testing teacher might login and either add to the discussion for the module (see tabs) or make a change in the module for the section. Furthermore, a teacher can make their own copy and customize it for his or her own use.
*'''Portable''' - curriculum and scripted teacher instruction can be placed on a laptop and/or printed out.  No more lugging books around.  Student booklets can be easily printed in black and white or color and easily replaced.
*'''Reduced costs''' - Student books can currently cost $50–$80 each.  Workbooks can currently cost $10 to $20 each.  Printed teacher editions can cost $80 on up.
*'''Durable''' - electronic media can often be put into various types of formats such as a database, web page, or even printed in sections.  Currently, teacher editions are spiral bound which can compress and become difficult to turn pages.
*'''Expandable''' - the use of hyperlinks to get more information on an idea or item can assist teachers in learning the curriculum more completely and quickly.
*'''Format/media''' - using electronic media allows curriculum to be developed in a way that is quicker for the teacher to learn to efficacy, thereby, allowing the teacher more time to work on student errors or more time to &quot;punch up&quot; the curriculum to make more fun.  The use of small icons as cues can assist teachers in learning the curriculum more quickly.
*'''Multimedia''' - the ability for a teacher to use pictures and short videos to make a point.  Also allows the multimedia to include current events thus making the lessons more timely and linked to the students point of view.
*'''Helpful for parents''' - parents of students with disabilities can help pre-teach or firm areas for students with disabilities that need extra practice.  A teacher can print the information/workbooks or direct the parent to the wikibook website.
*'''Transformable''' - can translate the curriculum to different languages and even communication style (i.e. from written to sign language).

== Who Should Contribute [[File:100%.svg]]==
Anyone interested in Direct Instruction curriculum development and the idea of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnu_free_documentation_license GNU Free Documentation License]

The idea of providing schools with free, effective, field tested curriculum will save money and give us a more educated, competitive populace.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This work is a collection that tries to offer all the '''original''' citings provided by taxonomists. It should only contain the original citing given by the author who gave an organism its current binomial name.

Example: ''Chrysosplenium alternifolium'' '''L.''' ''Species Plantarum'' '''1''': 398. 1753
: ''Chrysosplenium alternifolium'' is the binomial name given to a plant. This name is in Latin, and is used by biologists and botanists from all over the world, so there can be no confusion as to what someone is talking about when people from different cultures meet. This binomial name was first given by Carolus Linnaeus. ('''L.''' in this case stands for Linnaeus) This name was given in the year 1753. The description of the plant and the binomial name were published for the first time in the book Species Plantarum, which was indeed written by Carolus Linneaus.

This book tries to collect how Carolus Linnaeus described 'his' ''Chrysosplenium alternifolium''.

==Why is this important?==

Just giving a name to something doesn't mean people know what was meant. In 1753 Linnaeus didn't have the possibility to make photographs of his plants, so he could not show that in his books. The only thing he had were descriptions. Trying to describe what he sees, and then giving that a name. This is still done today. Pictures alone of a new species is not enough to distinguish an organism from another. Some organisms look so much alike, that two pictures might almost seem identical, while taxonomists see the two as different species. So the description '''is''' important.

The problem is, that over the last 250 years, many species were described by hundreds of biologists, botanists, zoologists, etc. Sometimes two people were describing a certain species at almost the same time, giving a species two names. And specialists published their descriptions in magazines, from all over the world. To keep up with all these publications one would need to subscribe to hundreds of magazines to keep up with all new developments. So sometimes people were just unaware of the fact that something was already described before.

Today there's still not one repository, for all these descriptions. And that's where this wiki comes in.

==About Curriculum==
Good curriculum based on scientific evidence is hard to come by.  Most schools don't use it.  Instead they tend to do more of the same.  That's like the old saying: if you take a gallon of shit and a teaspoon of wine everyone knows it's shit.  But if you take a gallon of wine and a teaspoon of shit it's still shit. They still use the same old crappy curriculum and actually hope to get better testing results given more time and money.  It's like saying &quot;Why, if teaching this crappy curriculum 4 days a week isn't getting good results, maybe we should teach it 5 days a week!&quot;

We also need a good free student skill assessment tool - especially for developmentally disabled:
*[[Free ABA Student Skills Assessment]] - Free ABA SSA?
This tools assists parents and educators in tracking skill levels in reading, math, science, language (broken down via Skinner's Verbal Behaviors).

While we're on it, some basic Information on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA):
*[[Free ABA Basics]] 
Mike's starting point for topics:
#Discrete trial teaching, of repetition
#Modeling
#Narration
#Errorless teaching
#Hand-over-hand shaping, prompting and fading... to Mastery
#Teaching from simple to complex (incorporates cognitive aspects)
#Teaching to the interests (of feelings, of senses) of the child
#Turn-taking (of modelling, and social reward, to play)
#Visualization and emotional expression, to social interaction
#Fading primary reinforcement as the child masters and understands (Mastery.) what he/she has to do (Somewhat like #5.)

== What is Free Direct Instruction Reading 1 (Free DIR 1) [[Image:25%.png]]==
Free DIR 1 is the teacher's guide for teaching reading at the first level.  This can be started anywhere between ages 3 and 6 depending on ability of learner.

Each section is numbered and can be taught in one day.  Each section also contains scripted instructions for the teacher.  Most sections contain workbook pages and stories.

== Curriculum Development ==
Some interesting thoughts are from [[SA_NC_Doing_Investigations]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mathematics and science curriculum development has three domains: the cognitive, the so-called conative and the affective. Cognitive development is concerned with knowledge and understanding. In mathematics and science this means key concepts and factual knowledge and these are identified and described in the Revise National Curriculum Statements as Learning Outcomes . Conative development is concerned with the practical and procedural knowledge found in science process skills and mathematical problem solving abilities, also described in the RNCS. Affective development is concerned with emotional, social, cultural and moral development. This is an important, although often forgotten, aspect of learning - and hence teaching. Its importance is recognized by the learning outcomes in various Department of Education policy documents and, importantly, the critical and developmental outcomes that underpin our whole education effort.

What, in the new curriculum, should be taught and learnt in school mathematics and science? Here are some answers to the question, in one possible direction. The kind of mathematics and science that needs to be taught in schools must give learners a confident grasp of content knowledge and understanding the procedural skills to know how mathematicians and scientists work and appropriate attitudes to mathematics and science and their value and use in society and economy. This resource book illustrates the curricular relevance of independent investigation in achieving these teaching and learning goals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Simplify and redesign DI Rubric ==
Why? Because currently it is copyrighted and we need to copyleft it.  Also, it is full of jargon and very long.  As a historical document, the rubric is great but I think it can be improved upon with better examples (let's use science!), and de-jargoned a little.  Also, cut out historical and immediately non-pertinent parts - make them links or refer to the actual rubric.

This version will have a different name because it will be different:
#DI Approach
#DI Conventions
#DI Designs
#DI Formula
#DI Methods
#DI Principles
#DI Rules
#DI Schema
#DI Specifications
#DI System

Here are the various definitions of each word:
*approach - method used or steps taken in setting about a task, problem -  method used in dealing with or accomplishing
*conventions - A practice or procedure widely observed in a group -A widely used and accepted device or technique
*designs - To formulate a plan for; devise - To plan out in systematic, usually graphic form - To create or contrive for a particular purpose or effect - To have as a goal or purpose; intend - To create or execute in an artistic or highly skilled manner
*forumla - a set form of words, as for stating or declaring something definitely or authoritatively, for indicating procedure to be followed
*methods - A means or manner of procedure, especially a regular and systematic way of accomplishing something - Orderly arrangement of parts or steps to accomplish an end - The procedures and techniques characteristic of a particular discipline or field of knowledge
*principles - A basic or essential qualities or elements determining intrinsic nature or characteristic behavior: the principle of self-preservation - rules or laws concerning the functioning of natural phenomena or mechanical processes: the principle of jet propulsion. 
*rules - A usual, customary, or generalized course of action or behavior
*schema - a diagram, plan, or scheme - an underlying organizational pattern or structure; conceptual framework
*specifications - a detailed description or assessment of requirements, dimensions, materials, etc., as of a proposed building, machine, bridge, etc.
*system - an assemblage or combination of things or parts forming a complex or unitary whole - an ordered and comprehensive assemblage of facts, principles, doctrines, or the like in a particular field of knowledge or thought - due method or orderly manner of arrangement or procedure

Here are opinions on each:
*Approach - I like this one.  It is a little vague but all encompassing
*Conventions - DI isn't necessarily widely accepted but the parts and pieces that make up DI is pretty widely accepted within the DI community
*Designs - more for various ways to implement, not a general overview of what makes a DI program a DI program
*Formula - kind of neat because it sounds &quot;sciencey&quot; - but I'm not an authority so I don't want to represent all of DI with my words
*Methods - systematic, orderly, procedures and technics - I like this
*Principles - essential qualities of a natural phenomena - hmmm, learning to read is not done &quot;naturally.&quot;  If anything, it needs to be taught systematically, discretely.
*Rules - hmm, a general way to do things - just doesn't sound good
*Schema - don't really have a diagram overall but there are many parts and peices that are diagramed - such as error correction procedures
*Specifications - description of requirements - usually used for buildings and machines but hey, we're building thinking people, right?
*System - combination of things that make a comprehensive thing.  Hmmm.

Here my top 3:
#Approach
#Methods
#Specifications

Compare to the definitions:
*approach - method used or steps taken in setting about a task, problem -  method used in dealing with or accomplishing
*methods - A means or manner of procedure, especially a regular and systematic way of accomplishing something - Orderly arrangement of parts or steps to accomplish an end - The procedures and techniques characteristic of a particular discipline or field of knowledge
*specifications - a detailed description or assessment of requirements, dimensions, materials, etc., as of a proposed building, machine, bridge, etc.</text>

__TOC__
== What is Free Direct Instruction Reading 1 (Free DIR 1) Image:25%.svg==
Free DIR 1 is the teacher's guide for teaching reading at the first level.  This can be started anywhere between ages 3 1/2 and 6 depending on ability of learner.

Each section is numbered and can be taught in one day.  Each section also contains scripted instructions for the teacher.  Most sections contain workbook pages and stories.

This program is probably not for children that have been taught to read but make many mistakes.  It is difficult to &quot;unlearn&quot; some reading methods in order to learn phonics.  Such conflicting methods include guessing at words or guessing the sentence or words from a picture.  It could be that guessing at words takes less effort than actually trying to sound them out so it is difficult to replace the habit.  Try Corrective Reading by SRA at that point.

== How do I know the program is working? ==
If your student(s) are progressing and mistakes are low (less than 10%), then you are doing well.  If there are more than 10% mistakes there is a problem with either your presentation or with the verbage in the actual lesson.  If the student has a learning disability, then some areas may need more firming or practice.  Some fast learner can get a new concept in about 3 trials.  Some slower learners can take up to 1000.  Then there are many kids in between.

If typical students are making too many mistakes and progressing slowly and you know your presentation is good, try the discussion group to see if there are suggestions for improvement in specific areas.  The talk tab at the top can get you there.  There is a talk tab for each lesson.  If you found a great solution that adheres to the Direct Instruction Rubric then either suggest it at the talk tab and/or make a modification to the actual lesson.

== What order do I teach in? ==
You will definitely want to teach this curriculum in order.  Each lesson builds on the last.

{{info|Before reading this chapter, students should know the terms ''vector'', ''scalar'', and ''matrix''. These terms are discussed in [[Linear Algebra]].}}

== Vectors and Scalars ==

A '''scalar''' is a single number value, such as 3, 5, or 10. A '''vector''' is an ordered set of scalars.

A vector is typically described as a matrix with a row or column size of 1. A vector with a column size of 1 is a '''row vector''', and a vector with a row size of 1 is a '''column vector'''.

{{eqn|Column Vector}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}a \\ b\\ c\\ \vdots\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; 

{{eqn|Row Vector}}
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}a &amp; b &amp; c &amp;\cdots\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

A &quot;common vector&quot; is another name for a column vector, and this book will simply use the word &quot;vector&quot; to refer to a common vector.

== Vector Spaces ==

A vector space is a set of vectors and two operations (addition and multiplication, typically) that follow a number of specific rules. We will typically denote vector spaces with a capital-italic letter: ''V'', for instance. A space ''V'' is a vector space if all the following requirements are met. We will be using x and y as being arbitrary vectors in ''V''. We will also use c and d as arbitrary scalar values. There are 10 requirements in all:

Given: &lt;math&gt;x, y \in V&lt;/math&gt;
#There is an operation called &quot;Addition&quot; (signified with a &quot;+&quot; sign) between two vectors, x + y, such that if both the operands are in ''V'', then the result is also in ''V''.
#The addition operation is commutative for all elements in ''V''. 
#The addition operation is associative for all elements in ''V''.
#There is a unique '''neutral element''', &amp;phi;, in ''V'', such that x + &amp;phi; = x. This is also called a '''zero''' element.
#For every x in ''V'', then there is a negative element -x in ''V'' such that -x + x = &amp;phi;.
#&lt;math&gt;cx \in V&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;c(x + y) = cx + cy&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;(c + d)x = cx + dx&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;c(dx) = cdx&lt;/math&gt;
#1 &amp;times; x = x

Some of these rules may seem obvious, but that's only because they have been generally accepted, and have been taught to people since they were children.

== Scalar Product ==

A scalar product is a special type of operation that acts on two vectors, and returns a scalar result. Scalar products are denoted as an ordered pair between angle-brackets: &lt;x,y&gt;. A scalar product between vectors must satisfy the following four rules:

#&lt;math&gt;\langle x, x\rangle \ge 0, \quad \forall x \in V&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\langle x, x\rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;,  only if x = 0
#&lt;math&gt;\langle x, y\rangle = \langle y, x\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\langle x, cy_1 + dy_2\rangle = c\langle x, y_1\rangle + d\langle x, y_2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

If an operation satisifes all these requirements, then it is a scalar product.

=== Examples ===

One of the most common scalar products is the '''dot product''', that is discussed commonly in [[Linear Algebra]]

== Norm ==

The '''norm''' is an important scalar quantity that indicates the magnitude of the vector. Norms of a vector are typically denoted as &lt;math&gt;\|x\|&lt;/math&gt;. To be a norm, an operation must satisfy the following four conditions:

#&lt;math&gt;\|x\| \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\|x\| = 0&lt;/math&gt; only if x = 0.
#&lt;math&gt;\|cx\| = |c|\|x\|&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\|x + y\| \le \|x\| + \|y\|&lt;/math&gt;

A vector is called '''normal''' if it's norm is 1. A normal vector is sometimes also referred to as a '''unit vector'''. Both notations will be used in this book. To make a vector normal, but keep it pointing in the same direction, we can divide the vector by its norm:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \frac{x}{\|x\|}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Examples ===

One of the most common norms is the '''cartesian norm''', that is defined as the square-root of the sum of the squares:

:&lt;math&gt;\|x\| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Unit Vector ===

A vector is said to be a '''unit vector''' if the norm of that vector is 1.

== Orthogonality ==

Two vectors x and y are said to be '''orthogonal''' if the scalar product of the two is equal to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x,y\rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Two vectors are said to be '''orthonormal''' if their scalar product is zero, and both vectors are unit vectors.

== Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality ==

The cauchy-schwartz inequality is an important result, and relates the norm of a vector to the scalar product:

:&lt;math&gt;|\langle x,y\rangle | \leq \|x\|\|y\|&lt;/math&gt;

== Metric (Distance) ==

The distance between two vectors in the vector space ''V'', called the '''metric''' of the two vectors, is denoted by d(x, y). A metric operation must satisfy the following four conditions:

#&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; only if x = y
#&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = d(y, x)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) \le d(x,z) + d(z, y)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Examples ===

A common form of metric is the distance between points a and b in the cartesian plane:

:&lt;math&gt;d(a, b)_{{cartesian}} = \sqrt{(x_a - x_b)^2 + (y_a - y_b)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

{{info|Before reading this chapter, students should know how to take the ''transpose'' of a matrix, and the ''determinant'' of a matrix. Students should also know what the ''inverse'' of a matrix is, and how to calculate it. These topics are covered in [[Linear Algebra]].}}
== Linear Independance ==

A set of vectors &lt;math&gt;V = {v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n}&lt;/math&gt; are said to be linearly dependant on one another if any vector v from the set can be constructed from a linear combination of the other vectors in the set. Given the following linear equation:

:&lt;math&gt;a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \cdots + a_nv_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The set of vectors V is linearly independent only if all the a coefficients are zero. If we combine the v vectors together into a single row vector:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{V} = [v_1 v_2 \cdots v_n]&lt;/math&gt;

And we combine all the a coefficients into a single column vector:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a} = [a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n]^T&lt;/math&gt;

We have the following linear equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{V}\hat{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

We can show that this equation can only be satisifed for &lt;math&gt;\hat{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the matrix &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}&lt;/math&gt; must be invertable:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{V}^{-1}\hat{V}\hat{a} = \hat{V}^{-1}0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Remember that for the matrix to be invertable, the determinate must be non-zero.

=== Non-Square Matrix V ===

If the matrix &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}&lt;/math&gt; is not square, then the determinate can not be taken, and therefore the matrix is not invertable. To solve this problem, we can premultiply by the transpose matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{V}^T\hat{V}\hat{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

And then the square matrix &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}^T\hat{V}&lt;/math&gt; must be invertable:

:&lt;math&gt;(\hat{V}^T\hat{V})^{-1}\hat{V}^T\hat{V}\hat{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

=== Rank ===

The rank of a matrix is the largest number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix.

To determine the Rank, typically the matrix is reduced to row-echelon form. From the reduced form, the number of non-zero rows, or the number of non-zero columns (whichever is smaller) is the rank of the matrix.

If we multiply two matrices A and B, and the result is C:

:&lt;math&gt;AB = C&lt;/math&gt;

Then the rank of C is the minimum value between the ranks A and B:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Rank}(C) = \operatorname{min}[\operatorname{Rank}(A), \operatorname{Rank}(B)]&lt;/math&gt;

== Span ==

A '''Span''' of a set of vectors ''V'' is the set of all vectors that can be created by a linear combination of the vectors.

== Basis ==

A '''basis''' is a set of linearly-independent vectors that span the entire vector space.

=== Basis Expansion ===

If we have a vector &lt;math&gt;y \in V&lt;/math&gt;, and ''V'' has basis vectors &lt;math&gt;{v_1 v_2 \cdots v_n}&lt;/math&gt;, by definition, we can write y in terms of a linear combination of the basis vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \cdots + a_nv_n = y&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{V}\hat{a} = y&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}&lt;/math&gt; is invertable, the answer is apparent, but if &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}&lt;/math&gt; is not invertable, then we can perform the following technique:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{V}^T\hat{V}\hat{a} = \hat{V}^Ty&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a} = (\hat{V}^T\hat{V})^{-1}\hat{V}^Ty&lt;/math&gt;

And we call the quantity &lt;math&gt;(\hat{V}^T\hat{V})^{-1}\hat{V}^T&lt;/math&gt; the '''left-pseudoinverse''' of &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Change of Basis ===

Frequently, it is useful to change the basis vectors to a different set of vectors that span the set, but have different properties. If we have a space ''V'', with basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{V}&lt;/math&gt; and a vector in ''V'' called x, we can use the new basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{W}&lt;/math&gt; to represent x:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \sum_{i = 0}^na_iv_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n b_jw_j&lt;/math&gt;

or,

:&lt;math&gt;x = \hat{V}\hat{a} = \hat{W}\hat{b}&lt;/math&gt;

If V is invertable, then the solution to this problem is simple.

== Grahm-Schmidt Orthogonalization ==

If we have a set of basis vectors that are not orthogonal, we can use a process known as '''orthogonalization''' to produce a new set of basis vectors for the same space that are orthogonal:

:Given: &lt;math&gt;\hat{V} = {x_1 v_2 \cdots v_n}&lt;/math&gt;
:Find the new basis &lt;math&gt;\hat{W} = {w_1 w_2 \cdots w_n}&lt;/math&gt;
:Such that &lt;math&gt;\langle w_i, w_j\rangle = 0\quad\forall i, j&lt;/math&gt; 

We can define the vectors as follows:

#&lt;math&gt;w_1 = v_1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;w_m = v_m - \sum_{i = 1}^{m-1}\frac{\langle v_m, u_i\rangle }{\langle u_i, u_i\rangle }u_i&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the vectors produced by this technique are orthogonal to each other, but they are not necessarily orthonormal. To make the ''w'' vectors orthonormal, you must divide each one by its norm:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{w} = \frac{w}{\|w\|}&lt;/math&gt;

== Reciprocal Basis ==

A Reciprocal basis is a special type of basis that is related to the original basis. The reciprocal basis &lt;math&gt;\hat{W}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{W} = [\hat{V}^T]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

{{info|Some sections in this chapter require that the student know how to take the ''derivative'' of a function with respect to a particular variable. This is commonly known as ''partial differentiation'', and is covered in [[Calculus]].}}
== Linear Transformations ==

A linear transformation is a matrix M that operates on a vector in space ''V'', and results in a vector in a different space ''W''. We can define a transformation as such:

:&lt;math&gt;T:V\to W&lt;/math&gt;

In the above equation, we say that ''V'' is the '''domain space''' of the transformation, and ''W'' is the '''range space''' of the transformation. Also, we can use a &quot;function notation&quot; for the transformation, and write it as:

:&lt;math&gt;M(x) = Mx = y&lt;/math&gt; 

Where x is a vector in ''V'', and y is a vector in ''W''. To be a linear transformation, the principle of superposition must hold for the transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;M(av_1 + bv_2) = aM(v_1) + bM(v_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Where a and b are arbitrary scalars.

== Null Space ==

The Nullspace of an equation is the set of all vectors x for which the following relationship holds:

:&lt;math&gt;Mx = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Where M is a linear transformation matrix. Depending on the size and rank of M, there may be zero or more vectors in the nullspace. Here are a few rules to remember:

#If the matrix M is invertable, then there is no nullspace.
#The number of vectors in the nullspace (N) is the difference between the rank(R) of the matrix and the number of columns(C) of the matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;N = R - C&lt;/math&gt;

If the matrix is in row-eschelon form, the number of vectors in the nullspace is given by the number of rows without a leading 1 on the diagonal. For every column where there is not a leading one on the diagonal, the nullspace vectors can be obtained by placing a negative one in the leading position for that column vector.

We denote the nullspace of a matrix A as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}\{A\}&lt;/math&gt;

== Linear Equations ==

If we have a set of linear equations in terms of variables x, scalar coefficients a, and a scalar result b, we can write the system in matrix notation as such:

:&lt;math&gt;Ax = b&lt;/math&gt;

Where x  is a m &amp;times; 1 vector, b is an n &amp;times; 1 vector, and A is an n &amp;times; m matrix. Therefore, this is a system of n equations with m unknown variables. There are 3 possibilities:

#If Rank(A) is not equal to Rank([A b]), there is no solution
#If Rank(A) = Rank([A b]) = n, there is exactly one solution
#If Rank(A) = Rank([A b]) &lt; n, there are infinitely many solutions.

=== Complete Solution ===

The complete solution of a linear equation is given by the sum of the '''homogeneous solution''', and the '''particular solution'''. The homogeneous solution is the nullspace of the transformation, and the particular solution is the values for x that satisfy the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;A(x) = b&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A(x_h + x_p) = b&lt;/math&gt;

Where

:&lt;math&gt;x_h&lt;/math&gt; is the homogeneous solution, and is the nullspace of A that satisfies the equation &lt;math&gt;A(x_h) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_p&lt;/math&gt; is the particular solution that satisfies the equation &lt;math&gt;A(x_p) = b&lt;/math&gt;

=== Minimum Norm Solution ===

If Rank(A) = Rank([A b]) &lt; n, then there are infinitely many solutions to the linear equation. In this situation, the solution called the '''minimum norm''' solution must be found. This solution represents the &quot;best&quot; solution to the problem. To find the minimum norm solution, we must minimize the norm of x subject to the constraint of:

:&lt;math&gt;Ax - b = 0&lt;/math&gt;

There are a number of methods to minimize a value according to a given constraint, and we will talk about them later.

== Least-Squares Curve Fit ==

If Rank(A) doesnt equal Rank([A b]), then the linear equation has no solution. However, we can find the solution which is the closest. This &quot;best fit&quot; solution is known as the Least-Squares curve fit. 

We define an error quantity E, such that:

:&lt;math&gt;E = Ax - b \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

Our job then is to find the minimum value for the norm of E:

:&lt;math&gt;\|E\|^2 = \|Ax - b\|^2 = &lt;Ax -b, Ax-b&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

We do this by differentiating with respect to x, and setting the result to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \|E\|^2}{\partial x} = 2A'(Ax - b) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Solving, we get our result:

{{info|Before reading this chapter, the student should know what ''minimization'' is, and how to minimize a function. Students should also know ''partial differentiation'', and how to solve systems of equations.}}
== Khun-Tucker Theorem ==

The Khun-Tucker Theorem is a method for minimizing a function f(x) under the constraint g(x). We can define the theorem as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;L(x) = f(x) + \langle \Lambda, g(x)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

Where &amp;Lambda; is the ''lagrangian vector'', and &lt; , &gt; denotes the '''scalar product''' operation. We will discuss scalar products more later. If we differentiate this equation with respect to x first, and then with respect to &amp;Lambda;, we get the following two equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L(x)}{\partial x} = x + A\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L(x)}{\partial \Lambda} = Ax - b&lt;/math&gt;

We have the final result:

:&lt;math&gt;x = A^T[AA^T]^{-1}b&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Analysis}}

== Projection ==

The projection of a vector &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; onto the vector space &lt;math&gt;W \in V&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum distance between v and the space ''W''. In other words, we need to minimize the distance between vector v, and an arbitrary vector &lt;math&gt;w \in W&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\|w - v\|^2 = \|\hat{W}\hat{a} - v\|^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \|\hat{W} \hat{a} - v\|^2}{\partial \hat{a}} = \frac{\partial \langle \hat{W}\hat{a} - v, \hat{W}\hat{a} - v\rangle }{\partial \hat{a}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

{{eqn|Projection onto space W}}
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a} = (\hat{W}^T\hat{W})^{-1}\hat{W}^Tv&lt;/math&gt;

For every vector &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; there exists a vector &lt;math&gt;w \in W&lt;/math&gt; called the projection of v onto W such that &lt;v-w, p&gt; = 0, where p is an arbitrary element of ''W''.  

=== Orthogonal Complement ===

:&lt;math&gt;w^\perp = {x \in V: \langle x, y \rangle = 0, \forall y \in W}&lt;/math&gt;

== Distance between v and W ==

The distance between &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; and the space ''W'' is given as the minimum distance between v and an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;w \in W&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial d(v, w)}{\partial \hat{a}} = \frac{\partial\|v - \hat{W}\hat{a}\|}{\partial \hat{a}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

== Intersections ==

Given two vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'', what is the overlapping area between the two? We define an arbitrary vector z that is a component of both ''V'', and ''W'':

:&lt;math&gt;z = \hat{V} \hat{a} = \hat{W} \hat{b}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{V} \hat{a} - \hat{W} \hat{b} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\hat{a} \\ \hat{b}\end{bmatrix}= \mathcal{N}([\hat{v} - \hat{W}])&lt;/math&gt;

Where N is the nullspace.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Analysis}}

== Linear Spaces ==

Linear Spaces are like Vector Spaces, but are more general. We will define Linear Spaces, and then use that definition later to define Function Spaces.

If we have a space X, elements in that space f and g, and scalars a and b, the following rules must hold for X to be a linear space:

#&lt;math&gt;f + g \in X&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;f + g = g + f&lt;/math&gt;
#There is a null element &amp;phi; such that &amp;phi; ''+ f = f''. &lt;math&gt; \phi \in X&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;f \in X, -f \in X&lt;/math&gt;
# ''f + (-f) ='' &amp;phi;

      <comment>/* Continuity */ missing &quot;;&quot; added to format &amp;epsilon; correct.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Analysis}}

== Function Space ==

A function space is a linear space where all the elements of the space are functions. A function space that has a norm operation is known as a '''normed function space'''. The spaces we consider will all be normed.

== Continuity ==

''f(x)'' is continuous at ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' if, for every &amp;epsilon; ''&gt; 0'' there exists a &amp;delta;(&amp;epsilon;) ''&gt; 0'' such that ''|f(x) - f(x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)| &lt;'' &amp;epsilon; when ''|x - x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt;'' &amp;delta;(&amp;epsilon;).

== Common Function Spaces ==

Here is a listing of some common function spaces. This is not an exhaustive list.

=== C Space ===

The ''C'' function space is the set of all functions that are continuous.

The metric for ''C'' space is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x, y)_{L_2} = \max|f(x) - g(x)|&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the metric of ''sin(x)'' and ''cos(x)'':

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(sin(x), cos(x))_{L_2} = \sqrt{2}, x = \frac{3\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

=== C&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; Space ===

The ''C&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the set of all continuous functions for which the first ''p'' derivatives are also continuous. If &lt;math&gt; p = \infty&lt;/math&gt; the function is called &quot;infinitely continuous. The set &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all such functions. Some examples of functions that are infinitely continuous are exponentials, sinusoids, and polynomials.

=== L Space ===

The ''L'' space is the set of all functions that are finitely integrable over a given interval ''[a, b]''. 

''f(x)'' is in ''L(a, b)'' if:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b |f(x)|dx &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

=== L &lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; Space ===

The ''L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' space is the set of all functions that are finitely integrable over a given interval ''[a, b]'' when raised to the power ''p'':

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b |f(x)|^pdx &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

Most importantly for engineering is the ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' space, or the set of functions that are &quot;square integrable&quot;.

==1. Have the Trees Honor.==
{{ay_prerequisite|Nature|Trees}}
==2. Collect, identify, press, and mount leaves of 35 different species of trees.==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Leaf_collection}}

==3. Separately collect, press, mount, and label specimens that demonstrate the following terms:==
;a. Serrate: The margins of the leaf have forward-pointing teeth. (cherry)
;b. Doubly serrate: Each serration on the margin of the leaf has smaller serrations of its own. (elm)
;c. Entire: The entire margin of the leaf is smooth. (sassafras, pawpaw, osage orange)
;d. Crenate: The margins of the leaf have rounded teeth. (beech)
;e. Dentate: The margins of the leaf have symmetrical teeth. (chestnut)
;f. Lobe: The margins of the leaf have large, smooth indentations that do not go all the way to the centerline.  (oaks)
;g. Incise: The margins of the leaf are deeply and sharply cut. (Maples)
;h. Whorled: Three or more leaves are attached to a single node on a branch or stem.
;i. Opposite: Leaves are paired on a node on opposite sides of the stem. (sumacs, hickorys, walnut)
;j. Alternate: Only a single leaf grows from a node.  
;k. Pinnately compound: A leaf consisting of multiple leaflets. (sumac, locust)
;l. Triple compound (if possible): Like pinnately compound leaves except the leaflets have leaflets of their own. (devil's walking stick, mimosa).

[[Image:Leaf morphology no title.png|thumb|700px]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==4a. Describe the advantages in using the Latin or scientific names.==
[[Image:Maclura pomifera2.jpg|thumb|180px|Osage Orange]]
Latins names (such as ''Quercus alba'' which is white oak) are useful because they are absolutely unique for each species.  Thus, the Latin name can be used in international settings without ambiguity.  Sometimes a given species will go by one name on one region, and by another name in another region.  

For example, the Osage-orange (''Maclura pomifera'') is also known as mock orange, hedge-apple, horse-apple, hedge ball, bois d'arc, bodark (in Texas), and bow wood. A common slang term for it is also monkey brain or monkey ball due to its brainlike appearance.  

Bows are made from many types of wood, including yew and red elm, so &quot;bow wood&quot; could mean any of these.  However, ''Maclura pomifera'' means only one thing.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==4b. Of what use are the two parts of a scientific name?==
The first part of the scientific name is the genus, and the second part is the species.  We have already discussed ''Quercus alba'' - the white oak, so let's expand on that.  There are many, many different species of oak, and they are all in the genus ''Quercus''.  All these trees produce acorns, and they are closely related to one another.  Grouping them into a common genus recognizes their similarities, while separating them by species recognizes their differences.

==5. Name six families of trees in the angiosperm class and three families in the gymnosperm class.==
===Angiosperms===
;Beech Family: Beeches, Chestnuts, Chinkapins, and Oaks
;Birch Family: Alders, Birches, Hornbeams, and Hazelnuts
;Cashew Family: Smoketree and Sumacs
;Custard-Apple Family: Pawpaw and Pond apple
;Elm Family: Elms and Hackberries
;Horsechestnut Family: Buckeyes and Horsechestnuts
;Laurel Family: Laurels, Redbay, and Sassafras
;Legume Family: Acacias, Redbuds, and Locusts
;Magnolia Family: Magnolias, and Yellow (Tulip) Poplar
;Maple Family: Maples
;Mulberry Family: Figs, Mulberries, and Osage Oranges
;Palm Family: Coconuts, Dates, Palms, and Palmettos
;Rose Family: Apples, Peaches, Pears, and Plums
;Sycamore Family: Sycamores
;Walnut Family: Hickories, and Walnuts
;Willow Family: Aspens, Poplars, and Willows

===Gymnosperms===
;Cedar or Cypress Family: Cedars, Cypresses, Junipers
;Pine Family: Firs, Hemlocks, Pines, and Spruces
;Redwood Family: Redwood, Giant Sequoia, Baldcypress
;Yew Family: Yews, Torreyas

==6. Know and describe the function of leaves in the life of a tree.==
A leaf is the part of a plant specialized for photosynthesis. For this purpose, a leaf is typically flat and thin, to expose the cells containing chloroplast to light over a broad area, and to allow light to penetrate fully into the tissues. Leaves can store food and water.

==7. Name the families of trees in your area which have opposite leaves.==
This is a partial list of trees with opposite leaves.  There may be more in your area.

Maples, most Dogwoods, Ashes, Buckeyes, Buckthorn, Redwood, Paulownia, Lilac, Viburnum, Juniper, Black Mangrove, Olive, Piratebush, Boxwood, Southern Catalpa, Eucalyptus (gum), Pomegranate, and Elderberry.

==8. Define the following terms:==
;a. Stipule: Outgrowths on either side of the petiole.
;b. Petiole: A leaf's stem.
;c. Blade: The flat portion of a leaf, the blade may be simple or be divided into leaflets (compound).
;d. Pitch: Pitch is the name for any of a number of highly viscous liquids which appear solid. Pitch can be made from petroleum products or plants.  Pitch produced from plants is also known as resin. 
;e. Heartwood:  Examination of the cross-section of a log will reveal dark wood near the center, and light-colored wood near the bark.  The dark wood near the center is heartwood.  As a tree increases in age and diameter an inner portion of the sapwood becomes inactive and finally ceases to function, as the cells die. This inert or dead portion is called heartwood.
;f. Sapwood: Sapwood is comparatively new wood, comprising living cells in the growing tree. All wood in a tree is first formed as sapwood. Its principal functions are to conduct water from the roots to the leaves and to store up and give back according to the season the food prepared in the leaves.
;g. Springwood: The inner portion of a growth ring is formed early in the growing season, when growth is comparatively rapid (hence the wood is less dense) and is known as &quot;early wood&quot; or &quot;spring wood&quot;
;h. Summerwood: The outer portion of the growth ring is the &quot;late wood&quot; (and has sometimes been termed &quot;summerwood&quot;, often being produced in the summer, though sometimes in the autumn) and is more dense.
;i. Annual ring: Annual rings can be seen in a horizontal cross section cut through the trunk of a tree. Visible rings result from the change in growth speed through the seasons of the year, thus one ring usually marks the passage of one year in the life of the tree. The rings are more visible in temperate zones, where the seasons differ more markedly.
;j. Cambium: A layer of cells just under the bark of a tree.  This layer is only one cell deep, and it produces all the new wood in a tree.
;k. Xylem: A vein in a tree that brings water from the roots into the leaf.
;l. Phloem: A vein in a tree that moves sap out, the latter containing the glucose (a form of sugar) produced by photosynthesis in the leaf.

==9. What families of trees have:==
;a. Thorns: Hawthorn, locust
;b. Catkins: Oak, birch, willow, alder, poplar
;c. Winged seeds: Maple, ash, elm
;d. Acorns: Oak
;e. Pods: Locust (and other legumes), mimosa
;f. Capsules: Sourwood, paulownia, eucalyptus
;h. Berries: Yew, mulberry, elderberry, nannyberry
;g. Nuts: Hickory, beech, birch, walnut

==10. Identify ten deciduous trees by their “winter” characteristics, (features other than leaves) such as twig and bud, characteristic form, and growth habits.==
===By bark===
The bark of many trees is easily recognizable, and in some cases, using the bark to identify the tree is easier than using the leaves. 

[[Image:American_sycamore_bark.jpg|thumb|right|American Sycamore]]
;Sycamore: The bark of a sycamore tree could best be described as &quot;patchy.&quot;  Large scales of the outer brown, gray, and white bark flake off to reveal a green bark beneath.  Sycamores are most often found near streams, rivers, ponds, or other sources of water.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

[[Image:Betula papyrifera1.jpg|thumb|right|The bark of a Paper Birch]]
;Paper Birch: The bark of the paper birch is white, commonly brightly so, flaking in fine horizontal strips, and often with small black marks and scars. It is papery, with thin wisps peeling off.  The tears in the bark run laterally, and there are characteristic &quot;dotted lines&quot; running in the same direction.  
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
[[Image:IN Hoot Woods.jpg|thumb|right|The bark of a Beech]]
;Beech: Beech trees are similar to birch trees, but the bark does not peel off in paper-thin wisps.  Also, the color is a bit more grey, and it lacks the horizontal &quot;dotted lines&quot; found on the birch.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

[[Image:Flowering Dogwood Cornus florida Trunk Bark 3100px.jpg|thumb|right|The bark of a Flowering Dogwood]]
;Dogwood: The bark of a mature dogwood breaks up into small scales.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

;Hackberry: The bark of the hackberry tree is warty.  These warts are typically .25 inches (6 mm) in diameter, and arranged in groups on the tree's trunk.

;Hornbeam: The bark of the hornbeam (also known as ironwood) looks distinctively muscular.  It is smooth and looks very much like the limb of a muscular human.  Indeed it sometimes goes by the name &quot;musclewood&quot; for this very reason.

[[Image:Hickory07103.jpg|thumb|right|Shagbark Hickory]]
;Shagbark Hickory: Mature Shagbarks are easy to recognize because, as their name implies, they have shaggy bark. This character is however only found on mature trees; young specimens have smooth bark.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===By buds and twigs===
Virginia Tech has a website at http://www.cnr.vt.edu/DENDRO/DENDROLOGY/syllabus/twigkey/location.htm which will aid you in identifying trees by their twigs.  The arrangement and structure of buds on a twig are unique to many species, and therefore useful as an identification tool.  In some cases, identification by twigs is more accurate than by leaves.  The following trees are among the easiest to identify by their twigs:

;Alder:
;Maple:
;Apple:
;Hawthorn:
;Black Locust:
;Honey Locust:

===By Characteristic Form===
Some trees have a unique shape.  If you learn to recognize trees by their shape, it is possible to identify them even from a great distance. 
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Llandegfan Elm tree.jpg|Elm Tree
Image:Willow1.jpg|Willow
Image:Populus nigra Italica(02).jpg|Lombardy Poplar
&lt;/gallery&gt;
;Elm: Elm trees are generally vase shaped
;Willow: Note the dense, thin branches in the top of the tree.
;Lombardy Poplar: Lombardy Poplars are slender, columnar tree with branches pointed sharply upward.

===By Growth Habits===
Some trees have preferred habitats.  The American Sycamore, for example, tends to grow near plentiful water sources. Because of its distinctive bark, it is usually easier to find creeks by finding the sycamore than it is to find the sycamore by finding a creek.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Analysis}}

The ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' space is very important to engineers, because functions in this space do not need to be continuous. Many discontinuous engineering functions, such as the delta (impulse) function, the unit step function, and other discontinuous functions are part of this space.

== L2 Functions ==

A large number of functions qualify as ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' functions, including uncommon, discontinuous, piece-wise, and other functions. A function which, over a finite range, has a finite number of discontinuities is an ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' function. For example, a unit step and an impulse function are both ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' functions. Also, other functions useful in signal analysis, such as square waves, triangle waves, wavelets, and other functions are ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' functions. 

In practice, most physical systems have a finite amount of noise associated with them. Noisy signals and random signals, if finite, are also ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' functions: this makes analysis of those functions using the techniques listed below easy.

== Null Function ==

The null functions of ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the set of all functions &amp;phi; in ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' that satisfy the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b |\phi(x)|^2dx = 0&lt;/math&gt; 

for all ''a'' and ''b''.

== Norm ==

The ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' norm is defined as follows:

{{eqn|L2 Norm}}
:&lt;math&gt;\|f(x)\|_{L_2} = \sqrt{\int_a^b |f(x)|^2dx}&lt;/math&gt;

If the norm of the function is 1, the function is normal.

We can show that the derivative of the norm squared is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \|x\|^2}{\partial x} = 2x&lt;/math&gt;

== Scalar Product ==

The scalar product in ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' space is defined as follows:

{{eqn|L2 Scalar Product}}
:&lt;math&gt;\langle f(x), g(x)\rangle_{L_2} = \int_a^bf(x)g(x)dx&lt;/math&gt; 

If the scalar product of two functions is zero, the functions are orthogonal.

We can show that given coefficient matrices ''A'' and ''B'', and variable ''x'', the derivative of the scalar product can be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\langle Ax, Bx\rangle = A^TBx + B^TAx&lt;/math&gt;

We can recognize this as the product rule of differentiation. Generalizing, we can say that:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\langle f(x), g(x)\rangle = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

We can also say that the derivative of a matrix ''A'' times a vector ''x'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}Ax = A^T&lt;/math&gt;

== Metric ==

The metric of two functions (we will not call it the &quot;distance&quot; here, because that word has no meaning in a function space) will be denoted with &amp;rho;''(x,y)''. We can define the metric of an ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' function as follows:

{{eqn|L2 Metric}}
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x, y)_{L_2} = \sqrt{\int_a^b|f(x) - g(x)|^2dx}&lt;/math&gt; 

== Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality ==

The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality still holds for ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' functions, and is restated here:

:&lt;math&gt;|\langle f(x), g(x)\rangle| \le \|f\|\|g\|&lt;/math&gt;

== Linear Independence ==

A set of functions in ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are linearly independent if:

:&lt;math&gt;a_1f_1(x) + a_2f_2(x) + \cdots + a_nf_n(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

If and only if all the ''a'' coefficients are 0.

== Grahm-Schmidt Orthogonalization ==

The Grahm-Schmidt technique that we discussed earlier still works with functions, and we can use it to form a set of linearly independent, orthogonal functions in ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

For a set of functions &amp;phi;, we can make a set of orthogonal functions &amp;psi; that space the same space but are orthogonal to one another:

{{eqn|Grahm-Schmidt Orthogonalization}}
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 = \phi_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_i = \phi_i - \sum_{n=1}^{i-1}\frac{\langle \psi_n, \phi_{i}\rangle}{\langle \psi_n, \psi_n\rangle}\psi_n&lt;/math&gt;

== Basis ==

The ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an infinite-basis set, which means that any basis for the ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' set will require an infinite number of basis functions. To prove that an infinite set of orthogonal functions is a basis for the ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' space, we need to show that the null function is the only function in ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' that is orthogonal to all the basis functions. If the null function is the only function that satisfies this relationship, then the set is a basis set for ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

By definition, we can express any function in ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' as a linear sum of the basis elements. If we have basis elements &amp;phi;, we can define any other function &amp;psi; as a linear sum:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n\phi_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;

We will explore this important result in the section on [[../Fourier Series/]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Unless you are already very familiar with the trees in your area, you will need to get a field guide on trees for this activity.  Illustrating all the tree species you may encounter is well beyond the scope of a single chapter in an answer book!

It is best to collect the leaves in the spring or early summer before insects and weather have had a chance to damage them, but if you prefer, you can try to collect them in the fall when the colors change.

When you go out collecting, take the field guide with you.  It is important to identify the leaves as you collect them, as you can look at more than just the leaves for identification.  The bark, environment, buds, and shape of the tree are all important clues to the tree's species.  This is especially important if you wish to differentiate trees of the same genus (such as black cherry, pin cherry, choke cherry, etc.).  Indeed, proper identification may not be possible from just the leaf.

Collect leaves that are typical for the tree, but remember - smaller leaves are going to be easier to fit onto an 8.5x11 inch sheet of paper.

Press the leaves by placing them on some sort of absorbant paper - newspaper, paper towels, tissues, etc.  Then place these under a stack of books or in a leaf press.  After two weeks, the leaves should be flattened, dried, and well-preserved.  Evergreens such as spruce and fir are difficult to preserve this way as the needles will fall off.  The more ambitious may wish to encase the leaves in epoxy, as this preserves the color and eliminates the need for pressing (meaning the leaves also retain their three dimensional features).

Once the leaves have been pressed, you can glue, tape, or laminate them onto notebook paper.  Use looseleaf if you wish to rearrange them later.  You may also place the pressed leaves between two sheets of wax paper, cover with a towel, and iron.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Nomenclatural citations template ==

I noticed the book, [[Nomenclatural citations]], which you started. Just in case you hadn't thought of it, I figured I'd mention that using a template such as the infoboxes on Wikipedia, might be useful for standardising the information in the book's sub-pages. See [[w:Wikipedia:Infoboxes]] and [[mw:Help:templates]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:50, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

: Hi, yes thanks for the information. I need to look into this kind of things. I started this yesterday, and my first priority was to get some data in. I'm not really good in all this fancy webstuff, but I understand there need to be templates to keep everything in one look, and to color up some things. Ofc, feel free to help ;) --[[User:Kempm|Kempm]] 07:14, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

:: I've changed [[Template:Nomenclatural citations infobox]] a bit. Please review these and let me know how this fits with what you are looking for (personally, I find this just more visually appealing).
:: Also, does any page use the &quot;image&quot; variable? It will have to be formatted properly, but without having an example picture, I didn't bother experimenting. Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:28, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

:::Hi Swift, thanks for your modifications, if the changes are good for you, then they are good for me, I only look at the data hehe. As for the pictures... at the moment I'm only adding fungi (my personal field of interest), and there's not many pictures on commons I can use for that. I'll try add a few mammals and add a picture as well in the next few days. Thx for taking care ;) --[[User:Kempm|Kempm]] 21:13, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

== A book that might interest you... ==

[[Dichotomous Key]] appears to be an abandoned stub, and I was wondering if you'd be interested in working on it, or perhaps know some people at wikispecies who'd enjoy this kind of project?

It's currently using an old naming convention, which I'll work on a bit, but it could be quite interesting if it's more developed. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:07, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

: Hi, yes I think the Dichotomous Key is an interesting project. It is known on Wikispecies and they're linking articles to the book, when a taxon is available. Personally I wouldn't mind trying to contribute, my main interest (coming from a professional point of view) is Fungi. Do you think there is any need for that? My specialism is the so-called Ascomycetes. I doubt 'normal people' have a great interest in that field :), but if I can contribute with this I'd be happy to do so. It would actually help me also. --[[User:Kempm|Kempm]] 07:38, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.

==Plot Summary==

'''Introductory Note:''' This play is unlike Shakespeare's other romance comedies in that it focuses on a female character aggressively pursuing a male character rather than a male pursuing a female. The female character, an appealing young woman named Helena, traps the male character, Bertram, into marriage. He is an immature young man who despises her because of her inferior social standing. After he abandons her on their wedding night, she continues to pursue him and eventually wins him back in a scheme of deception.

The Countess of Rousillon [Shakespeare spells Roussillon with one &quot;s&quot; but the modern spelling has two] has taken in an appealing young woman named Helena after the death of her father, Gerad de Narbon, a highly respected physician. While in the household, Helena falls in love with the countess's son, Bertram, but keeps her feelings to herself. Bertram pays her no heed and does not hesitate to go off to serve in the court of the King of France, a friend of Bertram's late father. Accompanying Bertram is his friend, Parolles, a braggart who is a corrupting influence on Bertram throughout the play.
The king suffers from what is believed to be an incurable fistula. When he greets Bertram and his friends, he says, 

I would I had that corporal soundness now, 

As when thy father and myself in friendship

First tried our soldiership! (Act I, Scene II, Lines 30-32)

The king says he would submit himself to treatment under Gerad de Narbon, who also attended Bertram's father, if the great physician were still alive. All other physicians have done him no good, and the king thinks death is near.
While Bertram is in Paris, Helena pines for him even though he may be out of reach because of his high social station. Under prodding from the countess, Helena admits the cause of her melancholy: her seperation from Bertram. Then Helena reveals a plan to go to Paris to heal the king with a potion left behind by her father. While in Paris, she will have an opportunity to be with Bertram. The countess, pleased that Helena loves her son, encourages her in her plan. After Helena arrives in Paris, an old lord of the court, Lafeu--who had accompanied Bertram and Parolles to Paris--tells the king of her wondrous healing powers:

.......I have seen a medicine

That's able to breathe life into a stone, 

Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary

With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch, 

Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay, 

To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand, 

And write to her a love-line. (Act II, Scene 1, Lines 75-81)

But the king at first refuses to let her treat him because he has had his fill of failed cures. She then stakes her life on the efficacy of her medicine, but stipulates a condition: If her treatment works, the king wil allow her to select a husband from among the eligible bachelors at court. The king aggrees. Within days, his illness disappears, and the king presents five worthy gentlemen for her to chose from. Helena rejects all of them and selects Bertram as her husband-to-be. However, Bertram complains that she is the daughter of a mere physician and, thus, unworthy of him. He vows and that he cannot and will not love her. Helena, heartbroken, is wiling to let the matter end there. The king is not. After elevating Helena to a higher social rank, he commands Bertram to marry her, telling him,

My honour's at the stake; which to defeat, 

I must produce my power. Here, take her hand, 

Pround scornful boy, unworthy this good gift. (Act II, Scene III, Lines 156-158)

Bertram yields, and the wedding ceremony takes place that evening. Meantime, Lafeu and Parolles discuss the events of the evening. When Lafeu criticizes Bertram for his ungentlemanly conduct, Parolles threatens the old man but backs down, revealing himself as a coward, after Lafeu threatens him in return. 
After the wedding, headstrong Bertram refuses to stay with Helena even for a single night, preferring instead to hie off to join other young French lords in a military campaign in Florence, Italy. Parolles praises his decision, saying it is better to seek glory in war than wallow in the hellhole of France. As Bertram prepares for his military venture, Lafeu warns him that Parolles is cowardly and untrustworthy, but Bertram is heedless. Befre leaving, Bertram orders Helena to return home to Rousillon with a letter for his mother. In the letter, Bertram infuriates his mother by writing, &quot;I have sent you a daughter in-law: she hath recovered the king and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the NOT eternal.&quot; Helena then receives a letter of her own from Bertram. It says, 

When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which

never shall come off, and show me a child begotten 

of thy body that I am father to, then call me

husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'

This is a dreadful sentence. (Act III, Scene II, Lines 59-63)

Deeply hurt, Helena leaves Roussillon and goes on a pilgramage to Saint Jaques monastery in Spain. However, her feet do not cooperate, and, instead, lead her to Florence, where Bertram is encamped with troops. Helena stays at a lodging house for pilgrims run by an elderly widow. The widow's daughter, Diana, tells Helena that a certain Count Rousillon (Bertram) has distinguished himself in battle. &quot;Know you such a one?&quot; she asks. Helena says she has heard of him, but does not know him personally. Helena also learns that Bertram has been trying to seduce Diana. In public, Diana points out the Count Roussillon to Helena.
Later Helena tells her whole sad story to the widow, revealing herself as the rejected wife of the young court. Then she enlists Diana's help in a plot to win back her husband. Diana agrees to help her. Here is the stratagem. Bertram has been attempting to seduce Diana. Diana will agree to a midnight tryst with Bertram if he will give her his ring, yielding her chastity in exchange. When Bertram agrees to all the conditions, Diana says, 

And on your finger in the night I'll put

Another ring, that what in time proceeds 

May token to the future our past deeds. (Act IV, Scene II, Lines 71-73)

After Diana obtains the ring, all goes well. At the appointed hour, Helena takes Diana's place in a darkened room, going unrecognised, and she and Bertram make love. During the night she places on his finger a ring given to her by the King of France. Meanwhile, Parolles has been exposed as a simpering coward by French lords who ambushed and captured him, then make him think he was in the custody of the enemy. Parolles, whose name means &quot;words&quot; in French, tells his &quot;captors&quot; everything they want to know in order to save his skin.
Elsewhere, Bertram's mother, who has ben led to believe that Helena has died, sends a letter to Bertram announcing Helena's death and asking her son to return home. After he arrives, he begins to realize what a good and loving woman Helena was. When the king visits Roussillon, Bertram claims that he loved Helena.
The king forgives him for rejecting her. But life must go on, and the king thinks Bertram should now marry Lefeu's daughter. However, before he makes the match, the king notices the ring on Bertram's finger--the very ring he gave Helena, the ring that Helena placed on Bertram's finger in the dark room after first removing Bertram's own ring. While Bertram lamely tries to explain how he obtained the king's ring, Diana shows up, saying it was she who placed the ring on Bertram's finger while in bed with him. Then she demands that Bertram marry her. (Diana is really acting on Helena's behalf. Helena must first prove that a midnight meeting took place before she can disclose that it was she, not Diana, who met with Bertram.) Next, the widow arrives with Helena. Helena announces that not only does she have Bertram's own ring, but she also carries his child. Thus, she has met both of the conditions Bertram set forth in his letter to her. The whole truth of what happened in Florence then unravels, and Bertram accepts his wife. The king says, &quot;All is well ended&quot; (Act V, Scene III, Line 336).

==Characters==

Protagonist: Helena

Antagonist: Class System That Discriminates Against Persons Of Low Birth

Bertram: Self-centred and immature Count of Roussillon, who rejects the woman who loves him because of her inferior social status. 

Countess of Roussillon: Kindly and level-headed mother of Bertram.

Helena: Gentlewoman protected by the Countess; she is in love with Bertram even though he believes she is not good enough for him. When he leaves his home in Roussillon to make his mark in Paris at the court of the King of France, she later follows him in hopes of winning his love. Bertram's mother, the countess, abets her in her plan.

King of France: He suffers from a chronic ailment which Helena, schooled in the healing arts, has the power to cure. 

Duke of Florence

Parolles: Follower of Bertram. Parolles is a bad influence on the young man and is, in part, responsible for Bertram's less than gentlemanly behaviour. 

Lafeu: An old lord who warns Bertram that Parolles is a coward. 

Steward, Clown: Servants to the Countess of Roussillon. 

Old Widow of Florence

Diana: Daughter of the Widow. Diana cooperates with Helena in a scheme to trick Bertram into pledging his love for Helena. 

Violenta, Mariana: Neighbours and friends of the Widow

Minor Characters: Lords, Officers, Soldiers, Gentlemen (French and Florentine).

==Settings==

The action begins in Roussillon, a region in southern France, then moves to other locales, including Paris, France; Florence, Italy; and Marseilles, France. Bertram, one of the central characters in the play, is the Count of Roussillon.

==Climax==

The climax of a play or another narrative work, such as a short story or a novel, can be defined as (1) the turning point at which the conflict begins to resolve itself for better or worse, or as (2) the final and most exciting event in a series of events. The climax of All's Well That Ends Well occurs, according to the first definition, when Helena, through trickery, takes Bertram's ring while he is asleep. (Bertram had vowed that he would never return to Helena unless she obtained the ring on his finger--a task he thought impossible, given his determination never to willingly yield it to her.) At this point, the plot begins to resolve itself. According to the second definition, the climax occurs in the final act when Helena shows Bertram the ring and he vows to love her forever.

==Themes==

Theme 1: A human being should be judged on his or her inner qualities, not on social standing. Bertram rejects Helena (until the end of the play) because she is below him on the social scale. Blinded by his prejudices, he fails to see her good qualities. This theme foreshadows the themes of later English writers, such as Jane Austen, Emily Bronte and Charles Dickens. 

Theme 2: Women have the intelligence and know how to compete with men. Examples: (1) Only Helena can cure the king's fistula. (2) Helena and Diana team up to trick Bertram. The motif of women struggling to prove their worth--or suffering under male domination--is a recurring theme in literature. For example, in the 5th Century B.C., Sophocles dealt with this theme in Antigone, a play in which a teenage girl challenges the authority of a king. In the 19th Century A.D., Kate Chopin dealt with this theme in several of her works, including a splendid short story entitled &quot;The Story of an Hour,&quot; in which an oppressed women fails to assert herself in a male world but does enjoy an hour of freedom. 

Theme 3: All things are not as they seem. Bertram thinks high standing brings happiness. In reality, he discovers later, only love, honesty, and other virtues can bring happiness.

==Dates and Sources==

Date Written: 1603-1604

First Printing: 1623 as part of the First Folio

Probable Main Source: The Decameron, by Boccaccio (1313-1375). The Decameron, written between 1349 and 1353, consists of 100 tales told by seven men and three women to pass the time after they isolate themselves in a villa to escape the plague. The subjects of the tales include romance, deceit, and the power of the human will. 

Number of Words in Complete Text: 24,505

==Type of Play==

All's Well That Ends Well is a romance comedy. It is also clasified as one of three of Shakespeare's &quot;problem plays&quot; (along with Measure for Measure and Troilus and Cressida) because it presents as heroes or heroines characters who are seriously flawed in some way. In All's Well, Bertram is a problem because he consistently mistreats Helena, the woman who loves him; he regards her as unworthy of him because of her inferior social status. Helena is also a problem because, though intelligent and appealing, she resorts to trickery to win Bertram. Only at the end of the play does Bertram accept Helena, but his sincerity remains a question. Consequently, because the heroes are less than heroic and because the ending of the play is abrupt and somewhat forced, many critics regard All's Well as one of Shakespeare's weaker comedies. These critics may be entirely right in their assessment. However, one may fairly speculate that Shakespeare intended the play as a satire on social conventions of the day, pointing out the problems that arise from snobbery and hauteur, as personified in Bertram. In this context, the play becomes far more palatable and the character development and plot artifices more artistically acceptable.

==Epigrams==

In the dialogue of All's Well That Ends Well and other Shakespeare plays, characters sometimes speak wise or witty sayings couched in memorable figurative language. Although these sayings are brief, they often express a profound universal truth or make a thought-provoking observation. Such sayings are called epigrams or aphorisms. Because many of Shakespeare's epigrams are so memorable, writers and speakers use them again and again. Many of Shakespeare's epigrams have become part of our everyday language; often we use them without realizing that it was Shakespeare who coined them. Examples of phrases Shakespeare originated in his plays include &quot;all's well that ends well,&quot; &quot;every dog will have its day,&quot; &quot;give the devil his due,&quot; &quot;green-eyed monster,&quot; &quot;my own flesh and blood,&quot; &quot;neither rhyme nor reason,&quot; &quot;one fell swoop,&quot; &quot;primrose path,&quot; &quot;spotless reputation,&quot; and &quot;too much of a good thing.&quot; Among the more memorable sayings in All's Well That Ends Well are the following: 

Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,

excessive grief the enemy to the living. 

(Lafeu to Helena on her expressions of grief, Act I, Scene I, Lines 44-45)

Oft expectation fails, and most oft there

Where most it promises. 

(Helena to the King of France on Failed Cures for His Fistula, Act I, Scene II, Lines 145-146)

A young man married is a man that's marred.

(Parolles to Bertram after Bertram's Wedding, Act II, Scene III, Line 315)

The web of our life is a mingled yarn, good and ill together. 

(First Lord to Second Lord on Bertram's changing fortunes, Act IV, Scene III, Line 83).

==Imagery==

All's Well That Ends Well contains standard verse and soaring poetry demonstrating a maturity of style equal, in many instances, to that displayed in Shakespeare's greatest plays. Some of the most beautiful imagery in the play is expressed by Helena. In the following touching passage, she compares Bertram to a bright star too high for her to reach. The light imagery is reminiscent of that in Romeo and Juliet, written ten years before. 

'Twere all one

That I should a bright particular star 

And think to wed it, he is so above me:

In his bright radiance and collateral light

Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.

The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:

The hind that would be mated by the lion

Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague, 

To see him every hour; to sit and draw

His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, 

In our heart's table; heart too capable

Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:

But now he's gone, and my idoltrous fancy

Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?

Helena also alludes to Apollo, the sun god who drives his chariot across the sky, when telling the King of France that her medicine will produce a quick cure. Note, too, the end rhyme in the passage:

The great'st grace lending grace

Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring

Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring, 

Ere twice in murk and occidental damp

Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleep lamb, 

Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass

Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass, 

What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly, 

Health shall live free and sickness freely die.

==Strong Women==

Helena and the Countess of Rousillon are both strong women. Helena is courageous and persistent; she is also highly intelligent, the proof of which is her mastery of the medical arts. When Bertram takes no notice of her and goes off to Paris, she pines for a while, then acts decisively, traveling to Paris herself. There the king suffers from an apparently incurable fistula. When Helena claims that she can cure him, the king allows her to treat him under penalty of death if she fails. With the king's promise that if she succeeds she may choose a future husband from among the men at court, she proceeds and heals the king. She chooses Bertram, of course, and the king orders him to marry her. When Bertram abandons her after their wedding, she is broken-hearted. But thanks to a little luck and help from other women, she wins Bertram back. The Countess, well aware of Helena's excellent qualities, encourages Helena in her pursuit of her spoiled son, perhaps in the realization that Helena can help Bertram to mature. Her support of Helena underscores her strength of character. In an age when other mothers of high social standing attempted to make a match for their sons based on pedigree, the countess has the courage to endorse a woman of the lower class as a possible future daughter-in-law. It is interesting to note that the countess acts in a fatherly role in advising Bertram on the ways of the world. She gives Bertram a short farewell &quot;lecture&quot; reminiscent of the lecture Polonious gives to Laertes (in Hamlet: Act I, Scene III, Lines 59-81) before Laertes leaves home. Following is the advice the countess gives: 

Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father

In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue 

Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness

Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few, 

Do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy 

Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend

Under thy own life's key; be cheque'd for silence, 

But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will, 

That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down, 

Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord; 

'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord, 

Advise him.

==Significance of the Title==

The title is based on lines spoken by Helena to point out that the success or failure of an event or a course of action depends entirely on how it ends: 

But with the word the time will bring on summer, 

When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns, 

And be as sweet as sharp. We must away; 

Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us: 

All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;

Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.

I noticed your attempts to try to fix issues with the naming convinctions used with the Programming:Perl book. I deleted all the duplications, I could find that you made under Begining Perl TOC and moved some of the Programming:Perl pages to use a name begining with [[Perl Programming]] instead. Copy pasting doesn't preserve the edit history like moving/renaming a page does, which is important to keep. I kept the kept the top Begining Perl TOC page, but renamed it as [[Perl Programming/TOC]] in case you or other people need it or intend to continue to develop it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:18, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

== Your historical documents project ==

Hi - closing the VfD on this I have moved the pages into your user space to work on [[User:Tannersf/Historical Documents]].  Maybe when this is something more than a collection of redlinks you will consider offering it as a book again - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:06, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

== [[Star Trek Starships]] ==

I'm curious about the direction you want to go with this book.  Wikibooks really shound't be just about a collection of encyclopedia-like articles but should be something a little more substantial.  And from what I've seen, you are essentially writing a bunch of semi-related articles of a topical nature.

I'm not really trying to discourage you from contributing to Wikibooks, but I'm not entirely sure that this is the appropriate setting for writing content of this nature.  This is also something called a &quot;Macropedia&quot;, and is explicitly mentioned in the official policy [[WB:WIW]].

From a personal viewpoint, I love Star Trek myself.  This is nothing against trying to develop a Wikibook with a Star Trek related theme (like the [[Klingon]] Wikibook), but rather trying to duplicate Wikipedia or Wikipedia-like content here on Wikibooks.  There is a long history about trying to make a distinction between the two projects (Wikibooks and Wikipedia), and I understand if it isn't exactly easy to tell the difference.   That some Wikibooks do have a similar collection of article flavor may also be true, but these are exceptions and something that may in the future be removed from Wikibooks.  I would rather not see you put large amounts of effort into something only to see it being removed become of being inappropriate to Wikibooks.

The only reason it survived the VfD earlier was mainly due to the fact that this was a brand-new Wikibook, and slapping a VfD on something totally new is generally discouraged.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:20, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

== print versions and images ==

Don't worry about them... just remove it from the other pages, and it will no longer show up as linked from the print version. The print versions are just collections of transcluded pages, so if you remove them from the included pages, it is automatically removed from the print version as well. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:21, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

== Image removal ==

Uh, what exactly are you doing with the images? You haven't left edit summaries for any of your changes. If this is part of the image cleanup, there isn't any reason to actually remove the links to the images in many cases (e.g. on the Cookbook talk page archives). What you should do instead is just delete the image and leave the redlink. People will have to clean these up in the future. At the minimum, you need to explain each edit in the summary field. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:39, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

Hope you haven't taken my slow pace attempt to help remove images from pages from the end as a reason to stop from working on it from the begining of the category. Just trying to help meet in the middle. Using an edit summery as Kellen suggested is a good idea though. Should explain the edit is to remove an image that lacks a license tag. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:49, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

== Seasonality ==

G'day, I just reverted your edits to the Seasonality of the following foodstuffs: [[Cookbook:Alfalfa]], [[Cookbook:Artichoke]], [[Cookbook:Arugula]], [[Cookbook:Asparagus]]. Your edit summaries indicate that they were part of &quot;image cleanup&quot;, but the actual impact was to break these pages. Please perform a preview of your edits before saving. 

Additionally, I think that in these instances you took the wrong approach. The image was a simple single-colour GIF that could easily be recreated and uploaded with public domain license. I have now done this, solving the problem of license without breaking all pages that linked to it. Please bear this in mind when &quot;cleaning up&quot; further pages - don't let the &quot;fix&quot; become the problem. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]] 02:14, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

== Image cleanup ==

Just to say thanks for your help in this - it has been a big job but hopefully we are nearly there - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:07, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

I'd also like to say thanks, and one more thing - '''please stop'''. There are images now missing, with no links saying that they're even missing, and for no better reason than that they had no licensing information. I don't have the time to pick over ''long'' lists of contribs for you and others who are removing these images and any links to them, so please desist for now. 

At least some of these images are either in existence on Wiki Commons or are easy to recreate (e.g. maths formulas). It would be far better for the project if these images were replaced, substituted, or fixed rather than deleted along with any reference to them. For just a couple of examples, please check out these pages:

Hi - yesterday I was doing some tidying on stub type pages and marked some as qr-em (ie they become speedy in 7 days).  I then realised one of them was a page of your Volcano book.  I have taken it off again however I then noticed that there are a number of pages in the book that show up in special:Shortpages.  This means that it is quite possible that others will find them and maybe mark them - could you give me any idea of your plans with the book?  I'm not sure whether you feel some redlinks would be better than leading to a page that just has headings at present?

'''Tuna glop''' - A simple, quick-to-make meal

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) elbow macaroni
*1 can (10 oz, 300 g) cream of mushroom soup
*1 can (6 oz, 170 g) chunk [[Cookbook:tuna|tuna]] in water
*2 cups frozen vegetables, such as peas and carrots
*1 cup crushed potato chips (crisps)

==Procedure==
# Prepare macaroni according to directions on the package, but without salt.  Drain and return to pot.
# Add cream of mushroom soup.
# Drain tuna and add.
# Add frozen vegetables and mix well.
# For crunchy vegetables, heat five minutes over low heat, stirring frequently.  Heat longer for softer vegetables.
# Serve topped with crushed potato chips (crisps).

==Notes, tips, and variations==
This is a recipe with a great deal of room for variation.  All the ingredients can be substituted: other small noodles for the macaroni, chopped turkey or chicken for tuna, cream of celery for cream of mushroom, or fresh chopped vegetables for frozen. I've even had it with corn flakes cereal substituted for the chips (crisps).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Overview ===
Arithmetic and logical operations (plus some string comparisons) are in Tcl concentrated in the '''expr''' command. It takes one or more arguments, evaluates them as an expression, and returns the result. The language of the '''expr''' command (also used in condition arguments of the '''if''', '''for''', '''while''' commands) is basically equivalent to C's expressions, with infix operators and functions. Unlike C, references to variables have to be done with ''$var''. Examples:
 set a [expr {($b + sin($c))/2.}]
 if {$a &gt; $b &amp;&amp; $b &gt; $c} {puts &quot;ordered&quot;}
 for {set i 10} {$i &gt;= 0} {incr i -1} {puts $i...} ;# countdown

The difference between Tcl syntax and ''expr'' syntax can be contrasted like this:
 [f $x $y]  ;# Tcl:  embedded command
  f($x,$y)  ;# expr: function call, comma between arguments
In another contrast to Tcl syntax, whitespace between &quot;words&quot; is optional (but still recommended for better readability :) And string constants must always be quoted (or braced if you wish):
 if {$keyword eq &quot;foo&quot;} ...

Then again, Tcl commands can always be embedded into expressions, in square brackets as usual:
 proc max {x y} {expr {$x&gt;$y? $x: $y}}
 expr {[max $a $b] + [max $c $d]}

In expressions with numbers of mixed types, integers are coerced to doubles:
 % expr 1+2.
 3.0
It is important to know that division of two integers is done as integer division:
 % expr 1/2
 0
You get the (probably expected) floating-point division if at least one operand is ''double'':
 % expr 1/2.
 0.5
If you want to evaluate a string input by the user, but always use floating-point division, just transform it, before the call to expr, by replacing &quot;/&quot; with &quot;*1./&quot; (multiply with floating-point 1. before every division):
 expr [string map {/ *1./} $input]

=== Brace your expressions ===
In most cases it is safer and more efficient to pass a single braced argument to ''expr''. Exceptions are:
* no variables or embedded commands to substitute
* operators or whole expressions to substitute

The reason is that the Tcl parser parses unbraced expressions, while expr parses that result again. This may result in success for malicious code exploits:
 % set e {[file delete -force *]}
 % expr $e   ;# will delete all files and directories
 % expr {$e} ;# will just return the string value of e

That braced expressions evaluate much faster than unbraced ones, can be easily tested:
 % proc unbraced x {expr  $x*$x}
 % proc braced x   {expr {$x*$x}}
 % time {unbraced 42} 1000
 197 microseconds per iteration
 % time {braced 42} 1000
 34 microseconds per iteration

The precision of the string representation of floating-point numbers is also controlled by the tcl_precision variable. The following example returns nonzero because the second term was clipped to 12 digits in making the string representation:
 % expr 1./3-[expr 1./3]
 3.33288951992e-013
while this braced expression works more like expected:
 % expr {1./3-[expr 1./3]}
 0.0

=== Operators ===
Arithmetic, bitwise and logical operators are like in C, as is the conditional operator found in other languages (notably C):
* c?a:b -- if c is true, evaluate a, else b
The conditional operator can be used for compact functional code (note that the following example requires Tcl 8.5 so that fac() can be called inside its own definition):
 % proc tcl::mathfunc::fac x {expr {$x&lt;2? 1 : $x*fac($x-1)}}
 % expr fac(5)
 120

==== Arithmetic operators ====
The arithmetic operators are also like those found in C:
* + addition
* - (binary: subtraction. unary: change sign)
* * multiplication
* / (integer division if both operands are integer
* % (modulo, only on integers)
* ** power (available from Tcl 8.5)

==== Bitwise operators ====
The following operators work on integers only:
* &amp; (AND)
* | (OR)
* ^ (XOR)
* ~ (NOT)
* &lt;&lt; shift left
* &gt;&gt; shift right

==== Logical operators ====
The following operators take integers (where 0 is considered false, everything else true) and return a truth value, 0 or 1:
* &amp;&amp; (and)
* || (or)
* ! (not - unary)

==== Comparison operators ====
If operands on both side are numeric, these operators compare them as numbers. Otherwise, string comparison is done. They return a truth value, 0 (false) or 1 (true):
* == equal
* != not equal
* &gt; greater than
* &gt;= greater or equal than
* &lt; less than
* &lt;= less or equal than
As truth values are integers, you can use them as such for further computing, as the sign function demonstrates:
 proc sgn x {expr {($x&gt;0) - ($x&lt;0)}}
 % sgn 42
 1
 % sgn -42
 -1
 % sgn 0
 0

==== String operators ====
The following operators work on the string representation of their operands:
* eq string-equal
* ne not string-equal
Examples how &quot;equal&quot; and &quot;string equal&quot; differ:
 % expr {1 == 1.0}
 1
 % expr {1 eq 1.0}
 0

==== List operators ====
From Tcl 8.5, the following operators are also available:
* a '''in''' b - 1 if a is a member of list b, else 0
* a '''ni''' b - 1 if a is not a member of list b, else 0

Before 8.5, it's easy to write an equivalent function
 proc in {list el} {expr {[lsearch -exact $list $el]&gt;=0}}
Usage example:
 if [in $keys $key] ...
which you can rewrite, once 8.5 is available wherever your work is to run, with
 if {$key in $keys} ...

=== Functions ===
The following functions are built-in:
* abs(x) - absolute value
* acos(x) - arc cosine. acos(-1) = 3.14159265359 (Pi)
* asin(x) - arc sine
* atan(x) - arc tangent
* atan2(y,x) 
* ceil(x) - next-highest integral value
* cos(x) - cosine
* cosh(x) - hyperbolic cosine
* double(x) - convert to floating-point number
* exp(x) - e to the x-th power. exp(1) = 2.71828182846 (Euler number, e)
* floor(x) - next-lower integral value
* fmod(x,y) - floating-point modulo
* hypot(y,x) - hypotenuse (sqrt($y*$y+$x*$x), but at higher precision)
* int(x) - convert to integer (32-bit)
* log(x) - logarithm to base e
* log10(x) - logarithm to base 10
* pow(x,y) - x to the y-th power
* rand() - random number &gt; 0.0 and &lt; 1.0
* round(x) - round a number to nearest integral value
* sin(x) - sine
* sinh(x) - hyperbolic sine
* sqrt(x) - square root
* srand(x) - initialize random number generation with seed x
* tan(x) - tangent
* tanh(x) - hyperbolic tangent
* wide(x) - convert to wide (64-bit) integer

Find out which functions are available with ''info functions'':
 % info functions
 round wide sqrt sin double log10 atan hypot rand abs acos atan2 srand
 sinh floor log int tanh tan asin ceil cos cosh exp pow fmod

=== Exporting expr functionalities ===
If you don't want to write [[expr {$x+5}]] every time you need a little calculation, you can easily export operators as Tcl commands:
 foreach op {+ - * / %} {proc $op {a b} &quot;expr {\$a $op \$b}&quot;}
After that, you can call these operators like in LISP:
 % + 6 7
 13
 % * 6 7
 42
Of course, one can refine this by allowing variable arguments at least for + and *, or the single-argument case for -:
 proc - {a {b &quot;&quot;}} {expr {$b eq &quot;&quot;? -$a: $a-$b}}

Similarly, expr functions can be exposed:
 foreach f {sin cos tan sqrt} {proc $f x &quot;expr {$f($x)}&quot;}

In Tcl 8.5, the operators can be called as commands in the ''::tcl::mathop'' namespace:
 % tcl::mathop::+ 6 7
 13
You can import them into the current namespace, for shorthand math commands:
 % namespace import ::tcl::mathop::*
 % + 3 4 ;# way shorter than [expr {3 + 4}]
 7
 % * 6 7
 42

=== User-defined functions ===
From Tcl 8.5, you can provide procs in the ''::tcl::mathfunc'' namespace, which can then be used inside ''expr'' expressions:
 % proc tcl::mathfunc::fac x {expr {$x &lt; 2? 1: $x * fac($x-1)}}
 % expr fac(100)
 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000

This is especially useful for recursive functions, or functions whose arguments need some expr calculations:

 % proc ::tcl::mathfunc::fib n {expr {$n&lt;2? 1: fib($n-2)+fib($n-1)}} 
 % expr fib(6)
 13

This template provides structure and links for weed control methods. It should be added to the &quot;Controls&quot; section of weed profiles.

==Using [[Template:Weedcontrol]]==
This template is automatically included by the page template {{tlx|Weedprof}}.

Fill in only the fields for which there is information. Unused lines should be left blank to be filled in later.
{{weedcontrol|
| Mowing    = discuss here whether mowing is effective, and if it should be done at any particular time
| Cultivation   =  discuss whether cultivating is effective

| Girdling  = Is girdling effective? (Applies to trees, shrubs, and vines only.)
| Coppicing  = Can the plant be kept coppiced to prevent seed production? (Applies to trees, shrubs, and vines only.)
| Grinding  = Will the tree sprout from outer roots after grinding? (Applies to trees, shrubs, and vines only.)
| Pulling  = is the plant hard to pull? are there any particular techniques that should be used?
| Flame  = is flame-weeding effective?
| Barriers  = are barriers effective? how long do they need to be kept in place?
| Solarization  = is solarization a good approach for controlling this weed?
| Pre-emergents (organic)  = discuss whether organic pre-emergents (such as Corn Gluten meal) are effective, and when to apply
| Pre-emergents (synthetic)  = discuss whether synthetic pre-emergents are effective, which ones, and when to apply

| Biocontrols (animal)  = discuss any animals (insects, etc.) that are used as biocontrols of this weed
| Biocontrols (plants)  = discuss any plants that are used as biocontrols of this weed (e.g., allelopathic plants, smothering vines, etc.)
| Grazing  = discuss whether grazing can be used to control this weed, and which animals
| Nutritional controls  = discuss whether altering the nutrient levels or pH of the soil can control this weed
| Disposal  = can this plant be safely composted? if so, only in certain times during it's development? Hot piles only? Is the plant so aggressive that it should always be burned? Does the plant contain persistent allelopathic chemicals that should be kept out of the compost pile?

== Overview ==

The '''''Marauder's Map''''' is a map that shows Hogwarts and its grounds. It is one of a kind.

== Extended Description ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The '''''Marauder's Map''''' is a magical parchment showing Hogwarts castle and grounds in its entirety, including seven secret passages into the castle. These passages are unknown to most, though [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] apparently knows four. The map also shows every person's location within the castle's premises, identified by their names in minuscule writing.

When the map is inactive, it appears to be large blank parchment. It is activated by placing a wand tip on it and saying, &quot;I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.&quot; To restore its blanked appearance, a wand taps it again as the holder says, &quot;Mischief managed,&quot; causing the map to go blank.

When the map is activated, the parchment will reveal a writing:

&lt;center&gt;'''Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs'''&lt;br /&gt;'''Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers'''&lt;br /&gt;'''are proud to present'''&lt;br /&gt;'''the Marauder's Map'''&lt;/center&gt;

The map was created by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marauders|Marauders]]: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] (Moony), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] (Wormtail), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] (Padfoot) and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]] (Prongs) during their years at Hogwarts, and was confiscated by Filch because he believed it to be a dark object, though he apparently never discovered its secret. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|The Weasley twins]] stole it from his files, and it became useful in their own mischief-making; they, in turn, passed it on to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] when it appeared that he would otherwise be unable to visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. Harry has used it extensively since.

== Analysis ==

Magic can, if handled incautiously in a story, render the plot pointless by making anything possible. If a character or an artifact is capable of doing anything, the story devolves into a simple chase of the character or artifact. Rowling makes the series exciting and dynamic in part by limiting people's abilities – not all wizards are equally magical, and even the most powerful have their blind spots – and by limiting artifacts' availability or capabilities.

The Marauder's Map is just such an artifact. It shows people's exact positions in real time everywhere in a nine-story (or more) castle, even identifying by name individuals who have never been there before. The map sees them by their psyche, thus making it proof against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloaks]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagi]]. And when not in use, it looks like a simple blank parchment. It is necessary to show it has limitations (it is unable to reveal the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], for instance), and it is necessary in several situations to have it be unavailable to Harry, because it has been either borrowed or confiscated.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
# How did the Weasley twins happen upon the particular spell that activates the Map? (&quot;I solemnly swear I am up to no good.&quot;)
# What was there about the Map that would convince Filch that it was Dark magic? It is often described as just looking like a bit of parchment.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

One question that comes up is whether [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] knows what the map is. He finds it in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] pocket in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 14|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], at which time it identifies its creators and insults Snape. Snape may know who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are or were, which is likely why he summons [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] to inspect it and makes such pointed comments about the map's manufacturers; Lupin is the only Marauder he can talk to immediately. Snape immediately recognizes the Marauder's Map in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 25|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] as being Harry's property. That, plus the Egg, causes Snape to be certain that Harry is hiding nearby under his Invisibility Cloak. Snape, by this time, knows the map's function, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 19|he has seen it working]] on Lupin's desk.

Another question is how Harry gets the Map back; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|the fake Professor Moody]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 25|borrows it]], and, when he is transformed back as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch]], confesses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 35|that he used it]], in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''. Though [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] expresses interest in it, we do not see it at that time, nor is Harry seen getting it back. However, he does put it to good use in later books. The author, in an interview, has stated that this was an oversight, and in the book's next edition, Harry collects it from Moody's desk while Barty is incapacitated.

Many weeds can be controlled effectively by simply mowing or cutting them down. This can be done with a mower, brusher, string-trimmer, or scythe.

Weeds that are susceptible to this method includes all trees and shrubs, most vines, and large herbaceous plants. Lawn weeds are of course not controllable by this method, since they are adapted to regular mowing.

Depending on the plant in question mowing can either be done regularly to continually weaken the plant, or in the case of annual weeds simply cut down before seed production to prevent their return the following year. 

Disposal of the clippings can generally be done by composting, although care should be taken if seeds are present.

== Organisation of the book == 

This book contains:
* 40 lessons, 
* a Kapampangan to English lexicon, 
* an English to Kapampangan lexicon, 
* the solutions to all the exercises, 
* an index.

Each of the 40 lessons is organised in four parts plus one optional part:
* Part A: presentation of the aspect of the language that we learn in this lesson,
* Part B: application of the principles,
* Part C: exercises,
* Part D: summary and list of newly learned words and phrases,
* Part E: extras (optional part): linguistic information related to the lesson's subject for the curious reader that wants to know more about the language or its history, or wants more explanations on grammatical points. You can skip this part if you only wish to understand and speak Kapampangan, and have no other linguistic interest.

== General advice == 

# Work regularly: if you can spread your work, go through only one lesson per day. It is during your sleep that your brain will organise your new knowledge, but there is only so much that it can organise.
# Plan your effort: Allocate in advance your time for learning. This will help not having large periods without any work, which could cause you to forget what you have previously learned, and would cause you to have to double your effort.
# Go back: Do some revision with the previous lessons, and redo some exercises. You need to know (and remember) the basics before you can move on.

== Conventions in this book ==

*The alphabet we use here for the purpose of sorting alphabetically Kapampangan words is a,b,d,g,h,i,k,l,m,n (including ng),o,p,r,s,t,u,w,y. &lt;ref&gt;For easier computer processing of word lists, the letter ng is considered to be two separate letters, so are the letters dy, ts and sy. The glottal stop indicated by ' is not used for sorting. This means that the same sorting rules can be used for the English word lists and Kapampangan word lists.&lt;/ref&gt;

*New Kapampangan words are always indicated in '''bold'''. 
*Translations in English are indicated in ''italic''.
*The origin of new words, when they can be identified, is indicated with the following abbreviation the first time that a word is mentioned: 
**''Span.'' Spanish
**''Eng.'' English
**''Tag.'' Tagalog
**''Chin.'' Chinese
**''Arab.'' Arabic

This book offers you the possibility to learn the Filipino language called Kapampangan.

== Who should read this book? ==

To our knowledge, there is no such book available in print, it will therefore be the first of its kind.
This book is intended for those who wish to learn Kapampangan at a conversational and written level. It requires you to have a good knowledge of English, but does not require any knowledge of Tagalog: we will only refer to Tagalog to indicate borrowings of the Kapampangan language from its mighty neighbour.

The pronunciation of Kapampangan is reasonably straightforward, and we will not require you to understand the full International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) system to be able to pronounce the words we describe (although IPA sounds are indicated in the first lesson for those who prefer it).

We do recommend, however, a basic understanding of grammatical words like subject, object, agent, transitive, pronoun etc.

The vocabulary and pronunciation presented here is the one of the two biggest cities of Pampanga: Angeles and San Fernando. We will not discuss the rural variations or local town accents, since their speakers can all understand the main dialect.

Here is a brief introduction on the language history and geography before our first lesson.

== The Kapampangan language ==

[[Image:Kapampagan cultural center.PNG|thumb|300px|Map of the provinces where Kapampangan is most popular. This also shows the locations of the main cities of Pampanga, from which we base our vocabulary and pronunciation]]

Kapampangan is a language of the Philippines spoken as mother tongue by roughly two million people in Central Luzon.
Most speakers live in the province of Pampanga and Tarlac, although there are a few speakers in the provinces of Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Bataan and Zambales . The map below shows the extent of the language cover.

Most of the Kapampangan people are tri-lingual: Kapampangan, Tagalog and English, since the education system is English and Tagalog, nearly all master these languages well enough to get around. However, when together with other Kapampangan people, they will prefer to use their mother tongue over the other two.
Very little books have been written in Kapampangan, as the language is not considered “formal” enough for the purpose of written documents. This is a biased but common view from a people whose education system is not in their own mother tongue. 

For those of you that are linguists, you may want to know that Kapampangan is, generally classified in the central Luzon branch of languages of the Malayo-Polynesian branch of Austronesian family. It is also an an ergative-absolutive language, so there is a little difficulty in the grammar that will appear early in the learning process for those who know only English and other nominative-accusative languages.

== A bit of history of the Kapampangan language ==

The first modern people to arrive in Luzon are the people sometimes called Negrito, Ayta, Aeta, or Atis which were probably related to the aboriginals of New Guinea and Australia. Their original language is today extinct, but may have influenced Kapampangan at some point since a reasonable number of them still live in the mountain area around Pampanga.
The majority of today’s Kapampangans descend from the second wave of population: the Austronesian people that immigrated from Taiwan around 2500 B.C.E. and which settled in the whole of the Philippines within 1000 years. In Luzon, it is unclear why the various languages separated from each other into separate languages, but time caused them to drift apart, since there were already many languages in Luzon when the Spanish arrived in 1521.
The Philippines have been under Spanish influence from 1521 until 1898 A.D. and this has caused Kapampangan to import a large number of words from Spanish, like the days of the week, the days of the months, a lot of religious words, and words from cooking.
Then in 1898, the United States took over power from the Spanish, and later made the Philippines a colony. They established an education system entirely in English throughout the country. The Philippines were made independent in 1946, but English is still now one of the 2 official languages in the country, and therefore Kapampangan has been, since 1898, heavily borrowing words from it.
[[Image:Extent of Kapampangan language.PNG|left|thumb|350px|Current extent of the Kapampagan language in the island of Luzon. Click to enlarge.]]
The Kapampangan people are surrounded by other languages of the Philippines and therefore you should expect influences from these neighbours to influence the vocabulary over time. Tagalog has now got the advantage of also being the national language, and the language of Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and therefore Kapampangan has a large number of words borrowed from Tagalog.

== Modern Kapampangan ==

Kapampangan is still very much alive in the barrios, although not taught at school, even the youngest children use it among themselves and it is not in danger of being extinct.

More and more frequently, some Kapampangan speakers replace, in their every day language, the Kapampangan words and phrases by their English equivalent, although keeping most of the sentence structure in Kapampangan. This mixed language is referred to as Kapanglish (in the same way that Taglish refers to Tagalog mixed with English words and phrases). We will avoid describing Kapanglish here, since you will naturally understand, and even practice if required, Kapanglish once your knowledge of Kapampangan is sufficient.

Modern Kapanpangan is exclusively written in the Latin alphabet, therefore you will not have to learn a different writing system. The old Spanish-like spelling is being abandoned (e.g. Capampañgan), and the modern Tagalog-like spelling has widely taken over, which is the spelling we use here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Deletion==
Either this wikibook should be deleted, moved or fixed. It's not completely neutral (e.g. telling us that this is the author's way of meditating, since a wikibook on meditation should focus on popular or most ways of meditating). Also, on the subject of neutrality, it describes what not to do instead of reccomending what not to do - or even further it should tell you that some people don't think meditation should be done with non-calming music.
==Rewrite==
I've Been Bold and did a major rewrite, hoping that someone would notice and add to what I started.  I will be the first to say that I don't edit that much and learning by doing  I already feel it's a little too conversational, but I'll work on that soon.  

I saw the very sad state of the current page and thought &quot;even though I'm no expert, I know more about this than this page&quot;.  I had to edit it.  There are some major things missing (using smells, music, devotional, etc.) and I hope someone with more experience might update what I started.  I may be re-reading some of the text I have and I'll be back in a week to update this. [[User:Seer|Seer]] 03:42, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

== Cool Book ==
I managed to quit biting my nails using some ideas of this book in a slightly modified way. I am a programmer, and this book is just a cool software library that I can run on my brain.

:The chapter has 36 references, mostly to scientific studies, including some highly authoritative studies (which is rare in this field). Perhaps you don't like advice such as &quot;avoid promiscuous partners&quot; if you don't want STDs, or you don't want to follow the rules of safe(r) sex to avoid AIDS. Whether you follow this advice is your choice, but the facts are established. More important, these facts are little-known among the general public. The Wikibooks mandate is to present authoratative factual materials, regardless of how unpopular or politically incorrect the facts may be.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 04:11, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

==Helpful, but sexist==
I think it's a real helpful book, but it focuses to solely on how; men like to blabber about their sex-life, whilst women don't, women tend to get hurt easily, even how boys have much more interest in sex compared to girls. Now, I '''don't''' think it should be deleted, since it has certain usefulness- but alot of material has to be fixed. [[User:BiT|BiT]] 12:54, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

:Maybe... it really depends on whether or not it won't be vandilised by the same person who placed spam inside it. I still say it should be deleted. I put it on the page for deletion :) [[User:Wikisquared|Wikisquared]] 13:18, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

::The phrase &quot;it focuses to solely on&quot; is difficult to square with the wide range of material in this chapter. The entire book, and especially this chapter, establishes over and over that men and women are different. Of course that's sexist. An earlier chapter says that some women think and act more like men, and some men think and act more like women. When this book says &quot;men do this, women do that,&quot; the intended meaning is &quot;persons who think and act in masculine patterns, which are mostly but not always men, so this, and persons who act in feminine patterns...&quot; Perhaps that disclaimer should be put at the top of every chapter.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 04:11, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

::: Or simply reword it more clearly. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:36, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

==This material will always be controversial==
Sexually transmitted diseases, consent issues, how parents should guide their teenagers&amp;#151;these are extremely controversial issues in our society. If you find scientific studies not included in this chapter, please add material, or correct outdated material. But please don't delete materials just because you're offended by it.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 04:11, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

: In similar vain, please strive for NPOV, mentioning existing differences on issues and referring to expert consensus with readily available (possibly internet available) sources. Also keep in mind that uncontested POV isn't NPOV. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:34, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;The Twenty-Four-Hour Rule&quot; and &quot;Men's Talk and Women's Reputations&quot; removed ==

I removed these two sections because the former was a very specific rule that cannot be applied to the general, and the second as it completely failed to mention cultural backgrounds, cultural differences and was therefore not helpful. I think the book is better without these sections than with them in that state. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:28, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

:Perhaps the last two sections (&quot;Five Tips for Better Kissing,&quot; &quot;What Women Want in Bed&quot;) should be removed, or moved to a new chapter. The rest of the chapter is about why you should avoid sex (outside of committed monogamous relationships) and then the last two, short sections are about how to please a partner in bed. On the other hand, it's nice to end on a positive note, after so much negative material. IMHO, &quot;The Twenty-Four-Hour Rule&quot; and Men's Talk and Women's Reputations&quot; goes with &quot;What Women Want in Bed,&quot; I don't see any reason to delete those sections. Maybe move the deleted sections and the remaining two sections to a new chapter.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 15:05, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

:: No. Those two shouldn't stay unless elaborated on in a way that adresses the comments I made.
:: ''The rest of the chapter is about why you should avoid sex''. This is a bad approach to NPOV. Wikibooks is supposed to be informative, not advocative. The scope should be &quot;how&quot; to have sex. Now, emotional issues and desease prevention may warrant mentioning what are considered good practices (here it is important to present multiple views) and expert opinion on those so that the reader can make up his/her own educated mind. This is an official policy here at Wikibooks. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:34, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

== Correlation doesn't mean causation ==

Re the lead section: Maybe people are more likely to stay monogamous if they have a good sex life, rather than vice-versa as this section claims. And maybe the reason so relatively few are happy with their secondary partners is that they have to spend so little time together to keep the primary partner from getting suspicious. (AFAIK, with most bigamists, the primary partner is unaware of the secondary partner's existence.) [[User:Seahen|Seahen]] 03:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

== Ridiculous ==
This module is probably the most harming POV article I've ever seen on a WMF-project (believe me, I've seen a few). I would strongly recommend deleting it and start over. Unfortunately I don't write articles in English, otherwise I would love to rewrite the article. Regards, [[User:.Koen|.Koen]] 21:37, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

This book is outrageous!  It reads like some US religious or political propoganda and the time has come for it to be deleted.  Wikibooks is not the place for books like this which pick and choose the information that they see fit to push a particular religious or political viewpoint.  It also focuses too much on the USA and current &quot;trends&quot; in that country like celibacy and &quot;drug wars&quot;.

'''Old Church Slavonic''', '''Old Church Slavic''' (OCS) (словѣ́ньскъ ѩзꙑ́къ, slověnĭskŭ językŭ) was the first literary Slavic language, developed by the 9th century Byzantine Greek missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius who were credited with standardizing the language and using it for translating the Bible and other Ancient Greek ecclesiastical texts as part of the Christianisation of the Slavic peoples. It played an important role in the history of the Slavic languages and served as a basis and model for later Church Slavonic traditions, and some Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches use Church Slavonic as a liturgical language to this day.&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Soil and root barriers are used to control weeds or limit the spread of an aggressive plant.

Surface barriers prevent any exposure to light (and sometimes water), or simply prevent plant shoots from reaching light.

Root zone barriers are vertical barriers that prevent the roots of plants from extending into adjacent areas, and are most often used for running plants such as mints and bamboos.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An idea of a '''social contract''' draws from [[w:Teleology|teleological]] thinking as opposed to a modern [[w:Sociological_naturalism|naturalistic]] view of [[w:Sociocultural_evolution|sociocultural evolution]]. A social contract is a hypothetical agreement between primitive, &quot;unsocialized&quot; people, who decided to form a society in order to avoid wars and violence, by instead creating specific rules - [[w:Law|laws]] - that would organize the group life. A notable founder of the social contract model, [[w:Thomas Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], presents a totally rationalistic view on human nature, which is a main point of contemporary critique.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Disposing of garden wastes is a science all to itself, mostly involving composting.

Deciding what plant materials to compost, what to burn, what to throw out:

*Does the material contain seeds
*Does the material contain disease organisms
*Does the material contain chemicals that might be harmful to compost piles
*Will the material colonize the compost pile
*Will the material break down in the compost pile in a reasonable amount of time

Other materials:
*Plastic pots
*Fence posts, etc.
*Wire
*Stakes

=Using SwisTrack=

SwisTrack processes the images in various steps, whereas each step can be performed in a particular mode. For instance you can acquire images from device A, segment it with method B, and perform tracking with method C. This choices are independent from each other, e.g. it does not matter whether the image comes from a camera or a video. Rather, every step expects data to be available in a certain format, and produces output accordingly.

The organization of this manual follows the same scheme that SwisTrack uses for image processing, which is summarized in the table below

==Input==
===AVI video driver===
This mode uses Intel OpenCV's video acquisition features which uses Video for Windows (VfW) codecs for loading AVI and MPEG files. Make sure that you have the correct codec installed, SwisTrack does not work with DirectShow drivers! A good test is to use the software VirtualDub (open source), which allows you to get more specific information about the codec in use. 

===CMU 1394 Digital Camera Driver===
This mode uses the firewire driver developed at Carnegie Mellon University. Make sure you deinstall the driver that comes with your camera before! There is a little test application shipped with the CMU driver, which allows you to test your camera, and also to make some settings that are not yet accessible from SwisTrack.

===Native Video Driver===
This mode makes use of the native video driver of your operating system. Under Windows, this mode allows accessing standard USB cameras (&quot;Webcams&quot;). Under Linux, it should allow accessing Firewire cameras also, which has not been tested yet.

==Segmenter==
===Static Background (fixed threshold)===
The image is segmented by subtracting a background image of the scene from each video frame. A fixed threshold defines the minimum difference required to count a pixel as not belonging to the background.

This mode is sensible to changes in lighting condition.

Apparently, you need to be careful that the background image has the exact same dimensions of the video file.  The bmp exported from SwisTrack itself does not always have the same dimensions.

===Running Average===
This mode does not require a background image, which is instead the running average of all video frames processed so far. The parameter ''alpha'' specifies the speed of the running average, i.e. the ratio of how much every new frame contributes to the average.

This mode is more capabale when dealing with changing lighting conditions, but is not able to cope with objects that stop moving for a longer period of time as they become part of the background. 

===Static Background (color ratio)===

===Fixed Color===

==Segmenter Post-Processing==


==Particle Filter==
===Min-Max Size Filter===
===Circular Shape Filter===

==Mask==
===No Mask===
===Binary Mask===

This feature is currently under revision.

==Tracker==
===Nearest Neighbor===

The option ''Maximum allowed speed'' is given in pixels and defines the radius SwisTrack should look for potential targets. '''Maximum allowed speed'' is not necessary the physical speed of an object but should also take into account scenarios where objects are merged and split afterwards, which induces displacement on the trajectories without that the objects were moving.

The option ''Can trajectories share a particle?'' allows you to specify whether trajectories can merge on a single particle (as for instance when two insects are overlapping) or if this behavior is not desired (as for instance when tracking robots equipped with markers).

==Calibration==
===No Calibration===
===2nd Order Polynomial Fit===

==Output==
===Output uncalibrated data===

=Installing Swistrack=

SwisTrack is shipped as a Windows installer, which walks you through the installation process. Download the installer from [http://swistrack.sourceforge.net SourceForge]. For other platforms, SwisTrack has to be built from the sources.

==Installing Swistrack Sources (developers only)==


Download the SwisTrack sources with an SVN client of your choice, under Linux the SVN instruction will be 


 svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/swistrack swistrack


under Windows you only need to enter the address [https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/swistrack https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/swistrack].

You will also need the following libraries:

* All Platforms: OpenCV 1.0, WxWidgets 2.6.3
* Windows: CMU 1394 camera driver
* Linux: FFMPEG (needs to be installed prior to OpenCV, and OpenCV needs to be build with FFMPEG support enabled)

We use the following tools for developing SwisTrack:

* All Platforms: Doxygen
* Windows: Visual Studio 2005, NullSoft Installer

Mulches, when applied at the right time, can be very good for weed control and prevention. The important thing is timing: if mulches are applied at a time when weed seeds are fully dormant, they will prevent any exposure of the seed to sunlight, which is for many weed seeds the primary signal that causes them to start growing.

Mulches are most commonly applied in spring for this purpose, but many biennial and perennial weeds actually germinate in autumn, so some gardeners will mulch twice per year, or even add mulches whenever they pull weeds or otherwise disturb the soil.

Mulches are sometimes applied in combination with a pre-emergent. For organic gardeners, the pre-emergent used is [[../Corn Gluten Meal|corn gluten meal]], which is applied under the mulch.

=Introduction=
SwisTrack is programmed in C++ and should compile on Windows, Linux, and MacOS platforms.

SwisTrack's is divided in three parts
* The tracking core that takes care of image acquisition and analysis
* A graphical user interface that provides tools for visualizing different steps in the tracking process
* A command line interface

The three parts are linked by an XML description that can be found in the file ''swistrack.exp'' in the SwisTrack directory. Here, the different processes in the tracking process are organized in ''components'' with different ''modes'' (see [[/Using SwisTrack/]]). For the component ''input'' suitable modes are for instance image acquisition from a camera or from a file.

Based on this description (which also specifies the parameter type, e.g. ''list'' or ''integer''), the GUI provides appropriate controls for modifying each parameter and storing it to a configuration file, which is a subset of ''swistrack.exp'' (see for instance ''example.cfg'' in the ''example'' directory). Also, the GUI provides panels that allow changing parameters during tracking and observing their influence on the tracking result at the same time (see [[/Using SwisTrack/]]).

On the other hand, the structure defined in ''swistrack.exp'' should reflect the class hierarchy of the tracking core. As a rule of thumb, each component in ''swistrack.exp'' is encapsulated in its own class, whereas modes are implemented using ''switch'' statements in the class' member functions. Here, it is the duty of the programmer to verify in the constructor of each class, whether the current operational mode and its parameters are provided in the actual configuration file and throw an exception otherwise.

See [[/Installing Swistrack/]] for information about setting up a developer's environment.

==Example==

The &lt;COMPONENTS&gt; section in ''swistrack.exp'' describes the distinct tracking steps that are implemented in the tracking core and require parameter input from the user.

 
 &lt;COMPONENTS&gt;
  &lt;INPUT desc=&quot;Input&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;SEGMENTER desc=&quot;Segmenter&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;SEGMENTERPP desc=&quot;Segmenter Post-Processing&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;PARTICLEFILTER desc=&quot;Particle Filter&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;MASK desc=&quot;Mask&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;TRACKER desc=&quot;Tracker&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;CALIBRATION desc=&quot;Calibration&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;OUTPUT desc=&quot;Output&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/COMPONENTS&gt;

The &lt;SEGMENTER&gt; section for instance might have 2 modes (in this example)

 &lt;SEGMENTER mode=&quot;0&quot; desc=&quot;Static Background, fixed threshold&quot; long=&quot;The image is segmented by subtracting a static background image   from every frame in the video. The 'Threshold' determines the minimal difference for the gray value of an object to be recognized, and 'Max. Number' is the maximal number of contours processed (sorted by size).&quot;&gt;
  &lt;THRESHOLD desc=&quot;Threshold&quot; type=&quot;integer&quot; min=&quot;1&quot; max=&quot;150&quot; variable=&quot;1&quot;&gt;20&lt;/THRESHOLD&gt;
  &lt;FIXED desc=&quot;Fixed&quot; type=&quot;boolean&quot; variable=&quot;1&quot;&gt;0&lt;/FIXED&gt;
  &lt;BGIMAGE desc=&quot;Background Image&quot; type=&quot;open&quot; param=&quot;*.bmp&quot;&gt;example/bg.bmp&lt;/BGIMAGE&gt;
 &lt;/SEGMENTER&gt;
 
 &lt;SEGMENTER mode=&quot;1&quot; desc=&quot;Running Average&quot; long=&quot;The image is segmented by subtracting a static background image from every frame  in the video. The 'Threshold' determines the minimal difference for the gray value of an object to be recognized, and 'Max. Number' is the maximal number of contours processed (sorted by size). 'Alpha' is the speed of the exponential averager.&quot;&gt;
  &lt;THRESHOLD desc=&quot;Threshold&quot; type=&quot;integer&quot; min=&quot;1&quot; max=&quot;150&quot; variable=&quot;1&quot;&gt;20&lt;/THRESHOLD&gt;
  &lt;ALPHA desc=&quot;Averaging Speed&quot; type=&quot;double&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;1&quot; variable=&quot;1&quot;&gt;0.02&lt;/ALPHA&gt;
 &lt;/SEGMENTER&gt;

Here mode 0 has three parameters (&lt;THRESHOLD&gt;, &lt;FIXED&gt;, and &lt;BGIMAGE&gt;), whereas mode 1 has two parameters (&lt;THRESHOLD&gt;,&lt;ALPHA&gt;), that are of different type. For instance the type &quot;open&quot; of &lt;BGIMAGE&gt; with attribute ''param=&quot;*.bmp&quot;'' tells the GUI to use an ''Open File'' control (the developer should reserve a ''string'' variable in its application).

In the source code, the segmenter component can be found in the class ''Segmenter'' (''segmenter.cpp'', ''segmenter.h''). The constructor then needs to look like

 if(!IsAttrByXPath(cfgRoot,&quot;/CFG/COMPONENTS/SEGMENTER&quot;,&quot;mode&quot;))
  throw &quot;[Segmenter::Segmenter] Segmenter mode undefined (/CFG/COMPONENTS/SEGMENTER)&quot;;
 mode=GetIntAttrByXPath(cfgRoot,&quot;/CFG/COMPONENTS/SEGMENTER&quot;,&quot;mode&quot;);
 switch(mode)
  {
   case 0 :
    {
     CreateExceptionIfEmpty(cfgRoot,&quot;/CFG/SEGMENTER[@mode='0']&quot;);
     CreateExceptionIfEmpty(cfgRoot,&quot;/CFG/SEGMENTER[@mode='0']/BGIMAGE&quot;);
     CreateExceptionIfEmpty(cfgRoot,&quot;/CFG/SEGMENTER[@mode='0']/THRESHOLD&quot;);
     CreateExceptionIfEmpty(cfgRoot,&quot;/CFG/SEGMENTER[@mode='0']/FIXED&quot;);
    }
   case 1 :
    {
     CreateExceptionIfEmpty(cfgRoot,&quot;/CFG/SEGMENTER[@mode='1']&quot;);
     CreateExceptionIfEmpty(cfgRoot,&quot;/CFG/SEGMENTER[@mode='1']/THRESHOLD&quot;);
     CreateExceptionIfEmpty(cfgRoot,&quot;/CFG/SEGMENTER[@mode='1']/ALPHA&quot;);
    }
   default :
     throw &quot;[Segmenter::Segmenter] Segmenter mode not implemented&quot;;
  }
  SetParameters();

The parameters themselves are queried in the member function ''SetParameters()'', which will be called whenever the user changes parameters during run-time.

=Setting up your Developer Environment=

After downloading all necessary library packages (don't forget to compile them using your development environment), create a project for the SwisTrack core. Then create a project for the SwisTrack GUI, which links the core together with the other libraries. Make sure that you compile both projects as Multithreaded DLL.

==Libraries==

You will need to link the following libraries

* libxml++.lib
* libxml2.lib
* wxbase26_net.lib
* wxmsw26_adv.lib
* wxmsw26_core.lib
* wxbase26.lib 
* wxtiff.lib 
* wxjpeg.lib 
* wxpng.lib 
* wxzlib.lib 
* wxregex.lib
* wxexpat.lib
* winmm.lib
* comctl32.lib
* rpcrt4.lib
* wsock32.lib
* oleacc.lib 
* odbc32.lib 
* objecttracker.lib 
* 1394camera.lib 
* cv.lib 
* highgui.lib 
* cxcore.lib 
* vispolygon_dll.lib 
* libgeom_dll.lib

=Contributing components and modes=
This section addresses how to extend SwisTrack's core functionality by extending a component by a new mode or by adding a new component.

==Extending a component by a new mode==
# Add a new section into ''swistrack.cfg'' and set the ''mode'' attribute to a number not yet used. Also specify the mode's description and its parameters
# Add your mode into the ''switch(mode)'' statement in the constructor of the class that represents the component you want to extend, and throw exceptions for each missing parameter
# Define appropriate variables in the ''private'' section in the class's interface (to be found in ''.h file'')
# Add your mode into the ''switch(mode)'' statement in the ''SetParameters()'' member function to fetch the parameters from the XML description
# Go through each member function of the class that you are extending and add code into the switch statement so to implement the functionality that you have in mind. If some of the functionality is redundand, you might want to put your 'case' statement under a case that represents your functionality and remove its 'break;' statement (don't forget to add a ''break;'' in your case though)

==Adding a new component==
# Have a look at other components to see how they are implemented
# Inherit your class from the 'Component' class, including ''component.h'' also includes some handy macros that you need for accessing the XML structure
# Your class should be instantiated in the class that is above your component; in turn, your class needs to instantiate the class that is below your component in the functional hierarchy

==Lesson To-Do==
If you would like to help, feel free to do any of these tasks.

===General===

===Introductory===

===Level One===

===Level Two===

===Level Three===

==Lesson Contents==

Levels One Through Three:
&lt;br&gt;
Each lesson should focus on user involvement, and include:
*A written introduction with info about the lesson's topic.
*Vocabulary
*Grammar
*More pictures! WikiCommons seems to have plenty of Indonesian-related pictures.
*Exercises after '''every''' section.
*An increasingly more difficult paragraph/lecture followed by questions about it, with both the questions and lecture being completely in Indonesian, should be a fundamental part of each lesson. This will involve the student and cause him or her to go back and reread vocabulary tables. The first lesson should be a short &quot;Hi. My name is ___. I live in...etc&quot; with questions about the person and his life. Later lectures should be about the subject of the lesson, such as culture, sports, professions, and daily life.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Indonesian/Lessons/Level four|Level Four]]:
*See [[Indonesian/Lessons/Planning#Level_Four|the level four section]] below.
*Themes: 
*Grammar: Everything not yet covered.
*Common Expressions: A set of common expressions should be included in each lesson.
*Texts: A text from Indonesian litterature should be included in every lesson.
*Disambiguation Topics: Common problems and errors should be included in every lesson.

==Level Structure==
Introductory Level:
*Rules on pronunciation, writing and, reading
*Common Indonesian phrases
*Absolutely no grammar
&lt;br&gt;
Level One
*Grammar
**Only one verb section + one other grammar section per lesson
*Very basic introduction, could be learned in about a day with full effort
*One or two [[Indonesian/Texts|texts]] from French litterature should go at the end of the lesson.
&lt;br&gt;
Level Two
*Grammar
**New grammar: 
**Review sections: 
**Several grammar sections per lesson
*More advanced than level one, could be done in about a week with effort.
*A [[Indonesian/Lessons/Planning#Texts_2|text]] from Indonesian litterature should go after every few lessons for a total of three or four.
&lt;br&gt;
Level Three: 
*Grammar: several new tenses, all pronouns
*'''Detailed''' user-written lectures on each lesson's subject should be written. The reader should have enough knowledge to read these by now.
*A [[Indonesian/Texts|text]] from Indonesian litterature should go after every few lessons for a total of five or six.

==Level Four==

===General===
*[[Indonesian/Lessons/Level four|Level Four Main Page]]
*Vocabulary: Standard vocabulary topics have all been used up by now. The focus should be guiding the student through Indonesian texts.
*Grammar: Advanced and detailed grammar points should be part of each lesson.
*Theme: Since there's not enough new general vocabulary for this level, we should make each lesson region-themed, like the German/French Wikibook. 
*Common Expressions: A set of common expressions should be included in each lesson.
*Texts: A text from Indonesian litterature should be included in every lesson.
*Disambiguation Topics: Common problems and errors should be included in every lesson.

===Themes===
#Aceh
#Sumatra Utara
#Sumatra Barat
#Riau
#Riau Kepulauan
#etc...

===Grammar===



===[[Indonesian/Appendices/Phrasebook|Common Expressions]]===
These should be included in every lesson.
*Physical and mental health
*Reacting to events
*Thanking
*Complementing
*(Dis)agreeing
*Invitations
*Meetings
*Expressing opinions

===[[IndonesianAppendices/Hints and common errors|Disambiguation Lessons]]===

==Lesson Ideas==

===Exercise Ideas===
*Fill-in-the-blank with vocab words
*Matching Indonesian to English
*Rewriting a given sentence/phrase using a new word

====Indonesian Names To Use====
Budi, Hasan, Iwan, Wati, Eno

===Concept Lessons===
If you are interested in developing a lesson on any single aspect of Indonesian, but unsure where to develop it, put it together and link to it below. Title it Indonesian/Lessons/Concept/[title]. It can then be seen below, and later moved into the proper progression of lessons. Consider also simply adding or expanding on an appendix that can serve as a reference source for the student. (from the German/French Wikibook)

*[[Indonesian/Lessons/Concept/Grammar|Only grammar]]
*[[Indonesian/Lessons/Concept/Vocabulary|Only vocabulary]]
*[[Indonesian/Lessons/Concept/Lectures|Only lectures]]
*[[Indonesian/Lessons/Concept/Mixed|Lessons with related grammar/vocabulary/lectures/texts]]

==Audio==

===Help Playing Audio Files===
[[w:Wikipedia:Media help (Ogg)|Wikipedia page]]

===Contribute!===
====Native Speakers====
Do you really like your voice and want the rest of the world to hear it? Do you want to improve this Wikibook? If so, please upload audio to accompany each lesson whenever you see a red &quot;audio&quot; link on a table by clicking on that link and uploading your audio to the file given.

If you would like to contribute to other projects needing pronunciation files, see [[Commons:Indonesian_pronunciation]].

====Maintenance Tasks====
If an &quot;upload&quot; link brought you here for a file that already exists, please edit the table and change the &quot;0&quot; at the top of the table to the size of the audio file in kilobytes. You can find the filesize by typing &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:image:[filename].ogg]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the sandbox and clicking on the link.

Add &lt;nowiki&gt; [[Category:Indonesian Audio]] &lt;/nowiki&gt; to any Indonesian audio file on Wikibooks that doesn't already have it. To do this, click &quot;edit this page&quot; on the info (Image:) page. Don't do this to files on Commons.

===Creating Audio Files===
The best and most efficent format to use for recorded speech that is acceptable at Wikibooks is .ogg with the [http://www.speex.org/ Speex] codec. 

First create a .wav file using the software that came with your microphone. Next you must convert the file to .ogg. To do this, first download the binary file from www . republika . pl/roed/speexw/ . Install it, open command prompt (start=&gt;run=&gt;cmd.exe), and type:
  x:\...\speexenc.exe x:\...\file.wav x:\...\file.ogg
where &quot;x:\...\&quot; is the directory of speexenc.exe, the location of the .wav file to be converted, and the soon-to-be location of the .ogg file. Replace &quot;file&quot; with the name of the .wav file. 

===Uploading the File to Wikibooks===
# Click on the red audio link at the top of the table that you created audio for.
# Click browse and find the .ogg file, choose a liscense for your file, and click &quot;upload file.&quot;
# Click &quot;edit this page&quot; at the top and add &lt;nowiki&gt; [[Category:Indonesian Audio]] &lt;/nowiki&gt; to the edit box.
# Click &quot;Save page&quot; then reload the page of the table you created audio for and make sure the &quot;audio&quot; link turns blue.
# Edit the table and change the &quot;0&quot; at the top to the file size amount in kilobytes of the file (listed on the file's description page).

===Custom File Names or Multiple Files Per Table===
To use a custom file name for a table, edit the table and add |[file location(s) and info] between the column number (often 4) and }}.

Example: 

&lt;nowiki&gt; {| {{Indonesian Table|Vocabulary|Airports and Airplanes|Bandara dan Penerbangan|258 + 205|4|audio: [[media:Indonesian-Liburan7.ogg|One]] • [[media:Indonesian-Liburan8.ogg|Two]]}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; 

produces:
{| {{Indonesian Table|Vocabulary|Airports and Airplanes|Bandara dan Penerbangan|258 + 205|4|audio: [[media:Indonesian-Liburan7.ogg|One]] • [[media:Indonesian-Liburan8.ogg|Two]]}}
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The content of this page is a proposal for the local Manual of Style of this book.

==Book structure==

*Keep the book structure &quot;flat&quot; (i.e., no subchapters) for easy reading and linking.
*Use proper book title naming (i.e., &lt;tt&gt;Wikimedia/Subpage Name&lt;/tt&gt;, not &lt;tt&gt;Wikimedia/Subpage name&lt;/tt&gt; (administrative pages like this one being a notable exception).
*No transcluded categories (if templates are used, don't include categories, so that the book's category structure can be kept as simple as possible). 

==General MOS==

*This is a wikibook, so it should be worked on in the spirit of all wikibooks. Wikipedians should [[resist]] the [[urge]] to link every [[term or phrase]], because wikibooks really just doesn't work that way. (If you feel you absolutely must link terms used here, use the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:term to be linked|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; format (don't forget the pipe at the end, which makes the &quot;w:&quot; disappear... this will be discussed further in chapter on the wikibooks MOS). 

==Sections on particular Wikimedia projects==

*&quot;History&quot; sections should start at the beginning, but need not be kept &quot;up to the minute&quot; (this is a book, not a newspaper).
*&quot;Culture&quot; sections should be as NPOV as possible, pointing out both the strengths and weaknesses of the communities built around each project.
*&quot;MOS&quot; sections (which need a better name) are about the policies and guidelines of each project. It should include the policies, how they evolved, why they were adopted, and why they are important. Remember that policy changes should not be discussed here, as this is just a book about Wikimedia, and shouldn't be mistaken for an administrative page.

If you haven't done so already, spend a few minutes to first read the course's [[Indonesian/Lessons/Introductory|introductory lessons]]. Once that's done, you're ready to begin your very first traditional Indonesian lesson! After you have completed this level, you can move on to [[Indonesian/Lessons/Level two|the next level]]. Finally, go to [[Indonesian/Lessons/Planning|the lessons planning page]] if you would like to help improve this course.

== What is this? ==

What is this? I'm an IB Higher Level French student, and I would love to have a resource that would give me information on how and what to study. But for a Wikibooks site to be a forum for a single class (especially when the teacher of said class is apparently putting their work on it at a very low priority--I haven't seen a change here for several months) is not at all what Wikibooks is about. Please, I am asking whoever has taken the time to start this page to finish it.

:The problem is that if no one is a ctive at present who wants to contribute nothing much will happen - sorry --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:17, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome! This is a textbook which is meant to cover all subjects of the '''Primary School Leaving Examination''', or '''PSLE'''. It is meant to be a reliable and free textbook for students to use, whether for introduction, mastery or revision. It is also meant to assist parents and other adult individuals who teach or take care of primary school children. 

There are many resources for the PSLE offline, but those few available online often come at a price. This is a deplorable state of affairs, since reliable PSLE aid is a vital resource and should be free for all children. It is hoped that this book will eventually become a significant resource for students and parents, if not completely replace printed resources.

==What is the PSLE?==
{{Wikipedia|Primary School Leaving Examination}}
The PSLE is an end-of-year examination taken by all primary six students nationwide in [[w:Singapore|Singapore]] before leaving for secondary school. It is generally taken around the age of twelve, although there are exceptions based on pace. It is administered by the Ministry of Education. This nationwide examination tests English and various ''mother tongue'' languages such as [[Chinese]], [[Tamil]] and Malay, as well as science. Social studies may be taken, but it does not affect aggregate scoring. The PSLE syllabus has various significant differences from other primary school syllabuses around the world.

The PSLE is an end-of-year examination, and is the culmination of all that has been learnt in the six years of primary school. It is distinct, however, from the usual end-of-year examinations a student's primary school will give. In particular, the school will administer its own final year examination, and these are known as the '''preliminary examinations''' or ''prelims'', as lead-up to the PSLE itself.

The PSLE is not only an examination: it is also a system and a culture. The format of the examination is often implemented in primary school examinations in some form from primary one. As students progress, the examinations they take will increasingly reflect the format and content of the PSLE. Therefore, the PSLE Study Guide can be used not only to prepare for the actual PSLE itself, but for other examinations taken in the PSLE format, by students of other countries who may be encountering PSLE-type problems or wish to expand the methodology used, or perhaps adults who wish to brush up on what their children are learning!

==Streaming==
The PSLE is often unique from other final year examinations around the world because of the presence of streaming in the examination, in addition to the ''pass'' or ''fail'' element. Most other systems usually have final examinations that simply determine whether the student moves up to the next level or not. While the streaming system has been source of criticism, it is an element that must be dealt with. 

The presence of streaming means that within a specific subject there will be several different examinations with different formats, for each specific level. 

This book will break down the PSLE by macrotype (cultural or scientific), by subject, then stream. Students are advised not to be restricted by stream should they have the interest to look into the material of other streams.

==Scoring==
Scoring for the PSLE is not absolute. The individual's initial ''absolute'' score is taken, then compared against his peers, and adjusted based on the performance of other students. This results in an ''aggregate score''. The PSLE aggregate score helps to determine whether a student will be accepted into a desired secondary school.

Another language (I wouldn't want to call it &quot;little&quot;) embedded inside Tcl is ''regular expressions''. They may not look like this to you - but they follow (many) rules, indeed. The purpose is to describe a string pattern to match with - for searching, extracting, or replacing substrings.

Regular expressions are used in the ''regexp'', ''regsub'' commands, and optionally in ''lsearch'' and ''switch''. Note that this language is very different from Tcl itself, so in most cases it is best to brace an RE, to prevent the Tcl parser from misunderstanding them.

Before the gory details begin, let's start with some examples:
 regexp {[0-9]+[a-z]} $input 
returns 1 if $input contains one or more digits, followed by a lowercase letter.
 set result [regsub -all {[A-Z]} $input &quot;&quot;]
deletes all uppercase letters from $input, and saves that to the ''result'' variable.
 lsearch -all -inline -regexp $input {^-}
returns all elements in the list $input which start with a &quot;-&quot;.

=== Character classes ===
Many characters just stand for themselves. E.g.
 a
matches indeed the character &quot;a&quot;. Any Unicode can be specified in the \uXXXX format. In brackets (not the same as Tcl's), a set of alternatives (a &quot;class&quot;) is defined:
 [abc]
matches &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, or &quot;c&quot;.
A dash (-) between two characters spans the range between them, e.g.
 [0-9]
matches one decimal digit. To have literal &quot;-&quot; in a set of alternatives, put it first or last:
 [0-9-]
matches a digit or a minus sign. A bracketed class can be negated by starting it with ^, e.g.
 [^0-9]
matches any character that is not a decimal digit. The period &quot;.&quot; represents one instance of any character. If a literal &quot;.&quot; is intended (or in general, to escape any character that has a special meaning to the regexp syntax), put a backslash &quot;\&quot; before it - and make sure the regular expression is braced, so the Tcl parser doesn't eat up the backslash early...).

=== Quantifiers ===
To repeat a character (set) other than once, there are quantifiers put behind it, e.g.
 a+     matches one or more &quot;a&quot;s,
 a?     matches zero or one &quot;a&quot;,
 a*     matches zero or more &quot;a&quot;s.
There is also a way of numeric quantification, using braces (again, not the same as Tcl's):
 a{2}   matches two &quot;a&quot;s - same as &quot;aa&quot;
 a{1,5} matches one to five &quot;a&quot;s
 a{1,}  one or more - like a+
 a{0,1} zero or one - like a?
 a{0,}  zero or more - like a*

The + and * quantifiers act &quot;greedy&quot;, i.e. they consume the longest possible substring. For non-greedy behavior, which provides the shortest possible match, add a &quot;?&quot; in behind. Examples:
 % regexp -inline {&lt;(.+)&gt;} &lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt;&lt;grill&gt;
 &lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt;&lt;grill&gt; foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt;&lt;grill
This matches until the last close-bracket

 % regexp -inline {&lt;(.+?)&gt;} &lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt;&lt;grill&gt;
 &lt;foo&gt; foo
This matches until the first close-bracket.

=== Anchoring ===
By default, a regular expression can match anywhere in a string. You can limit that to the beginning (^) and/or end ($):
 regexp {^a.+z$} $input
succeeds if input begins with &quot;a&quot; and ends with &quot;z&quot;, and has one or more characters between them.

=== Grouping ===
A part of a regular expression can be grouped by putting parentheses () around it. This can have several purposes:
* ''regexp'' and ''regsub'' can extract or refer to such substrings
* the operator precedence can be controlled
The &quot;|&quot; (or) operator has high precedence. So
 foo|bar grill
matches the strings &quot;foo&quot; or &quot;bar grill&quot;, while
 (foo|bar) grill
matches &quot;foo grill&quot; or &quot;bar grill&quot;.
 (a|b|c) ;# is another way to write [abc]
For extracting substrings into separate variables, ''regexp'' allows additional arguments:
 regexp ?options? re input fullmatch part1 part2...
Here, variable ''fullmatch'' will receive the substring of ''input'' that matched the regular expression ''re'', while part1 etc. receive the parenthesized submatches. As ''fullmatch'' is often not needed, it has become an eye-candy idiom to use the variable name &quot;-&gt;&quot; in that position, e.g.
 regexp {(..)(...)} $input -&gt; first second
places the first two characters of ''input'' in the variable 'first'', and the next three in the variable ''second''. If $input was &quot;ab123&quot;, ''first'' will hold &quot;ab&quot;, and ''second'' will contain &quot;123&quot;.

In '''regsub''' and '''regexp''', you can refer to parenthesized submatches with \1 for the first, \2 for the second, etc. \0 is the full match, as with ''regexp'' above. Example:
 % regsub {(..)(...)} ab123 {\2\1=\0}
 123ab=ab123
Here \1 contains &quot;ab&quot;, \2 contains &quot;123&quot;, and \0 is the full match &quot;ab123&quot;. Another example, how to find four times the same lowercase letter in a row (the first occurrence, plus then three):
 regexp {([a-z])\1{3}} $input

=== More examples ===
Parse the contents in angle brackets (note that the result contains the full match and the submatch in paired sequence, so use ''foreach'' to extract only the submatches):
 % regexp -all -inline {&lt;([^&gt;]+)&gt;} x&lt;a&gt;y&amp;lt;b&gt;z&lt;c&gt;d
 &lt;a&gt; a &amp;lt;b&gt; b &lt;c&gt; c

Insert commas between groups of three digits into the integer part of a number:
 % regsub -all {\d(?=(\d{3})+($|\.))} 1234567.89 {\0,}
 1,234,567.89
In other countries, you might use an apostrophe (') as separator, or make groups of four digits (used in Japan).

In the opposite direction, converting such formatted numbers back to the regular way for use in calculations, the task consists simply of removing all commas. This can be done with '''regsub''':
 % regsub -all , 1,234,567.89 &quot;&quot;
 1234567.89
but as the task involves only constant strings (comma and empty string), it is more efficient not to use regular expressions here, but use a '''string map''' command:
 % string map {, &quot;&quot;} 1,234,567.89
 1234567.89

      <text xml:space="preserve">PSLE English is a multiple-paper subject that has papers taken on different dates. It is composed of:

*[[/Oral|Oral examination]] 
*[[/Listening Comprehension|Listening Comprehension]]
*[[/Paper 1|English Paper 1]] (mainly writing) 
*[[/Paper 2|English Paper 2]] (mainly tests reading and grammar) 

== Oral ==
The candidate is required to wait in the waiting room based on his team number. When he is called, he will need to proceed to the table of the timekeeper depending on the team number. The candidate will look at a passage and a picture within 5 minutes. Afterwards, he will need to stop and return the picture. After that, he needs to wait for the examiner to finish. 

PSLE Oral has three components:

*Reading
*Picture discussion
*Conversation

===Reading===
The candidate needs to read a passage. Marks are given according to fluency and pronunciation.

====Tips====
#Read out the passage during the 5 minutes while you are looking at the passage and the picture.
#Pronounce every word clearly.
#Do not speak too loud or soft.

Hi!!! My name is Tannersf (not real name). 

==My Projects==

I will edit just about anything. 

I'm currently working on [[Star Trek Starships]]. I'm going to try and get it completed soon. 

#[[Historical Documents]] This is going to be a '''huge''' book, so I'll need some help!
#[[Volcanoes]] This book will be more of a textbook than the others. 
#[[Solar System]] This book will be alot like the volcano book above. 
#[[Star Trek Starships]] This one will contain 30 ships, so not much in this one. 

But I've requested a Wikijunior book and also getting ready to start a book on income tax. 

Lastly, I'm getting ready to do (or edit) study guides for some popular novels.
 
Here is a possible idea for a Wikibook: [[/The Middle East - outline/]]



Feel free to send me any messages!

My name is Troy and I have been a CPA since 1999. I graduated in Accounting in 1996 and was employed by a &quot;Big Six&quot; accounting firm. In 1998, I went to work for one of our clients in the Internal Audit department. Currently, my role is that of Director of Financial Compliance, where I oversee corporate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, NYSE reporting requirements, and SEC reporting and disclosure requirments.

Other accomplishments and activities: I hold a Master's degree in Organizational Leadership, am a Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA), and am an Officer and Board Member of a local chapter of ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association).

While auditing (both financial and IT) and accounting are what I have been trained in, my true passion lies in teaching. Since these are the topics I am most familiar with, they are the topics where the majority of my contributions will be located.</text>

&lt;small&gt; Back to [[Ossicle|TOC]] &lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Overview ==
The goal of this collection is to provide a scholarly and readily accessible resource for professionals on Head and Neck disorders.  Consequently, there are several rules regarding formatting and citation that must be followed to keep this collection uniform and professional.  

For ease of use, each entry within this text should be written as if it were its own review article.  This should allow the reader a simple one-print mechanism to obtain high quality information on a given subject.  Please keep editorialism to a minimum.  While a “Discussion” section for each topic is encouraged, its contents should come from reasonable extrapolation of cited data, not mere opinion.


== Scholarly Sources &amp; Citation Format==

* The article’s body should ''eventually'' be thoroughly cited from (preferably) primary sources published in peer-reviewed journals.

** In the interest of ease of publication, partial articles and uncited articles will be allowed at present.
** Until a Reference list is completed, the [[Template:Uncited]] template should appear at the top of any incompletely cited articles.
*** Briefly, this is done by inserting the &lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Uncited}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/font&gt; markup at the top of a page, on its own separate line, when Editing.
** Citations will be made by using the Harvard referencing system.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#How_and_where_to_cite_sources|Citing Sources].  Briefly, this means following your cited text with with a parenthetical reference to the author and the year of publication, e.g. (Smith 2001).
** References will be listed as the last ''Level 2 Heading'' on the page, titled &quot;References&quot;.
** The References list should be formatted using the [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html|International Committee of Medical Journal Editors Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals] requirements.
* Well-established and time-tested fact or premise need not be cited, but realize it does open the article up for criticism.

== Article Formatting ==
To maintain a professional look, please publish with a unified format:
* Use the “Contents” template at the very top of the article
* Divide into sections using “Level 2 Headline” formatting in Wiki Markup
** Introduction
** Clinical Presentation
** Epidemiology
** Pathophysiology
** Treatment Options
** Discussion
**References
* Capitalize the first initials in Level 2 Headline.
* Cross reference other articles in this text by making the keyword an “Internal Link”.  Please only link a keyword the first time it appears in your article.
* Common abbreviations should be spelled out with the abbreviation in parenthesis for its first use in each article.
* Please write in third-person style.
* Please spell check.
* For all other matters of style, please refer to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style|Wikipedia Manual of Style]

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''The Cuban Missile Crisis'''==

===Summary===

The Cuban Missile Crisis, in October 1962, was probably the closest the United States and the Soviet Union came to initiating nuclear war. The placing of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, aimed at the United States, could have escalated into a full scale war between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union allied with the new revolutionary government of Fidel Castro in Cuba not only because Khrushchev supported revolutions which overthrew &quot;oppressive&quot; capitalist regimes, but also to use Cuba strategically against the United States. It is possible that Khrushchev placed nuclear missiles in Cuba within reach of almost all USA because the United States had surrounded the Soviet Union with their own nuclear missiles, especially in Turkey. By the end of October 1962, the possibility of nuclear war had been averted by negotiations between US President John Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, but the “winner” of the situation was not immediately clear. 

However, there was another possible scenario- a Soviet first strike according to Soviet colonel Oleg Penkovsky, who used his position both in Military Intelligence and contacts with high ranking generals to determine Kruschev's alleged ambitions to spark a nuclear war. Colonel Penkovsky, who fought Hitler's armies in World War II called Kruschev &quot;the atomic Hitler&quot; in his warnings to MI-6 and CIA. Penkovsky gave his life to provide technical data and operating manuals on the 1000 mile range SS-4 which is widely known to have been deployed to Cuba, but also on the 2100 mile range SS-5. The SS-5's deployed to Cuba would have put almost all of the continental US within the reach of Soviet IRBM's tipped with 3 MT warheads. Thankfully, none of the SS-5's seem to have been armed, although a few of the SS-4's were armed and under local field control in case Moscow was hit in a nuclear exchange.

===Background===

As early as the Vienna summit between Kennedy and Khrushchev in June 1961, Khrushchev defended the Cuban revolution and the legitimacy of the Castro regime. Khrushchev held that no country had the right to be involved in Cuba's internal affairs, but that, if Castro's government was not the right one, another revolution would inevitably depose Castro because the Cuban people would be dissatisfied with his regime. Already at this summit, the tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union in regard to Cuba can be seen. The discussion of Cuba established Khrushchev’s objectives for Cuba. He reaffirmed Soviet policy supporting nationalist movements by defending Castro’s revolution in Cuba. He also used the summit to warn Kennedy not to intervene in Cuba; basically warning the United States not to invade Cuba. Khrushchev also brought into discussion the US nuclear missiles in Turkey.

===Buildup===

Both Kennedy and Khrushchev wanted to avoid nuclear war at all costs. Khrushchev realized that the United States possessed far more nuclear weapons and had them strategically better deployed to strike against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union possessed far fewer nuclear missiles, and they were mainly obsolete, and very few, if any, were positioned to strike the continental United States. Khrushchev worried about the missile gap between the two superpowers and desired the placement of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba to match the US missile placement along the Soviet border. Over the summer, and into the autumn of 1962, Khrushchev sent Soviet missiles to Cuba to threaten the US border. By October 1962, the situation had escalated to the brink of war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Since Kennedy and Khrushchev both wished to avoid war, the two leaders opened negotiations with the other to alleviate the tensions brought by the placement of the missiles.

===Negotiations===

On 26 October 1962, Khrushchev, in a private letter to Kennedy, offered to remove the Soviet missiles in Cuba in exchange for a pledge by the United States not to invade Cuba. Publicly, Khrushchev blamed Kennedy for pushing the two countries closer to war with aggressive behavior towards Cuba, and for the blockade prohibiting Soviet ships from entering the Caribbean. Khrushchev’s reason for blaming Kennedy for trying to start a war was to legitimize the presence of Soviet missiles in the western hemisphere. The only way the Soviet Union could win a nuclear war against the United States would be to turn international opinion against the United States.

The following day, 27 October 1962, Khrushchev added the removal of US missiles in Turkey to his demands. Although Khrushchev desperately needed to avoid war with the United States, he criticized the United States’ hypocrisy regarding defense policy. The United States intervened in other nations’ internal affairs to protect its own interests, but denied the Soviet Union that same right. Khrushchev guaranteed the sovereignty of Turkey and pledged not to invade Turkey, but demanded that the United States pledge not to invade Cuba, and remove American missiles in Turkey in exchange for the removal of the Soviet missiles in Cuba. This arrangement would partially ease the reciprocity issue to Khrushchev’s benefit. Later on the 27th, Kennedy responded favorably to Khrushchev’s letter of the previous day. Kennedy agreed to remove the blockade and give assurances against an American invasion of Cuba in exchange for the immediate removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba.

Kennedy’s letter to Khrushchev signalled the easing of the tensions between the two nations over the Missile Crisis. Khrushchev responded to Kennedy’s letter by agreeing to Kennedy’s terms and proposing future exchanges regarding the prohibition of nuclear weapons, disarmament, and the defusing of international tension. Essentially, Khrushchev was hinting at the beginning of the period of 'dètente', or 'peaceful coexistence'. Once again, Khrushchev stressed the removal of American missiles in Turkey as part of the agreement. To ensure that the Cuban situation did not erupt into war during the negotiations, Khrushchev wrote to Castro warning him to be patient and not to provoke war with the United States by downing U2 planes. In another letter to Castro on 30 October 1962, Khrushchev commented that the aggressor (the United States) was the loser of the Missile Crisis.

On 20 November 1962, President Kennedy announced to the press that if all Soviet missiles were removed from Cuba, then the United States would &quot;neither initiate nor permit aggression in this hemisphere.” Essentially, Kennedy was issuing his no-invasion pledge for Cuba in agreement with the Soviet Union. In April 1963, Kennedy removed the American missiles from Turkey, thus fulfilling the last of Khrushchev’s demands.

===Effects===
The Cuban Missile Crisis showed the superpowers that they had no option but to co-exist peacefully. It began the so-called period of 'dètente', which lasted until the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. This period started with the introduction of a telephone hotline between the White House and the Kremlin, called 'IWIK', and the agreement that the USA would sell grain to the USSR. It also included a series of treaties, including the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, and the two Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I and II).

==='''United States Relations with Russia 1861 to 1865'''===
Throughout the American Civil War, tsarist Russia maintained a diplomatic friendship with the United States that remained diplomatically unofficial until after the war ended. Although the United States and Russia had similar “peculiar institutions” prior to the war, slavery in the United States and serfdom in Russia, the Russians did not view serfdom in the same light as slavery. Even after the Confederacy seceded, the majority of Russians still viewed the United States with contempt in regard to segregation and racism. However, Tsar Alexander II had freed the serfs in Russia before Lincoln’s inauguration, giving Lincoln partial justification for emancipating American slaves. During the war, Russia needed American goodwill and support due to increasing tensions with England and France, than the United States needed Russian support. This essay will attempt to construe the nature of the friendship between Russia and the United States, the reasons for this friendship, and the effects of the friendship.

By the time of Lincoln’s inauguration in March 1861, Russian Minister to the United States Edouard de Stoeckl had been in America for twenty years and had been Minister for seven.  Stoeckl had witnessed the gradual decline into secession and war. He witnessed the deaths of the “Great Compromisers” in the early 1850’s, and was dismayed by the lack of ability remaining in Congress.  Stoeckl personally held a low opinion of Lincoln-criticizing what he perceived to be Lincoln’s indecisiveness, ignorance, and inability to perform the presidential duties-and, alternately, a rather high opinion of his friend, Jefferson Davis.  In April 1861, Stoeckl volunteered to act as a mediator between Confederate commissioners and Federal representatives to determine the status of the Confederacy peacefully. Secretary of State William Seward declined to participate in the mediation, which the Confederates wholeheartedly supported.  

Russia was the first nation to stand behind the Union in friendliness. The nature of this relationship was not one of support - the Russian leadership did not love democracy - but one of convenience. Russia aligned itself with the United States because England and France, Russia’s enemies, aligned themselves more closely with the Confederate States.  Although the Russian aristocracy had no use for democracy, they feared insurgency. Along with all other conservative monarchs in Europe, Tsar Alexander II would not recognize the Confederacy mainly because he considered it a revolutionary regime in an era of frequent revolutions and regime changes in Europe.  It is apparent that the Tsar, as well as other monarchs, feared that the insurrection mounted by the Confederacy would spark the beginning of another round of revolutions throughout Europe. It is interesting to note at this point that extremely few European nations retain their monarchs a century later. 

Russia had a second motive to align itself behind the United States. A reunited United States would potentially be a powerful ally for the Russians, an ally that Russia desperately needed after losing the Crimean War.  In 1863, Tsar Alexander II ordered the Russian Atlantic Fleet and the Pacific Fleet to United States ports for the winter.  Many construed this action to mean that Russia was openly aiding the Union and that the Russian Navy would supplement the Federal Navy against the Confederacy. However, this apparent meaning proved false. Tensions between Russia and England were escalating over Russian actions against the Polish and war between the two was on the horizon. The Tsar sent the navy to the United States so that the naval fleets would not be trapped by the winter ice in arctic Russia ports.  An underlying motive probably was to warm American support for Russia in case of war with England. 

The effects of the relationship between Russia and the United States were relatively few, but very important. In 1861, the Russian government proposed a land based telegraph line from the United States to Europe through Canada and Russia. This plan was later abandoned in 1867 when the Atlantic cable was laid, but throughout the war Lincoln and the Congress supported this option as the most viable.  Russia also agreed to refuse to participate in any European planned intervention or interference into American affairs. This agreement came in 1863 with France and England trying to persuade Russia to participate in a European intervention in the American Civil War. Coinciding with this invitation was an invitation from England and France to the United States to act against Russia for its suppression of Poland.  These invitations to both the United States and Russia were no more than a western European attempt to disrupt the diplomatic relationship between those two nations.  Russia’s refusal of the France-England invitation was to ensure that the United States would not interfere in Russian affairs in return. Lincoln maintained American isolationist policy by refusing the France-England invitation to react against Russia, even though he was personally opposed to Russian despotism.  

On 3 March 1861, Tsar Alexander II freed over twenty million serfs in Russia and ended serfdom forever.  This action gave American abolitionists fuel for their fight against slavery and helped to justify Lincoln’s decision to free the slaves in America. The main difference in the two emancipations was race. The serfs were of the same race and heritage, spoke the same language, had the same religion, and shared the same culture as their masters. Upon emancipation, the serfs gained full civil rights (to Russian standards), self government, and had a claim to the land they had toiled on for years.  American emancipation was much different. The slaves were of a different race and considered inferior to their masters. They were not allowed to worship with their masters; they had a different heritage and culture, and many times spoke a different language adopted solely by slaves. Upon emancipation they were granted civil rights by law, but in practice most of those rights were denied. They were kept out of government by their former masters and could not make a claim on the land on which they had previously toiled.  The treatment of former slaves by white Americans soured relations with Russia somewhat. Russia was critical of segregation and racism within the United States and became vocal in their criticisms. 

Russia and the United States maintained friendly relations during the American Civil War. The reasons for this friendliness differ between the two nations; both had a need for international friends, but both were wary of the other. The nature of this relationship was opportunistic-Russia needed a strong ally against England and France, and the United States needed a quasi-ally to disrupt European interference in American affairs. The effects of the relationship were based on the nature of the relationship. Both Russia and the United States were able to disrupt intervention into their affairs by western European powers by maintaining their diplomatic friendliness. Diplomatic relations between Russia and the United States were important in the course that each nation made its own.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Monasticism==

[[File:Abbaye de Lérins.jpg|thumb|right|Lérins Abbey is a Cistercian monastery. There has been a monastic community present on the island of Saint-Honorat (one of the Lérins Islands) since the 5th century.]]

Monasticism developed from the ancient practice of eremeticism, or isolating oneself from the “civilized” world. Hermits would isolate themselves in the “wilderness” to be closer to God and battle with their inner demons. Anthony of Egypt was an influential hermit who lived for 105 years, fighting demons in the wilderness for much of his life. From eremeticism developed monasticism to oversee the spiritual needs of the hermits. A main purpose of eremeticism and monasticism was to maintain an ascetic lifestyle. The depravity of an ascetic life was to encourage a closer connection to God and to allow a greater focus on spiritual duties. Monasticism spread from the east into Italy and southern Gaul in the fifth century.

The Monastery of Lérins was founded in AD410 as a training center for bishops that combined Egyptian severity with an intellectual dimension.  By the beginning of the sixth century, monasticism had gained wide support throughout Europe with many monasteries being constructed in the north by newly converted Irish Christians. St. Benedict, founder of the Monastery of Monte Cassino, created a set of rules for monks to follow. Other monastic rules followed, the Rule of St. Columba of Iona among them. Monastic rule generally allowed only a very strict, severe lifestyle with allotments for prayer, work, and scholastic pursuits.  The early Irish Christians developed “white martyrdom” specifically for those entering into the ascetic life of the monastery. In Ireland, the monastery developed as the center of Christian society rather than the bishops as on the continent. The monasteries of Ireland became major centers of learned culture as well as spiritual centers. Literacy was especially important for the continued spread of Christianity. 

On the continent, the Germanic kings were establishing royal monasteries for unwed family members and political opponents. These monasteries fell under the protection of the royal family, but could fall out of favor quickly if the exchange of fiscal “gifts” to the monastery were not returned by spiritual blessings. These continental monasteries organized the surrounding territory and residents for the kings in return for financial support and land. With the accumulation of land, the monasteries were able to gain a semblance of financial independence rather than relying solely on the generosity of the kings. The kings also granted the monasteries immunities from royal taxes and law.   With the acquisition of land and resources, the monasteries became important economically as centers of trade. 

As well as economic importance, monasteries became centers of scholarship and culture. Books were produced at many monasteries, spreading ideas around Europe and educating the upper classes that sent children to learn at the monastery. In Ireland, a penitential discipline developed that regularized the penance system throughout Europe. However, by the eighth century, monastic reform had begun in Carolingian France. The Monastery of St. Gall was rebuilt in AD818 as the model of an ideal Carolingian monastery. In AD910, the most important monastery of the Middle Ages was constructed at Cluny. Cluny was chartered as a completely independent monastery with no secular or Church authority above it.  Cluny became a major component of monastic reform, establishing a monastical empire as its monks replaced the abbots of corrupt monasteries throughout Europe. In the era of feudal mutation, Cluny remained a source of continuity for the Frankish world and provided a nucleus of stability. The idea of a prayer confraternity was also developed at Cluny, allying it with powerful nobles and kings in the disintegrating Frankish Empire. The power of Cluny as an economic, political, scholastical, and spiritual institution marked the height of monasticism in Europe. The power of the monastery had never been greater before Cluny, and monastical power began to wane during the Middle Ages as powerful warlords and kings rose to power across Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Development of the Medieval Church==
Christianity transformed from a persecuted, unorganized group of believers into a hierarchical, dominating Church over the course of seven centuries, developing alongside the changing political environment of post-Roman Europe. The development of the institution of the Catholic Church and the spread of Christ throughout Europe during these seven centuries directly impacted every aspect of late-antiquity and early-medieval life, especially politics and the relationship between kings and religion. During this time period the Church rejected its domination by the Roman and Byzantine emperors, in turn exerting its own type of spiritual dominance over the rulers of post-Roman Europe. Christianity, through the Church, became organized and “conquered” all of Europe by the time of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. 
 
Christianity had developed as a religious idea in Roman Palestine, and had slowly spread throughout the eastern part of the Empire toward the west. During the first three centuries of its existence, Christianity remained disorganized and concentrated within the cities. Each group of believers centered around a few charismatic local leaders and developed their own liturgy.   However, the conversion of Emperor Constantine in AD312 changed the structure of Christianity and turned it into a well-organized, quasi-political institution. The Church provided Constantine with a tool to use to hold together the crumbling Empire. The Church came under the Emperor’s control with the Emperor as the ''divus caesar'', or divine emperor.  Constantine used the Christian bishops as imperial officials to administer law and justice throughout the Empire. These “imperial bishops” answered directly to the Emperor, thus instituting imperial dominance over the Church. The Council of Nicaea in AD325 further brought the Church under imperial control with the establishment of a uniform liturgy to use throughout the Empire and approved by the Emperor.  Imperial dominance was completed with Theodosius II proclaiming Christianity to be the official religion of the Roman Empire a century later. Thus began the period of ''praeparatio evangelii'', the Christian conquering of the world. 

The Western Roman Empire gradually collapsed during the fourth and fifth centuries to be replaced by “barbarian” kingdoms that thought of themselves as “Roman” and maintained many of the classical Roman institutions. The political structure and culture of the new kingdoms was different, however. Germanic kings with long hair and animal skins took the place of the emperors.  These barbaric kings had been converted to Christianity during the Roman Empire by missionaries, but practiced Arianism rather than Roman Catholicism. Christianity continued to thrive under the Germanic kings, spreading the religion through Western Europe. In AD508, Clovis of the Franks converted to Christianity followed by his warriors and subjects.  He was followed by the Visigothic king, Reccared in AD589 by the conversion of Ireland during the sixth century.  Under the Germanic kings, the Christian bishops became the predominant source of continuity between the Empire and the Germanic kingdoms. The bishops also became a source of great power in the post-Roman kingdoms. Germanic kings used the bishops as a link between the king and the Roman citizens living in the kingdom. The bishops grew very powerful serving as the representative of the largest class of subjects. The kings recognized this power and acknowledged it by granting the bishops political power to administer to the needs of the former Romans. Monasteries also became important institutions for the Germanic kings. The monasteries became centers of culture, scholarship, and economics, enabling the Germanic kings to better govern their kingdoms through the established religious institutions. 

To increase their political power and tighten their rule of the countryside, the kings and nobles founded their own royal monasteries to supplement their own spiritual power. The idea that the Christian God would assist Christian rulers to effectively rule their kingdoms and gain victory in battle began to be developed in Western Europe. However, close ties between kings and the Church was not the only factor transforming the Church. The spread of Christianity into Ireland in the sixth century played a major role in changing Church liturgy. The Irish readily accepted Christianity as their own religion and with the fanaticism of the newly converted began to zealously transform previous Christian thought and liturgy to better suit their situation. The Irish developed a slightly different form of Christianity and sent missionaries across Europe spreading the Irish version of Christianity.  Irish missionaries and monasteries influenced and transformed Christianity from the seventh century onward. 

[[File:Sacre de Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|right|The Coronation Of Charlemagne from an Illuminated Manuscript by Jean Fouquet (1455-1460)]]

Christianity was again transformed and adapted to suit the wishes of a powerful ruler with the ascension of Charlemagne. Charlemagne was an influential proponent in the creation of “Christian kingship.” Unlike the situation the Church experienced under the Roman Emperors, with the Emperor controlling Church policy and actions, the notion of Christian kingship placed the Church in a powerful position, while not actually dominating the king. Charlemagne’s father, Pippen, received the Pope’s blessing in AD751 to become king of the Franks. This established a very strong connection between the Church and the Carolingian line of Frankish kings.  Due to this strong link, the Carolingian kings were willing to become the protectors of the Papacy in destroying the power of the Lombards in Italy and guaranteeing the independence of Rome. Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Franks by Pope Leo III in AD800 and continued to carry out a policy of ''praeparatio evangelii'' by spreading Christianity everywhere his military conquests led him.  Under Charlemagne, Christianity emerged as a political concept as well as a religious one. Much like the Visigoths before him, Charlemagne viewed kingship as a religious office and the kingdom as the Church. In this there was no separation of Church and state-they became one entity. Secular law was replaced by Christian law and the bishops became even more powerful than they had previously been.  The reign of Charlemagne was marked by a merging of Christian ideals with Germanic kingship, creating unity throughout the Frankish Empire. However, the next transformation of Christianity would ultimately destroy the unity enjoyed under Charlemagne and his immediate successors.

Upon the death of Charlemagne’s son, Louis the Pious, his three grandsons engaged in a civil war for succession to the imperial throne. The result of this war was the division of Charlemagne’s Empire into three parts. The three grandsons attempted to restore the glory of Charlemagne, but were all three unsuccessful. The idea of Christian kingship continued with the three grandsons, but the quality of rulers declined over the next half century so that by AD900, the internal divisions and the increasing irrelevancy of the king transformed the political and religious landscape of Europe. This was the period of feudal mutation and marked the end of Church independence and freedom throughout Europe.  In the place of kings, local, independent nobles arose to govern the countryside. The monasteries, churches, and bishops came under the influence of these local warlords.  powerful monasteries and bishops assumed control of the local area themselves and governed them directly as the local lord. As can be seen in the account by Hugh of Lusignan, bishops assumed regional power and acted independent of Rome and other religious centers.  The Church was tied into the vassalage system with clerics invested into proprietary churches by local nobles. By the turn of the first millennium, the power of the Church in Rome had been eroded, and the unity of the Church throughout Europe had been destroyed. Christianity still remained in Europe as the dominant religion (only religion in most places), but the Roman Catholic Church had been divided by the political turmoil engulfing Europe following the collapse of Charlemagne’s Empire. 

Christianity had transformed greatly throughout the first millennium of its existence along with the changing political culture of Europe. The collapse of the Roman Empire in the fourth and fifth centuries gave rise to an increasingly powerful and influential Church that would remain so for five hundred years. However, the onset of the feudal mutation and the collapse of imperial and royal power in Europe in the tenth century led to the division and subjugation of the Church.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=The Histories of Shakespeare=

History was an important Elizabethan entertainment genre. In the theater and real life, Elizabethans were very interested in their kings and the mechanations of power, and Shakespeare was one of those that helped fill this demand. Incidentally, we learn quite a bit about the time.

Eight of Shakespeare's history plays concern the [[w:Wars of the Roses|Wars of the Roses]] between the houses of [[w:House_of_Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[w:House_of_York|York]].

In historical sequence, the plays of the War of the Roses cycle are as follows:

* Richard II
* Henry IV, part 1
* Henry IV, part 2
* Henry V
* Henry VI, part 1
* Henry VI, part 2
* Henry VI, part 3
* Richard III

The other two plays of Shakespeare that are grouped with his histories are King John and Henry VIII.

==Part A: Description==

In this lesson you will learn to greet anyone with the appropriate level of formality.

The level formality for many sentences, including greetings, is more complex than in English. But we will see here that it is quite easy to show respect or sound formal.

The first word to know is '''mayáp''', ''good''. Then you need the word describing the time of day: 
'''ábak''' ''morning'', '''ugtú''' ''noon'', '''gatpanápun''' ''afternoon'', '''béngi''' ''night'',  

If you want to be formal and respectful to elderly, you need the word '''pu''' and the following construction then applies:

'''Mayáp a gatpanápun pu'''   ''Good afternoon, sir'' or ''Good afternoon, madam'' showing respect for an older person.

The '''a''' simply links ''good'' with ''afternoon'' and is a compulsory link word. But an interesting phenomenon is that Kapampangan does not allow 2 vowels and so words starting with a vowel have a '''y''' added at the beginning if they are after the compulsory preposition '''a''':

'''Mayáp a yábak pu''' ''Good morning, sir'' or  ''Good morning, madam'' showing respect for an older person.

Another frequently used phrase is '''Kumustá''' which means both ''Hello'', and ''How are you?''. It is borrowed from the Spanish ''Como esta?'' which means exactly ''How are you?''

==Part B: Application==

Given the rules here above, we can generate the following set of phrases:

{| 
| style=&quot;width:150px&quot; | ''Hello, how are you?'' || Kumustá? ''(Span.)''
|-
|| ''Good noon'' (literally) || Mayáp a yugtú
|-
|| ''Good night''|| Mayáp a béngi
|}

You noted that in Kapampangan one can say &quot;good noon&quot;. Although it might sound unusual to you, this is simply used when you meet someone at noon or around lunch time.

==Part C: Exercises==

Translate the following English sentences into Kapampangan:

* Good afternoon
* Hello madam, how are you?

Translate the following Kapampangan into English:

* Mayáp a béngi pu
* Mayáp a yábak

[[Kapampangan/Solutions to all exercises#Greeting|Solutions]]

==Part D: Summary==

You can now correctly greet anyone you meet in Pampanga, and not be perceived to be rude.
Here is the list of words and greeting phrases that you have learned:

{|
|style=&quot;width:150px&quot;| mayáp || ''good''
|-
||ábak  || ''morning''
|-
||ugtú || ''noon''
|-
||gatpanápun || ''afternoon''
|-
||béngi || ''night'' 
|-
||pu || word indicating respect for the person that you talk to 
|-
||a || link word between an adjective and a noun
|-
||Kumustá || ''Hello, how are you?'' 
|-
||mayáp a yábak  || ''Good morning''
|-
||mayáp a yugtú || ''Good noon''
|-
||mayáp a gatpanápun || ''Good afternoon'' 
|-
||mayáp a béngi || ''Good night'' 
|}

==Part A: Pronouncing Kapampangan words in this book==
This first lesson is essential for you to be able to pronounce the words that we have printed in this book.
Here we will learn a few basic words, and how to pronounce them.

===Consonants===

Most consonants are pronounced like in English. But a few have a specific behaviour:

* '''r''' is rolled and pronounced in the same manner as the Spanish, Italian and Russian pronounce it, but not like in English nor like in French.
* '''dy''' is pronounced like in English ''Jack''
* '''sy''' is pronounced like in English ''shine''
* '''ts''' is pronounced ''ts'', like in English ''tsar'', but sometimes drifts into a pronounciation that sounds more like ''tch'' like in English ''cheer''. You will be understood however, if you always pronounce ''ts''.
* '''ng''' is pronounced like in the English word ''sing''. But beware, this sound can appear at the begining of a word, not only the middle or the end.
* The glotal stop, that we indicate with an apostrophe ''' ' ''' is pronounced in the same way as the ''t'' is pronounced in [[w:Estuary English|Estuary English]] in words like ''bottom'' (bo'om), ''Britain'' (bri'ain} or ''that'' (tha'). However a glottal stop that occurs at the end of a word is often omitted when it's in the middle of a sentence.

===Vowels===

There are 5 vowels:

* '''a''' similar to English ''f'''a'''ther''
* '''i''' similar to English ''mach'''i'''ne'', but shorter like ''b'''i'''t'' when not stressed.
* '''u''' similar to English ''l'''oo'''p'' but shorter like ''b'''oo'''k'' when not stressed.
* '''e''' similar to English ''b'''e'''d''
* '''o''' somewhere between English ''f'''o'''rty'' and English ''d'''o'''g'' 


When they are not stressed, '''i''' and '''e''' are nearly interchangeable: there are many words that can be pronounced and written using either of the two vowels, for example, '''king''' can be pronounced and written '''keng''', '''íni''' can become '''íne'''.
Also '''o''' and '''u''' are frequently interchangeable if unstressed: '''nukarín''' can be pronounced and written '''nokarín''', '''kumustá''' can be pronounced and written '''komustá''', etc.
Although we try to use a consistent spelling in this book, there is currently no consensus on the spelling for unstressed vowels and it may be that this book sometimes contains both possible spellings.

===Stress===

Each word with more than one syllable is stressed in a specific way: the stress either appears in the last syllable, or in the last-but-one syllable. If it is the last-but-one, it is accompanied by a legthening of the stressed vowel.
We indicate the stress in this book with the following sign above the vowel of the stressed syllable: ’
Please note that the stress is usually not written in texts or web sites, however, we indicate it in every word, since this is the only way that you can learn to pronounce each word correctly.

==Part B: Application==

Here is an example for each of these specific sounds in a simple word. Note the stress location.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- bgcolor=&quot;#EFEFEF;&quot;
!Kapampangan word
!Translation
!Hear it
!English-like pronunciation
!IPA pronunciation
!Comment
|-
| ''' reló '''  || ''wristwatch'' ||  {{audio|Pam-ph-relo.ogg|Listen}}  || rrEh-loh || {{IPA|[rɛ:'lo]}} || Remember to roll the r-s as in Spanish
|-
| ''' dyip ''' ''Eng.''  || ''jeep'' || {{audio|Pam-ph-dyip.ogg|Listen}}  || jip || {{IPA|[dʒip]}} || Same as English ''Jack'' 
|-
| ''' syémpre '''  || ''of course'' || {{audio|Pam-ph-syempre.ogg|Listen}}  || shEh-m-prreh|| {{IPA|['ʃɛ:mprɛ]}} || Same as English  ''shame''
|-
| ''' tsa '''  || ''tea'' || {{audio|Pam-ph-tsa.ogg|Listen}}  || ts-ah  or tch-ah || {{IPA|[tsa]}} or {{IPA|[tʃa]}}|| Same as English ''tsar'' or drifting to ''chat''
|-
| ''' ngan '''  || ''everyone'' || {{audio|Pam-ph-ngan.ogg|Listen}}  || ng-an|| {{IPA|[ŋan]}} || Same as English  ''singing''
|-
| ''' yátu' '''  || ''world'' || {{audio|Pam-ph-yatu.ogg|Listen}}  || yAh-tu + end of word t in Estuary English || {{IPA|['ja:tuʔ]}} || Glotal stop: Remember to stop abruptly at the end of the word.
|-
| ''' óbra ''' ''Span.'' || ''work, job'' || {{audio|Pam-ph-obra.ogg|Listen}}  || O-brrah|| {{IPA|['o:bra]}} || The o is somewhere between ''dog'' and ''forty''
|-
| ''' uktúbri ''' ''Span.'' || ''October'' || {{audio|Pam-ph-uktubre.ogg|Listen}}   || uk-tU-brri || {{IPA|[uk'tu:bri]}} || The second u is like ''loop'' 
|-
|}

You can click on the sound file to here a native speaker pronounce the word.
You can note that there is no stress indicated for '''ngan''', '''tsa''' and '''dyip'''. This is because there is only one syllable (vowel) and therefore there is no need to indicate it.

You can now even answer when asked what you would like for a drink:&lt;br&gt;
- '''syémpre, tsa!'''  
''Tea, of course!''

==Part C: Exercises==

Given the rules described above, pronounce the following words:

{|
| style=&quot;width:100px&quot; | '''ngéni''' ||''now''
|-
|| '''yélu''' ||''ice''
|-
|| '''syam''' ||''nine''
|-
|| '''réni''' ||''these''
|-
|| '''dyéli''' ||''jelly''
|-
|| '''tsinélas''' ||''slippers''
|}

[[Kapampangan/Solutions to all exercises#Pronouncing Kapampangan|Solutions]]

==Part D: Summary==

In this lesson you have learned how to pronounce each vowel and consonant of the Kapampangan language.
You have a also learned the following words:

{|
| style=&quot;width:100px&quot; |ngéni|| style=&quot;width:180px&quot; | ''now'' || style=&quot;width:100px&quot;  | dyip || ''jeep'' 
|-
||yélu|| ''ice''|| syémpre ||  ''of course''
|-
||syam|| ''nine''|| tsa ||  ''tea'' 
|-
||réni|| ''these''|| ngan ||  ''everyone'' 
|-
||dyéli|| ''jelly''|| yátu' ||  ''world'' 
|-
||tsinélas|| ''slippers''|| óbra || ''work''
|-
|| reló || ''wristwatch'' || uktúbre ||  ''October''
|}

Try to remember these words, they will be useful later for constructing sentences.

==Part E: IPA sound charts==

|}


There are two diphthongs; {{IPA|/oɪ/}}, and {{IPA|/iʊ/}}, which we simply write '''oi''' and '''iu'''.

We have become gene-centric in the last half century, but I think it is important to keep the focus of a true genetics text on patterns and causes of variation. If this is planned as a text on genetics it will be important to keep the focus on sources of biological variation; whether caused by gene variants, epigenetic modification, somatic mutation, stochastic developmental process, or environmental effects.  Students need to understand from the get-go that genetics in not just the study of genes. That is an easy mistake to make. 

For this reason the introduction could use help at two levels.

1. Genetics as a field of study predates a well defined DNA gene by roughly 50 years. For this reason, the first sentence needs some modification. Perhaps:

&quot;Genetics is the study of the sources and inheritance of biological variation, usually within populations that can interbreed.&quot; 

2. Only a small fraction of the genome of many species is made up of genes. 

The strict study of genes, their structure and function, is more the domain of molecular biology. Of course, many geneticists are great molecular biologist, But some of the greatest geneticists (Fisher, Wright, and Haldane) predate the era of molecular genetics.</text>

== Clinical Description ==
Otosclerosis is a progressive degenerative condition of the temporal bone which can result in hearing loss.

Chronic conductive hearing loss (CHL) is the finding in almost all cases of otosclerosis (in fact should a person present with sensorineural hearing loss they would likely never be diagnosed with otosclerosis). This usually will begin in one ear but will eventually affect both ears with a variable course. On audiometry, the hearing loss is characteristically low-frequency, with higher frequencies being affected later. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has also been noted in patients with otosclerosis; this is usually a high-frequency loss, and usually manifests late in the disease.


== Epidemiology ==
Approximately 0.5% of the population will eventually be diagnosed with otosclerosis. Interestingly, post mortem studies show that as many as 10% of people may have otosclerotic lesions of their temporal bone, but apparently never had symptoms warranting a diagnosis. Whites are the most affected race, with the prevalence in the Black and Asian populations being much lower. Females are twice as likely as males to be affected. Usually noticeable hearing loss begins at middle-age, but can start much sooner. The disease can be considered to be heritable, but its penetrance and the degree of expression is so highly variable that it may be difficult to detect an inheritance pattern. Most of the implicated genes are transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion.


== Pathophysiology ==
The pathophysiology of otosclerosis is complex. The key lesions of otosclerosis are multifocal areas of sclerosis within the endochondral temporal bone. These lesions share some characteristics with Paget’s Disease, but they are not thought to be otherwise related. Histopathologic studies have all been done on cadaveric temporal bones, so only inferences can be made about progression of the disease histologically. This being said, it seems that the lesions go through an active “spongiotic” / hypervascular phase before developing into “sclerotic” phase lesions. There have been many genes and proteins identified that, when mutated, may lead to these lesions. Also there is mounting evidence that measles virus is present within the otosclerotic foci, implicating an infectious etiology (this has also been noted in Paget’s Disease).

CHL in otosclerosis is caused by two main sites of involvement of the sclerotic (or scar-like) lesions. The best understood mechanism is fixation of the stapes footplate to the oval window of the cochlea. This greatly impairs movement of the stapes and therefore transmission of sound into the inner ear (“ossicular coupling”). Additionally the cochlea’s round window can also become sclerotic, and in a similar way impair movement of sound pressure waves through the inner ear (“acoustic coupling”).

SNHL in otosclerosis is controversial. Over the past century, leading otologists and neurotologic researchers have argued whether the finding of SNHL late in the course of otosclerosis is due to otosclerosis or simply to typical presbycusis. There are certainly a few well documented instances of sclerotic lesions directly obliterating sensory structures within the cochlea and spiral ligament, which have been photographed and reported post-mortem. Other supporting data includes a consistent loss of cochlear hair cells in patients with otosclerosis; these cells being the chief sensory organs of sound reception. A suggested mechanism for this is the release of hydrolytic enzymes into the inner ear structures by the spongiotic lesions.


== Treatment Options ==
Treatment of otosclerosis relies on two primary options: hearing aids and a surgery called a stapedectomy. Hearing aids are usually very effective early in the course of the disease, but eventually a stapedectomy may be required for definitive treatment. Modern stapedectomy consists of removing a portion of the sclerotic stapes footplate and replacing it with an implant that is secured to the incus. When possible, the stapes may be able to be freed from its sclerotic attachments to the oval window, eliminating the need for an implant. Both of these methods restore continuity of ossicular movement and allow transmission of sound waves to the inner ear.

Other less successful treatment includes fluoride administration, which theoretically becomes incorporated into bone and inhibits otosclerotic progression. Recently, some success has been reported with bisphosphonate medications, which stimulate bone-deposition without stimulating bony destruction.

==About the book==
[[Image:The_Elements.png|right|267px]]'''Welcome to [[Wikijunior]] The Elements.'''

The target age of this title is 8–12 years old.  Section titles will include elements children may have heard of or are particularly interesting.  The print version will focus only on answering a specific series of questions about the elements plus an explanation of what an element is.  There will be an introduction and a glossary.  Other articles of general interest about the Elements as a group may also be included. 

When working on this project, remember that it is aimed at children. Being understood is just as important as being accurate. Authors should concentrate on the most important concepts rather than getting wrapped up in every detail. Use technical vocabulary when you need to, but don't use big words where simpler language would work.

&lt;font color=green&gt; Nánung lagyú' mu?&lt;/font&gt;

==Introducing Yourself, Part Two==

Write the following conversation in Kapampangan and then read it aloud:

* You meet what seems to be an elderly relative of your friend in that same party, but you are not certain: ask them their name. 

&lt;font color=green&gt; Mayáp a yábak pu. Nánu pu ing lagyú' yu?&lt;/font&gt;

* They are indeed: indroduce yourself to them, and express how nice it is to meet them. 

&lt;font color=green&gt; Áku pu y &lt;your name&gt;. Masayá ku pu ing akilála kayú. &lt;/font&gt;

* Finally, introduce a friend called Lisa to them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Good and Bad - Introduction==

''In nature there is no good and no bad.'' - Baruch de Spinoza

In the behavior of animals egoism, altruismus, child murder and self sacrifice exist. All examples are realized. Good and bad appear as conflicting emotions even in one and the same individuum. Nature is not too fastidious in a human moral sense. Good and bad like social and loving or in the opposite as egoistic and aggressiv behavior are more or less found in every animal at the same time. There exist completely opposite ways of acting. An ape, which is extremely aggressive against the members of a strange group, can be very loving to his own children at the same time. Whether the ape is concsious of this contrast or not, is difficult to find out. For human beings the demarcation of good and bad might make substantial problems.

[[Image:ItsukushimaDeer7389.jpg|left|thumb|'''The Deer, for some people a symbol for the innocent and good.''']]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;


An animal must defend itself against other animals. Members of the same species but of foreign groups are classified primarily as strange and dangerous. They must be fought against, they might even be killed. As a wild animal a lion for example must kill other animals in order to  survive. At the same time each animal must support the survival of its own family or kinship.



==Theodizee==
Die Existenz von so vielem Übel in der Welt ist aus Sicht der Naturwissenschaften eines der stärksten und nicht zu widerlegenden Argumente gegen einen aktiv ins Weltgeschehen eingreifenden, allmächtigen und allgütigen Gott. Diese Problem tritt nicht auf, wenn man Gott als Erschaffer der Welt ansieht, der dann aber nicht mehr ins Weltgeschehen eingreift. Auch das Problem der Verletzung der Naturgesetze durch Wunder kann dann gelöst werden.

Siehe: [[w:Theodizee|Theodizee]]

In klassischer Weise wurde das Problem bereits durch den griechischen Philosophen Epikur (341-270 v. Chr) formuliert:

 Entweder will Gott die Übel beseitigen und kann es nicht: 
 dann ist Gott schwach, was auf ihn nicht zutrifft, 
 oder er kann es und will es nicht: 
 dann ist Gott missgünstig, was ihm fremd ist, 
 oder er will es nicht und kann es nicht: 
 dann ist er schwach und missgünstig zugleich, also nicht Gott, 
 oder er will es und kann es, was allein für Gott ziemt: 
 Woher kommen dann die Übel und warum nimmt er sie nicht hinweg? 

Dieser Text wurde durch Lactantius überliefert. Einige Formulierungen dürften eher der Theologie des Lactantius entsprechen als der Theologie Epikurs. Nach Epikur waren die Götter selige Wesen, die sich nicht um die Welt kümmerten.

==Das Gewissen==
Bei der Frage nach Gut und Böse kommt eine interessante ethische Funktion im menschlichen Gehirn ins Spiel: das Gewissen. 

Über das '''Gewissen''' gibt es die unterschiedlichsten Ansichten, Meinungen oder Theorien. 

Viele stellen sich unter ''Gewissen'' eine spezielle Instanz des menschlichen Bewusstseins vor, die einen dazu ''drängt'' aus ethischen und sozialen Gründen bestimmte Handlungen auszuführen oder zu unterlassen. Entscheidungen können dabei als unausweichlich ''empfunden'' werden oder mehr oder weniger ''bewusst'', also ''im '''Wissen''' um ihre Voraussetzungen und denkbaren Folgen'', vorgenommen werden (Verantwortung). 

Handelt ein Mensch entsprechend seinem Gewissen, ist er oder ''fühlt er sich'' gut und zufrieden und gibt üblicherweise an, ''ein gutes'' oder ''reines Gewissen zu haben'' oder ''zu besitzen''; handelt er indessen ''entgegen seinem Wissen und Gewissen'', so ''fühlt er sich'' von dieser vermeintlichen Bewusstseinsinstanz vielleicht angeklagt oder gar verfolgt oder unter Druck gesetzt. Andere ''verspüren'' eher ein ''nagendes Gewissen'', und wieder andere ''fühlen'' sich von ''Gewissensbissen'' geplagt oder geradezu gepeinigt.  

Ersichtlich handelt es sich bei diesen geläufigen Redeweisen um alltagssprachliche Redewendungen, die über die realen Zusammenhänge kaum etwas aussagen, zumal sie teilweise deutlich metaphorischer Art sind und daher nicht wörtlich verstanden werden dürfen. Auch von anderen Voraussetzungen ausgehende Ansichten und Vorstellungen, Meinungen und Theorien von Natur und Herkunft des Gewissens scheinen kaum geeignet, etwas zur Aufklärung der psychologischen Eigenart des Gewissens beizutragen.

===Definition des Gewissens===
Man kann das Gewissen als das Bewusstsein des Menschen um Gut und Böse bezeichnen, welches dem Menschen nach naturwissenschaftlicher Weltanschauung vor allem von der sozialen Gruppe eingegepflanzt wird, in der er aufgewachsen ist oder in der er lebt. Durch den Gruppendruck entsteht der innere Antrieb, diesem Wissen entsprechend zu handeln. Nach naturwissenschaftlicher Ansicht kann man so etwas wie ein Gewissen auch bei sozialen Tieren wie beispielsweise Hunden beobachten. 

===Unterordnung und Gehorsam===
Stanley Milgram untersuchte in seinen sozialpsychologischen Experimenten der 60er Jahre  die Gehorsamsbereitschaft unter verschiedenen Bedingungen. Dabei wies er experimentell nach, wie das Gewissen je nach Versuchsanordnung ganz unterschiedlich  reagiert. Ein wichtiges Einzelergebnis ist die Widerstandsfähigkeit des Gewissens bei etwa einem Drittel der Versuchspersonen. Insbesondere der noch höhere Anteil der Verweigerer unter der Bedingung der räumlichen Nähe zum &quot;Opfer&quot; verweist auf die sozialen Komponente des Gewissens hin. 

===Gewissensgründe===
Der bundesdeutsche Gesetzgeber geht von der Existenz des Gewissens aus, zum Beispiel dadurch, dass er die Möglichkeit zur Verweigerung des Wehrdienstes aus „Gewissensgründen“ ermöglicht (Grundgesetz der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, GG Artikel 4, Punkt 3).

==Zitate==
*''Es wäre ein überzeugenderer Hinweis auf einen gütigen Schöpfer, wenn das Leben besser wäre, als wir es erwarten können ... Mein Leben war bemerkenswert glücklich und liegt wahrscheinlich bei 99,99 in einer 100er-Skala menschlichen Glücks. Doch ich mußte zuschauen, wie meine Mutter unter Schmerzen an Krebs starb, die Persönlichkeit meines Vaters durch die Alzheimer-Krankheit zerfiel und zahlreiche entferntere Verwandte im Holocaust ermordet wurden. Die Anzeichen eines gütigen Schöpfers sind ziemlich gut versteckt. Das Böse und das Leid haben schon immer jene beschäftigt, die an einen gütigen und allmächtigen Gott glauben. Manchmal wird Gott durch die Notwendigkeit des freien Willens der Menschen entschuldigt. Aber es erscheint für meine Verwandten etwas unfair, ermordet zu werden, damit Deutsche eine Gelegenheit für ihren freien Willen hatten. Davon abgesehen: Wie erklärt der freie Wille den Krebs? Braucht ein Tumor ebenfalls einen Spielraum für seinen freien Willen? Ich halte es hier nicht für nötig zu begründen, warum das Böse in der Welt beweist, daß das Universum nicht geschaffen wurde, sondern nur, daß es keine Anzeichen von Güte gibt, die die Handschrift eines Schöpfers zeigen. Die Sichtweise, Gott könne nicht gütig sein, ist schon alt. Die antiken Tragödien machen klar, daß die Götter selbstsüchtig und brutal sind, obwohl sie ein besseres Verhalten von Menschen erwarten. Der Gott des Alten Testaments fordert, daß wir das Leben unserer Kinder auf sein Geheiß hin opfern, und der Gott des traditionellen Christentums verdammt uns in alle Ewigkeit, wenn wir Ihn nicht in der rechten Weise verehren. Ist dies eine nette Art, sich zu benehmen? Ich weiß ja, wir dürfen Gott nicht nach menschlichen Maßstäben messen. Aber welche anderen Maßstäbe können wir denn anlegen, wenn wir nicht bereits von Seiner Existenz überzeugt sind und nach Anzeichen Seiner Güte suchen? Religion hat manches Gute in der Welt bewirkt, aber insgesamt sind ihre Folgen furchtbar. Meine persönliche Ansicht ist: Mit oder ohne Religion werden sich gute Menschen gut verhalten und schlechte Menschen werden Böses tun. Doch der Beitrag der Religion in der Geschichte war, es guten Menschen zu erlauben, Böses zu tun. Eine der größten Errungenschaften der Wissenschaft ist nicht, es intelligenten Leuten unmöglich zu machen, religiös zu sein, sondern es ihnen zumindest zu ermöglichen, nicht religiös zu sein. Dahinter sollten wir nicht zurückfallen.'' *Steven Weinberg, &lt;Bild der Wissenschaft&gt; 12/1999

== Overview ==

The House '''''Quidditch Team Captain''''' is in charge of selecting the players for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] team, setting practices, and coaching them in the necessary maneuvers to guide them, hopefully, to win the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup. 

== Event Details ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

There is no description of how the Captain of the house Quidditch team is selected. It would appear to be a selection made by the head of the House, presumably from among the returning team members; while it would be logical to select the most senior returning team member, this is not how the selection is made, because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] is one year senior to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], and yet Harry is selected as team captain in his sixth year, while Katie is in her seventh year.

In Gryffindor house, the Quidditch team captain for the first three years is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]]. There is no Quidditch in the fourth year because of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]; in the fifth year it is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina Johnson]], and in the sixth year it is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Flint|Marcus Flint]] is captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team for the first three years, despite his apparently having to repeat a year for academic reasons; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] is captain of the Hufflepuff team in Harry's third year. There does not seem to be any playing position that is more often chosen for the captaincy than any other; Wood is Keeper, Flint and Angelina are Chasers, and Harry and Cedric are Seekers.

As Quidditch captain, Harry has a great deal more work to do than either of his predecessors. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], because of the ongoing battle with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], Harry was banned from the Quidditch team along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]]; so Angelina did have to engineer a mid-season replacement for her Seeker and both Beaters. But in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', so many players are incapacitated or are unable to play due to detention or other concerns that both Slytherin and Gryffindor seem to field a substantially different team for every match.

== Notable Consequences ==

As Quidditch Captain, Harry is called upon to create a Quidditch team. He has a few experienced players to draw from; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]], who was on the team as Chaser when Harry first started playing as Seeker (making her only a second-year student at the time), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], who had played as Keeper the previous year, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], who, though nominally a Chaser, had filled in as Seeker while Harry was banned in the previous year, are kept on, along with himself as Seeker, but the previous year's Beaters are replaced, and a new Chaser is brought in. However, this is not a static team; over the course of the year, players are injured (Katie Bell is Jinxed, Ron is poisoned, Harry himself is injured mid-game, and later put on detention) and Harry must repeatedly juggle the roster to be sure of fielding a full team.

It is during this time that Harry begins to understand how Angelina Johnson, and before her Oliver Wood, had felt about their duties as Quidditch Captain. Harry finds that it is taking a significant part of his time and attention, but finds consolation in that as Captain, he can schedule practices when he wishes so as to avoid the &quot;Slug Club&quot; parties put on by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]. Late in the year, he also finds that practicing alongside Ginny can be quite exhilarating.

== Analysis ==

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], we are told that many of the privileges granted to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects]] are also granted to the Quidditch captain. One question that arises is exactly which of the Prefects' privileges are granted to the Quidditch captain, and why? The only one that is actually mentioned is that the Quidditch captain can use the Prefect's bathroom. It is entirely possible that this is intended as explanation of how Cedric Diggory is able to tell Harry about the Prefect's bathroom in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]; there is no mention that Cedric is a Prefect, only that he is Captain of Quidditch, and Cedric being a prefect is certainly something that Cedric's father [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Amos]], with his demonstrated excessive pride in his son's achievements, would have mentioned.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

There does not seem to be any particular significance to Harry's being made Quidditch captain. Presumably, he was the only logical choice for the position, as he had been considered good enough in his year to be considered for the position of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]], but had been passed over because he &quot;had enough responsibility to be going on with.&quot; As the Quidditch Captain receives all the privileges of the Prefects, but with less responsibility (fielding a team and coaching it to play well), it is perhaps the case that this position was given to Harry as something of a reward.

Once Harry leaves school, he does not seem to re-enter the world of Quidditch as a sport. The same cannot be said for Oliver Wood, who apparently is picked up by a professional team (Puddlemere United) on graduation, or Ginny Weasley, who, according to an interview given by the author following publication of the final book, plays professionally for a while after she and Harry are married. We can speculate that Ginny quite possibly was Quidditch captain in Harry's absence, during his seventh year, due to her demonstrated skill in both the Seeker and Chaser positions, but nothing in the story suggests this. Whether she and Oliver are selected by professional teams because of their captaincy, or because of playing skill, is unknown. We are not told of any scouting done by the professional teams at Hogwarts games, although it is logical that scouts would be present at many school games.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
About the MFC part you moved to the other book, I was the major contributor, it was created before the other book was, it didn't deal with windows in general, only the C++ part of the wrapper its classes and was an independent part of the C++ book, an addendum. You didn't know my plans or intentions to start building it, you took into your initiative to move its contents without asking and without being the one resposable for the other work also, at witch stage shouldn't I be concerned on what you do with my work and contributions ?!?
&lt;/div&gt;

I wasn't saying it has to do with Windows in general, but with Windows Programming or the Windows API. I did it based on what I thought was my best judgement at the time. Moving its contents based on what it seemed to be topic of its discussion and what the Windows Programming wikibook topic is as being more tightly related and outside the scope of the wikibook as its describe. It may have been better for me to have added a comment to its page saying I think it should be moved there and perhaps added the template suggesting merger to the top of its page and waiting awhile to see if there was any objections, rather then going with what looked like reasonable move to me.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
Authors are protected by the GFDL and have the power in enforcing a work evolution, just because they are the ones contributing content, this is a GFDL work it can be hosted anywhere in this case it is on the wikibooks, authors writing are protected and authors get to sign their work, check the GFDL for the definition and rights... As for the wikibooks in itself a book is not a wikipedia article and if your not returning from a trip to mars you know what steps are being taken to protect articles. This is even more important in wikibooks. In this case the book doesn't only fallow out the wikibooks guidelines and rules but it implements its own set of rules without violating the previous or limiting the guidelines to it's community, we have to deal with 2 communities, the wikibooks readers and the specific book users and editors and the keep track of other works being used (I do have some documentation giving me access to use some content).
&lt;/div&gt;

The GFDL gives everyone the right to distrubute and modify the contents of a document so long as previous authors are given credit for their work. GFDL protects authors from all liabilities from the use and modification of the documentation. GFDL allows authors to control their copy of the documentation, but authors give up their rights to dictate to others what is done to or with the documentation other then to enforce that people who do make use of the documentation give the same rights to everyone else. GFDL documents may be hosted anywhere, but to be hosted here at wikibooks, additional rules must be followed.

I don't know what steps your reffering to for protecting articles, however I disagree with your assertion on your rights and that the rules you make alone, aren't violating the GFDL and the rules and guidelines of Wikibooks. Wikibooks from what I can tell has no explicit policy on approaches to working together as a community to work on books and even says there is no one right way to do it and leaves open for people's interpretation of best practice, which of course other people may not agree with, such as in our case. I can understand trying to develope some helpful approaches to be used with any wikibook, so long as its agreed to by the majority of community of the wikibook in question as is required by wikibook policy. This wikibook doesn't have a clear guideline or approach that is recommanded written anywhere that I can see, which makes it open to each person's best judgement to decide what to just do and what to discussion beforehand. I'm open to trying to understand what you think on this and adobt some of it to try to reduce disagreements, so long as its reasonable and doesn't violate Wikibook Guidelines and Policy.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;background: #ff7; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px;&quot;&gt;
You can learn who is responsible for the most recent versions of any given page by clicking on the &quot;Page history&quot; link. For example, you can look at the full history of this FAQ just by clicking here. You can also see who is most responsible for a particular Wikibook by reading that book's &quot;authors&quot; page (if it has one). If you spot an error in the latest revision of an module you are highly encouraged to be bold and correct it. This practice is one of the basic review mechanisms that maintains the reliability of this instructional resource.
&lt;/p&gt;

The wording states a diferentiantion on the level of contribution or a ranking if you will, and the GFDL in its wording enforces it also. I'm not locking your contributions out but I claim that I should have more to say about this particular book than you if not for historical reasons, just on moral ground, when I started contributing to the old book Programming:C++ I didn't agreed with the previous maintainer on some topics I tried to dialog with him and his vision on the work difered from what I intended to do,  did not contributed , so I created a newbook that was called (wrongly a fork and the wikibooks forking rules were implemented and passed and aproved in record time), if I did it now it would fall outside of the specification on the forking rule, it would share the same topic but not the goal or format, what we have now was an enforced resolution.
&lt;/div&gt;

There isn't a defined level or ranking of contribution that is needed to be listed on the authors page and the GFDL doesn't say anything about it either other then that the names of those who are listed as the authors must be preserved and that the person should add there name to the list if they make any modifications to it. There's no policy that gives someone more say then other people for historial reasons or otherwise and I think it is fair to say any such attempt at enforcement goes against wikibook policy.

We haven't even had much chance yet to discussion our visions of the work to know if they differ, if they are compleatly incompatible and if there is no room for compromise. Jumping the gun a little bit, don't you think in comparing that past situation to here and now? I kindly ask you to minimize changes to the C++ Programming modules for now since we do disagree until we've worked things out please, as I have tried to do, so we can discuss without resulting in the chaos you spoke of before and getting sidetracked with changes we disagree with.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
It does fallow the guidelines of the book to make it accessible to beginners but that doesn't imply deleting content, just making it accessible (if something is to advanced, an explanation should be added), ie: I give the parsing part you used on the rewording, I had to add an explanation that the preprocessor does parse and what it consist, I see that in your view I should only removed the reference to parsing but my main motivation is providing content that goes even beyond the book guidelines, if it is correct more information will never be bad, we are not limited by physical constrains as paper or even size...
&lt;/div&gt;

I don't go by some fixed rule of thumb for deciding what I think makes an improvement, just depends on whats present. I continue to fail to see how rewording deletes contents. I have no problem adding explanations. I just think since we had agreed on something that it would of been better to add the parsing explanation to my changes rather then what looks like a revert and add, which I disagree with. I have no problem with more information, my motivation is that certain information can be explained with less words and that less time it takes to explan something and to read the explanation the better off everyone is. So I try to improve the quality of the information by balancing it out with the quanity it takes to explain it. More information is always good, quality information is never bad either. I rather read a book that has 1000 pages that explains 500 concepts then a book that only explains a few concepts that takes 1000 pages to explain it. My motivation is in trying to improve the quality of the book, not to decress the size of the book.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
I consider a major change, rewording, reformatting, moving or deleting more than couple of lines or the number of changes one does to a work on a small time frame, even more if you were not the original writer, new writers are asked to refrain from doing just that because it can disturb the book in itself and just provide more checking work to any existing maintainers (if the book is not orphan on authors), and probably as it did, will just piss people off (and alienating people is one thing wikibooks doesn't need, if I was not committed to this work I would probably have given up a long time ago).
&lt;/div&gt;

Wikibooks tend to have more then one author at some point. If change is enough to piss somebody off I think this is the wrong place for them. I can understand trying to give a new module time to grow by its orginal author, but how much time that should be is hard to say. I don't see how the number of changes made in any given time frame should matter. I can't agree with all rewordings and reformatings as being major changes if nothing is lost. A writer can never become known and attempt to be part of the community of maintainers if potental writers just sick back and do nothing which is why it seems reasonable to me that people should be bold and not hestitate to contribute as is suggested. Otherwise books become orphaned when people stop wanting to contribute or worse new writers stops trying to contribute out of hesitation. If I wasn't committed to trying to make this work and to the quality of this work I probably would of been another aliened person who would of left by now.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
A real big change would probably grant the writer author status into the book by the GFDL, but it consist mostly in adding content.&lt;br&gt;
Minor changes are in the size correcting spelling errors, format mistakes, or any non content based action (like boxes, changing bold, italics), heck even adding pictures can be hard to qualify it probably would depend if the writer has the copyright of the pictures being added, etc...
&lt;/div&gt;

There doesn't seem to be a real requirement for being listed as an author by wikibooks or GFDL. I won't comment on weither thats a major change or not since its so vage what the requirements are to consider an opinion on it. I had thought of adding myself as an author since it seemd like I had done enough to qualify as one, but then decided I rather let somebody else decide weither I had done enough to have my name added to authors section. I agree with what you consider minor changes with the exception of boxing which I'm still thinking about since in a way they can discrupt the flow of the text much like pictures do.

I think it would be a good idea to try to develope some helpful guidelines for this wikibook that is stated in the talk pages of the wikibook, rather then assuming everyone agrees and shares the same opinions. Which means discussing it with anyone whose contributing to the wikibook and coming to some community consensus and realize that such guidelines may change if consensus changes or new wikibook policies are made that take precedence.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
PS: I'm having a problem with the line format, many times I have to add &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to text any idea ? (using firefox)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:22, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
&lt;/div&gt;

I use firefox as well. A &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; is going to be needed if you want to force a line to break because the wiki software interprets two ajoining lines to be part of the same line if there are no tags that normally make two lines disjointed. If your trying to break text into paragraphs its far easier to use a blank line between them. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 23:08, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
... I did it based on what I thought was my best judgement at the time. ...
&lt;/div&gt;

Ok and what prevents you from doing the inverse option as I requested? (I will show you that you did violate GFDL in your action)

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
The GFDL gives everyone the right to distrubute and modify the contents of a document so long as previous authors are given credit for their work.
&lt;/div&gt;

Haa, did you give any credit? :) But that is not the problem, You agreed that it wasn't probably the best way of going about it, but is it your view that people that were not involved with a work should have the same decision power as a person that was contributing to the work for over 1 year ?!?
(I could get several users, even without asking for new registries to show that your view could be very dangerous)

But I think it's also morally self evident, even as a newcomer to wikibooks I tried to go by the rules that existed, when that did prove impossible, dialog failed and moderation was missing, for myself I didn't get involved in a revert war so I had 2 options, just quit contributing or &quot;forking&quot; (I still claim that it was not a fork as identified on the fork policy).

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
GFDL allows authors to control their copy of the documentation, but authors give up their rights to dictate to others what is done to or with the documentation other then to enforce that people who do make use of the documentation give the same rights to everyone else. GFDL documents may be hosted anywhere, but to be hosted here at wikibooks, additional rules must be followed.
&lt;/div&gt;

Not so, I did not relinquish any rights, I still do own the content, I provide a copy under the GFDL but the content may still be protected, for instance check about the dual licenses and the BSD problem with he GFDL.

As for the wikimedia steps for protecting content check the buzz about the German wikipedia.

You should also take a look at the GFDL as it ''does'' make distinction in contributors and rights. If you wish I can probably copy paste here but I think its evident.

And wikibooks also makes distinction in users/contributors, did you cast your vote on the last election here ?!?

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
I'm open to trying to understand what you think on this and adobt some of it to try to reduce disagreements, so long as its reasonable and doesn't violate Wikibook Guidelines and Policy.
&lt;/div&gt;

I think we are all cooperating here... If for nothing else just to trade some ideas and check about different view points...

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
I can understand trying to develope some helpful approaches to be used with any wikibook, so long as its agreed to by the majority of community of the wikibook in question as is required by wikibook policy.
&lt;/div&gt;

I'm one of the book authors, I don't recognize you as part of the community of the this particular book since you did not contribute content (as for the GFDL).

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
We haven't even had much chance yet to discussion our visions of the work to know if they differ, if they are compleatly incompatible and if there is no room for compromise.

&lt;/div&gt;

Ok you must provide/clarify your view above. I'm willing to help/correct and be corrected/work on comments, criticism  and debate with users (readers) and give credit to any ''real'' contribution to the work (book).

I don't want any place on the wikibooks/wikimedia community structure nor to advance any policy or be involved in it (I will vote one them), but as you should have understanded by now my problem is with what gives you the wright to claim more editorial rights on the book that the ones I have (I don't agree that we should even have equal rights at this time), as stated prev. you did no small changes to the book, was it intended to start a revert war as I requested you to make corrections and you didn't act on them most basic course of action would be having me reverting them (I did and will not take that step).

&lt;/div&gt;

I don't recognize your right to ask me that, I will not revert your changes as stated above, but I WILL continue to provide content, I will expect only the same from you.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
A writer can never become known and attempt to be part of the community of maintainers if potental writers just sick back and do nothing which is why it seems reasonable to me that people should be bold and not hestitate to contribute as is suggested.
&lt;/div&gt;

Agreed, but your reformats doesn't fall on the contribution being asked, writers are even asked NOT to do it.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
I continue to fail to see how rewording deletes contents. I have no problem adding explanations.

Check your own changes for example on the OOP part.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
This wikibook doesn't have a clear guideline or approach that is recommanded written anywhere that I can see,
&lt;/div&gt;

Gezz, I think the this is one of the books were the guidelines are more evident. In the chart, even in the introduction they could be better written probably, but until you clarify your view on editors to a book this is a mood point as a superior number of editors (I think you agree that users will not do) can trash any work on wikibooks.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
There isn't a defined level or ranking of contribution that is needed to be listed on the authors page and the GFDL doesn't say anything about it either other then that the names of those who are listed...
&lt;/div&gt;

It does, and even give you a magic number ''5'', as I said even in the GFDL there are levels...

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
There doesn't seem to be a real requirement for being listed as an author by wikibooks or GFDL.

&lt;/p&gt;

Ok and what prevents you from doing the inverse option as I requested? (I will show you that you did violate GFDL in your action)
&lt;/div&gt;

Only concern that since its already been moved that moving it again could be an issue now for those involved with the Windows Programming wikibook and your own assertion that it would be moved when it gets big enough. You also said you were asking to move what they had on MFC into the C++ Programming wikibook. No biggy, but to me that seems to be a bit of a contridiction of what your plans for it are . There is also that nagging forking policy to consider. Also I think it would take an admin to revert this action since the page it was moved from still exists. The best I think I could do is replace the redirect with an inclusion. Since you said you were wanting to have the other contents added, wouldn't it make since to have them as inclusions as well? Whatever is done to achieve it, I'd add the template suggesting its merger into the Windows Programming wikibook and then include my reasons on its talk page, since I haven't changed my mind on it being best to have it there. Even though you probably don't recognize any right to do so.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
Haa, did you give any credit? :)
&lt;/div&gt;

I don't think there is an explict need to do give credit on the page itself. The history of the page acts as a sort of revision history listing the people who contributed to its making. I'm also uncertain if enough has been done to give proper credit to other contributors on the C++ Programming authors page. This properly giving credit issue seems to be an open debate that hasn't been resolved yet as whole when it comes to applying the GFDL to wiki documents from what I have seen. The only solution I've seen suggested is not using GFDL as a way to solve the problem.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
...but is it your view that people that were not involved with a work should have the same decision power as a person that was contributing to the work for over 1 year ?!? (I could get several users, even without asking for new registries to show that your view could be very dangerous)
&lt;/div&gt;

My view goes beyond just &quot;should have&quot;. My view is people &quot;do have&quot; the same equal right in the decision making process. See [[Wikibooks:Decision_making#Community_consensus]] as well as &quot;Following the Guidelines&quot; thats right below it, for what I mean. My point in all this is no I don't think you have more right, only equal right to disagree and debate and like anyone else try to come to some consensus. This doesn't mean to say I think your opinion don't mater. I think its good to state and discussion, just tired of this &quot;what I say goes&quot; attitude I sence from you that I think clarily goes against guidelines, policy and community cooperation. It also suggests to me a level of unwillness to negotiation and compromise, which can make it difficult to get additional contributors.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
Not so, I did not relinquish any rights, I still do own the content, I provide a copy under the GFDL but the content may still be protected, for instance check about the dual licenses and the BSD problem with he GFDL.
&lt;/div&gt;

I think you relingquished some rights or gave some rights to other people when you pressed the submit button and agreed to provide it under the terms of the GFDL, including right to modify. Since its not dualed licensed I don't see the relevency of comparing it to any situation involving dual licensing. BTW you said you got permission to use some work by other people, did you get there permission under terms acceptable to wikibooks (eg public domain, GFDL), such as using [[Help:Boilerplate request for permission|Boilerplate request for permission]]? Otherwise that could be a potential problem too. Which I only bring up because we disagree with what this license means and what people are allowed to do.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
As for the wikimedia steps for protecting content check the buzz about the German wikipedia.
&lt;/div&gt;

Its not in german is it? I only understand english. I would also hesitate to consider anything related to German wikipedia for two reasons. This isn't wikipedia and I think different language wikis hosted by wikimedia foundation each have there own situations and policies to deal with even within the same general project. Like the German wikipedia may have different policies from the English wikipedia.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
You should also take a look at the GFDL as it ''does'' make distinction in contributors and rights. If you wish I can probably copy paste here but I think its evident.
&lt;/div&gt;

I see no distinction made. There is only one reference to contributor that I could find:

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #ff7; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
&lt;/div&gt;

Which would suggest to me only applying to the &quot;Authors&quot; section on wikibooks, that it may not be changed only appended to, unless its the author who added the achknowledgement or dedications who changes only their own achknowledgements or dedications.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
And wikibooks also makes distinction in users/contributors, did you cast your vote on the last election here ?!?
&lt;/div&gt;

Do you have some references you could point me to that make a clear distinction? I haven't seen any clear distinction made.

Hmm the only lost contents I can see is perhaps encapsulation. The rest was covered in Classes. I could add encapsulation back by adding it at the end of Classes to fix that lost contents. Anything else?

I'm going to need those references. I've read the GFDL, in fact again on the 29th, to refresh my memory. Here's what I consider relivent:

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #ff7; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS&lt;br/&gt;

I don't want any place on the wikibooks/wikimedia community structure nor to advance any policy or be involved in it (I will vote one them), but as you should have understanded by now my problem is with what gives you the wright to claim more editorial rights on the book that the ones I have (I don't agree that we should even have equal rights at this time), as stated prev. you did no small changes to the book, was it intended to start a revert war as I requested you to make corrections and you didn't act on them most basic course of action would be having me reverting them (I did and will not take that step).
&lt;/div&gt;

I don't claim more editorial rights, just equal rights as anyone has. No I have no intention to start a revert war. Trying to prevent one. There is some guideline/policy/recommandation somewhere I read that said in the event of a dispute don't revert, discuss it first and try to come to a consenus to prevent revert wars from happening. Thats why I have not been reverting and we've been getting sidetracked on &quot;rights&quot; and the like, presenting from a discussion that could lead to a compermise. So to me, reverting is the wrong course of action. I'm trying to follow reasonal recommandation. I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;I don't want a place on the wikibooks/wikimedia community structure&quot;.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Well the best definition I can think of to explain my view on editors is somebody who in good faith tries to contribute to a wikibook in an attempt to improve it, regardless of how major or how minor the contribution is, and tries to cooperate, discuse, compermise, etc when disputes arrise with other editors. And before I'm asked, I consider contributions to be any change thats attempts to improve, even such things as spellchecking, grammar correction and format corrections.

P.S Do you know if any good spellchecker for firefox other then SpellBound, appearently there hasn't been an update yet for newer versions of firefox. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 13:02, 1 October 2006 (UTC)
----
Nope I don't think there is one (spellchecker that works inside the browser for firefox) there are for explorer (you could probably use IETab and one of those for example, but I use SpellBound, I hate the way it jumps arround the edit box after a check or the slider going mising from it window some times, but could't find another.

As for our private discussion we should move it to the public forum, the best way it to state what our divergence is and ask for third party participation, this can also be useful to others as if your point was the valid one I doubt most projects would get bilt on wikibooks.

I will edit this post later and provide the point in witch I think we diverge and after you check them we will move the discussion.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:22, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
----

Ya I tried to give SpellBound a try and install it, but its not compatible with this version of firefox. I guess I'll have to wait for a new update and I can't use IE because I don't use Windows and wouldn't want to.

As for the other stuff, I was going to suggest similar moves. Trying to see if we can agree on a summary of what the issue is we disagree with in regard to policy here first and then move it to Staff Lounge or some other place/forum. I think thats the main issue here that needs attention and not our disagreements with the wikibook content, because we are both trying to be reasonablein that respect. I think the issue causing the problem is both our interpretation of Wikibook policy. I'll try to summerize my POV on this.

Let me know if I'm wrong on this last bit and how. feel free to correct me by clarifing your view:&lt;br/&gt;
I say the problem thats arrising here is that you think some people are more entitled and are free to force there POV on wikibooks without discussion and that choosing to discuss things with people you don't recognize as being entitled to an opinion, is just a matter of courtesy.

You can force the compatibility, on my page go to my page at http://del.icio.us/Panic2k4 check for the firefox+inuse tags, the one that does make it easy (no javascript editing involved) is Mr. Tech local install, you can check google for it also. I'm running the last version, so if you are not running a beta that will work.

I would have liked if you had been less &quot;politically correct&quot; (even if its for public consumption, but I'm not running for office), some of the text includes wikibook/community stuff that you and me do agree, but if you do remove that  part we have in &quot;common&quot;, I would also remove my last sentence and some other &quot;political correct&quot; text from my statement as it's pointless for the discussion at hand.

Any how, if you don't want any changes, you can move the declarations to the public forum and ask for participation for the clarification of the matter (if you don't want to be the poster I can do it also, no prob.), it should be mentioned that this should be probably used to create a global wikibooks guideline or policy, a link should be provided to this copy to state that none of us are altering each others words and I will move the discussion part (not the declarations) to a separated archive page, if any one does have a need to check what we have said.

I think its a good idea to try to show where we both agree too, it shows we have been reasonable and have tried to discuss it by ourself and that there is some issues we simply can't seem to agree on that we both agree could benifit from outside input. BTW are we in agreement that the issue isn't so much about what either one of us has done, but with how Wikibooks works? I'd like to try to keep this from becoming &quot;finger pointing&quot; of specific things that have been done and having to clarify that both of our views may have changed and that this isn't so much an issue about a specific wikibook, but interpretation of current Wikibooks policy. I think we both can agree that one way or another specific things that have been done can be resolved on our own once this issue about policy has been resolved and clarified to both our understanding. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 16:21, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

----

No prob., but please avoid counter arguing my points, just state the facts you defend and make your own points, keep you statements small and less confusing. And take notice that in your first statement I almost agree entirely with it, the point in question is your understanding on the level of contribution needed to become part of a specific book community and that can't be understood by reading it, I have added a common statements on thing we agree and disagree, to remove some of double talk.
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:26, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

Not sure I like the last bit about &quot;call for opinion vote&quot;. Did you notice the '''General voting rules/Proposals''' you refer to is a rejected policy and if you go up to '''General voting rules''' it redirects you to [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] ?!?. If thats not enough to convence you of my point at the very least you should try to refer to a policy thats accepted and not rejected in calling for people's opinions, because I cannot agree to such a statement being used when it refers to a rejected policy. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 00:43, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

I'm not sure what to put in its place, I think it may be too early to suggest that it needs to be voted on or needs to be turned into a new policy. There may already be an established consensus or policy that covers this neither of us are aware of or that needs to be clarified. I think for now we just need to ask for people's opinions and for clarification and go from there. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 02:07, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

----

You are right, but as the GFDL is an enforceable policy my point is valid (on our disagreements), I'll remove the reference to the '''General voting rules''' later on you can continue in establishing a policy (I will be content with a decision by at least a 60%+ in global votes on our problem), if you win I will probably fork the books I was creating to another location (not wikibooks) and probably not wikibased (I was about to do that as the merge was forced on me, this will be the tipping point...).

Well since I didn't change any other points (feel free to edit the format of the proposal of vote), I think we are done. Can you post it on the Lobby or do you prefer that I do it. ?
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:57, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

----

We were both editing at the same time. I was about to add to my last comment. Which may effect this. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 02:07, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

Perhaps we should say we both agreed that we needed to get input and opinions of other people and try to get clarification and that this is a summary of what the dispute is about and if people would comment in order to help us try to resolve this dispute. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 02:22, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

I made the changes to reflect this view. Hows it look? It is late here, so I won't get a chance to see any changes you've made until later. So this will need to continue tomorrow before we are finished. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 03:15, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
----

Call for comment is not a vote, we will not get a clear response, there may even be people with other views, it will take much more time to even understand what various factions will be saying and your interpretation my be different than mine a clear and simple vote is what is needed. A discussion will be needed to create a policy but a proper page must be created.
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:36, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Well, a vote is premature, until we know what other people's views are. We both could be compleatly off or both somewhat right. We just don't know. A vote now assumes people agree with one of our views 100%. Obviously a discussion will take more time, but a discussion is what is needed and what will have to happen anyways before a vote for it to have any meaning twords a new policy or changes to existing onces to be more clear, if thats what your after. I would just be satisfied with some clarification, one way or another even if I'm wrong. Did you not read on the Decision making page that policies are high impact changes? Even if you can't agree that the same process applies to book discussion, surely you agree it applies to trying to change policy or to have policies clarified? --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 22:28, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

We could say we disagree with this too, if you don't agree, and make it clear that its you who believes it should be voted on now and give a third choice. The third choice being that it needs to be discussed more before being voted on yet. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 22:33, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

----

I don't want to know other peoples views are, I only wan't to know if the majority agrees with you or with me, if we take your option you or I can shape our views along the way, restate or reformulate them, this can lead to a endless debate.
(Made a small clarification on my points),Btw it is not my intention of creating a policy (one is needed) but to solve this differences with you, as I stated before I don't have the time or will to be involved in general wikibooks debates, my concern is only &quot;my&quot; works, if you will only accept a lengthy discussion, I can live with it, if you can accept that I could revert some of the changes you made to the book to its original status (if your view wins a future vote, you can then restore them), then I will have no problem with the time frame, if this is acceptable then move the points to the lobby. If not I must request a moderation vote on our views as this will be the quicker path.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:07, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

-----

It is my intention to solve these differences with you as well. I have no interest in politics as you have refered to it either. I've tried to understand your POV to better understand where we differ in opinion, but it is difficult to do. I've tried to rephrase what I've thought you point is on more then one occation, but you have not really commented on them. I don't see how the GFDL relates to our difference in opinion, you have not even stated specifics from the GFDL that you believe validate your view. Which in turn makes it hard to explain why I think you are wrong or right. All this seems to be the result in difference in opinion of how we are suppose manage differences in opinion and what should or shouldn't be done in the mean time.

I can't stop you from reverting my changes nor from not explaining why you think reverting my changes was necessary. However without input, I may continue to make changes you disagree with, simply because I can't read whats going through your mind. I don't expect you to seek approvel from me any more then I expect to need to seek approvel from you. As this is a community effort, for people to work together it seems like a good idea to try to avoid rediting each other's work if its only going to lead to a revert war by discussing our differences to come to some comparemise that works for us both. I choose to prevent a revert war by trying to limit my edits to what I think won't cause reversions by you, what you do is up to you.

The only issue I have here, is what to me appears to be your belief that the GFDL and/or certain policies gives you more say or greator control over the book contents then other users for whatever reasons you have, which haven't been made clear to me in a way I can understand. The only thing that has been made clear to me so far is that you don't think you own the wikibook as I use to think. I'm not sure what you interpretation of my POV is either, but it seems to suggest to you that wikibook could not work if things are as you think I'm saying things are, which may mean you misunderstand my POV.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
my concern is only &quot;my&quot; works,
&lt;/div&gt;

This is partially where we may have a difference in opinion or interpretation. While I don't urgue with your changes being your work, I do not understand what your concern is. Are you concerned with people editing your contributions? Are you concerned with what your rights are here on Wikibook concerning your contributions? Are you concerned with what is done with your contributions? This is why I tried (perhaps not clearly) to suggest this may not be the right place if thats what concerns you. By putting you work under the GFDL you allow anyone to use and do with your work as they please so long as credit for what you have done is maintained.  Perhaps you could clarify what your concerns are?

It has been suggested to me, that what is needed is a mediator to interven in our discussion here and try to help us resolve the problem. Its also been suggested to me what our problem is has not been made clear. Are you be open to a mediator? Are you open to trying to explain the problem so its clearer? I'm not even sure how to explain the problem clearly myself, which means to me they got a good point. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 05:26, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

----

This is exasperating, we have by now shown each other to respect wikibooks and recognized its rules and you now ask me &quot;Are you concerned with people editing your contributions?&quot;... ?!?? wtf ?!?

I respect the views of wikibooks probably more than you (as only I seem to understand the moral and legal rights it has to stand on) and have been contributing content for two years, please don't use that kind of wording/remarks on your comments, I am not a kid, as I said before if you are running for a job/more power on wikibooks please don't make me waste my time, what I write here is for your consumption not as a platform to show how righteous I am, I am human and I do make mistakes and like to be corrected but I will refuse to be made into a vilan...

&quot;I and others painted a group swimming in a pool over a wall, later, you saw it and decided that the person jumping into the pool needed tree nipples and painted over it...&quot; that is the core of our discussion...
 
We have established our divergences, I don't recognize you as an author (if you prefer an equal part to the work, some of the reformatting were welcomed, but copyright law, at least were I live, doesn't give you author status) and I claim that you made changes (witch I have listed to you) to the work I didn't like (as author, even in you view I was an author before you), I claim you had no rights in doing some changes (you've granted me that you at least failed to fallow protocol) and I claim that even if what I say is not expressed as a policy in wikibooks (which I claim it is), I and others at least have the moral rights (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright#Moral_rights) to the work and form the book community that should steer that book development, if you wished to have an equal decision/participation what you needed to do is make content contributions (see GFDL), then I would recognize you equal rights even thant natural raking should be respected, I would respect the opinion of one that made greater part of the work.

&quot;in other word, if you had contributed as mutch to the painting as the other artists you should have an equal rights on deciding its evolution&quot;   

Ok will you move our points to the lobby and ask for a simple vote ? If not I will move my declaration and ask for a show of hands...

--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:42, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

I don't mean to come off sounding like I think your a kid or to offend you. I know I'm no diplomat and far from sounding like one when trying to discuss with people who have differences of opinion. I can only do my best and I'm not sure how I could phrase my question any better to not offend you. I'm not trying to make anyone out to be a vilan here. I'm just a bit confused.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
&quot;I and others painted a group swimming in a pool over a wall, later, you saw it and decided that the person jumping into the pool needed tree nipples and painted over it...&quot; that is the core of our discussion...

&lt;/div&gt;

So your saying because I haven't been contributing as long you, that I don't have any right to be involved in any decision on the book and that I should just accept your decisions as being final when we disagree? I'll leave it at that so as not to have to address too many things at once.

As for the moving to the lobby and asking for a vote, I don't think thats such a good idea from what I'm being told. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 23:22, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

Gezzz, you clearly don't seem to comprehend that it is not the time (that should also count, but it is more sign of respect to others that came before or have done more work) but the quality of the contributions, content (simple edits to a work is not contributing content to it), since you did not contribute to a work yes you aren't considered part of its community the decision process and should respect its opinion, this to me seems to be basic and morally right (even if we disagree with the legalities of it, right is right...), I can't be more basic that the example I gave.

You should read about &quot;game theory&quot; you would see how wrong your POV is and why it wouldn't work anywhere.
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:00, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

Who determins weither contributions are quality contributions then? Is it those who are listed on the Author's section? If so who determins who can be on the authors section? Is it those who are already listed there? Who determins who is part of a wikibook community? Is it also determin by those listed in the authors section? If its not who determins these things, then how or what determines these things?

I'm trying to refrain from urging with you on things I disagree with again and trying to just focus on understanding what your POV is, by asking questions and restating what you say based on my interpretation so you can correct me where I'm getting your POV wrong. For the sake of trying to speed this up more, I'm going to try to ask more questions. Ignore any questions which don't fit in and try to explain why if you could please or  explain further where you think I'm getting your POV wrong.

I'm a bit confused on what your POV applies to. Does it apply to contributing at all? It doesn't seem so, since you seem to agree that any one can contribute. Are these suppose to be under what conditions you believe someone can edit a wikibook? Perhaps this is suppose to apply to when there is disagreement in order to resolve disagreement? I'm thinking you believe its for when there is disagreement and for certain exspects of contributing, from what I think I understand of your POV.

Using the painting analog to somewhat explain what I think I understand of your POV as being &quot;a painter should only add new coats of paint, until the painter has shown enough respect for the painting to be able to keep the artist's intentions and vision of the painting the same.&quot; Is that correct? --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 13:09, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

----

*Who determins weither contributions are quality contributions then?

The book community (note that the book community can only make its will stand on wikibooks if no rules to GFDL are broken, anyone can ignore thier decissions, author is defined in the copyright law so its simple to force a legal action if legal laws are broken in this case you could probably get help from the Mediawiki as the &quot;editor&quot; of the work).

*Is it those who are listed on the Author's section? 

Yes and others that can prove contributions to content (GFDL).

*who determins who can be on the authors section?

The GFDL, even if the book community refuses the place you can fork the work (not on wikibooks) and add your name, or request FSF to make a legal claim to correct the Wikibook (if you write to Wikimedia and request a review they will do it if the history logs are there).

*Who determins who is part of a wikibook community?

The book coomunity itself or the author (creator).

*&quot;a painter should only add new coats of paint, until the painter has shown enough respect for the painting to be able to keep the artist's intentions and vision of the painting the same.&quot;

Well respect is a good thing, for your elders, for people that have more experience for the rights and liberties of others, etc... but that is no enforceable, it falls on the motivations and morals that should guide ones life.

Basically the new painter should respect the previous work, not to vandalize it or make unwanted alterations to it try to see if the ones that made it agree, if not and the painting is GFDL, copy it to another wall and do as he likes (even then he should respect the others VP but GFDL removes any obligation to respect the original work, you could for instance get a GFDL book on WW2 and rewrite parts of it to make Hitler a hero, this is probably why people refuse to be added to the author list and some movements against the GFDL are emerging), we have to remember that authors are liable for the work.
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:20, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

Hmm I think we almost agree here.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
*Who determins weither contributions are quality contributions then?

The book community (note that the book community can only make its will stand on wikibooks if no rules to GFDL are broken, anyone can ignore thier decissions, author is defined in the copyright law so its simple to force a legal action if legal laws are broken in this case you could probably get help from the Mediawiki as the &quot;editor&quot; of the work).
&lt;/div&gt;

I almost agree with this. I think the issue is there's no universal copyright law and definition for author. The closest we can get is International Copyright Laws. Other then that yes I agree, if you can prove laws have been broken, you can seek legal action. Perhaps one disagreement is over definition of authors as it applies to wikibooks? Could you meantion what rules of GFDL your referring to? You said awhile ago you would try to show me how the GFDL proves you are right. I'm a bit interested in this again. Do you believe I have broken the GFDL requirements somehow?

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
*Is it those who are listed on the Author's section? 

Yes and others that can prove contributions to content (GFDL).
&lt;/div&gt;

What proof of contributions would that be? I think the edit History acts as a sort of proof as well as satisfies History section of the GFDL. Am I correct in my understanding that you disagree that the edit History is not same as an Authors section and is not proof of contributions?

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
*who determins who can be on the authors section?

The GFDL, even if the book community refuses the place you can fork the work (not on wikibooks) and add your name, or request FSF to make a legal claim to correct the Wikibook (if you write to Wikimedia and request a review they will do it if the history logs are there).
&lt;/div&gt;

I agree the GFDL determins this. Perhaps we disagree on how the GFDL determins this? Could you explain how the GFDL determins this from your POV or would you rather we try to seek clarification of this from a third party? OK your reference here to the history logs suggests you do consider the edit history to be important in determing authors and disputes over authorship. Am I correct?

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
*Who determins who is part of a wikibook community?

The book coomunity itself or the author (creator).
&lt;/div&gt;

So the community decides who is and isn't part of the community? How does the author fit into deciding this?

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

I agree. My motivation and morals in regard to wikibooks, is that its a community effort, some changes are expected and people's contributions may not always be preserved except in the edit history if people wish to look back on it, because wikibooks are always changing. Some changes last longer then others, but nothing lasts forever. When people disagree with changes they should try to work out a solution that will satisfy everyone involved. Obviously some changes are more important then others, but that can be hard to work out when its best to discuss before hand and when to just do it. Obviously thats something I'm still trying to learn through making mistakes.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;

--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:20, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
&lt;/div&gt;

Is that what you think I've done? Vandalized and made unwanted alternations to try to see if its a problem? I agree that vandalism should be avoided and unwanted alterations, but it can be hard to determan if its so until its been done, more so when its a community thats judging whats unwanted. I have to disagree with the last bit about authors being liable for their work. I think GFDL removes reliability or at least tries to. I guess this is another area we disagree with?

I think I may have managed to figure out where we disagree a little better. Which is also whats confusing, since you said you agreed with me for the most part on what I said before about contributions being welcomed. Care to explain some more about your POV on the distinction between users, authors, editors and contributors? I think we might be able to make it clearer whats disagreed on this way and reducing what our differences in POV are exactly, taking this approch. :) 

Another recap of my understanding of your POV. Both authors and the community decides who is and isn't part of the community (a &quot;contributor&quot;) based on both the quality and amount of contributions (the &quot;weight&quot; of contributions) made to a wikibook. It is up to the community to decide or vote if there is disagreement with a contribution made. Users are people not part of the community as decided by the community and authors. Users don't get to make any decisions if there's disagreements. Is this correct?

My POV for the sake of something to compare to if you want to explain your POV, is that authors, contributors and editors are the same thing here on Wikibooks and all are members of wikibook community. Users tend to be readers and may occationlly make comments on a talk page or the like about how great the work is or make constructive criticism about how a wikibook could be made better, while everyone else actually works to try to make the wikibook better rather then just saying what could be done to make a wikibook better.

I hope I haven't sidetracked away too much from trying to understand your POV better. BTW do you have any questions for me on my POV that you would like to understand better? --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 20:51, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

== Overview ==

'''''Dissendium''''' is a single-purpose spell; used on the statue of the hump-backed, one-eyed witch in the third-floor corridor at Hogwarts, it causes her hump to hinge open

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

When her hump is open, it reveals the end of a passageway that goes to the basement of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Honeyduke's_Sweetshop|Honeyduke's Sweetshop]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] uses this passageway to leave the castle without permission, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the twins]] have apparently been doing the same for years, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marauders|the Marauders]] did many years before them; and it seems [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] is also using this as a means of getting into the castle.

== Analysis ==

A certain number of spells seem to have a single use at a single location, much like passwords; rather than being available for general use, they seem to be tied to specific locations or artifacts. '''Dissendium''' appears to be one such; similar to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Alohomora|Alohomora]], the unlocking spell, but tied to this one statue. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] is similarly opened and hidden with passwords that are not, strictly speaking, magical at all, though they have magical effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Membrane Potentials

==Membane Properties==
The membrane, just like in any other cell, is a phospholipid bilayer separating two regions of ion-filled,water-based solutions. The separation of various ions across this membrane creates the potentials that form the basis of the electrical comunication in neurons. 
===Chemical Background===
Proteins are located throughout the membrane and function to regulate the concentrations of various ions on either side of the membrane. Many of these proteins function as ion channels-that is, they control the passage of ions across the membrane. Based on the constuction of a particular ion channel, it will be opened by different stimuli, electrical or chemical, and when open, permeable to a specific ion. The ions that commonly have channels are the monovalent potassium, sodium and chlorine and the divalent calcium. There are also important ion channels with no gate, referred to as leak channels because the ions will 'leak' across the membrane through these channels down their electrochemical gradient. Another set of membrane proteins serve to force ions across the membrane against their chemical gradient. These are known ion pumps, and the most common one is the sodium potassium ion pump that, at the cost of one molecule of ATP(Adenosine triphosphate), forces three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions in.

===Electrical Background===
Because opposite charges attract, the separation of positive and negative ions (ex. Na+ and Cl-) across the membrane creates a potential for charges to move toward each other. When these charges do move relative to other nearby charges, this movement is referred to as electrical current. By convention a positive current refers to the movement of positive charge. The electrical potential exerted on these charges is a measurable force called voltage measured in volts. Another relevant characteristic of the movement of charge is the ease with which the charges or ions move across a barrier such as the membrane. This is measured with two inversely related quantities, conductance (g) and resistance (R). the relation between the two is R=1/g. To tie everything together is Ohm's Law, which says that current (I) is equal to the conductance (g) multiplied by the electrical force (V).

===Measurement===
The membrane potential can be measured experimentally with an electrode inserted through the membrane of the cell. The electrical force is then measured, and most cell register at about -65 millivolts, usually stated as Vm = -65 mV. This potential is necessary for the function of a neuron.

===Composition of the Resting Potential===
This measure of -65mV is a composite of the potentials of K+, Na+, Cl- and Ca2+ ions. To determine what a particular ion, for example K+, contributes to the composite, an experiment can be setup in which a potassium salt is placed in solution on one side of the membrane. The salt dissociates, leaving K+ and A- (the anion)  in solution. The membrane, being permeable to K+ only, prevents the anion from crossing. Diffusion forces K+ to spread out, so K+ crosses the membrane without A-. There is also a force acting against diffusion, the electrical attraction between the negative anion and the positive K+, and the balancing of these two forces is referred to as an ionic equilibrium. Because this equilibrium involves the separation of opposite charges, it has a potential associated with it. K+'s equil. potential is about -80mV. Each of the ions associated with membrane potentials have a characteristic equilibrium potential. The composite will be the overall resting membrane potential, and because this composite is a compromise between the ionic equilibrium potentials of the ions permeable to the membrane, none of the ions are at their own ionic equilibrium. The difference between an ion's ion equilibrium potential and the overall resting potential is the force on that ion to move toward its own equilibrium. This force is referred to as the ionic driving force.

==Mechanisms==
===Driving Force===

If ion is not at equilibrium it has a potential to move. This is a force on the ion. The total driving force is a sum of the electrical potential and the chemical gradient potential.  (A negative current is an inward current; a positive current, out of the cell. [DANGER: most Neuroscience websites and books mention that inward current is positive current and outward current is negative current. The opposite of what is here]) K+'s force  is -80mV, resting potential is -60mV, so positive 20mV on the cell, this pushes positive ions out of the cell. If one opens Na and K channels (the same number) Na generates more current because it's electrical force is higher than K. More Na will come in than K out. For Na, the outside concentration is much higher than the conc. inside, and there is a negative charge inside that pulls Na inside. Cl- equilibrium potential is just below resting potential, so there is some movement when permeability is higher. 

===Ion Pumps=== 

It is essential to maintain the concentration gradients to keep electrical forces. K continues to leak out and Na in, until conc.s across membrane are equal. The membrane compensates by pumping these ions against their conc. gradient. Requires ATP. Three Na ions bind to protein on the inside of the membrane, and when ATP binds, the protein changes conformation to release Na on the outside. K binds and that cause the protein to change back. This causes a positive current out of the cell. Ca2+ is used differently, generally herded elsewhere. Ca has low intracellular conc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Foreword==
#[[/Aim|Aim of this textbook]]

==Chapter 1: Overview of Common Certification and Regulatory Standards==

==Chapter 2: Underwriter's Laboratory (UL) Certification Standards and Testing==

==Chapter 3: European Conformity (CE) Certification Standards and Testing==
===Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Directive===
===Low Voltage (LV) Directive===

==Chapter 4: Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Certification Standards and Testing==

The FCC has set electromagnetic compatibility standards such that, if your device passes the test (and your neighbor's TV or other device also passes the test), you device will (probably) not interfere with your neighbor's TV reception, and your neighbor's other devices will not interfere with your device.

All products containing electronics that oscillate above 9 kHz must be certified [http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/5196/which-products-should-have-fcc-certification-and-about-how-much-does-that-cost].
(There is a special section 15.103 exemption from certification for devices that do not operate when connected to the AC power lines, are digital, do not intentionally radiate, and both the highest frequency generated and the highest frequency used are less than 1.705 MHz [http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/14954/does-anyone-know-of-a-microcontroller-dsp-with-no-clock-speeds-or-any-oscillator]).

Nearly all electronic devices fall into one or the other of the categories and therefore require one or the other tests described in &quot;FCC Part 15&quot; ([[Wikipedia: Title 47 CFR Part 15]]):
* Intentional radiators that require a license to use
* Intentional narrowband radiators that use the &quot;unlicensed spectrum&quot; in a way that does not require a license to use
* Intentional ultra-wideband radiators
* Unintentional radiators

== Other tests ==

Many manufacturers perform other tests on prototypes that -- while not legally required --
often help flush out design flaws that lead to excessive returns or support costs or both:

* drop tests are often performed even on products that aren't technically required to pass that test [http://www.nefab.com/Packaging_Material_Testing.aspx] [http://www.twinhead.com.tw/durabook/page02-01.html] [http://www.panasonic.com/business/toughbook/why-shock-resitant-laptops.asp]. One drop test standard is &quot;49 CFR 178.603 - Drop test&quot;. 
* electrostatic discharge testing ([[Wikipedia: Electrostatic discharge#Simulation and testing for electronic devices]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Install Java ==

Follow the [http://www.freebsd.org/java/ FreeBSD instructions] to install the native Java. I (Ari Maniatis) am still using 1.4.2 on our deployment servers, but it is likely that 1.5.x will work fine.

This should also cause the javavmwrapper port to be installed. This makes it easy to switch between different Java VM versions.

== Install WebObjects ==

Install gtar (the FreeBSD tar doesn't seem to work for me):

 portinstall gtar

Mount the WebObjects CD at /mnt/cdrom and then:

 cd /mnt/cdrom/Deployment/SOLARIS
 ./install.sh -license B-111-AAA-111-AAA-111-AAA-111-AAA-111 -altjvm /usr/local/bin/javavm -adaptorsOnly NO -minimalInstall NO -cgibin /usr/local/www/cgi-bin -docroot /usr/local/www/data -woroot /usr/local/apple -gnutar /usr/local/bin/gnutar

To find your license key, look in your developer installation and find it at:

 /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaWebObjects.framework/Resources/License.key

The system then needs to know where NEXT_ROOT lives:

edit /etc/profile and add:
 NEXT_ROOT=/usr/local/apple
 export NEXT_ROOT
 OS=FREEBSD
 export OS

Log out and then back in to make sure this takes effect.

== Apply updates ==

If necessary, you can apply updates like this:

 sh patcher.sh -install WO51Solaris522.tar.gzip

You can download the patcher.sh shell script and the gzip update from Apple's website.

== Install the Apache adaptor ==

* [http://wonder.sourceforge.net/WOAdaptor.html Download the binary] or
* [http://www.tetlabors.de/wo/setup_webobjects_on_freebsd.html Compile it yourself]

TODO: I've tried but failed to get this working with Apache2


== Configure Apache ==

Add the configuration file:
cp $NEXT_ROOT/Developer/Examples/WebObjects/Source/Adaptors/Apache/apache.conf /usr/local/etc/apache/webobjects.conf

Add the line:
 Include /usr/local/etc/apache/webobjects.conf
*before* LoadModule rewrite_module

Add the line:
 AddModule mod_WebObjects.c
*after* AddModule mod_rewrite.c

Edit the configuration file at /usr/local/etc/apache/webobjects.conf:

 comment out the line &quot;AddModule mod_WebObjects.c&quot;
 replace LOCAL_LIBRARY_DIR/WebServer/Documents with /usr/local/www/data

== Create a startup scripts for wotaskd and javamonitor ==

Create /usr/local/etc/rc.d/110.wotaskd.sh
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

NEXTROOT=/usr/local/Apple

case &quot;$1&quot; in
        start)
                if [ -x /usr/local/bin/mysqld_safe ]; then
                export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
                export NEXT_ROOT=${NEXTROOT}
                ${NEXTROOT}/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/wotaskd.woa/wotaskd &amp;
                        echo -n ' wotaskd'
                fi
                ;;
        stop)
                echo &quot;not supported&quot;
                ;;
        *)
                echo &quot;&quot;
                echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` { start | stop }&quot;
                echo &quot;&quot;
                exit 64
                ;;

&lt;/pre&gt;

Create /usr/local/etc/rc.d/150.javamonitor.sh
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

PATH=/usr/local/bin
NEXTROOT=/usr/local/Apple

case &quot;$1&quot; in

                        export NEXT_ROOT=${NEXTROOT}
                        ${NEXTROOT}/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/JavaMonitor.woa/JavaMonitor -WOPort 6666 &amp;
                        echo -n 'JavaMonitor'

==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
[[Image:Redrosedust_wright_f2000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A close up of the Rosette Nebula. Stars are forming in this region of space. The red color comes from clouds of hydrogen.]]Hydrogen is the absolute smallest of all elements, so small that four thousand million, laid end to end, could fit on the head of one pin! At room temperature hydrogen is a clear gas. Hydrogen gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a molecule made of two hydrogen atoms bonded together. It has no taste or odor and is not toxic. It takes a very, very low temperature and/or very high pressure to turn hydrogen into a liquid or a solid. One common molecule formed by hydrogen is water or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. At room temperature, water is a clear liquid.

==How was it discovered?==
Henry Cavendish was the first to understand that hydrogen was a unique substance. In 1776 he produced hydrogen by mixing [[Wikijunior_The_Elements/Mercury|mercury]] with an acid. Hydrogen had actually been produced much earlier by the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus. He also added mixes of water samples in it to make water!

==Where did its name come from?==
Hydrogen comes from Hydrogenium, which comes from Ancient Greek meaning &quot;water-forming&quot;. The element was named by Antoine Lavoisier in 1783. When hydrogen burns, it produces water.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* Hydrogen is the smallest element.
* Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe.
* Hydrogen isn't common in a pure form on Earth, but is mostly found as part of water.
* Hydrogen is the main fuel of stars and the only fuel for red dwarfs.
* The whole universe is thought to have been formed by a Hydrogen nucleus.
* Hydrogen makes a squeaking noise when it is set on fire.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Hydrogen in its atomic form is found commonly in space and stars. There are vast clouds of hydrogen in outer space. However much of the hydrogen in space is missing an electron, which means it is an ion. On Earth, hydrogen is commonly found as part of water molecules. Many other molecules also contain hydrogen. Some bacteria produce pure hydrogen gas as waste.
[[Image:PhareHagueCoucher.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Sun setting into the sea. The Sun is mostly hydrogen. Most of the hydrogen on Earth is in the form of water.]]
Hydrogen is very important for all living creatures including people to exist. It is found in every living thing on Earth, and also forms the oceans, rivers, lakes and clouds.

Hydrogen gas is most of the atmosphere of the gas-giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, planets with much stronger gravity and lower temperatures than Earth.

==What are its uses?==
The largest application of hydrogen is for the processing (&quot;upgrading&quot;) of fossil fuels, and in the production of ammonia. Hydrogen can be used as a fuel source. A fuel cell is a device that produces electricity by safely combining hydrogen and oxygen. 

In the future, non-polluting cars may be fueled by hydrogen. The technology to make a hydrogen car already exists, but there are reasons you don't see them on the road. Separating hydrogen from water takes energy. The energy needed to produce enough hydrogen to power a car can cause pollution. Also, it's hard to carry enough hydrogen to power a vehicle for a long trip.

Stars give off light and heat because of the energy made when hydrogen atoms are merged (or fused) together to form heavier elements. Scientists are working to create a reactor that can make energy in the same way. This, however, is a very hard problem to solve and will take many years before we see useful fusion reactors built.

==Is it dangerous?==
Elemental hydrogen is highly flammable, and when it is mixed with oxygen gas or with air it can explode.

The Whomping Willow destroys the flying car in which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] arrive at Hogwarts in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 5|their second year]]; it apparently manages to injure itself slightly in this event. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]] teacher, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]], is seen to have been tending it. At the same time, we learn something about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]], who has been &quot;advising&quot; her; tellingly, Professor Sprout is carrying all the tools and equipment, has been injured in the endeavor, and is looking nettled, while Professor Lockhart has not even a hair out of place. 

We find out later in that book that the Whomping Willow was planted specifically to guard the entrance to a secret passage. It was actually brought to Hogwarts when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] was a student at school. The tree hid a secret tunnel that led to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|the Shrieking Shack]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]; when the full moon caused Lupin to transform into a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|werewolf]], he could lock himself into the Shack and so avoid harming his fellow students. This particular willow can be temporarily stilled by pressing a specific knot at its base; this is the technique used by Lupin (and others) to enter the secret tunnel that it conceals between its roots. The presence of this knot is revealed to Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]]; we also later see Lupin and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] using it. It is possible that Sprout knows about this, but was prevented from using it while tending the tree's injuries because of Lockhart's presence; this would explain not only her injuries, but part of her visible annoyance with him. Most of her annoyance, likely, would have been caused by his staying out of range and shouting unnecessary and probably incorrect advice, while Sprout was actually doing the hard and dangerous work.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 9|Harry's third year]], the tree destroys Harry's Nimbus 2000 [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broom]]. We are never told whether the Willow has a particular antipathy to brooms, but it does reduce Harry's treasured broom to splinters.

Finally, we see that the Trio have to pass the Willow to reach the Shrieking Shack, where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] has established his field headquarters for the attack on Hogwarts. In this instance, it is Ron who triggers the knot that stills the tree. How he knows about the knot and its function is not explained, as Sirius had already dragged him into the tunnel when Crookshanks revealed its operation to Harry and Hermione;

== Analysis ==

There is a technique of tree-trimming much practiced in England, and places following the English model, where major branches of a tree are cut quite short and repeatedly. This results in a tree with stubby branches and large round growths on the ends of its branches. These, looking like knuckles on the ends of the branches, could easily inspire the idea of a tree that acts as if it has fists.

Like many of the obstacles Harry faces in his endeavors, the Whomping Willow is impersonal; it neither likes nor dislikes Harry, it simply defends its secret against all comers. Other similar obstacles are Fluffy, the three headed dog, and most of the other barriers between Harry and the chamber where the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] is kept in the first book. We suspect these challenges are intended to illustrate to the reader how not all obstacles are malign; they would, and do, act the same no matter who is challenging them. Harry's reaction, showing dismay, for instance, when his broom is destroyed, without having the urge to destroy the Willow, shows maturity and likely is intended to teach that sort of mature response to adversity. It is to the author's credit that the lesson is not belaboured, as that makes it much more likely to be accepted.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 32|the final book of the series]], Voldemort uses the Shrieking Shack as a command post. As he attended Hogwarts before Lupin, the tunnel to the school may not have existed in his day, and the Whomping Willow certainly did not. The Trio have to pass the Willow and traverse the tunnel in order to determine what Voldemort is doing. Voldemort is clearly unaware of the tunnel, as the Trio do not encounter any difficulty other than the Willow in reaching the room where Voldemort is holding court.

The effort to pass the Willow results in a bit of byplay between Ron and Hermione that echoes an event in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 16|the first book]]. As mentioned in the Extended Description section, there is no explanation for how Ron knows to still the tree, as he was dragged into the tunnel before Crookshanks demonstrated the operation of the knot. We suspect that having Ron still the Willow was done specifically to allow that echo from the first book, and his not having earlier seen the knot being used was an oversight on the author's part.

[[Image:GraphiteUSGOV.jpg|thumb|right|350px|'''Graphite.''' Pencil lead is made of graphite. Graphite is made up of the element [[../Carbon|carbon]].]]

To know what &quot;Elements&quot; are, you need to know about chemistry. So, what is chemistry? Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes that take place within that matter. Unfortunately, this does not tell you very much about chemistry, and it is also a very long way from telling you EVERYTHING about chemistry. 

Everything on Earth, everything in our solar system, everything in our galaxy, and everything in the universe is made up of matter. Matter is the name that scientists have given to everything you can touch, or see, or feel, or smell. Matter takes up space, and matter has weight. To be really correct, we should say that '''matter has volume and mass'''. In other words matter has substance, and '''&quot;Elements&quot;''' (about 118 of them) are what gives matter its substance, even what makes it exist at all.

Most of the matter around you will have more than one element in it. But there are bits of matter that you have certainly seen and touched that are made up of just one element. If you have ever held a diamond, for example, it has been formed from just one element, the element Carbon. Surprisingly, the graphite in a pencil that you use for drawing or writing is also Carbon, just arranged differently.

Some other examples of matter you may have seen which have just one element are: an aluminium drink can; 24 carat gold jewelry; the helium gas in a balloon that floats upwards; cast iron garden railings; lead sheeting used by builders on the roofs of houses; a powder called &quot;Flowers of Sulphur&quot; that you can buy in a pharmacy. 

In actual fact these are not perfectly true examples of elements, because an element, like gold or aluminium, will always have tiny amounts of other elements present as impurities.

Not many elements occur &quot;naturally;&quot; that is to say as pieces of nearly pure substance that you can pick from the ground. The elements Gold and Sulphur do occur naturally, as does Carbon when it is a diamond.

To purify them, most elements have to be pried apart from one another, because in most matter they are fixed together by strong &quot;chemical bonds.&quot; Sometimes this can be done quite easily by using heat or electricity.

Ancient people knew how to make the element Iron. They did it by heating iron ore dug from the ground with charcoal they got from burning wood. The matter containing the iron was originally a &quot;compound&quot; of two elements, iron and oxygen; by heating with charcoal the oxygen was removed as a gas called carbon dioxide, leaving iron behind.

The elements Sodium and Chlorine can be separated from common salt by passing an electric current into salt that is melted at a very high temperature. The salt we started with is said to be a &quot;compound&quot; of sodium and chlorine. It is given the scientific name of sodium chloride.

One interesting source of elements is the air around us.  It contains a mixture of elements that are all gases, such as Oxygen which you will have heard of already, as well as many gases which are not elements but are compounds — a bit like salt, only different!.

To get the elements from the air we need to cool it down to a very low temperature, much lower than even Siberia in winter!  At around &amp;minus;190°C it forms a liquid.  It's a bit like cooling down steam to make water.  Afterwards, by boiling this liquid, the gases are released one at a time.  As well as elements Oxygen and Nitrogen, we can get what are called the &quot;Noble Gas&quot; elements Argon, Xenon and Krypton.  Two other noble gases, Helium and Neon, are in the air and can be taken out by cooling to an even lower temperature.

You have probably wondered how we have got this far without using some words that you probably have heard, and which are very much part of the subject of chemistry: atom, molecule, electron, nuclear and so forth. In fact, up until about 150 years ago chemists didn't really know very much about any of these things, even though they did understand the difference between elements and compounds.

Today we can &quot;see&quot; atoms by using a special electron microscope, which magnifies things that are millions of times smaller than those things we look at with an ordinary microscope. Under a scanning electron microscope, which shows things in 3-D, atoms appear as fuzzy balls.

'''Atoms''' are the key to describing why there exists different elements and why these elements form just those '''compounds''' that they do. 

Atoms also explain why the Periodic Table of Elements is the way it is, even though much of it was worked out by the old-time chemists like Dobereiner and Medeleev (see Chapter 4). Understanding atoms can explain, for example, why there are just 81 elements that have atoms which can exist for ever.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

I would like to comment on the Finnish name of this project: ''Suomen kieli ulkomaalaisille'' sounds awkward; it actually means giving the whole language to foreigners (how's that possible?), or maybe &quot;to&quot; instead of &quot;for&quot; in English. Correct name would be ''Suomen kiel'''tä''' ulkomaalaisille'', or even better, just ''Suomea ulkomaalaisille''. It is the process of giving a part of Finnish, not all, to foreigners.

Interesting project, especially laudable as it seems that main contributor is not a native Finnish speaker. I will probably contribute something.--[[User:Jyril|Jyril]] 23:22, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

==='''Summary'''===

Helena, the daughter of a famous doctor, has been the ward of the Countess of Rousillon, a wise and kindly old noblewoman, since her father's death. The Countess' husband has also recently died, and her son Count Bertram, a brave, handsome, but callow young man, is sent to serve the King of France, his liege lord. (The King, we learn, is dying). Helena is in love with Bertram, but hopelessly, since he is a nobleman and she a commoner. As he departs for the King's Court, she banters with Parolles, an unsavory character who has managed to gain Bertram's ear despite being a liar and a coward. They discuss chastity in coarse terms, with Parolles recomending that she find a husband and lose her virginity quickly. As they speak Helena conceives a plan that she hopes will gain her the hand of Bertram. 

Bertram arrives at the King's court, where the cautious monarch has recently decided to stay out of a war involving Austria and the Duke of Florence--with the caveat that any French noblemen who wish to involve themselves in the conflict are free to go. Greeting Bertram, the King laments the loss of the young man's father, and then remarks that he wishes Helena's father were still living, because only such a great doctor could now save his life. Meanwhile, in Rousillon, the countess walks about and chats with the coarse, bawdy Clown who once served her husband. Her Steward joins them and informs the Countess that he overheard Helena declaring her love for Bertram; the noblewoman sends for her ward immediately. After much dissembling, Helena admits to loving the Countess' son, and then immediately declares her plan to go to the King's palace and offer her services as a doctor, using the medical knowledge that her father taught her. The Countess, while expressing her doubts that the King and the royal doctors will accept the help of a young woman, gives her blessing, and sends Helena on her way.

=='''Commentary'''== 

The play opens on a dark, somber note: as Bertram departs, his mother recalls her husband's passing, and Bertram comments that &quot;I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew.&quot; (Act I, Scene I, Lines 3-4) Lafew. the wise old nobleman, makes an attempt at comforting them by saying that the King will act as a husband and father to the family, but this only leads into a discussion of the King's illness, and how he has abandoned all hope of a cure--which, in turn, leads them to speak of the recent death of Helena's father. This conversation is useful to the audience, since it fills in the background details before the action of the play begins, but its heavy emphasis on illness and death casts a pall over the scene. Indeed, the entire older generation in All's Well That Ends Well is nearing death--the King, the Countess, Lafew are all figures of wisdom, offering sage advice to the headstrong young, but they are also figures of decay and decrepitude. The Countess and Lafew speak repeatedly of their own feebleness and impending deaths; the King's life will be saved by Helena, but it is clearly only a reprieve, and he seems to lack energy, especially in his refusal to take part in the war that so many of his young nobles flock to join. In sum, the play presents a &quot;generation gap&quot;--a stark contrast between the weakness of the older generation and the vitality of the younger characters (Helena, Bertram, Diana, etc.).

The shadow that mortality casts on the action is one reason why this play has often been termed a &quot;problem comedy,&quot; or &quot;dark comedy.&quot; Another reason is the nature of the younger generation, who are poised to inherit from their wiser, aging elders. Bertram, the supposed romantic hero, possesses most of the appropriate attributes--everyone admits that he is handsome, dashing, and brave, and certainly, Helena speaks highly of him, desribing his &quot;bright radiance and collateral light /...His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls&quot; (Act 1, Scene 1, Lines 94-100) in the glowing terms of a would-be lover. But, significantly, she only mentions, and we only observe, the superficial qualities of the man. When he shows his true colors later, his image will be tarnished significantly.

Helena, meanwhile, is more appealing--her worth is evident despite her low birth--and already her resourcefulness is on display as she assumes the male role of physician (a common burden for Shakespeare's heroines, who either end up wearing men's clothes, like Viola in Twelth Night, or doing men's work, like the lawyerly Portia in The Merchant of Venice) and plans a journey to Paris. But her fixation on Bertram, while determined, will come to seem almost monomaniacal--it is her defining character trait, in the end. Her love, she admits, is a kind of &quot;idolatrous fancy,&quot; (Act 1, Scene 1, Line 103) but she will not release her hold on it. There is a bitter edge to her humor, too, a coarseness that other Shakespearean heroines lack; her conversation with Parolles, filled with sexual innuendo, displays a cynicism about relations between the sexes that is seems jarring coming from a romantic heroine. 

The cynicism is appropriate to Parolles, of course, who seems cast as the villain in the early going. Eventually, his essential harmlessness will be revealed--he is a minor rogue, whose boasts and lies are dangerous, but not deadly.

{{info|Before reading this chapter, students should be familiar with the ''fourier series'' decomposition method. Information about this can be found in [[Signals and Systems]].}}
The L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; space is an infinite function space, and therefore a linear combination of any infinite set of orthogonal functions can be used to represent any single member of the L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; space. The decomposition of an L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; function in terms of an infinite basis set is a technique known as the '''Fourier Decomposition''' of the function, and produces a result called the '''Fourier Series'''.

== Fourier Basis ==

Let's consider a set of L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; functions, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \{1, \sin(\pi x), \cos(\pi x), \sin(2\pi x), \cos(2\pi x), \sin(3\pi x), \cos(3\pi x) ...\}. \ &lt;/math&gt;

We can prove that over a range &lt;math&gt;[0, 2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;, all of these functions are orthogonal:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2\pi} 1 \cdot \cos(n\pi x) dx = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2\pi} 1 \cdot \sin(n\pi x) dx = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2\pi} \sin(n\pi x) \sin(m\pi x)dx = 0, n \ne m&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2\pi} \sin(n\pi x) \cos(m\pi x)dx = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2\pi} \cos(n\pi x) \cos(m\pi x)dx = 0, n \ne m&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is as an infinite orthogonal set in L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is also a valid basis set in the L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; space. Therefore, we can decompose any function in L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the following sum:

{{eqn|Classical Fourier Series}}
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) = a_0(1) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \sin(n\pi x) + \sum_{m=1}^\infty b_m\cos(m\pi x)&lt;/math&gt;

However, the difficulty occurs when we need to calculate the a and b coefficients. We will show the method to do this below:

== a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;: The Constant Term ==

Calculation of a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the easiest, and therefore we will show how to calculate it first. We use the value of a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; which minimizes the error in approximating &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; by the Fourier series.

First, define an error function, E, that is equal to the squared norm of the difference between the function f(x) and the infinite sum above:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{2\pi}\|f(x) - a_0(1) - \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \sin(n\pi x) - \sum_{m=1}^\infty b_m\cos(m\pi x)\|^2dx&lt;/math&gt;

For ease, we will write all the basis functions as the set &amp;phi;, described above:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i\phi_i = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \sin(n\pi x) + \sum_{m=1}^\infty b_m\cos(m\pi x)&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the last two functions together, and writing the norm as an integral, we can say:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{2\pi}|\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i\phi_i|^2dx&lt;/math&gt;

We attempt to minimize this error function with respect to the constant term. To do this, we differentiate both sides with respect to a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and set the result to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \frac{\partial E}{\partial a_0} = \int_0^{2\pi} (f(x) - \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i\phi_i(x))(-\phi_0(x))dx&lt;/math&gt;

The &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; term comes out of the sum because of the chain rule: it is the only term in the entire sum dependant on a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. We can separate out the integral above as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2\pi} (f(x) - \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i\phi_i)(-\phi_0)dx = -\int_0^{2\pi}f(x)\phi_0(x)dx + a_0\int_0^{2\pi}\phi_0(x)\phi_0(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

All the other terms drop out of the infinite sum because they are all orthogonal to &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Again, we can rewrite the above equation in terms of the scalar product:

:&lt;math&gt;0 = -\langle f(x), \phi_0(x)\rangle + a_0\langle \phi_0(x), \phi_0(x)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

And solving for a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, we get our final result:

:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = \frac{\langle f(x), \phi_0(x)\rangle}{\langle \phi_0(x), \phi_0(x)\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;

== Sin Coefficients ==

Using the above method, we can solve for the a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; coefficients of the sin terms:

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = \frac{\langle f(x), \sin(n\pi x)\rangle}{\langle \sin(n\pi x), \sin(n\pi x)\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;

== Cos Coefficients ==

Also using the above method, we can solve for the b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; terms of the cos term.

:&lt;math&gt;b_n = \frac{\langle f(x), \cos(n\pi x)\rangle}{\langle \cos(n\pi x), \cos(n\pi x)\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;

Epidemiology

The overall prevalence of presure sores in the nursing home population is 11% [http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/1/45?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=&amp;hits=&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;fulltext=pressure+sores&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT ulcers]


Sociology

Sorting out the influence of clinical factors and care factors is a poignant reminder of how the responsibility for the physical integrity of the nursing home resident falls to the staff of the nursing home. We can only hope and attempt to foster a quality standard akin to the care of a loving family which we hold as an optimal standard even though by definition the nursing home patient by virtue of clinical factors, the intensity and duration of care needed has exceeded the capacity of the extended family unit to provide for their needs. Thus this issue is a comment on modern industrial society and the breakdown of the family unit and the outsourcing of intergenerational responsibilities. 

Pathophysiology

Wound Healing

Prevention

In the case of pressure ulcers prevention is the most cost effective approach, however in the population at risk medicare dollars are not available for preventative measures and in fact treatment is underfunded until complicated by infection. Like falls, pressure ulcers have been considered a nursing-sensitive outcome.  [http://wjn.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/28/6/654?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=&amp;hits=&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=decubitus+ulcer&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT pressure ulcers]

Nutrition

Nutritional inadequacy and pressures sores go hand in hand. How to prevent the second by attending to the first is not so easy. How to overcome depression and altered awareness and diminished appetite, loss of taste, even the loss of a sufficient coordination to physically engage in eating make nutrition a more daunting problem than encouraging the nursing home patient to eat. Feeding tubes have there own problems including impeding mobility, diarrhea and fecal incontinence (with resultant risk of skin breakdown) [http://biomed.gerontologyjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/59/4/M355 nutrition]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Automatics ==

The 42RLE is a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission. The 42RLE comes in 2003.5+ Jeep Libertys.  The 45RFE is a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission, with an alternative 2nd gear ratio for downshifting. The 45RFE was replaced by the 42RLE in 2003.5+ Libertys.  The 545RFE is a 5-speed overdrive automatic transmission. The 545RFE was the only transmission available in Liberty CRD (diesel engine) models.  The Liberty's maximum tow rating with an automatic transmission is Class III 5,000#.  Mechanically, the 42RLE has 13 bolts and a straight crossmember, while the 45RFE and 545RFE have 15 bolts and a backwards angled crossmember.  Electronically, vehicles equipped with the 42RLE have a 4 connector NGC PCM (Powertrain Control Module) with an integrated TCM (Transmission Control Module), while those equipped with the 45RFE have a 3 connector JTEC PCM and a separate TCM.

== Manuals ==

The NSG370 is a 6-speed overdrive manual transmission.  The NSG370 comes in 2005+ Jeep Libertys.  The NV3500 is a 5-speed overdrive manual transmission.  The NV3500 was replaced by the NSG370 in 2005+ Libertys.  The NV1500 is 5-speed overdrive manual transmission with an unsynchronized first gear.  The Liberty's maximum tow rating with a manual transmission is Class II 3,500#.  The clutch design of the manuals results in a lower tow rating than that of the automatics.  A driver skilled in towing with manuals may be able to safely tow more than Class II.

Jeep Libertys with the 42RLE transmission have an auxiliary transmission cooler in front of the engine radiator.  Libertys with the 45RFE transmission have a cooler built into the engine radiator.  Liberty CRDs with the 545RFE have a combination transmission cooler &amp; A/C condenser in front of the intercooler and engine radiator.  Libertys with the NSG370, NV1500, and NV3500 manual transmissions don't have a cooler because manual transmissions lack a fluid pump.

== Off-Roading ==

An automatic transmission is more popular than a manual for off-roading.  It removes the distraction, water leakage, and clutch wear associated with off-road manual shifting.  These benefits come at a price, as an automatic is always heavier than an equivalent manual.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A force system is a collection of forces acting at specified locations (may also include couples). Thus the set of forces shown on any free body diagram make up a force system.  '''Force system''' is simply a term used to describe a group of forces.

==Resultants==
When two or more forces or moments are combined, the combination is called a '''resultant'''.  Any force system can be simplified about a point to a resultant consisting of one force and one couple (either or both of which may be zero). The force is applied to the point and is the vector sum of all of the forces in the system. The couple is the vector sum of all of the couples in the force system plus the vector sum of all of the moments about the point of all of the forces in the force system. One immediate consequence of this definition of resultant is that the resultant about any point of the external force system acting on any system in equilibrium must be zero. The statement that the sum of the external forces and the sum of the external moments acting on a system in equilibrium is zero is often replaced by the statement that the resultant acting on a system in equilibrium is zero. An important attribute of the resultant of a force system is that if you apply the resultant of a force system to a rigid body, the effect on that rigid body is exactly the same as the effect of the original force system. It is in this sense that the resultant is &quot;equivalent&quot; to the original force system. Thus as we study the behavior of rigid bodies under the action of forces, the resultant of the external force system will be of vital interest. Care must be taken in replacing force systems with their resultant when dealing with deformable bodies as the effects of the resultant acting on a non-rigid system will be different than the effects of the actual force system.

==Equipollence==
The &quot;equivalence&quot; of effect on a rigid body of a force system and its resultant is the motivation for the term '''equipollence'''. Two force systems are said to be equipollent if they have the same resultant about a point. Thus two equipollent force systems have the same effect on a rigid body. Thus the precise way to state what we have learned about the toe is that the upper clamping surface exerts a force system on the toe that is equipollent to a force of 540 lb in the -Y direction acting at a point at the top, middle of the toe. Typically we are not this precise and merely state that the clamping surface is exerting a force of 540 lb in the -Y direction on the top, middle point of the toe. It is important for you to recognize that when you hear such statements, what they mean is that the force system acting on the object is equipollent to the specified force and that the particular distribution or combination of forces involved may be quite complicated.

The classical Fourier series uses the following basis:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x) = {1, \sin(n\pi x), \cos(n \pi x)}, n = 1, 2, ...&lt;/math&gt;

However, we can generalize this concept to extend to any orthogonal basis set from the L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; space. 

We can say that if we have our orthogonal basis set that is composed of an infinite set of arbitrary, orthogonal L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; functions:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = {\phi_1, \phi_2, \cdots, }&lt;/math&gt;

We can define any L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; function f(x) in terms of this basis set:

{{eqn|Generalized Fourier Series}}
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n\phi_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Using the method from the previous chapter, we can solve for the coefficients as follows:

{{eqn|Generalized Fourier Coefficient}}
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = \frac{\langle f(x), \phi_n(x)\rangle}{\langle \phi_n(x), \phi_n(x)\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''What is Matter?'''

Matter is everything around you. Matter is everything made of atoms and molecules. Matter is anything that has a mass, which means it can be weighed. However, some things that are matter can't be scooped up and weighed. For instance, matter is also related to light.

Even though matter can be found all over the universe, you usually find it in just a few forms. As of 1995, scientists have identified five states of matter. They may discover one more by the time you get old.

You should know about solids, liquids, and gases, because they are the states of matter you deal with every day.  Ionized gases, or plasmas, are also a state of matter.  In 1995 scientists first created a new state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate.  The scientists who first made Bose-Einstein condensates received a Nobel Prize for their work in 2001. 

But what makes a state of matter? It's all about what the smallest parts of matter, called molecules and atoms, are doing. They might be flying around really fast, like in a gas. Or they might be stuck together in a rigid form to make a solid. These are very different ways for molecules to behave, and they lead to very different properties, as we shall see later.

Elements and compounds can move from one state to another and not change. Nitrogen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser but the molecules are still the same. Water is another example. The compound water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. It has the same molecular structure whether it is a gas, liquid, or solid. Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains the same.

&quot;So,&quot; you ask, &quot;What is a chemical state?&quot;  If the formula of water were to change, that would be a chemical change.  If you added another oxygen atom, you would make hydrogen peroxide, a different molecule.  Changing states of matter is about changing densities, pressures, and temperatures.  If the basic chemical structure changes, that is a chemical change.

Bessel's equation relates the original function to the fourier coefficients a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;:

{{eqn|Bessel's Equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n^2 \le \|f(x)\|^2&lt;/math&gt;

If the basis set is infinitely orthogonal, and if an infinite sum of the basis functions perfectly reproduces the function f(x), then the above equation will be an equality, known as Parseval's Theorem:

{{eqn|Parseval's Theorem}}
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n^2 = \|f(x)\|^2&lt;/math&gt;

Engineers may recognize this as a relationship between the energy of the signal, as represented in the time and frequency domains. However, parseval's rule applies not only to the classical Fourier series coefficients, but also to the generalized series coefficients as well.

      <comment>/* Convergant Functions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Analysis}}

There are some special spaces known as '''Banach''' spaces, and '''Hilbert''' spaces. 

== Convergent Functions ==

Let's define the piece-wise function &amp;phi;(x) as:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_n(x) = \left\{\begin{matrix}0 &amp;  x \le 0 \\
                                         nx &amp; 0 &lt; x \le \frac{1}{n} \\
                                         1 &amp; \frac{1}{n} &lt; x 
                           \end{matrix}\right. &lt;/math&gt;

We can see that as we set &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, this function becomes the unit step function. We can say that as n approaches infinity, that this function converges to the unit step function. Notice that this function only converges in the L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; space, because the unit step function does not exist in the C space (it is not continuous).

=== Convergence ===

We can say that a function &amp;phi; converges to a function &amp;phi;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; if:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty}\|\phi_n - \phi^*\| = 0&lt;/math&gt;

We can call this sequences, and all such sequences that converge to a given function as n approaches infinity a '''cauchy sequence'''.

=== Complete Function Spaces ===

A function space is called complete if all sequences in that space converge to another function in that space.

== Banach Space ==

A Banach Space is a complete normed function space.

== Hilbert Space ==

A Hilbert Space is a Banach Space with respect to a norm induced by the scalar product. That is, if there is a scalar product in the space X, then we can say the norm is induced by the scalar product if we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\| = g(\langle f, f\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

That is, that the norm can be written as a function of the scalar product. In the L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; space, we can define the norm as:

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\| = \sqrt{\langle f, f\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;

If the scalar product space is a Banach Space, if the norm space is also a Banach space.

In a Hilbert Space, the Parallelogram rule holds for all members f and g in the function space:

:&lt;math&gt;\|f + g\|^2 + \|f - g\|^2 = 2\|f\|^2 + 2\|g\|^2&lt;/math&gt;

The L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; space is a Hilbert Space. The C space, however, is not.

      <comment>/* NV241J */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Transfer case|Transfer cases]] for the Jeep Liberty are built by [[w:New Venture Gear|New Venture Gear]], hence the NV prefix.  New Venture inherited New Process Gear from Chrysler, therefore the older transfer cases are prefixed with NP. Whether prefixed with NV or NP, parts are interchangeable between the same transfer case model.

Full-time 4WD can be used on pavement because it utilizes the differential in the transfer case. Part-time 4WD Lo and 4WD Hi can't be used on pavement because they lock the axles together in the transfer case. While the 2WD, full-time 4WD, and part-time 4WD Hi modes support the maximum vehicle speed, the part-time 4WD Lo mode does not.  Part-time 4WD Hi should not be engaged over 55mph.  Essentially, part-time 4WD should be used for off-road, full-time 4WD for maximum traction on-road, and 2WD for everything else.

== NV231J ==

The NV231J, utilized in the Command-Trac system, is a mechanically shifted part-time transfer case.  Its chain-driven aluminum construction makes it weaker than gear-driven iron transfer cases.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2
! Mode !! Gear Ratio
|-
| 2WD || 1.00:1
|-
| 4-HI Part Time || 1.00:1 
|-
| N || N/A
|-
| 4-LO || 2.72:1
|}

== NV241J ==

The NV241J, also known as Command-Trac HD, is sometimes incorrectly referred to as an &quot;NV231J-HD&quot;.  It was available in the 2005-2007 Jeep Liberty (KJ) with the 6-spd transmission in any package. The transfer case is tagged &quot;241J&quot; in these applications and uses the same gear ratios as the NV231J. This is not the limited production NV241OR found in the Wrangler Rubicon models.

== NV242 ==

The NV242, also known as Select-Trac, is a mechanically shifted full time tranfer case.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2
! Mode !! Gear Ratio
|-
| 2WD || 1.00:1
|-
| 4-HI Part Time || 1.00:1 
|-
| 4-HI Full Time || 1.00:1
|-
| N || N/A 
|-
| 4-LO || 2.72:1
|}

== Slip Yoke Eliminator ==

A slip yoke eliminator replaces the slip yoke in the rear of the transfer case with a fixed yoke.  Primarily this allows for the installation of double cardon joints and reduces the driveshaft angle by increasing the driveline length.  These two changes help cut down on vibration caused by lifting the Jeep.  As an added benefit, it prevents the transfer case from spilling fluid everywhere if the driveshaft gets pulled out.  When installing a slip yoke eliminator, a drive shaft with an integrated slip yoke and double cardon joints must also be installed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= The States of Matter=

[[Image:Snow river.jpg|thumb|250px|When snow is melting, water is turning from a solid to a liquid form.]]

There are four main states of matter:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Solids
| Solids hold their shape rigidly.
| Examples: Blocks, dishes, chairs, pencils
|-
! Liquids
| Liquids take the shape of their container, but hold themselves together.
| Examples: Water, soda, milk, blood
|-
! Gases 
| Gases take the shape of their container completely, spreading apart.
| Examples: Air, oxygen, carbon dioxide, steam
|-
! Plasmas
| Plasmas can act like gases, but are also affected by electromagnetic fields.
| Examples: Candle flames, lightning&amp;nbsp;bolts, stars, forest fires
|}

Each state is also known as a ''phase''. Elements can change from one phase to another under certain physical conditions. These conditions are ''temperature'' and ''pressure''.  Temperature is related to the amount of heat a substance has, and pressure is the amount of force &quot;squeezing&quot; the substance.  Deep underwater there is high pressure, and atop a mountain there is low pressure.

There is also another state of matter called ''plasma''.  It exists on the sun and in fluorescent lights.  Plasma is basically a gas that has become electrified.

There are special names for the process of changing from one phase to another:

[[Image:Phase change - en.svg|thumb|300px|center|The phase changes]]

An substance can change from one phase to another, but still be the same substance.  You can see water vapor over a boiling pot of water. That gas can condense and become a drop of water. If you put that drop in the freezer, it would become a solid. No matter what phase it is in, it is always the same chemical: water.  It has the same chemical properties.  In other words, ice is just solid water, and steam is just gaseous water.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Analysis}}

== Norms ==

=== Induced Norms ===

=== n-Norm ===

=== Frobenius Norm ===

=== Spectral Norm ===

== Derivatives ==

Consider the following set of linear equations:

:&lt;math&gt;a = bx_1 + cx_2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;d = ex_1 + fx_2&lt;/math&gt;

We can define the matrix A to represent the coefficients, the vector B as the results, and the vector x as the variables:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}b &amp;  c \\ e &amp; f\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = \begin{bmatrix}a \\ d\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

And rewriting the equation in terms of the matrices, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;B = Ax&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let's say we want the derivative of this equation with respect to the vector x:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}B = \frac{d}{dx}Ax&lt;/math&gt;

We know that the first term is constant, so the derivative of the left-hand side of the equation is zero. Analyzing the right side shows us:

== Pseudo-Inverses ==

There are special matrices known as '''pseudo-inverses''', that satisfies some of the properties of an inverse, but not others. To recap, If we have two square matrices A and B, that are both n &amp;times; n, then if the following equation is true, we say that A is the inverse of B, and B is the inverse of A:

:&lt;math&gt;AB = BA = I&lt;/math&gt;

=== Right Pseudo-Inverse ===

Consider the following matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;R = A^T[AA^T]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

We call this matrix R the '''right pseudo-inverse''' of A, because:

:&lt;math&gt;AR = I&lt;/math&gt;

but

:&lt;math&gt;RA \ne I&lt;/math&gt;

We will denote the right pseudo-inverse of A as &lt;math&gt;A^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;

=== Left Pseudo-Inverse ===

Consider the following matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;L = [A^TA]^{-1}A^T&lt;/math&gt;

We call L the '''left pseudo-inverse''' of A because

:&lt;math&gt;LA = I&lt;/math&gt;

but 

:&lt;math&gt;AL \ne I&lt;/math&gt;

We will denote the left pseudo-inverse of A as &lt;math&gt;A^\ddagger&lt;/math&gt;</text>

== The Eigen Problem ==

This page is going to talk about the concept of '''Eigenvectors''' and '''Eigenvalues''', which are important tools in linear algebra, and which play an important role in State-Space control systems. The &quot;Eigen Problem&quot; stated simply, is that given a square matrix A which is n &amp;times; n, there exists a set of n scalar values &amp;lambda; and n corresponding non-trivial vectors v such that:

:&lt;math&gt;Av = \lambda v&lt;/math&gt;

We call &amp;lambda; the '''eigenvalues''' of A, and we call '''v''' the corresponding '''eigenvectors''' of A. We can rearrange this equation as:

:&lt;math&gt;(A - \lambda I)v = 0&lt;/math&gt;

For this equation to be satisfied so that v is non-trivial, the matrix (A - &amp;lambda;I) must be singular. That is:

:&lt;math&gt;|A - \lambda I| = 0&lt;/math&gt;

== Characteristic Equation ==

{{wikipedia|Characteristic polynomial}}

The characteristic equation of a square matrix A is given by:

{{eqn|Characteristic Equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;|A - \lambda I| = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Where I is the identity matrix, and &amp;lambda; is the set of '''eigenvalues''' of matrix A. From this equation we can solve for the eigenvalues of A, and then using the equations discussed above, we can calculate the corresponding eigenvectors. 

In general, we can expand the characteristic equation as:

{{eqn|Characteristic Polynomial}}
:&lt;math&gt;|A - \lambda I| = (-1)^n(\lambda^n + c_{n-1}\lambda^{n-1} + \cdots + c_1\lambda^1 + c_0)&lt;/math&gt;

This equation satisfies the following properties:

#&lt;math&gt;|A| = (-1)^n c_0&lt;/math&gt;
#A is nonsingular if c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is non-zero.

=== Example: 2 &amp;times; 2 Matrix ===

Let's say that X is a square matrix of order 2, as such:

:&lt;math&gt;X = \begin{bmatrix}a &amp; b \\c &amp; d\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Then we can use this value in our characteristic equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}a - \lambda &amp; b \\ c &amp; d- \lambda\end{vmatrix} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(a - \lambda)(d - \lambda) - (b)(c) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The roots to the above equation (the values for &amp;lambda; that satisfies the equality) are the eigenvalues of X.

== Eigenvalues ==

The solutions, &amp;lambda;, of the characteristic equation for matrix X are known as the '''eigenvalues''' of the matrix X.

Eigenvalues satisfy the following properties:

#If &amp;lambda; is an eigenvalue of A, &amp;lambda;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; is an eigenvalue of A&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.
#If &amp;lambda; is a complex eigenvalue of A, then &amp;lambda;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (the complex conjugate) is also an eigenvalue of A.
#If any of the eigenvalues of A are zero, then A is singular. If A is non-singular, all the eigenvalues of A are nonzero.

== Eigenvectors ==

The characteristic equation can be rewritten as such:

:&lt;math&gt;Xv = \lambda v&lt;/math&gt;

Where X is the matrix under consideration, and &amp;lambda; are the eigenvalues for matrix X. For every unique eigenvalue, there is a solution vector v to the above equation, known as an '''eigenvector'''. The above equation can also be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;|X - \lambda I|v = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Where the resulting values of v for each eigenvalue &amp;lambda; is an eigenvector of X. There is a unique eigenvector for each unique eigenvalue of X. From this equation, we can see that the eigenvectors of A form the nullspace:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \mathcal{N}\{A - \lambda I\}&lt;/math&gt;

And therefore, we can find the eigenvectors through row-reduction of that matrix.

Eigenvectors satisfy the following properties:

#If v is a complex eigenvector of A, then v&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (the complex conjugate) is also an eigenvector of A.
#Distinct eigenvectors of A are linearly independent.
#If A is n &amp;times; n, and if there are n distinct eigenvectors, then the eigenvectors of A form a complete basis set for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalized Eigenvectors ==

Let's say that matrix '''A''' has the following characteristic polynomial:

:&lt;math&gt;(A - \lambda I) = (-1)^n(\lambda - \lambda_1)^{d_1}(\lambda - \lambda_2)^{d_2} \cdots (\lambda - \lambda_s)^{d_s}&lt;/math&gt;

Where d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , d&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; are known as the '''algebraic multiplicity''' of the eigenvalue &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. Also note that d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
+ d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + d&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = n, and s &lt; n. In other words, the eigenvalues of A are repeated. Therefore, this matrix doesnt have n distinct eigenvectors. However, we can create vectors known as '''generalized eigenvectors''' to make up the missing eigenvectors by satisfying the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;(A-\lambda I)^k v_k = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A-\lambda I)^{k-1} v_k = 0&lt;/math&gt;

== Right and Left Eigenvectors ==

The equation for determining eigenvectors is:

:&lt;math&gt;(A - \lambda I) v = 0&lt;/math&gt;

And because the eigenvector ''v'' is on the right, these are more appropriately called &quot;right eigenvectors&quot;. However, if we rewrite the equation as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;u(A - \lambda I) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The vectors ''u'' are called the &quot;left eigenvectors&quot; of matrix A.

== Companion Form ==

A '''companion form''' contains the coefficients of a corresponding characteristic polynomial along one of its far rows or columns. For example, one companion form matrix is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -a_0 \\
                       1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -a_1 \\
                       0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -a_2 \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -a_3 \\
                       \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 &amp; -a_{n-1} 
       \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and another is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} -a_{n-1} &amp; -a_{n-2} &amp; -a_{n-3} &amp; \cdots &amp; -a_1 &amp; -a_0 \\
                       1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 &amp; 0 
       \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

There are two companion forms that are convenient to use in control theory, namely the observable canonical form and the controllable canonical form. These two forms are roughly transposes of each other (just as observability and controllability are dual ideas). When placed in one of these forms, the design of controllers or observers is simplified because the structure of the system is made apparent (and is easily modified with the desired control).

=== Observable Canonical Form ===

'''Observable-Canonical Form''' is useful in a number of cases, especially for designing observers. 

The observable-canonical form is as follows:


:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix} -a_1 &amp;  1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
                       -a_2 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
                       \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
                       -a_{n-1} &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
                       -a_n &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 
       \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;  0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Controllable Canonical Form ===

'''Controllable-Canonical Form''' is useful in a number of cases, especially for designing controllers when the full state of the system is known. 

The controllable-canonical form is as follows:


:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix} -a_1 &amp; -a_2 &amp; -a_3 &amp; \cdots &amp; -a_{n-1} &amp; -a_n \\
                       1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 &amp; 0 
       \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; b_3 &amp; \cdots &amp; b_n \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;D = \begin{bmatrix} b_0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If we have two spaces, space ''v'' which is the original space of the system (''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D''), then we can transform our system into the ''w'' space which is in controllable-canonical form (''A&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''B&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''C&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''D&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'') using a transformation matrix ''T&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''. We define this transformation matrix as:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \zeta_v \zeta_w^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &amp;zeta; is the controlability matrix. 

Notice that we know beforehand  ''A&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''B&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'', since we know both the form of the matrices and the coefficients of the equation (e.g. a linear ODE with constant coefficients or a transfer function).  

If we know these two matrices, then we can form &amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;. We can then use this matrix to create our transformation matrix.

We will discuss the controllable canonical form later when we discuss state-feedback and closed-loop systems.

== Modal Form ==

In this form, the state matrix is a diagonal matrix of its (non-repeated) eigenvalues. The control has a unitary influence on each eigenspace, and the output is a linear combination of the contributions from the eigenspaces (where the weights are the complex residuals at each pole).

:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix} -p_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       0 &amp; -p_2 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; -p_3 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -p_n
       \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 &amp; c_2  &amp; \cdots &amp; c_n \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Jordan Form ===

This &quot;almost diagonal&quot; form handles the case where eigenvalues are repeated. The repeated eigenvalues represent a multi-dimensional eigenspace, and so the control only enters the eigenspace once and its integrated through the other states of that small subsystem.

:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix} 
                    -p_1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       0 &amp; -p_1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; -p_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -p_4 &amp; 0 &amp;\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -p_n
       \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 &amp; c_2 &amp; \cdots  &amp; c_n \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Phase Variable Form ==

== Computing Standard Forms in MATLAB ==

{{Matlab CMD|canon}}
MATLAB contains a function for automatically transforming a state space equation into a companion (e.g., controllable or observable canonical form) form.

 [Ap, Bp, Cp, Dp, P] = canon(A, B, C, D, 'companion');

{{Matlab CMD|compan}}
Moving from one companion form to the other usually involves elementary operations on matrices and vectors (e.g., transposes or interchanging rows). Given a vector with the coefficients of a characteristic polynomial, MATLAB can compute the corresponding companion form.

 compan(P)

Given another vector with the coefficients of a transfer function's numerator polynomial, the &lt;tt&gt;canon&lt;/tt&gt; command can do the same.

 [Ap, Bp, Cp, Dp, P] = canon(tf(Pnum,Pden), 'companion');


To transform a state space equation into a modal (e.g., diagonal) form, the same command can be used.

 [Ap, Bp, Cp, Dp, P] = canon(A, B, C, D, 'modal');

{{Matlab CMD|jordan}}
However, MATLAB also includes a command to compute the Jordan form of a matrix, which is a modified modal form suited for matrices that have repeated eigenvalues.

      <comment>/* String literals */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ruby Programming/TopNav|prev=Hello world|next=Alternate quotes}}

Like [[w:Python (programming language)|Python]], [[w:Java (programming language)|Java]], and the [[w:.NET Framework|.NET Framework]], Ruby has a built-in String class. 

== String literals ==

One way to create a String is to use single or double quotes inside a Ruby program to create what is called a string literal. We've already done this with our &quot;[[../Hello world/|hello world]]&quot; program. A quick update to our code shows the use of both single and double quotes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts 'Hello world'
puts &quot;Hello world&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Being able to use either single or double quotes is similar to [[w:Perl|Perl]], but different from languages such as [[w:C (programming language)|C]] and [[w:Java (programming language)|Java]], which use double quotes for string literals and single quotes for single characters.

So what difference is there between single quotes and double quotes in Ruby? In the above code, there's no difference. However, consider the following code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts &quot;Betty's pie shop&quot;
puts 'Betty\'s pie shop'
&lt;/source&gt;

Because &quot;&lt;code&gt;Betty's&lt;/code&gt;&quot; contains an apostrophe, which is the same character as the single quote, in the second line we need to use a backslash to escape the apostrophe so that Ruby understands that the apostrophe is ''in'' the string literal instead of marking the end of the string literal. The backslash followed by the single quote is called an [[w:escape sequence|escape sequence]].

== Single quotes ==

Single quotes only support two escape sequences.

* &lt;tt&gt;\' &lt;/tt&gt;&amp;ndash; single quote
* &lt;tt&gt;\\ &lt;/tt&gt;&amp;ndash; single backslash

Except for these two escape sequences, everything else between single quotes is treated literally.

== Double quotes ==

Double quotes allow for many more escape sequences than single quotes. They also allow you to embed variables or Ruby code inside of a string literal &amp;ndash; this is commonly referred to as [[#Interpolation|interpolation]].

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts &quot;Enter name&quot;
name = gets.chomp
puts &quot;Your name is #{name}&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Escape sequences ===

Below are some of the more common escape sequences that can appear inside of double quotes.

* &lt;tt&gt;\&quot; &lt;/tt&gt;&amp;ndash; double quote
* &lt;tt&gt;\\ &lt;/tt&gt;&amp;ndash; single backslash
* &lt;tt&gt;\a &lt;/tt&gt;&amp;ndash; [[w:bell character|bell/alert]]
* &lt;tt&gt;\b &lt;/tt&gt;&amp;ndash; [[w:backspace|backspace]]
* &lt;tt&gt;\r &lt;/tt&gt;&amp;ndash; [[w:carriage return|carriage return]]
* &lt;tt&gt;\n &lt;/tt&gt;&amp;ndash; [[w:newline|newline]]
* &lt;tt&gt;\s &lt;/tt&gt;&amp;ndash; [[w:space character|space]]
* &lt;tt&gt;\t &lt;/tt&gt;&amp;ndash; [[w:tab key|tab]]

Try out this example code to better understand escape sequences.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts &quot;Hello\t\tworld&quot;
 
puts &quot;Hello\b\b\b\b\bGoodbye world&quot;
 
puts &quot;Hello\rStart over world&quot;
 
puts &quot;1. Hello\n2. World&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The result:

 $ '''double-quotes.rb'''
 Hello&amp;#09;&amp;#09;world
 Goodbye world
 Start over world
 1. Hello
 2. World

Notice that the newline escape sequence (in the last line of code) simply starts a new line.

The [[w:bell character|bell character]], produced by escape code &lt;code&gt;\a&lt;/code&gt;, is considered a [[w:control character|control character]]. It does not represent a letter of the alphabet, a punctuation mark, or any other written symbol. Instead, it instructs the [[w:terminal emulator|terminal emulator]] (called a [[w:Win32 console|console]] on [[w:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]]) to &quot;alert&quot; the user. It is up to the terminal emulator to determine the specifics of how to respond, although a [[w:beep (sound)|beep]] is fairly standard. Some terminal emulators will flash briefly.

Run the following Ruby code to check out how your terminal emulator handles the bell character.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts &quot;\aHello world\a&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== puts ==

We've been using the &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; function quite a bit to print out text. Whenever &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; prints out text, it automatically prints out a newline after the text. For example, try the following code.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts &quot;Say&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;world&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The result:

 $ '''hello-world.rb'''
 Say
 hello
 to
 the
 world

== print ==

In contrast, Ruby's &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; function only prints out a newline if you specify one. For example, try out the following code. We include a newline at the end of &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;'s argument list so that the shell prompt appears on a new line, after the text.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
 print &quot;Say&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;world&quot;, &quot;\n&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The result:

 $ '''hello-world.rb'''
 Sayhellototheworld

The following code produces the same output, with all the words run together.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
print &quot;Say&quot;
print &quot;hello&quot;
print &quot;to&quot;

== Similarity ==

Matrices ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be similar to one another if there exists an invertable matrix ''T'' such that:

:&lt;math&gt;T^{-1}AT = B&lt;/math&gt;

If there exists such a matrix ''T'', the matrices are similar. Similar matrices have the same eigenvalues. If ''A'' has eigenvectors ''v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ..., then ''B'' has eigenvectors ''u'' given by:

:&lt;math&gt;u_i = Tv_i&lt;/math&gt;

== Matrix Diagonalization ==

Some matricies are similar to diagonal matrices using a '''transition matrix''', ''T''. We will say that matrix ''A'' is diagonalizable if the following equation can be satisfied:

:&lt;math&gt;T^{-1}AT = D&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''D'' is a diagonal matrix. An ''n &amp;times; n'' square matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it has ''n'' linearly independent eigenvectors.

== Transition Matrix ==

If an ''n &amp;times; n'' square matrix has ''n'' distinct eigenvalues &amp;lambda;, and therefore ''n'' distinct eigenvectors ''v'', we can create a transition matrix ''T'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;T = [v_1 v_2 ... v_n]&lt;/math&gt;

And transforming matrix X gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;T^{-1}AT = \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
                                 0 &amp; \lambda_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
                                 \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
                                 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; \lambda_n\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, if the matrix has ''n'' distinct eigenvalues, the matrix is diagonalizable, and the diagonal entries of the diagonal matrix are the corresponding eigenvalues of the matrix.

== Complex Eigenvalues ==

Consider the situation where a matrix ''A'' has 1 or more complex conjugate eigenvalue pairs. The eigenvectors of ''A'' will also be complex. The resulting diagonal matrix ''D'' will have the complex eigenvalues as the diagonal entries. In engineering situations, it is often not a good idea to deal with complex matrices, so other matrix transformations can be used to create matrices that are &quot;nearly diagonal&quot;.

== Generalized Eigenvectors ==

If the matrix ''A'' does not have a complete set of eigenvectors, that is, that they have ''d'' eigenvectors and ''n - d'' generalized eigenvectors, then the matrix ''A'' is not diagonalizable. However, the next best thing is acheived, and matrix ''A'' can be transformed into a Jordan Cannonical Matrix. Each set of generalized eigenvectors that are formed from a single eigenvector basis will create a jordan block. All the distinct eigenvectors that do not spawn any generalized eigenvectors will form a diagonal block in the Jordan matrix.

==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
Calcium is a soft gray alkaline metal. We often see it in impure forms and it looks like white powder. In its pure form it smells like oranges. It tastes mostly like chalk, because chalk is mainly made of calcium.

* Owners manual indicates every 6000 km or 12000 km depending upon service conditions.

== Method 1 - Using Ramps ==

# Drive the vehicle on to a set of ramps.  One of the risks with this method is overshooting the ramps.  This happened to me once: the ramps, at 8 inches height skidded under the running boards but did no damage.
# Engage the parking brake. Place blocks behind the rear wheels.
# Place jack stands in a suitable location under the ramped vehicle. This minimizes another risk with ramps, that they can collapse.  Possible locations for jack stands are the jack seam.
# Place drain pan under the vehicle and remove the drain plug with a 14 mm socket.
# Place the draing pan so that it collects the oil draining from the pan as well as covering the area under the filter.
# Remove the filter.  Removing the filter on this vehicle will make quite a mess of the plastic shrouds in the passenger side fender.  You can clean it with rags or try to avoid some of the mess by placing old plastic bags over the filter when removing.  Good luck!
# Check that the filter gasket has been removed before installing a new filter.  Lubricate the new filter before installation
# Install the draing pan plug. Honda will provide a new washer for the draing plug.
# Remove the filler plug.  Add the recommended amount of oil.  This is 4.3 litres () of 5W-20. Secure the filler plug.  Check the oil level with the dipstick.  It should be close to right.
# Start the vehicle, remove it from the ramps, and place it on a level surface.
# Check the oil level and add as required.

{{info|Before reading this chapter, students should know what the ''taylor series'' of a function is, and how to obtain it. This is discussed in [[Calculus]].}}

== Matrix Exponentials ==

If we have a matrix ''A'', we can raise that matrix to a power of ''e'' as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{A}&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that this is not necessarily (not usually) equal to each individual element of ''A'' being raised to a power of ''e''. Using taylor-series expansion of exponentials, we can show that:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{A} = I + A + \frac{1}{2}A^2 + \frac{1}{6}A^3 + ...  = \sum_{k=0}^\infty{1 \over k!}A^k&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, the matrix exponential can be reducted to a sum of powers of the matrix. This follows from both the taylor series expansion of the exponential function, and the cayley-hamilton theorem discussed previously.

However, this infinite sum is expensive to compute, and because the sequence is infinite, there is no good cut-off point where we can stop computing terms and call the answer a &quot;good approximation&quot;. To alleviate this point, we can turn to the [[../Cayley Hamilton Theorem| Cayley-Hamilton Theorem]]. Solving the Theorem for ''A&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', we get:

:&lt;math&gt;A^n = -c_{n-1}A^{n-1} - c_{n-2}A^{n-2} - \cdots - c_1A - c_0I&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying both sides of the equation by ''A'', we get:

:&lt;math&gt;A^{n+1} = -c_{n-1}A^n - c_{n-2}A^{n-1} - \cdots - c_1A^2 - c_0A&lt;/math&gt;

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation, and the result will be ''A&lt;sup&gt;n+1&lt;/sup&gt;'' in terms of the first ''n - 1'' powers of ''A''. In fact, we can repeat that process so that ''A&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'', for any arbitrary high power of m can be expressed as a linear combination of the first ''n - 1'' powers of ''A''. Applying this result to our exponential problem:

:&lt;math&gt;e^A = \alpha_0I + \alpha_1A + \cdots + \alpha_{n-1}A^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Where we can solve for the &amp;alpha; terms, and have a finite polynomial that expresses the exponential.

== Inverse ==

The inverse of a matrix exponential is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;(e^{A})^{-1} = e^{-A}&lt;/math&gt;

== Derivative ==

The derivative of a matrix exponential is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}e^{Ax} = Ae^{Ax} = e^{Ax}A&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the exponential matrix is commutative with the matrix ''A''. This is not the case with other functions, necessarily.

== Sum of Matrices ==

If we have a sum of matrices in the exponent, we cannot separate them:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{(A+B)x} \ne e^{Ax}e^{Bx}&lt;/math&gt;

== Differential Equations ==

If we have a first-degree differential equation of the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;x'(t) = Ax(t) + f(t)&lt;/math&gt;

With initial conditions

:&lt;math&gt;x(t_0) = c&lt;/math&gt;

Then the solution to that equation is given in terms of the matrix exponential:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = e^{A(t - t_0)}c + \int_{t_0}^t e^{A(t - \tau)}f(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

This equation shows up frequently in control engineering.

== Laplace Transform ==

As a matter of some interest, we will show the Laplace Transform of a matrix exponential function:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}[e^{At}] = (sI - A)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

We will not use this result any further in this book, although other books on engineering might make use of it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Indications ==

* Honda recommends that the transmission fluid be changed at 48000km or 96000 km depending upon service conditions.  This change is simply a drain and replace of the nominal 3.3 litres that drains.  Honda does not recommend a flush.  [2002 Owners Manual]

The drain/refill could be repeated after a short drive if one wished to replenish a greater fraction of the total 7.9 litres of fluid in the transmission, torque converter, and transmission cooler.  This might be a good idea, given the reputation of this transmission.

== Method 1 - Per manufacturers recommendation ==

Despite the low profile of this vehicle, since the drain plug is towards the front, it is just possible to do this replacement without jack stands or ramps.

# Place the vehicle on a level surface or slightly declined with the front lower than the back.  The drain plug is towards the front of the transmission and any incline that raises the front of the vehicle will result in incomplete fluid drainage.
***Loosen the fill bolt before draining the tranny or you might be forced to fill it through the small tube which is a PITA***
# Place a drain pan under the vehicle and remove the transmission plug with a 3/8&quot; ratchet end (square end).  The fluid ejects rather quickly toward the drivers side, so be ready.
# Clean the debris from the drain plug. Replace the drain plug gasket.  Available from Honda.  Reinstall the drain plug.
# discard of the old fluid, ideally in an old graduated container.  Note the amount removed.
# Add 3 litres or the amount removed, whichever is the lesser. Honda recommends their own ATF-Z1.  I used a small diameter (&gt;8.5mm) plastic kitchen funnel to get the fluid into the dipstick tube.  This works fine. Alternatively, there is a 17mm  bolt on top of the transmission marked ATF - behind the dipstick towards the firewall - that is the transmission fill port.
#  With the vehicle on a level surface, check the fluid level with a dipstick.  If it's close, but a little low, that's fine
# Per honda's recommendation, run the vehicle to operating temperature.  Check the fluid level and adjust as required.
# Do not overfill

== printable version? ==
I bet many educators or parents would like to be able to print this out to have a hard copy. Might we make a &quot;print version&quot; page with all of the letters below each other? --[[User:Sanitized|Sanitized]] ([[User talk:Sanitized|talk]]) 17:15, 5 September 2009 (UTC)

::It might also be useful to make a version that prints nicely in black and white since not all schools or home schools can print in color, and some photographs need tweaking to read well in black and white.

== Suggestions ==

It really would be more effective if it could be viewed as a slideshow, one image and text-sentence per slide.  Is there any software  on wikipedia that would allow such viewing?

Also: there are many, many more possibilities for slideshows that could be useful for the classroom; for example, sets of rhyming words, lists of consonant-vowel-consonant words, groups of objects for counting practice, abc books with themes (animals, household items)....

== Separation of letters. ==

I am proposing that each letter should be separated into individual pages to allow the reader (child) to receive the information slowly without consecutively attaining the knowledge. The current layout also poses a problem if it were to be published in paper form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''The Battle of Khe Sanh'''==
The Khe Sanh base was estblished in 1964 as a small Special Forces camp near the border between North and South Vietnam. It was tucked away in a remote corner about eight miles from the border of Laos and near Route 9, the major road in that region. The reason the base was located here was to protect the area from North Vietnamese coming from Laos or North Vietnam to attack. This was a strategic location; Khe Sanh was the &quot;gateway&quot; into South Vietnam. Khe Sanh could also serve as an air base for operations into Laos, a supply base for overland units, and a wall against enemy infiltration, which it would soon become.

In mid-1966, a battalion of Marines was dispatched to the base to provide the Special Forces team reinforcement after numerous short battles with the North Vietnamese. The Marines stayed at Khe Sanh and continued to fight the North Vietnamese until 13 December 1967. On this date, they were ordered to relocate their combat base to a safer location. The new Khe Sanh Combat Base was located approximately two miles south of the old base, which had been just outside the town of Khe Sanh. Three weeks later, on 2 January 1968, six high ranking North Vietnamese officers were gunned down at the base perimeter of the new base. The reason that the north Vietnamese Army sent out six of their high ranking officers was to show that Khe Sanh was a priority target in their plan to enter South Vietnam. The actions of the North Vietnamese were quickly passed to the head of the operation and the American position was fortified.

To fortify Khe Sanh, the Marines dug trenches, some of which were over six feet deep; the perimeter was reinforced with land mines, barbed wire, German razor tape, and trip flares. The same reinforcement was done around the tactically crucial hills. Several hills were located around the base and became sub-bases with artillery and Marines stationed on each. This gave the Americans a strategic advantage in the area.

On 20 January 1968, a company of marines was investigating the site of a previous ambush when North Vietnamese soldiers attacked them. At first, this was a devastating loss by the Americans until shells from 155mm howitzers pulverized enemy positions. That same day, the Americans captured a North Vietnamese soldier near the airstrip. This soldier informed them that at midnight that night the North Vietnamese would storm the base. Trusting this information as truth, the American troops prepared for the surprise attack. That night at midnight, the North Vietnamese Army launched their attack on Khe Sanh, but was repelled by the Americans in the base. Extensive damage was sustained though, with the airstrip damaged, the munitions dump destroyed, the communications center down, and the control base bombed. A reason that the traitorous North Vietnamese soldier gave the information that freely could have been because he was a conscripted soldier who wanted the war to end. Many soldiers in the North Vietnamese Army had been drafted to make such a large army possible.

Following the surprise attack on Khe Sanh on 20 January 1968, reinforcements were sent to join the troops already stationed there. This brought the total number of defenders to 6000 against the estimated 40,000 North Vietnamese soldiers attacking the base. Since the airstrip had been damaged during the surprise attack and Route 9 was cut off by the enemy, supplies could not be sent to Khe Sanh easily which is the reason that more soldiers were not sent as reinforcements.

At this time, another question arose for those in Washington; should the base be held or evacuated? President Lyndon Johnson and his military advisor, General Maxwell Taylor, both suggested that a withdrawal should be considered. The advantages of a withdrawal would have been numerous, including saving lives, diverting the enemy, and avoiding the problems caused by the base's isolated location. The enemy struck the rest of South Vietnam before Johnson could decide, however, and the decision was made to hold the base at all costs. The reason for this decision was that the government had built up the Khe Sanh situation in the eyes of the public and it would have been difficult to explain that the battle of Khe Sanh was unimportant. For this reason, the battle continued at Khe Sanh for many more months.

Several quick, insignificant skirmishes took place over the next few weeks, but nothing serious occurred until the attack on Lang Vei, a Special Forces camp about four miles southwest of Khe Sanh. During the night of 7 February 1968, eleven tanks passed through the wire around Lang Vei's perimeter and bombarded the entire base. By morning, Lang Vei had been completely destroyed. The soldiers that had not escaped had been killed during the attack. The attack on Lang Vei was only a diversionary battle involving 400 North Vietnamese soldiers to lure soldiers away from Khe Sanh before a major battle there.

The major assault on Khe Sanh never occurred, though. By early April, all North Vietnamese soldiers had left the area unexpectedly. Perhaps North Vietnamese commanders believed that Khe Sanh was not worth the losses sustained by the North Vietnamese Army. Over 120,000 tons of bombs had been dropped on North Vietnamese positions during the battle for Khe Sanh. The loss for the North Vietnamese had been both physical and psychological. The Americans defending Khe Sanh withdrew shortly after the North Vietnamese withdrawal, to be replaced by fresh battalions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Indications == 

* One indicator for repair or replacement of the rotors on this vehicle may be wobble or vibration  that is felt in the steering wheel or the vehicle when the brakes are being used.  A warpage in the rotors will cause the vibration.

Method 1 - Using Jack Stands

# Place the vehicle on a level surface and engage the parking brake.
# Loosen the lug nuts on the front wheels.
# Place a floor jack with a piece of wood under the seam (below the running boards).  The seam on this vehicle is shrouded with the plastic running board cover.  However, by using a block of wood, the vehicle can be lifted without any damage to the plastic.  
# Lift one wheel of the vehicle until it is off the ground.  Place a jack stand at the  reinforced jack stand point adjacent to this wheel.  Repeat for all wheels.
# I choose to jack stand all 4 wheels since the front wheels will need to be removed for this repair and I didn't want any risk of the vehicle rolling.
# Place extra jack stands under the control arms just in case, but not let them bear any significant weight.
# Remove front wheels.
# Using 19 mm socket, remove the bolts that secure the front caliper. 
# Slid the front caliper off the rotor and suspend it, providing strain relief to the brake hose.  This can be done by wiring it to the mcpherson strut.
# The rotors on this vehicle are secured with #3 philips machine screws and they can be tight ones to remove.
# Remove rotors.  It may be necessary to employ a dead blow or rubber mallet to disengage the rotors.
# Have a reputable shop machine the rotors to remove any warp.  If the warp cannot be removed while still maintaining the minimum rotor thickness, the rotors will need to be replaced.
# Reinstall the rotors.
# Install the caliper and torque (spec?) the caliper bolts.
# Install the wheels.
# Remove the front jack stands and drop the front wheel with a floor jack until it bears enough weigh to allow the lug nuts to be tightened.
# Tighten lug nuts.
# Repeat on the other front wheel.
# remove jack stands from rear of vehicle.

[[Image:Aluminum.gif|thumb|Aluminum's symbol on the Periodic Table]]
Aluminum, also known as ''aluminium'', is a metal that is known for its resistance to corrosion and its light weight. Aluminum is used in many industries to manufacture a large variety of products and is very important to the world economy. 
{{clear}}

==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
[[Image:Aluminum Metal coinless.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A piece of aluminum metal.]]

Aluminum is a soft, lightweight metal which usually has a dull silvery appearance.  This dull appearance is caused by a thin layer of oxidation that forms quickly when the metal is exposed to air.  Without this layer of oxidation, aluminum has a bright and clear silvery appearance.

==How was it discovered?==
Friedrich Wöhler is credited with isolating aluminum in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminum chloride with potassium.  The metal, however, had indeed been produced for the first time two years earlier — but in an impure form — by the Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian Ørsted.  Therefore, Ørsted can also be listed as the discoverer of the metal.

==Where did its name come from?==
In 1807, Sir Humphrey Davy was trying to isolate aluminum from a mineral called ''alumina''. He first called the metal ''alumium'', but decided to call it ''aluminum'' in 1812.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* Recycling aluminum requires one twentieth as much energy as producing aluminum from raw ore.
* Aluminum is the most common metal in the earth's crust.
* Aluminum and Aluminium are two different names for this metal.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, and the third most abundant element overall, after oxygen and silicon.  But it is not found free in nature.  The Bayer process is used to refine aluminum from bauxite (aluminum oxide,) an aluminum ore.

==What are its uses?==
[[Image:Air.france.b747.2003.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|300px|147,000 pounds of aluminum are used in building a single Boeing 747 airplane.]]Aluminum has many uses.  It is light and strong.  Aluminum helps us get from place to place since it's a part of cars, trucks, airplanes, bicycles, rockets, and more. 

Every morning you wake up and look in a mirror, the reflective backing is likely made from aluminum. The pots and pans your family uses to cook dinner may be made with aluminum. The utensils you eat your dinner with could be made with aluminum, along with the kitchen aluminum foil used to wrap up leftover food. Soda cans are also made from aluminum.

When aluminum is combined with Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the right quantity thermite can be made. Thermite burns very quickly and with extreme heat. Aluminum is one of the primary components of the fuel that propels [[Wikijunior:How_Things_Work/Rocket|rockets]] into space.

==Is it dangerous?==
Aluminum isn't dangerous.  The metal is protected by a surface layer of aluminum oxide.  This surface layer forms at once when the metal is exposed to air, and is very stable.  So dishes, pots, and pans can be made of aluminum, and aluminum foil can be used for packing sensitive foods.  However, acidic foods, such as tomatoes, can dissolve the surface oxide layer and some of the aluminum underneath.  This isn't dangerous and doesn't compromise the strength of the aluminum object, but can lead to off tastes in the food, which is why it is usually not recommended to cook acidic foods in aluminum cookware.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About the Book==

Meteorology embraces the study of the physics, chemistry, and dynamics of the atmosphere of the earth, including the related effects at the air–earth boundary over both land and the oceans.  Fundamental topics include the composition, structure, and motion of the atmosphere.  Meteorologists aim to understand completely and predict accurately atmospheric phenomena.  Weather describes the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place with respect to such variables as temperature, moisture, wind velocity, and barometric pressure.  Determining future weather involves more than simply looking at some pictures.  

Understanding meteorology requires understanding the atmosphere, some physics, and a lot of charts.  Although this book may attempt to explain some mathematical concepts, many chapters simply require a preexisting considerable understanding of differential and integral calculus.  Linear algebra, differential equations, and vector calculus also will aid the student greatly.  Students also should possess some familiarity with physics, chemistry, computer information science (programming), statistics, and communication.

== Tutorial Authors Wanted on Official Blender MediaWiki! ==

The main Blender documentation and tutorial authors are now working on the [http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Main_Page Official Blender MediaWiki]. If you're considering helping write Blender tutorials or documentation, please consider helping us at the official wiki instead.--[[User:Popski|Popski]] 17:46, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
:That's just silly, whichever set of documents is best is what everyone should be working on, link to each other instead of repeating efforts. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 14:14, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

Please, abandon this stupid nonsense, telling which keys to press, where a menu or other GUI element exists. Why do they exist? Because visual memory is quite rather effective than textual memory &amp;hellip;

The GUI will tell, which key to press, once the user is interested in. Sometimes it is hard to find the according GUI-Elements. Plus, you can omit those ridiculous &quot;Gnome-Users would press XXKEY, instead. Mac-Users would press YYKEY instead.&quot; For Mac-Users, CMD+LMB is '''identical''' to RMB.

Memorize: You're not a Pro, because you are the most hardly working vocabulary learner. You're a Pro, because you master more than one application. And as a Pro you would always adopt the keycodes exactly the way, you individually work most efficient. Blender is no commercial software. So, there is no need to compete about the knowledge of certain keycodes. --[[User:Bgks|Bgks]] 10:11, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

:I think the idea of merging has merit but I believed the original intent of the Docs and Noob to Pro to be different. The official docs are &quot;official&quot; whereas Noob to Pro is a collection of individual ideas originally planned to take a user through Blender via a series of specific hands-on tutorials. 

:What I'd really like to see is for someone to take down the '''OLD''' html docs (version 2.3x) as these often cause more trouble than they are worth as noobs spend hours looking for the subsurf button and wondering why they can't add an armature the way the docs describe. &quot;''Where has subsurf gone?''&quot; is without doubt the most asked question on the forums and 70-90% of the time it is asked because people are following an old doc tutorial --[[User:AndyD|AndyD]] 18:13, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

==Snapshot of the wikibook ?==

I just wonder if we can made a snapshot of this wikibooks into PDF ? This should be possible and it would be better to learn with a printable version. I've started one, in order to see if it's easy to do, but i am afraid it's not (because of the perpetual evolution of the wb).



== Printable versions ==
A printable version of this book - Such as a PDF or one really big HTML file; HTML file preferred - would be superb.  It wouldn't be continuously evolving, but it'd be something I can save to a CD-RW and take home with me.
~ Eric Melech
:The html version works fine as far as i can tell, and if it's been done right then it's generated when you ask for it, so it's always up-to-date with the latest changes. I have just made a pdf version and invited people to email me if they want it. If someone knows how to edit the front page appropriately we can upload the pdf for people to get directly. It's 3.1MB. Openoffice crashed every time I tried to paste from the HTML printable version into the Writer componant, so I downloaded it as webpage complete, edited it slightly in nvu to get rid of extra junk, and then printed it to a file as a Post Script (PS) file. On the command line (in Ubuntu Linux 6.06) I was then able to convert it from PS to PDF using ps2pdf13. The next problem is how to preserve the internal links, PDF can handle internal links but how to keep it in the conversion? --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 14:22, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
::I've just discovered that the print page doesn't actually have all the pages appearing on it. They are correctly listed, just not displayed - so this must be some internal resource-saving setting on the wikibook servers. We'll have to look at the best way to split the wikibook up into two or more sections. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 17:01, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

==The order of chapters==
Shouldn't Modeling/Rendering/Texturing/... Basics be taugth before attempting Quickie Model/Render/Texture/..? The current order of pages jumps right into the quickie-part. --[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] 16:29, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:actually i intended the basics pages to be more in depth than the quickies.  the quickies are just to help noobs get a quick &amp; dirty first model down.  in the Modeling Basics tutorial I would like to teach the user extrusion, subdivide, and a lot of hotkeys.  to teach them this, I would actually like to have them build a simple model of something... maybe a simple person using mostly the extrusion tool.  then i will rename the page to modeling a simple human or something like that.

:thanx for the input and for putting up pics. --[[User:Spiderworm|spiderworm]] 14:54, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::OK... I'll try to follow your work and add some stuff like images when I have time to do that. Btw, please sign these talk-page comments of yours with &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;, that will autocomplete as your name and signature. There's also a hotkey for that over this textbox. Also learn to use : as a way to indent your replies, like I have done here. :) But above all, keep up the good work. Blender is such a great program! --[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] 20:18, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:::Great, thanx for the insight!  I'm kinda new at this whole thing, but I'm sure you've figured that out by now.  I'm trying to get more authors for it but it might just be mostly me... until I can get content and traffic up.  One idea I had was to create a 2nd versions of each tutorial written by a different author, I'll call it the Second Opinion or something like that.  The reason is so that if a reader doesnt understand or like one author's way of explaining something, they can switch to the Second Opinion.  It will be the same tutorial, they will need to follow the same steps, but it will be explained differently, probably with more detail.  This will also help out when the user didn't learn something they were supposed to learn from previous tutorials.  It's not something that will be done immediately, because hey, there's no First Opinions yet, but just an idea I had.  Good idea or a waste of time? --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 20:41, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== freedom ==

btw, feel free to change anything, or discuss changing anything with me.  i want to turn noobs into pros, teaching both mechanical and artistic techniques of everything, modeling to texturing to lighting to putting the camera in the right spot.  this has to be a series of building tutorials.  if you or anyone feels that the way the tutorials are being taught or the sequence of the tutorials is out of line with the stated goals of this book, please feel free to discuss it with me.

i need help with tutorial ideas and objectives.  please entries on the main page with your ideas and what will be taught in each tute.  then actually put together the tute if you can.

also needing screenshots.

this is going to be such a great book :D --[[User:Spiderworm|spiderworm]] 16:48, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Game Plan ==

OK, to anyone helping with this book, I've created the first 13 pages or so.  Let's fill those up with content, screenshots, etc, before moving on.  I'd like some feedback on my idea about a &quot;Second Opinion&quot; which I put earlier on this discussion page.  Good idea or no?  If this is a good idea, let's put this on our immediate to-do list as well.  Anyone reading this, if you can recruit some help for this book, that'd be great.  There's already a large number of Blender tutes web-wide, and if we can get permission from authors to include sometimes slightly modified versions of their tutes, that'd be great. --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 15:44, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

: I think the idea of a book of tutorials is a fantastic way to help user's learn blender, and more rewarding that just reading theory, etc. However one thing of note, in my opinion at least, is that the main focus of each tutorial should be on the tool/procedure than the end result. Providing more detail about why you're doing each step, and explaining the how and why of the command (such as the extrude tool), than simply providing the steps to accomplish the end results.  The couple I've looked at thus far have all had the steps, but not much on the &quot;theory&quot;. Lots on the &quot;how&quot;, but not a lot of the &quot;why&quot;. Perhaps this would be better suited to your &quot;second opinion&quot; idea. Or some other possible title for it. In either case I plan to provide some contributions to the book, as I think it definately has potential. --[[User:Camel|camel]] 16:44, May 8, 2005 (UTC)

:: Thanx for your input!  Providing the why of everything, the theory of 3D modeling, is something that is going to be covered and covered very well in the Intermediate tutorials.  Feel free to chip in there!  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 00:40, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

::: an idea for the advanced section is some tutes on the theory of types of 3d models that are needed professionally.  (have a page for animal theory, one for plant theory, one for buildings theory, one for vehicle theory).  if fact you could even break it down to smaller parts (in vehicles have &quot;starships&quot;, &quot;land vehicles&quot;, &quot;water vehicles&quot;, &quot;air vehicles&quot; and one made on the theories on combining any of the above). --[[User:Alaethancar|Matrim]] 21:46, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)

:::: Matrim, I absolutely agree.  I've tried to start that up in the Intermediate Tutorials section, but no tutorials have popped up yet.  The problem is, I don't consider myself a good modeler at this point, so I'm not writing any tutorials for that section until I believe that I have something good to offer.  I hope some of those that are really Blender pros will help out here soon.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 15:00, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::::I'll try to spread the word at some of the forums i go to.  not very many tho. Basically just blender battles and blenderwars.--[[User:Alaethancar|Matrim]] 19:09, Jun 7, 2005 (UTC)

::::::Well guys, i noticed this book a while ago whilst trawling the Elysiun forums, back then i didnt really take the the time to have a good look at it. I had a proper look yeterday and i think it is great. I have a few tutorials that i wrote for the Blenderman magazine which is dead now i think (RIP). I plan on contributing a lot to this book, as i think it has a lot of potential. I won't have much time to do anything this week, but next week i will crack on and try to understand how this Wiki structure works and hopefully get some good stuff contributed. If anyone i interested in modifying my tutorials to put them on here, before i get a chance, then they are welcome, just let me know and i will e-mail them to you. One last thing, i would love it if we could get some good in-depth information on the new features since about 2.35 becasue documentation seems to be lacking for them. Once ive sorted out my old tutorials then i think i may very well concentrate on this. leinad13_at_hotmail_._com --[[User:Leinad13|Leinad13]]

== Logo Usage ==

I have removed the 'Blender icon' (Blender.png) image from this page. It is not the Blender icon or logo, and looks like it has been made by a third party. Unfortunately there's no logo pages on the blender website (there will be with the new site), but there's a brief history of the logo here, with some 'unofficial' usage guidelines: http://www.mopi.nl/blogo/

== Artistic side of things getting lost? ==

The mechanics of Blender tutorials seem to be coming along nicely.  I feel that this is a good time to ask what happened to the artistic component?  Even if you knew Blender backwards, you would have trouble creating an appealing image if you knew nothing about art... there's a reason Blender users are called &quot;artists&quot; :)  

The artistic side of things is touched on in the lighting section, but I feel that such an important subject is getting lost.     --[[User:Jonon|Jonon]] 15:40, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Jonan, I absolutely agree.  I really want to talk about the artistic side of the Blender, but I don't have good artistic skills with the Blender as of right now myself and am trying to get those with artistic skills from the community to pitch in.  I believe Popski has some artistic skills (from what I've seen of his stuff so far), maybe he could help out more with this.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 17:50, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Sounds like a good idea in theory, but I strongly advise against it.  Humankind has been trying to define &quot;art&quot; for millenia.  It is an instinctual thing; art cannot be taught with words, and even attempting would diminish its significance and its enigma.  You either are an artist - being born with a creative mind deeply imbedded into the id - or not an artist and therefore should stay far from Blender, Photoshop, and their kin.  It would save everyone a lot of frustration and arguments if we left such subjects for the philosophical geniuses to pick apart :)  ~ Eric Melech

:Eric, I must respectfully disagree. &quot;Art&quot; may not be definable in theory, but is is definable by example. &quot;I cannot define it, but I know it when I see it.&quot; Go to elysium.com and look at the forums. Blender artists are true artists, working in a novel medium. The most renowned artists of the past (Da Vinci and Reubens come to mind) were also technological innovators in new media. So: even if we cannot ask artists to produce a &quot;how to create art for the N00b,&quot; we can still ask artists to provide guidance on the techniques used to produce specific work that the community considers to be &quot;artistic.&quot; Another way to look at this: not all competent technicians are great artists, but as a general rule great artists are competent technicians. Nacent artists can benefit by the technical insights of great artists.
:A second point: Blender is useful to technicians even if they do not have the &quot;artistic soul&quot; you allude to. but even these benighted souls (such as myself) may benefit from the techniques used by &quot;real&quot; artists as we persue our more mundane technical craft. If I want to use blender to display my commercial procduct (a vacuum cleaner, say) against a really nice surreal background, the insights of a great artistic creator of surreal backgrounds are of great interest even if I am merely a marketing hack. [[User:arch_dude|arch_dude]] 25 June 2006

:Jonan and Spiderworm. I have to agree that such a topic should be covered in depth. But it's another book, not this one. Perhaps you could start a book about 3D Digital Art. It doesn't belong in a book about Blender except where is needed in order to explain why or how to do something a certain way. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 14:26, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

::DuLithgow,

::The original design of this book was to teach artistic skills and techniques along with the dull how-tos.  There were originally three major divisions: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.  The beginner section was to teach every tool in Blender, which means, of course, that the beginner section was originally intended to be HUGE.  The second section, the intermediate tutorials, was intended to teach artistic use of these tools.  The advanced tutorials were going to teach primarily Python in Blender.  I thought I would bring that up so that you would understand my comment in context.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 02:53, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

== Intermediate animation ==
Added a couple of topics under Intermediate animation.. if you're not happy with them or their descriptions, feel free to modify them. --[[User:Jonon|Jonon]] 08:06, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

==Thanks to the editors==
I really want to thank the editors of this tutorial for this amazing job they're doing. I'm a contributer to the Dutch Wikipedia and Wikibooks and while editing interwiki's here, I came to reverting some vandalist actions on this tutorial. That's how I came to this tutorial. I've had never heard about Blender before, but it surprises me what you can do with the program.&lt;br /&gt;
I already liked it to write, but now, I can also use work from others to learn something!&lt;br /&gt;
Editors of this tutorial, I'm really glad with this tutorial, thank you! [[User:Firefox|Firefox]] 21:41, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Links ==

Perhaps it would be a good idea to add further links to each lesson.
I think someone who started as a &quot;Noob&quot; would like to stay at one lesson for a while and practice what he has learned. So it would be good for him to know where to find further examples.

==Random observations==
I've been watching this project for quite some time, so allow me to make a couple criticisms.

*Some of these tutorials contain waaay too much text, for example [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Putting Hat on Person]].

*&quot;Simple Person&quot; shouldn't be the first tutorial. It should be &quot;screwdriver&quot; or something. Therefore, the &quot;person&quot; model could be more detailed, and at a more advanced level.

*Also, it might make sense to distribute the .blend files, so editors can make major changes. For instance, incorporating the face and edge select modes. For now, they could be hosted at http://blendermodels.katorlegaz.com
&amp;mdash;[[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 23:19, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

* Also the Blender model of simple person detailing doesn't connect

== Advanced Animation ==

Hi everyone.
I added the Advanced Animation topic as placeholder. I will fill this as time pass by. 
Deadline is for mid november, so don't worry these sections will not remain empty.
This is in fact a re-transcription of the presentation I did at the Montreal Blender conference.
Most of the .Blend are ready and a rough text is already done.
--[[User:Gabio|Gabio]] 03:22, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

==Die Another Way==
It appears that someone recently added a page called &quot;Die Another Way&quot;. This page is listed in the contents but is not part of the &quot;Previous Page/Next Page&quot; chain found on each page. Maybe it should be added to the chain? The page also doesn't appear to follow conventions of other pages (for example, keynames such as '''WKEY''') and needs to be revised a little. I'm also not sure where it belongs (beginning, intermediate, etc). [[User:68.126.1.251|68.126.1.251]] 20:29, 30 October 2005 (UTC)



== Making the dice - Error??? ==

I think I spottet an Error in this tutorial but 'cause im a Noob to Blender I first want to post ist here instead of changing the tutorial at once.

Step 8 says: Make sure these are the right ones by rotating your view with the middle mouse button. Now press x and select 'vertices'. This should leave only the top side of the die:

Don't I have to go to Select-&gt;Inverse (in the Menu on the bottom of the 3D Vieport) 'cause if I select all the Vertices of the top side of the dice an press x and select vertices so they are all gone and I have a Cube with one side open.

So far so good.

== reviewed on website ==

I saw this and thought you might want to know about it: http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/01/30/2029223 its basicly a review of the book. It says some good things about it, and some bad things, but I thought it was a bit negative. [[User:Bawolff|Bawolff]] 00:00, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

== Conversion into another format..? ==

Hi, I'm not sure if i have the right place here, so we will see what drops, and take it from there..

I'm using moodle, the open source elearning software, and am embarking on a project to put decent training &quot;manuals&quot; like this one into a moodle system, along with assignments relating to each stage. For an online training course project allowing users to easily find and particiape in training courses, 

I would like to take this course, and put it into moodle, and amek this course available to people via the elarning system...

Can i do that?
there is no charging for the courses..

== About the Review ==

Hi Im working in the translation of this book to spanish (my english is not good so you will understand).
About that article and the &quot;bad things&quot; that u say i think is not that bad. I mean, the changing type of this book is not a bad thing, acctualy i think is one of the most interensting things of this system. These are the first objects of comon construction in a non-logical language. Of corse its not nice find an uncomplete ejercise but is part of the experimet. Im not sure that this book would be any better by editing it by a sngle person. I understand that the original autor of this book feel misunderstood when he find new improvments but, hey! Thats the problem at every level. We born in a individual world where personal growing is much more important than the colective stuff. What ever this is the way i see this book.

== Screenshot on Index ==

Why is there a screenshot of Blender 2.36 on the index page? Why not upkeep a sreenshot of the latest version?

'''good idea'''

Why dont you load it. I dont think there would be any problem for any one. ([[User:Reptiles extintos|Reptiles extintos]] 17:04, 10 April 2006 (UTC))

:I can sort of see why this was book of the month for July. As long as all instructions are followed, the tutorial seems quite easy to understand and comprehensive. I've yet to find fault with the article {but I will be keeping an eye out ;) }. [[User:Dessydes|Dessydes]] 20:57, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== Missing advanced tutorials / joystick game ==

Seems that 84.176.249.244 is a bit of a joker - all of the links to the advanced tutorials were deleted and replaced with a link to a nonsense page about a &quot;joystick game&quot;. I've put it back to how it was before, hopefully

== Where did the modular version go? ==

Sorry for a n00b question, but I've just got to the end of the advanced tutorials and now there's only the massive printable version available.  Where did the rest of it go?
: it seems it got blanked by an IP Address [[User:62.84.228.7|62.84.228.7]] 11:25, 24 May 2006 (UTC)
I see it's back.  Cheers for the response.

== Links to wrong section. ==

I recently added a tutorial on Lip-Sync using shape keys. I also noticed the shape key page was empty (as linked from the contents page) so I threw something in there too. However, when I set up the next/previous navigation and tested it out, I discovered a different Shape Key page did already exist.

What seems to have happened is the links on the noob-pro content page link to the tutorial section while the links from the vertex groups &amp; constraints pages correctly link to the existing noob-pro page. I hadn't noticed this when I added the lip-sync page (which you might decide to move anyway?).

I'm happy for the link in the table of contents to be changed to link to the noob-pro shape key page if desired (my shape key page can disappear if it's not needed). I guess my Lip-Sync page should be added to the table of contents in the tutorials section??? 

I was going so well too! :(  [[User:AndyD|AndyD]] 11:43, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

: I went ahead and changed the link on the contents page to point to the existing noob to pro Shape Key page (it doesn't look finished though) and I added my Shape Key walk-through to the end of that page. --[[User:AndyD|AndyD]] 11:43, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

== Images and Copyright ==

When an image is uploaded it recommends choosing a license type. I churned through a few of the existing (old) pages to see what others had used for Blender screenshots and they're all different. The wiki help pages are no help to those not trained in corporate law. Maybe a link should be added to the contents page showing contributors the correct license to use for Blender screenshots with suggestions for the most common license types likely to apply for Blender tutorials. --[[User:AndyD|AndyD]] 11:43, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
: I've been advised that '''Blender screenshots''' should use the '''GPL license graphic''' and it's been requested that existing images be changed to this license type. I'll change them as I find them but it would help if others did the same. Currently, many screenshot images have different licenses while some have none at all. Just click on an image, enter edit mode on its info page and put/replace {{tl|GPL}} for the license.--[[User:AndyD|AndyD]] 05:18, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

----

I read http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing#Screenshots and I think that the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{free screenshot|license = [[w:GNU General Public License|GPL]]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; should be added for every screenshot, in addtion to the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{GPL}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

We shoud add a &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Blender images]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for every screenshot too (and for blender render). Is it possible to create a unique template for blender screenshots that adds all this information?

--[[User:Argento|Argento]] 22:04, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

== next step tutorials ==

The tutorials here only get someone so far, none of them go into the next step of giving an image/animation/whatever and telling the reader that it can be modeled using these tools, but the steps are not provided on purpose. This makes the reader solve real world problems and become a step closer to being a good 3d artist. --[[User:V2os|V2os]] 01:40, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

== Urgent hosting needed for pdf version ==

I've been hosting the pdf version for download, but it's proven far too popular for my hosting plan to cope with. It's only the 9th of the month and I'm at 80% of my quota. It's had 5988 requests and 7550838 Kbs of traffic (97.01% of my traffic).

I don't think the wikimedia foundation should host this file, their servers are overstreached already. So please contact me if you can host it, otherwise I'll have to temporarily pull the plug on it. --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 21:46, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

:Hi DuLithgow, I'm glad to see my baby (this book) is growing up and becoming popular.  Sorry about the effect that the PDF's having on your server :(

:Two things... I do have some web space at tellim.com .... I'll look into how much traffic I am allowed, but I need to know the file size.  How big is this thing?  Also, what script are you using to generate the PDF of the book?  Please point me to a website if there is one.

:One thought, have you tried making a torrent of this?

:Thanks a ton, and we'll try to relieve you of your burden a bit here! --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 02:41, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

::Why not use, for example, a coralcache link? Then the actual host's bandwidth use will be minimised.

== Move to Wikiversity? ==

Should this be moved to [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Blender Wikiversity]? [[User:67.181.61.13|67.181.61.13]] 06:22, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

== external resources ==

I would like to do a big edit to the initial page, but I think it's better to discuss it before I do such big change. I would like to add an &quot;external resources&quot; part of the book between &quot;Miscellaneous Tutorials&quot; and the &quot;Appendix&quot;. I would move the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Blueprint Links List]] page to external resources, together with Blueprints Materials Models Photos Textures of [[Blender_3D:_Tutorial_Links_List]] as separated pages.

This is the final structure for my '''external resources section''' proposal
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/External Resources/Tutorials Links]] from [[Blender_3D:_Tutorial_Links_List]]
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/External Resources/Blueprint Links]] (merge of [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Blueprint Links List]] and [[Blender_3D:_Tutorial_Links_List]] blueprints section)
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/External Resources/Materials Links]] from [[Blender_3D:_Tutorial_Links_List]]
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/External Resources/Models Links]] from [[Blender_3D:_Tutorial_Links_List]]
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/External Resources/Photos Links]] from [[Blender_3D:_Tutorial_Links_List]]
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/External Resources/Textures Links]] from [[Blender_3D:_Tutorial_Links_List]]
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/External Resources/Procedural Modelling Links]] new section (all the programs that generates models from parameters (humans, trees, textures...)

Note that the page [[Blender_3D:_Tutorial_Links_List]] is linked two times in the main page, one in the 
&quot;Miscellaneous Tutorials&quot; section and another in the &quot;Appendix&quot; section. I would remove both and leave only one in &quot;external resources section&quot;.
--[[User:Argento|Argento]] 16:27, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

Sorry I forgot my motivation, the page [[Blender_3D:_Tutorial_Links_List]] title only says tutorials, I'm not expected to find blueprints here when I click it, so I created lot of time ago the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Blueprint Links List]] page, I didn't know that blueprints were in the tutorials page, an &quot;external resources&quot; section is more appropriate in my opinion
--[[User:Argento|Argento]] 16:27, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

We can also rename the page [[Blender_3D:_Tutorial_Links_List]] to [[Blender_3D:External Resoruces]] and keep all in a single page.--[[User:Argento|Argento]] 16:30, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

I just noticed that there is a section similiar to the proposed [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/External Resources/Procedural Modelling Links]] in [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Advanced_Tutorials/Python_Scripting/Procedural_object_creation]]--[[User:Argento|Argento]] 21:23, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Unfortunately, the dates of the actual full moon in 1993/1994 do not seem to completely tally with the story. The full moon falls on October 30 and November 29 of 1993; internal evidence (Lupin looking healthy on October 31, Quidditch against Hufflepuff one to two weeks later, Lupin sick just before and possibly during the Quidditch match) would indicate the need for a full moon sometime around the second week in November. While there is a full moon on May 25 and June 23 1994, the episode in The Shrieking Shack falls immediately after Exams, which would place it most likely early in the second week of June. As the events in the story could, in both cases, be either one or two weeks off the dates of the full moon, we may simply assume that J. K. Rowling consulted a lunar phases chart for a different year than the one where story actually occurred... except that Lupin is apparently sick on Christmas, and there was a full moon on 28 December 1993.

I include this information because it nags at me; however, I don't believe that it belongs in the book proper. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 07:18, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Madam Rosmerta''''' is &quot;a curvy sort of woman with a pretty face&quot;, the owner of ''The Three Broomsticks'' pub in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Madam Rosmerta is first mentioned by name when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] escapes from Hogwarts to join [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. Here, she acts as a foil: the adults who are in the know are filling her in on why there are Dementors running around the village and ruining her business, and Harry is listening in. This allows Harry to receive the understood back-story about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Perhaps curiously, we do not see Madam Rosmerta in the Three Broomsticks when Harry is there being interviewed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]. As Harry is then banned from all further Hogsmeade weekends by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]], we do not see Madam Rosmerta in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Rosmerta greets Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] when they secretly left [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts|Hogwarts]] to find [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. On their return, she warns them of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Morsmordre|Dark Mark]] above Hogwarts, and loans them brooms to speed their return to the school.  At the school, Harry is present, though [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|immobilized]] and concealed by his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], as Dumbledore engages [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] in conversation to attempt to win his allegiance. In the course of conversation, Dumbledore wonders how Draco knew when they left the castle, and then realizes that Rosmerta, under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]], had told him. This revelation also explains how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] came to be carrying the cursed necklace back to school after a Hogsmeade visit; Rosmerta, acting under Malfoy's curse, had met Katie in the toilets, placed her under the Imperius curse, and given her the necklace to deliver to Dumbledore.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Ron seems to have a bit of a crush on Madam Rosmerta; perhaps he just likes her shape. He is well aware that she is literally old enough to be his mother; in fact, Madam Rosmerta was tending bar at the Three Broomsticks when Harry's father was at Hogwarts.

== Analysis ==

One of the things that goes past without significant mention is that Rosmerta is quite literally old enough to be Ron's mother, and he would realize that if he ever thought about it. Rosmerta mentions that she had known [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|Harry's father]] and the other [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marauders|Marauders]], in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''. It is unlikely she would remember them so well if she was significantly younger than them, so we can assume that she is roughly of an age, at least, as Harry's parents, or older if, as is suggested in the discussion with Fudge in the Three Broomsticks just before Christmas, she served them in the pub. Ron still seems to be angling for a glimpse of her in subsequent books, despite the conversation having happened in his hearing, and while he was paying attention to it.

Francois BIENTZ (francois.bientz@voila.fr)

Document based on the How-to :Setup WebObjects on Linux (Stefan Apelt) :
http://www.tetlabors.de/wo/setup_webobjects_on_linux.html.
Other platforms http://www.tetlabors.de/wo/

Thanks to 
Stefan Apelt, Ari Maniatis and Piotr Intres (Gentoo install)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

What you need :
*FreeBSD 6.1 X86 box
*a Mac and OSX 10.4.7 XCode 2.4, WebObjects dev installed.
*or a Mac and OSX 10.4.7 server WebObjects 5.3.1 deploy installed.  



==Install Java and Apache==
You can can build and install the native Java 
- using the ports system (see http://www.freebsd.org/java)
- or download the diablo Java 1.5 package from the FreeBSD foundation:http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/downloads/java.shtml
file: diablo-jdk-freebsd6.i386.1.5.0.07.00.tbz. 

Install Apache : I used the apache+ssl-1.3.34.1.57 port

==WebObjects 5.3.2 installation from OSX or WebObjects 5.3.1 from OSX server==

On FreeBSD create these directories:
&lt;pre&gt;
/usr/local/apple/Library
/usr/local/apple/Local/Library
&lt;/pre&gt;

Directories/Files to copy from OSX to FreeBSD:

FreeBSD: in /usr/local/apple/Library/Frameworks (OSX : /System/Library/Frameworks)

export OS
&lt;/pre&gt;
log off an log in (with a user login) then su

* [http://wonder.sourceforge.net/WOAdaptor.html Download the binary for FreeBSD 6.1] or
* [http://www.tetlabors.de/wo/setup_webobjects_on_freebsd.html Compile using Wo 5.2 Solaris]

Copy mod_WebObjects.so into /usr/local/libexec/apache.

== Configure Apache for WebObjects ==

Copy the configuration file for WebObjects  to the Apache conf folder: 
 cp webobjects.conf /usr/local/etc/apache/

The webobjects.conf file :
&lt;pre&gt;
# WebObjects : Enable the WebObjects module.


LoadModule WebObjects_module /usr/local/libexec/apache/mod_WebObjects.so
#AddModule mod_WebObjects.c

# Path to the Document Root of your Webserver, 
# it should contain a directory named WebObjects
WebObjectsDocumentRoot /usr/local/www/data

# You can change the 'cgi-bin' part of WebObjectsAlias to whatever you
# prefer (such as Apps), but the 'WebObjects' part is required.
WebObjectsAlias /cgi-bin/WebObjects

# Here are the 3 possible configuration modes.
# The apache module uses one of them to get information
# about your deployed applications.
# 1085 is the reserved port on which wotaskd processes listen to by default.

# Host List Configuration
# wotaskd is started automatically on supported platforms,
# so this is the default mode.
# The apache module gets its configuration from the wotaskds
# listed on the configuration line
# For multiple hosts:
# WebObjectsConfig http://&lt;name-of-a-host&gt;:&lt;port-on-a-host&gt;,http://&lt;name-of-another-host&gt;:&lt;port-on-a-host&gt; &lt;interval&gt;
# For localhost: 
WebObjectsConfig http://localhost:1085 10

# Multicast Configuration
# The apache module gets its configuration from all wotaskds
# that respond to the multicast call on the subnet
# WebObjectsConfig webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085 10

# File Configuration
# The apache module gets its configuration from one file
# WebObjectsConfig file://&lt;path-to-a-xml-config-file&gt; 10


# To enable public access to the WOAdaptorInfo page, uncomment the following line
# WebObjectsAdminUsername public

# To enable the WOAdaptorInfo page with restricted access,
# uncomment the next two lines and set the user and password
# To access the WOAdaptorInfo page with restricted access, 
# use a URL like: http://webserver/cgi-bin/WebObjects/WOAdaptorInfo?user+password.
# WebObjectsAdminUsername user
# WebObjectsAdminPassword password

# To change the logging options, read the following comments:
# The option name is &quot;WebObjectsLog&quot; and the first value indicates the path of the log file.
# The second value indicates the log level. There are five, in decreasing informational order:
# 	&quot;Debug&quot;,    &quot;Info&quot;,    &quot;Warn&quot;,    &quot;Error&quot;,    &quot;User&quot;
#
# Note: To enable logging, touch '/tmp/logWebObjects' as the administrator user (usually root).
#
# The following line is the default:
# WebObjectsLog /tmp/WebObjects.log Debug
&lt;/pre&gt;


Edit /usr/local/etc/apache/httpsd.conf. Search for the line &quot;LoadModule
rewrite_module ...&quot; and insert the following lines right _before_ it:

Include /usr/local/etc/apache/webobjects.conf &lt;br&gt;
&lt;Location /cgi-bin/./&gt; &lt;br&gt;
SetHandler WebObjects &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/Location&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Search for the line  &quot;AddModule mod_rewrite.c&quot; and put the following
line right after that:

AddModule mod_WebObjects.c

Search for a line &quot;ServerName ...&quot; and put your DNS host name in there.
If you do not have one, you can use your IP adress, too. The explanation
within httpd.conf about this is very good.

ServerName yourhost.yourdomain.com

Save and exit. Now, to see if everything is right, try:

 /usr/local/sbin/httpsdctl configtest

If it says &quot;Syntax OK&quot;, you are fine. Else, try to find and correct the
errors it reports.

== Start Apache and WO Services ==

Start Apache:
/usr/local/sbin/httpdsctl start

Start wotaskd :
$NEXT_ROOT/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/wotaskd.woa/wotaskd &amp;


== Start JavaMonitor and test the installation ==

The last step before adding application is starting JavaMonitor and see
if it works:
$NEXT_ROOT/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/JavaMonitor.woa/JavaMonitor
-WOPort 56789

After JavaMonitor is launched, you will see a line similiar to the
following:

Your application's URL is:
http://yourhost.yourdomain.com:56789/cgi-bin/WebObjects/JavaMonitor.woa

Open this URL in a web browser.


== Create startup scripts for wotaskd and javamonitor ==

Install lsof from the ports

Create /usr/local/etc/rc.d/110.wotaskd.sh
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

NEXTROOT=/usr/local/apple

case &quot;$1&quot; in
        start)
                
           export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
           export NEXT_ROOT=${NEXTROOT}
           ${NEXTROOT}/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/wotaskd.woa/wotaskd &amp;
           echo -n ' wotaskd'
                
           ;;
        stop)
           lsof -i tcp:1085 |grep LISTEN | sort -u | awk '{print&quot;kill -9 &quot; $2}' | sh
                ;;
        *)
           echo &quot;&quot;
           echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` { start | stop }&quot;
           echo &quot;&quot;
           exit 64
                ;;
esac
&lt;/pre&gt;
Then
  chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/110.wotaskd.sh
Create /usr/local/etc/rc.d/150.javamonitor.sh
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

NEXTROOT=/usr/local/apple

case &quot;$1&quot; in
        start)
           export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
           export NEXT_ROOT=${NEXTROOT}
           ${NEXTROOT}/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/JavaMonitor.woa/JavaMonitor -WOPort 56789 &amp;
           echo -n 'JavaMonitor'
                        ;;
        stop)
           lsof -i tcp:56789 |grep LISTEN | sort -u |awk '{print&quot;kill -9 &quot;$2}' | sh
            ;;
        *)
           echo &quot;&quot;
           echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` { start | stop }&quot;
           echo &quot;&quot;
           exit 64
            ;;
esac
&lt;/pre&gt;
Then
  chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/150.javamonitor.sh

== JDBC jars location. ==
for mySQL: put the mysql-connector-java-3.0.17-ga-bin.jar in /usr/local/apple/Local/Library/WebObjects/Extensions.

Cultivation, in the form of hoeing, raking, or otherwise &quot;shaking up&quot; the soil, is one of the most effective methods of weed control. While it has been somewhat outmoded in many regions in favor of applied mulches, cultivation achieves many of the same goals.

*Cultivation, when done well, uproots young weeds and badly damages perennial weeds.
*By shaking up the top layer of soil, cultivation effectively creates a mulch.
*Over time, cultivation creates a &quot;stale seed bed&quot;, as the seed bank is exhausted

The major problem is that cultivation does oxygenate the top layer of soil, causing the organic matter to degrade faster.

Coppicing is a pruning technique used for creating informal hedges out of trees and/or shrubs. The plants are cut to the ground at regular intervals, such as once per year, or perhaps once every 5 years. For weed trees, it can be used as a preventative measure against allowing the tree to set seed by cutting whenever the regrowth stems are mature enough to begin producing fruit.

Hello, I got your message about adding more ICT4D books. It looks like you are off to a good start so far with your first book. I am going to try and upload some more books myself today and tomorrow, so we can help each other with this. Please let me know if you need anything. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:00, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

== RE: Image copyright query ==

It was my understanding from talking to the people at APDIP and IOSN that all the primers and all the images in those primers have been released under the '''Creative Commons Attribution 2.5''' License. When you upload an image, you should specify that license, so that it doesnt create a problem. I will try and apply that license to the images that you have uploaded recently. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:31, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

== Image copyrights ==

I just finished marking all the images that you have uploaded with the appropriate copyright tags. In the future, if you put the tag &quot;{{tl|cc-by-2.5}}&quot; on your images when you upload them, they will be properly listed under the terms of that license. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:34, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

== Navigation Template ==

I have added navigation templates to the following books:
*[[Nets, Webs and the Information Infrastructure]]
*[[Information and Communication Technologies for Poverty Alleviation]]
*[[E-government]]
*[[ICT in Education]]
*[[Internet Governance]]
Please let me know if you need anything else. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:57, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

I will add a navigational template to your book when I get home from school tonight. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:10, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

==[[:Category:APDIP Books]] ==

I've added the ICT4D books to this category, and I've also changed it so that only the title pages of the FOSS books appear in the category. This should now be a listing of the title pages of all the APDIP books, arranged alphabetically. It may take some time for the server to process all these changes, but let me know if you need anything else. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:38, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

== RE:Excerpt with book link ==

I dont think there is any automatic way to display an excerpt from a book along with the book link in wikipedia. Also, wikipedia is very strict about the types of content that is allowed to be included. Unfortunately, I dont know enough about that project to help you with your problem. Sorry I cannot be of more help to you this time. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:40, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1 ==

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==An open letter to our inactive admins==

Hello,

You don't know me, because I wasn't all that active on wikibooks a year ago, but I'm the most recently appointed admin, and a wikibookian who doesn't like seeing a lot of bad blood being spilled and sloshed on the books. 

I wasn't originally convinced about the need for adding the inactive rules to the administration policy, but became convinced for several reasons, including:

#Having sysops who aren't present and doing any sysoping poses (in theory) a security risk, should passwords inadvertently be shared or stolen.
#There's been a lot of work on policy over the past few months, and sysops who've been &quot;out of the loop&quot; might not be aware of what's proper (the obvious &quot;elephant in the room&quot; example being that the administration policy was debated for over a month, and not one of the inactive sysops chimed in). 
#We need more sysops, because we have a huge backlog of sysop chores that need to be done, such as the 3,000+ images that have no copyright status tags. By not listing 10 or 20 sysops who aren't really sysoping (some of the users currently nominated for desysopping have ''no log entries whatsoever'', others seem mostly to have used the tools for their own projects and userspaces), we can be a little more clear about the need for new volunteers.
#The granting of sysop tools is not a barnstar, but rather are given to people who want to use tham for the benefit of the community. If someone's not using them, then they don't need them, so it's better to try to recruit new people that will use them. There is no &quot;disgrace&quot; involved in desysoping for inactivity: it's just that you're busy elsewhere, so just as giving them is no big deal, giving them up shouldn't be either. If you come back later as an active contributor and want them again, just do an RfA and get them!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Diagnosing a dishwasher that will not start==
===Check the power===
Check your fuse box for blown fuses or, if you have circuit breakers, check to see if they are tripped. Make sure the dishwasher's plug is secure in the outlet.

===Check the door switch===
If power is not the problem, try the electrical parts of your dishwasher. The most common part to fail is the door switch, used to start and stop your dishwasher.  If the door switch is faulty it may block the dishwasher from starting because it detects the door as always open.  Most dishwasher door switches are about an inch long. There are metal prongs on the body of the switch called terminals, which can corrode due to the wet conditions.

===Check the timer===
If your door switch is OK, check the timer assembly. This controls when and how long power is sent to other components on your dishwasher. If these controls don't receive power, they won't work.  The timer assembly contains a motor which should be checked as well. It is often cheaper just to replace the timer motor rather than the complete assembly.  

===Check the cycle selector switch===
These switches indicate cycles for washing, drying, and setting the temperature of the water. If one of your switches is the problem your dishwasher may not start.
 
By testing each one of these parts with an ohmmeter you should be able to determine why your dishwasher is not working. It is possible for other parts to fail but these are the most common parts to check.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Special Articles ==

Before we go crazy adding special articles, I think we should consider which ones are going to be extremely short and could be combined with other special articles to make a more general article. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 14:11, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

=== [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_New_Model_of_the_Atom A New Model of the Atom] ===

This is an Atomic Model that corresponds more closely to Einstein's view of atomic structure. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_New_Model_of_the_Atom A New Model of the Atom] attempts to make the Atom and Molecular Structure (atomic bonding) more intuitive and comprehendible without the use of Quantum Mechanics, yet maintaining the concept of &quot;Quantum&quot;. Even if this model is ultimately wrong, it is still useful as a concept tool.[[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_New_Model_of_the_Atom]]

[[User:Pcfjr9|Pcfjr9]] ([[User talk:Pcfjr9|talk]])

==Element Symbols==
I have a collection of element symbols (I have already uploaded some) and will finish uploading them in a when I have time. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 20:22, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

==Developing Articles==
I believe that articles should be moved to the developing articles section once some criteria are met:
# There are two or more contributors who contributed to the information of the article. This is a part of Wikimedia, after all, so we should have many contributors.
# All of the sections have something basic written and there are at least three interesting facts. Otherwise it doesn't have enough information.
# There is at least one image other than the periodic table position image and the element's symbol image. Kids like pictures, after all. 

The current example is gold. It is obviously more developed than other stubs, in my opinion, hence the reason to place it in the section for more developed articles. This is merely my opinion, though. Feel free to disagree. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 03:01, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

:That sounds like a good criteria to me. I guess we could take the stub tag off when thay are moved as well. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 05:01, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

:Not to sure about point #1-this may be hard to accomplish. Otherwise #2 and #3 are fine as well.--[[User:Read-write-services|Read-write-services]] 01:12, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::I strongly agree with point #1 at least to the extent of two people reviewing the article, because I just did a cleanup of [[Wikijunior The Elements/Gold|gold]], which most people seemed to consider complete.  There were numerous punctuation and spacing errors, and inconsistent use of italics.  At least one other set of eyeballs should be &quot;tweaking&quot; anything before it is &quot;shipped&quot;. --[[User:Eliyahu|Eliyahu]] 06:00, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

==Element-ary grammar==
Anyone know if element names are proper nouns or not? I'm not sure whether or not they should be capitalized in sentences or not. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 05:18, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
Element names are normally normal nouns, but sometimes they're shown as proper nouns. [[User:Wikisquared|Wikisquared]] 20:36, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
: According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element#Nomenclature element names are not to be capitalized as proper nouns even if the element name is derived from a proper noun. So they should not be capitalized. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 05:12, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

==Will this incorporate the 4 states of matter?==
I'm just wondering if this article (when finished) will contain the basic 3 elemental states or all 4; and also at which temperature each element reaches a state. Sure this is Wikijunior, but there's no use in lying to kids. [[User:Wikisquared|Wikisquared]] 20:45, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
UPDATE: I was right! There's only mention of plasma and no actual article. I can't be bothered to create one though... [[User:Wikisquared|Wikisquared]] 20:53, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

:We should definitely have information about plasma state. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 05:13, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

:Hi all,I created plasma and Bose-Einstein stubs this morning. My 11 year old daughter is learning about plasma in school at the moment-they consider four states of matter-presently. I agree, truth about states of matter wikijunior or not. Science is science.--[[User:Read-write-services|Read-write-services]] 01:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:We would be lying to the kids by telling them that there are only four states of matter. Ever seen [[w:list of phases of matter|list of phases of matter]]? Well, there are at least 20 states of matter, possibly 22 (depending on how you read the list), and there are likely more to come. More discussion is going to be necessary, I think. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

==Introductory material overwhelms intended content==
All the introductory material for this book is far too extensive. This is not intended to be a chemistry book. It is intended to be a book about the elements. Perhaps some of this material should be forked to Wikijunior_Chemistry and we should decide what material here really adds to the overall mission of this book. 

I think the best way to decide what introductory material is good for this book is to look at the actual concepts that crop up in the elements articles themselves (Compounds, gases, liquids) and briefly explain those things. Does anyone else have any thought on this? --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 12:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

*Hi Xixtas, I somewhat agree, if you like I could edit it right down, but I prefer to have the original Author authorise this before I go crazy! 
*I tend to leave articles as is to retain the original &quot;feel&quot;. perhaps today I'll trim it down...
--[[User:Read-write-services|Read-write-services]] 22:29, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

: Hi. I think that much of the material is worthwhile and valuable. But I also think it has too much detail for this book. That's why I suggested copying it before pruning it back. When I read it it seems like an excellent starting place for a book on basic chemistry. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:20, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

: Okay this morning I did a rewrite with a structural edit, what do you think? also If I wish to rename an article such as &quot;New!&quot; how would I do this?--[[User:Read-write-services|Read-write-services]] 23:00, 31 October 2006 (UTC)


:: I made a few edits to the &quot;New!&quot; Article. I'm going to start putting together a Possible Table of Contents. I'm thinking of intertwining the introductory material with the articles on elements. I'm not sure how to integrate the extensive introductory material with the specific element articles. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 19:55, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

== Idea for Clarification ==

We might want to include the grouping each element is placed in (i.e. noble gasses, transition elements, etc....) and the element's common state of matter (i.e. gas, solid, liquid, plasma, etc...). That might make the individual element articles make more sense in relation to the picture of the periodic table. Considering our age group target, we could expect that our reader would want strong parallels between pictures and words. Any thoughts?
[[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 00:30, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

: Perhaps an informational box including this information? --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 19:58, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

== Periodic Table Images ==

First of all, the periodic table needs to be filled out, but that's minor.

My concern is the periodic table images on each article page. The images are very good for showing information at a glance to people that know what it's showing, but the information goes beyond the scope of this book. I propose that a new set of images is made that is simplified. All that is necessary would be the periodic table with the specific element square highlighted. In the empty space can be filled with the symbol as it appears on the periodic table, so only one image is required per page. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 04:12, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

I can upload the remaining images at any time that they are needed.  However, if we are going to use a new set... [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 20:10, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

I don't understand the proposed change. Can you clarify, MiltonT? Which image are we talking about? --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 14:36, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

I think he is talking about the elements in [[Wikijunior_The_Elements/Periodic_Table#The_Table_itself]] though I could be wrong. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 17:49, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

Yes, I was talking about that periodic table. But I was also talking about the image that's on the upper left of each element page. There doesn't need to be all of that information in those images since it's not likely all of that will even be mentioned in this book. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 21:17, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

[[Image:C-TableImage.png|thumb|left|400px|Example image]]
True, those image however, have the advantage of already being in Wikicommons.  They also add an effect of adding the feeling of and advanced textbook without adding too much additional information. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 17:46, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
{{clear}}
[[Image:Gold-TableImage.png|thumb|right|300px|Periodic table showing the position of Gold, its symbol, and atomic number.]]
I'm not sure we want it to feel like an advanced textbook. Is this something like what you were thinking of MiltonT? --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 05:19, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

''&quot;The target age of this title is 8-12 years old.&quot;'' While feeling more advanced may make this more interesting to some (closer to the upper end of this range) it will propably discourage others in the lower end.  I have a couple of 12 year old brothers who might find it interesting, but we need to also consider the full extent of the age range. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 18:14, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

:I think that leaving the more advanced information, without further explanation, while discussing the more basic information that is shown in the atomic symbol box, is the way to go.  Children don't want to have to much information thrown at them, but at the same time there should be little &quot;hooks&quot; to allow the more advanced youngsters to springboard into higher-level topics.  This will help retain their interest and keep them coming back to the book again and again. --[[User:Eliyahu|Eliyahu]] 08:48, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

:: I think that decreasing the amount of information encapsulated on the periodic table graphic is a good idea, myself. If it the point was to create online information then we could direct kids where on the web to find out more. For a book, it needs to be more self-contained IMO. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:41, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

(Debating starting a new topic for this....)  Whatever format is used, I think that the color of the text box showing the atomic symbol should match the color of the indicated square on the periodic table.  In the gold example, the square on the table is salmon, for a ''transition metal'', while the text box has a decidely purplish color close to (if not exactly) that of the ''actinides''. --[[User:Eliyahu|Eliyahu]] 08:48, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

I agree that the color should match. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:41, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

== Reorder Questions == 
After working on a few articles, I'm finding that the question &quot;What does it look (etc.) like?&quot; should follow the question &quot;Where is it found?&quot; Because &quot;Where is it found?&quot; is the obvious place to talk about common compounds and molecules. If we've already talked about that, then it becomes much easier to include information about how, for instance, sodium cloride looks and tastes under sodium. This would make the text flow better and also allow us to introduce more relevant and interesting information about each element. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 14:38, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

== PDF Version ==
At momement there is no way that we could consider releasing a PDF version of this book.  However, there are several &quot;complete&quot; sections and the book is progressing quickly.  Perhaps we should start working on a PDF now. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 22:01, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

:I think the book is coming along nicely, I'm really excited about how the team that has been building this book has been working together on it. I think we can make a printable version and PDF. But I think we should label them &quot;Preliminary&quot; or &quot;Rough&quot;. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 01:55, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

::Sounds good[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 22:46, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

I have started working on it. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 05:15, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

[http://files.myopera.com/klingoncowboy4/files/Elements/Elements_draft1.pdf First Draft Done], this is obviously subject to massive change as the book evolves.  This version has basic formatting and doesn't contain any of the pages on the elements themselves, as a result I chose to host the file on a file host account I have rather than wikisource. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 05:45, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

==Table of Contents==
I've put together a [[Wikijunior The Elements/TOC|Table of Contents]] that interleaves the dry chemistry material with the information on individual elements that I think will be more interesting for our younger readers. The idea behind the structure is to introduce a concept and then talk about an element that illustrates that concept. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 00:30, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Preface to the First Edition ==

One the many challenges facing the countries in the Asia-Pacific today is pre-paring their societies and governments for globalization and the information and communication revolution. Policy-makers, business executives, NGO activists, aca-demics, and ordinary citizens are increasingly concerned with the need to make their societies competitive in the emergent information economy. 

The e-ASEAN Task Force and the UNDP Asia Pacific Development Information Programme (UNDP-APDIP) share the belief that with enabling information and com-munication technologies (ICTs), countries can face the challenge of the information age. With ICTs they can leap forth to higher levels of social, economic and political development. We hope that in making this leap, policy and decision-makers, plan-ners, researchers, development practitioners, opinion-makers, and others will find this series of e-primers on the information economy, society, and polity useful. 

The e-primers aim to provide readers with a clear understanding of the various terminologies, definitions, trends, and issues associated with the information age. The primers are written in simple, easy-to-understand language. They provide ex-amples, case studies, lessons learned, and best practices that will help planners and decision makers in addressing pertinent issues and crafting policies and strat-egies appropriate for the information economy. 

The present series of e-primers includes the following titles: 

#The Information Age 
#Nets, Webs and the Information Infrastructure 
#e-Commerce and e-Business 
#Legal and Regulatory Issues for the Information Economy 
#e-Government; 
#ICT and Education 
#Genes, Technology and Policy: An Introduction to Biotechnology 

These e-primers are also available online at http://www.eprimers.org. and http://www.apdip.net. 

The primers are brought to you by UNDP- APDIP, which seeks to create an ICT enabling environment through advocacy and policy reform in the Asia-Pacific re-gion, and the e-ASEAN Task Force, an ICT for development initiative of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We welcome your views on new topics and issues on which the e-primers may be useful. 

Finally, we thank all who have been involved with this series of e-primers-writers, researchers, peer reviewers and the production team.

== Introduction ==

Rapid advances in information technology, particularly in the area of bioinformatics, have played a critical role in breakthrough applications of modern biotechnology in medicine and agriculture.  Bioinformatics, broadly defined as the use of computers to handle biological information, has made possible the genomic era.  Bioinformatics provides the computer tools and databases to search, store, analyze and compare these data and to use them to develop, among others, safe and more effective medicines as well higher – yielding, more stress – resistant crops that have the potential for accelerating human development.

However, as the Human Development Report 2001 points out, this potential cannot be realized unless the two conditions are met.  First, modern biotechnology has to be utilized to address the key health and agriculture challenges facing poor countries.  Second, modern biotechnology has to be utilized through a systematic approach that allows potential risks to human health, environment and social equity to be effectively assessed and managed.

This primer discusses the science and policy issues surrounding the use of modern biotechnology.  It provides a snapshot of its benefits as well as concerns regarding its potential negative impact on the environment and on the human health.  The primer is divided into four parts.  The first part is on the science behind modern biotechnology.  The second part discusses the various issues relating to the application of modern biotechnology to medicine.  The third part focuses on the benefits and concerns relating to the use of modern biotechnology in agriculture.  Finally, the fourth part discusses ownership and access issues viewed from the perspective of developing countries.

This primer is by no means comprehensive.  It is intended merely to introduce readers to the various perspectives in the ongoing debate on the use of modern biotechnology.  Readers are therefore encouraged to consult the list of references at the end of the primer.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here are some examples were are still looking for:

== Examples Wanted ==
Here is list of the example progams we are looking for in rough order of priority (highest priority examples are first)
# '''Example to format currency''' - We would like an example that formats based on numeric picture formats such as &quot;$#,###.##&quot;.
# '''Validate Field by Character Set''' - We would like to validate a field base on a pattern character set.  So for example we would like to mark a field invalid if it has special characters such as non-alpha or non-numerics.  How do you specify this in a binding rule?  Can you bind it to an XML Schema data type?
# '''Full CRUD Example on dynamic file''' Demonstrate the full create, read, update delete (CRUD) cycle for some form data selected from a file local file system.  The example load the form data from a file (use the upload control) into an instance document and (similar to using the src=&quot;&quot; attribute), view the data, edit the data and save the data back to a file using a submit to a file. For doing this on a static file see [[../Read and write with get and put/]]
# '''Display required elements from Schema''' - A XML Schema file can tell you exactly what fields are required (if the minOccurs is not zero).  Demonstrate how these fields can be automatically be displayed using CSS and the :required pseudo element
# '''Instance validation''' - An example based on an external XML schema.  Validate an instance using the XML Schema file.  [[../Validate/]]
# '''XMLEvents''' Demonstrate how XML Events work with event propagation.  Show how events bubble up the event responder tree. 
# Use industry standard forms (IRS tax forms, ACORD insurance forms etc).
# A XForms example incorporating XML Signing in XHTML preferably with digital filters too.
# '''Full CRUD Example using any Database''' Demonstrate the full create, read, update delete (CRUD) cycle for some form data selected from a database.  The example load the form data from a database into an instance document and (similar to using the src=&quot;&quot; attribute), view the data, edit the data and save the data back to a database using a submit

== Non FireFox Examples ==
FireFox does not have Pseudo_element_support for &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;::value&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;::repeat-item&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;::repeat-index&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
See [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XForms:Mozilla_XForms_Specials#Pseudo_element_support Pseudo element support in FireFox]
Are their any other systems that will support this that we can get examples from?

== Finished Examples ==

# Get information from an XHTML web page - use the instance src to extract a value from an XHTML file. See [[../Read and write with get and put/]]
# Web Service Examples using REST - Examples of calling a web service using the simplified REST protocol where web service arguments are just passed in a URL.  See [[../Search flickr]] and [[../Search Amazon]]
# Call a web service from a form using the submit command.  We would like an example that does not require the students to register to use a web service. See [[../Web service/]]
# [[../Load from XML Schema]] - Load an XML Schema and use the data types in the XML Schema to validate data types in a form.
# [[../Facet Validation/]] - We would like to have a family of example programs that validate based on the facets of an XML Schema file but it appears that the FireFox extension does not yet support facet validation (restrictions based on length, minLength, maxLength, etc) so this is somewhat difficult to demonstrate easily in a classroom setting when the students are just running the FireFox browser.
# Set textarea size. Use the CSS to set the area of a textarea size differently of many boxes.  See [[../Textarea with style/]]

== The Science ==

__TOC__

== What is biotechnology? ==

In its broadest sense, “biotechnology” refers to “any technique that uses living organisms, or parts of such organisms, to make or modify products, to improve plants or animals, or to develop microorganisms for specific use.”{{gtpcite|1}}

Biotechnology combines disciplines like genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, embryology and cell biology, which are in turn linked to practical disciplines like chemical engineering, information technology, and robotics.

Figure 1 shows how biotechnology has evolved through the years. On one end of the development pole are techniques of ''traditional biotechnology'' like microbial fermentation, used as early as 10,000 years ago in fermenting beer, wine and dairy products. At the other end of the development pole are the continuously evolving techniques of ''modern biotechnology'', such as genetic engineering. Using genetic engineering techniques, the genetic makeup of an organism may be modified by inactivating or altering some of its genes and introducing other natural or artificial genes, usually from another organism.

'''Figure 1: The Gradient of Biotechnology'''

|}


Recently, the term “biotechnology” has come to be identified with modern biotechnology, specifically the use of genetic engineering techniques in medicine and agriculture. Hence, unless the context requires otherwise, this primer uses “biotechnology” to mean “modern biotechnology”.

== What definition of biotechnology is widely accepted not only by scientists but also by governments and multilateral institutions? ==

The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety defines modern biotechnology as referring to any process that involves the application of (i) ''in vitro'' nucleic acid techniques, including recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid and direct injection of nucleic acid into cells or organelles, or (ii) fusion of cells beyond the taxonomic family, that overcome natural physiological reproductive or recombination of barriers and that are not techniques used in traditional breeding and selection.{{gtpcite|2}}

Although the Protocol is not yet in force (because less than the required 50 States have either ratified or acceded to it), the Protocol’s definition of modern biotechnology has gained currency in international circles.

However, while there may be an emerging international consensus on the above definition, strictly speaking it is a definition that is applicable only when one uses the term “modern biotechnology” for purposes of interpreting or implementing the Protocol.

== What technical terms should a policy maker know to understand biotechnology? ==

There are at least four such technical terms: genetics, genes, genome and genetically modified organisms.

Genetics is the branch of biology that deals with the principles of heredity and variation in all living things. It is the study of why and how parents pass on some of their distinguishing features to their offspring. Its focus is on genes and their functions.

The gene is the basic unit of heredity and the ultimate arbiter of what we are. It carries instructions that allow cells to produce specific proteins. (It should be noted, however, that only certain genes are active at any given moment and environment.{{gtpcite|3}})

A gene is a part of the deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) molecule.{{gtpcite|4}} DNA, which is present in all living cells, contains information coding for cellular structure, organization and function.{{gtpcite|5}} It is made up of two strands twisted around each other in a helical staircase.{{gtpcite|6}}

'''Figure 2: DNA, Genes and Proteins'''

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:eprimer-genes_figure_2.jpg|600px]]
|}

Each cell in an organism has one or two sets of the basic DNA complement, called a genome. The genome is itself made up of one or more extremely long linear array of molecules of DNA that are called chromosomes. Genes, as explained earlier, are the functional regions of the DNA. They are the active segments of the chromosomes.7 Figure 3 shows how the genome, chromosomes, DNA and genes relate to each other:

'''Figure 3: Successive Enlargements of an Organism with Focus on Genetic Material'''

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:eprimer-genes_figure_3.jpg|600px]]
|}

In modern biotechnology8, the genome of an organism is altered by exposing cells to fragments of “foreign” DNA carrying the desirable genes, often from another species. This DNA is taken in and inserts itself into one or more of the recipient’s chromosomes at a location where it is inherited like any other part of the genome. The cells so modified are called transgenic cells. It is from transgenic cells that a GMO can be produced. All of the GMO’s cells contain the additional foreign DNA.9

There is no universal definition for genetically modified organism (also called “transgenic organism” or “living modified organism”). However, it is generally understood to be a plant, animal or microorganism that contains genes that have been altered or transferred from another species or from the same species by means of genetic engineering techniques.

== What role does information technology play in the development of modern biotechnology? ==

Our knowledge of biology has grown in such a way that we need powerful tools to organize that knowledge. Information technology, through the field of bioinformatics{{gtpcite|10}}, makes possible the rapid organization and analysis of biological data. Bioinformatics merges biology, computer science, and information technology to manage and analyze genomic data, with the ultimate goal of understanding and modeling living systems.{{gtpcite|11}}

== Why do we have to familiarize ourselves with the science of an issues surrounding modern biotechnology? ==

There are at least two reasons. The first has to do with the potential benefits that modern biotechnology offers humankind. The European Commission (2002){{gtpcite|12}} refers to modern biotechnology as the “next wave of the knowledge-based economy” after information technology, and the “most promising of the frontier technologies.”{{gtpcite|13}} It has identified applications in the following areas:

1. '''Health care'''. Biotechnology can be used to arrive at novel and innovative approaches to meet the needs of ageing populations and poor countries.

2. '''Crop production'''. Biotechnology can deliver improved food quality and environmental benefits through agronomically improved crops. It may be used to produce foods with enhanced qualities like higher nutritional benefits.

3. '''Non-food uses of crops'''. Biotechnology can also improve non-food uses of crops as sources of industrial feedstock or new materials such as biodegradable plastics. For example, canola is now being used to produce high-value industrial oil. Under the appropriate economic and fiscal conditions, biomass can contribute to alternative energy with both liquid and solid biofuels (e.g., biodiesel and bioethanol) and processes such as bio-desulphurisation.{{gtpcite|14}}

4. '''Environmental uses'''. New ways of protecting and improving the environment are possible with biotechnology, including bioremediation of polluted air, soil, water and waste, as well as the development of cleaner industrial products and processes like biocatalysis.{{gtpcite|15}}

The second reason why knowledge of biotechnology is important is that with more biotechnology-derived products being placed on the market, chances are these products will find their way into most countries, even those that do not use biotechnology for production. A government needs to be familiar with modern biotechnology if it is to effectively regulate biotechnological products and ensure that any adverse effects, if any, on the environment, human health, and social structures are properly managed, if not avoided</text>

==Definition of nursing== 
Nursing is a health-care profession focused on the care of individuals, families, and communities so they may attain, maintain, or recover optimal health and quality of life from conception to death. Nursing involves a greater, and often continued, level of human interaction than any other health care discipline. It is a holistic discipline with its own body of scientific knowledge. Nurses work in collaboration with interdisciplinary team members as to provide the best evidence based care. At the highest levels of nursing practice, nurse practitioners may act as primary health care providers.

Nurses work in a large variety of specialties where they work independently and as part of a team to assess, plan, implement and evaluate care. Nursing Science is a field of knowledge based on the contributions of nursing scientists through peer-reviewed scholarly journals and evidenced-based practice.

Nurses care for individuals and populations on all degrees of wellness, ages and cultural backgrounds, and who have physical, emotional, psychological, intellectual, social, and spiritual needs. The profession innovates art and science from numerous fields including nursing in caring for those individuals. Some nurses follow the traditional role of working in a hospital setting, but there are a number of career specializations which can be pursued, such as psycho-gerontological nursing.

==Scope of this book==
This book is intended for registered nurses,researchers and academics. A more basic nursing text is under development at [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Nursing_Study_Guide Nursing Study Guide]

==Entry to nursing== 
There are a number of educational paths to becoming a professional nurse, which all involve extensive study of nursing training and licensure by a regioanl regulatiory body.

In order to work in the nursing profession, nurses hold one or more credentials depending on their training and  scope of practice . Vocational nurses have a variety of titles including enrolled (EN), licensed (LPN) or registered practical nurse (RPN). 
A vocational nurse works with Registered nurse supervision. 

A Registered nurse (RN) provides scientific, psychological, and technological knowledge in the care of patients and families in many health care settings. Registered nurses may also earn additional credentials or degrees enabling them to work under different titles and career stages.

&lt;br&gt;
This command is paired with a conditional command such as the If statement. Comparable to the DOS &quot;do&quot; command, this simply tells the calculator what to execute if a certain statement is true.
&lt;pre&gt;
If A=0          //If value A=0 goto the next line
Then            //Because value was true, continue to the next line
...             //Rest of code to execute
...
End             //Defines end of If block
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Because of the inefficiency and redundancy of this command, it is often excluded in order to save space. In such cases the code is written
&lt;pre&gt;
If A=0
...
...
End
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''This format works in nearly all cases.''

==1. List the components of soil. Why is soil important to plants?==
===Soil Components===
Soil has three components: '''solid''', '''liquid''', and '''gas'''. The solid phase is a mixture of mineral and organic matter. Soil particles pack loosely, forming a soil structure filled with voids. The solid phase occupies about half of the soil volume. The remaining void space contains water (liquid) and air (gas).

Soil texture refers to '''sand''', '''silt''' and '''clay''' composition. Sand and silt are the product of physical weathering while clay is the product of chemical weathering. Clay content is particularly influential on soil behavior due to a high retention capacity for nutrients and water.
===Importance to Plants===
Soil provides minerals and water to plants. Soil absorbs rainwater and releases it later thus preventing floods and drought. Soil cleans the water as it percolates. Soil is the habitat for many organisms.

==2. Explain the difference between clay, sand, and loam soils. List three crops that grow well in each.==
;Clay: Clayey soils are made from very fine particles which stick together easily.  Water does not easily soak through clayey soils, but once it penetrates, the clay holds it well.  It must be broken up before it can be used for agriculture.  This can be done by mixing it with sand, sawdust, wood chips, lime, or manure.  Crops that grow well in clayey soils include '''celery''', '''wheat''', '''oats''', '''beans''', and '''clover'''.
;Sand: Sandy soils are made from coarse particles.  Water soaks into sand quickly, but will not remain there for very long.  This can be addressed by adding clayey soil to it.  Crops that grow well in sandy soil include '''melons''', '''cucumbers''', '''peaches''', '''peanuts''', and '''beans'''.
;Loam: Loam is soil composed of sand, silt, manure, and clay in relatively even concentration (about 40-40-10-10% concentration respectively).  Loams are gritty, plastic when moist, and retain water easily. They generally contain more nutrients than sandy soils. In addition to the term loam, different names are given to soils with slightly different proportions of sand, silt, manure and clay: sandy loam, silty loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, and manural loam.  Loam soil is ideal for growing crops because it retains nutrients well and retains water while still allowing the water to flow freely. This soil is found in a majority of successful farms in regions around the world known for their fertile land.  Crops that do well in loamy soil include '''barley''', '''turnips''', and '''potatoes'''.

==3. Test the germination of three varieties of seeds, 100 seeds in each variety. Record germination percentage after three, four, and five days.==
First, wrap each variety seeds in a paper towel.  Then dampen the paper towels and place them each inside their own clear plastic bag (such as a sandwich bag or a freezer bag) so that they retain moisture.  Do not seal the bags.  Place the bags in a warm place.  After three days, carefully remove the paper towel from each bag, open it, and count the number of seeds that have sprouted.  If you started with 100 seeds as per this requirement, the germination percentage will equal the number of seeds that have sprouted.  Write this percentage down for each variety.

Do not remove the sprouted seeds.  Rewrap the seeds in the paper towels, place the paper towels back in the bags, and return them to the warm place.  Repeat after day four and day five.

==4. Explain how plants obtain nutrients and convert them to food. Explain the differences between primary, secondary, and micronutrients.==
Fertilizers can be divided into macronutrients or micronutrients based on their concentrations in plant dry matter. There are six macronutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, often termed &quot;primary macronutrients&quot; because their availability is usually managed with NPK fertilizers, and the &quot;secondary macronutrients&quot; — calcium, magnesium, and sulfur — which are required in roughly similar quantities but whose availability is often managed as part of liming and manuring practices rather than fertilizers. The macronutrients are consumed in larger quantities and normally present as a whole number or tenths of percentages in plant tissues (on a dry matter weight basis). There are many micronutrients (such as boron, chlorine, manganese, iron, zinc, copper, and molybdenum), required in concentrations ranging from 5 to 100 parts per million (ppm) by mass.

The uptake of nutrients by plants is accomplished through both the roots and the leaves.  These nutrients are then used in the process of photosynthesis, which is a complex chemical reaction that converts light, carbon dioxide, and water into sugars.

==5. Name and identify ten common weeds of your community and tell how to best eliminate them, using cultural or chemical methods.==
===Chenopodium album===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Fat hen
| latin_name = Chenopodium album
| image =ChenopodiumAlbum001.JPG
| range = Worldwide
| description =
''Chenopodium album'' is a fast-growing weedy annual plant in the genus ''Chenopodium''. The standard English name is Fat-hen; other names include white goosefoot, lamb's quarters, pigweed or dungweed, or more ambiguously as just goosefoot.
| control =
It may be controlled by dark tillage, rotary hoeing, or flaming when the plants are small. Crop rotation of small grains will suppress an infestation. It is, however, difficult to control with chemical means.
}}
=== Stellaria===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Chickweed
| latin_name =Stellaria
| image =StellariaMedia001.JPG
| range =Europe, North America
| description =Stellaria is a genus of about 90-120 species flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, with a cosmopolitan distribution. Common names include stitchwort and chickweed.
| control =Control is difficult due to the heavy seed sets, although herbicides are effective when the plants are small. Common Chickweed is very competitive with small grains, and can produce up to 80% yield losses among barley.
}}

===Ranunculus ficaria ===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Lesser celandine
| latin_name =Ranunculus ficaria
| image =Ranunculus ficaria LC0016.jpg
| range =The plant is found throughout Europe and west Asia and is now introduced in North America.
| description =
The window of opportunity for controlling lesser celandine is very short, due to its life cycle. In order to have the greatest negative impact to celandine and the least impact to desirable native wildflower species, herbicide should be applied in late winter-early spring (March through May). Apply a 1.5% rate of a 39 to 41% glyphosate isopropylamine salt (e.g., Rodeo® for wetland areas) mixed with water and a non-ionic surfactant to foliage, avoiding application to anything but the celandine. Glyphosate is systemic; that is, the active ingredient is absorbed by the plant and translocated to the roots, eventually killing the entire plant. The full effect on the plant may take 1-2 weeks. Applications can be made during the winter season as long as the temperature is above about 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and no rain is anticipated within 12 hours. Because glyphosate is non-specific, spray should be controlled such that it touches only lesser celandine and does not drift onto desirable plants. To minimize impacts to sensitive-skinned frogs and salamanders, some experts recommend applying herbicide in March and then switching to manual methods.

===Oxalis ===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Wood sorrel
| latin_name = Oxalis
| image =Oxalis acetosella jfg.jpg
| caption =''Oxalis acetosella'' (Common woodsorrel)
| range =The genus occurs throughout most of the world, except for the polar areas; species diversity is particularly rich in tropical Brazil and Mexico and in South Africa.
| description =Oxalis is the largest genus in the wood sorrel family Oxalidaceae. Of the approximately 900 known species in the Oxalidaceae, 800 belong to Oxalis. Many of the species are known as Wood Sorrel or Woodsorrel. These plants are annual or perennial. The leaves are divided into three to ten or more round, heart-shaped or lanceolate leaflets, arranged in a whorl with all the leaflets of roughly equal size. The majority of species have three leaflets; in these species, the leaves are superficially similar to those of some clovers, though clovers differ in having the leaflets not in a whorl, and of unequal size with two smaller side leaflets and one larger central leaflet.
| control = Diuron has potential for use as an over-the-top application for postemergence oxalis control, and timely irrigation has the potential to reduce injury to sensitive crops.
}}

=== Elytrigia repens===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Couch Grass
| latin_name =Elytrigia repens
| image =Kweek Elytrigia repens.jpg
| range =''Elytrigia repens'' is a very common species of grass native to most of Europe, Asia, and northwest Africa. 
| description =Other names include twitch, quick grass, quitch grass, dog grass, and quackgrass.
It has creeping rhizomes which enable it to grow rapidly across grassland. The stems ('culms') grow to 40–150 cm tall; the leaves are linear, 15–40 cm long and 3–10 mm broad at the base of the plant, with leaves higher on the stems 2–8.5 mm broad. The flower spike is 10–30 cm long, with spikelets 1–2 cm long, 5–7 mm broad and 3 mm thick with three to eight florets. The glumes are 7–12 mm long, usually without an awn or with only a short one.
| control =Couch Grass is very difficult to remove from garden environments. One method is to dig deep into the ground in order to remove as much of the grass as possible. The area should then be covered with a thick layer of woodchips. To further prevent re-growth cardboard can be placed underneath the woodchips. The long, white rhizomes will, however, dry out and die if left on the surface.

=== Ranunculus repens===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Creeping Buttercup
| latin_name =Ranunculus repens
| image =Creeping butercup close 800.jpg
| range =Native to Europe, Asia and northwestern Africa.  Introduced to North America.
| description =Creeping Buttercup is a herbaceous, stoloniferous perennial plant growing to 50 cm tall. It has both prostrate running stems, which produce roots and new plants at the nodes, and more or less erect flowering stems. The basal leaves are divided into three broad leaflets 1.5–8 cm long, shallowly to deeply lobed, borne on a 4–20 cm long petiole; leaves higher on the stems are smaller, with narrower leaflets. Both the stems and the leaves are finely hairy. The flowers are bright golden yellow, 2–3 cm diameter, usually with five petals. The fruit is a cluster of achenes 2.5–4 mm long. Creeping buttercup has three-lobed dark green, white-spotted leaves that grow out of the node. It grows in fields and pastures and prefers wet soil.
| control =
From [http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publications.htm?SEQ_NO_115=177020 the USDA]
&lt;br&gt;
Chemical control is probably the best strategy to employ to eliminate the buttercup. Your local Cooperative Extension office can provide information on which pasture herbicides are most effective for controlling buttercup. Additionally, there is probably a large quantity of buttercup seed in the soil seedbank that may emerge after your initial control. Following best management practices can reduce future buttercups from emerging. Also, adding desirable pasture seed to the soil where the buttercup was growing will help fill in the bare areas.

===Sinapis arvensis ===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Charlock
| latin_name =Sinapis arvensis
| image =Herik 17-10-2005 13.59.40.JPG
| range = A native of Europe, it has also become naturalized throughout much of North America.
| description = Charlock, also known as wild mustard, is an annual or winter annual up to 1 m tall. The stems are erect with coarse spreading hairs near the base. The basal leaves are pinnatifid to dentate. The cauline leaves are much reduced and are short petiolate to sessile but not auriculate-clasping. The inflorescence is a raceme made up of yellow flowers having four petals. The fruit is a silique 3-5 cm long with a beak 1-2 cm long that is flattened-quadrangular. The valves of the silique are glabrous or rarely bristly, three to five nerved. The seeds are smooth 1-1.5 mm in diameter.
| control = Can be controlled by tilling the affected areas.

===Senecio vulgaris ===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Common groundsel
| latin_name =Senecio vulgaris
| image =Common Groundsel-first fruits.jpg
| caption =
| range =Common groundsel is a tenacious deciduous annual whose presence now encompasses the globe in a wide area of easy to somewhat difficult growing conditions.
| description =Standing only between 4 and 16 inches (10 to 41 cm) tall, bright florets mostly hidden by the characteristic bract giving it the appearance of never opening flowers and with a life span of 5-6 weeks, the self fertilizing Senecio vulgaris lives humbly among and occasionally under the other weeds and is easy to not notice.
| control =The ragwort flea beetle and ragwort seed fly have been approved and released for Senecio control in California, Australia and elsewhere.
}}

=== Galium aparine===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Cleavers, Bedstraw
| latin_name =Galium aparine
| image =Flowers February 2008-4.jpg
| range = Native to North America and Eurasia.
| description =
The long stems of this climbing plant sprawl over the ground and other plants, reaching heights of 1-1.5 m, occasionally 2 m. The leaves are simple and borne in whorls of six to eight. Both leaves and stem have fine hairs tipped with tiny hooks, making them cling to clothes and fur much like velcro. The white to greenish flowers are 2-3 mm across, with four petals.
| control = Cleavers, or Bedstraw, tends to grow in uncultivated areas, such as beneath fencelines and at the edges of fields.  The main problem it presents to agriculture is that it clogs harvesting machinery.  It is best controlled before it is allowed to propagate into cultivated fields by mechanical means, or by livestock.  
}}

=== Cardamine hirsuta===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Hairy bittercress
| latin_name =Cardamine hirsuta
| image =Cardamine hirsuta.jpg
| caption =
| range = Native to Europe and Asia, but also present in North America as an invasive weed. 
| description =The plant is a member of the mustard family (Brassicaceae), and is edible as a bitter herb. It flowers from quite early in the Spring until the Autumn. The small white flowers are borne in a corymb on wiry green stems, soon followed by the seeds and often continuing to flower as the first seeds ripen. The seed will burst explosively, often when touched, sending the seeds flying far from the parent plant. Seeds germinate in the Autumn, and the plants are green throughout the winter months.
| control =&lt;br&gt;
*Cultivation is effective on young plants that have not yet flowered.
*Mulching in late summer will prevent germination.
*Pulled plants should be placed directly into a container, as the seeds will continue to ripen even after the plant is pulled up.
*Flameweeding is effective.
}}

=== Rumex===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Dock
| latin_name =Rumex
| image =Rumex-britannica2.jpg
| caption =
| range = Members of this family are very common perennial herbs growing in acidic, sour soils mainly in the northern hemisphere, but have been introduced almost everywhere.
| description =These are erect plants with long tap roots. The fleshy to leathery leaves form a basal rosette at the root. The basal leaves may be different from those near the inflorescence. They may or may not have stipules. There are minor leaf veins. The leaf blade margins are entire or crenate.
| control = Keeping fields well drained will help control dock.  Young plants may be controlled by cultivation, but because mature plants send tap roots deep into the soil, it is difficult to eradicate them this way.  Chemical controls include applying a combination of glyphosate and dicamba via a wiper when the plants are at least 30cm higher than the crops in which they grow.
}}
===Taraxacum===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Dandelion
| latin_name =Taraxacum
| image =DandelionTatebayashiJapan.JPG
| caption =
| range =Dandelions are native to Africa, Asia and Europe, and have been widely introduced elsewhere.  Away from their native regions, dandelions have become established in the Americas, Australia and New Zealand and are now common throughout all temperate regions.
| description =The leaves are 5-25 cm long, simple and basal, entire or lobed, forming a rosette above the central taproot. As the leaves grow outward they push down the surrounding vegetation, such as grass in a lawn, which kills other plants by cutting off their access to sunlight. A bright yellow flower head (which is open in the daytime but closes at night) is borne singly on a hollow stem (scape) which rises 4-30 cm above the leaves and exudes a milky sap (latex) when broken. A rosette may produce several flowering stems at a time. The flower head is 2-5 cm in diameter and consists entirely of ray florets. The flower head matures into a spherical &quot;clock&quot; containing many single-seeded fruits (achenes). Each achene is attached to a pappus of fine hairs, which enable wind-dispersal over long distances.
| control =
Dandelion seeds are windborn, so it is difficult to prevent an infestation.  If possible, dig the plants up at the edge of a field before they produce seeds.  Otherwise, chemicl controls may be necessary. Glyphosate, mecoprop, and other herbicides can be applied to young plants.  2, 4-D is effective against established infestations.

===Calystegia ===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Bindweed, Morning Glory
| latin_name =Calystegia
| image =Calystegia sepium ssp sepium bluete.jpeg
| caption =
| range = The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution in temperate and subtropical regions, but with half of the species endemic to California
| description = Bindweed are annual or herbaceous perennial twining vines growing to 1-5 m tall, with spirally arranged leaves. The flowers are trumpet shaped, 3-10 cm diameter, white or pink, with a sometimes inflated basal calyx.  Some of the species, notably ''C. silvatica'', are problematic weeds, which can swamp other more valuable plants by climbing over them, but some are also deliberately grown for their attractive flowers.
| control = Bindweed is difficult to control once it becomes established.  It is a very persistent weed, so control methods must necessarily be more persistent.

Bindweed should be tilled under about eight days following emergence.  It will re-emerge, so it will need to be retilled several times during the growing season.

A systemic herbicide can also be used, such as 2,4-D or glyphosate.  These herbicides must move in sufficient amounts through the roots, stems, and leaves in order to be effective.
}}



=== Urtica===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Nettle
| latin_name =Urtica
| image =Urtica_dioica_(Blüten).jpg
| caption =
| range = ''Urtica'' has a cosmopolitan though mainly temperate distribution.  The most prominent member of the genus is the stinging nettle ''Urtica dioica'', native to Europe, north Africa, Asia, and North America. 
| description =This species have spiny hairs, or stinging trichomes, whose tips come off when touched, transforming the hair into a needle that will inject a cocktail of poisons: acetylcholine, histamine, 5-HT and possibly formic acid. This mix of poisons cause a sting or paresthesia from which the species derives its common name, as well as the colloquial name &quot;7 minute itch&quot;.
| control = Nettles should be trimmed to the ground and then sprayed with glyphosate.  If the re-emerge, they should quickly be hit with glyphosate a second time.

===Polygonum cuspidatum ===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Japanese knotweed
| latin_name =Polygonum cuspidatum
| image =Fallopia japonica MdE 2.jpg
| caption =
| range = Japanese knotweed is native to eastern Asia in Japan, China and Korea. In the U.S.A. and Europe the species is very successful and has been classified as invasive in several countries.
| description =A member of the family Polygonaceae, Japanese knotweed has hollow stems with distinct raised nodes that give it the appearance of bamboo, though it is not related. While stems may reach a maximum height of 3–4 m each growing season, it is typical to see much smaller plants in places where they sprout through cracks in the pavement or are repeatedly cut down. The leaves are broad oval with a truncated base, 7–14 cm long and 5–12 cm broad, with an entire margin. The flowers are small, creamy white, produced in erect racemes 6–15 cm long in late summer and early autumn.
| control =The success of the species has been partially attributed to its tolerance of a very wide range of soil types, pH and salinity.[2] Its rhizomes can survive temperatures of −35 °C (−30 °F) and can extend 7 meters (23 ft) horizontally and 3 meters (9.8 ft) deep, making removal by excavation difficult. The most effective method of control is by herbicide application close to the flowering stage in late summer or autumn. In some cases it is possible to eradicate Japanese knotweed in one growing season using only herbicides.

===Cirsium arvense ===
{{Argicultural pest
| common_name = Creeping thistle
| latin_name =Cirsium arvense
| image =Cirsium arvense bluete.jpeg
| caption =
| range =Native throughout Europe and northern Asia, and widely introduced elsewhere.
| description =It is a tall herbaceous perennial plant, forming extensive clonal colonies from an underground root system that sends up numerous erect stems each spring, reaching 1–1.2 m tall (occasionally more); the stems often lie partly flat by summer but can stay erect if supported by other vegetation. The leaves are very spiny, lobed, up to 15–20 cm long and 2–3 cm broad (smaller on the upper part of the flower stem). The inflorescence is 10–22 mm diameter, pink-purple, with all the florets of similar form (no division into disc and ray florets).
| control =
This plant is extremely difficult to control, as it can regrow from fairly small root fragments and is resistant to many herbicides.

*Pre-emergents can help prevent the plant from becoming established, but it is generally more often encountered as a perennial problem.
*Contact herbicides are only partially effective. Glyphosate in particular needs to be repeatedly applied.
*Mowing is effective over time, if done regularly.
*Goldenrods are allelopathic to this plant. Smothercropping of buckwheat and winter rye will also weaken the plant considerably.
*Pulling must be done repeatedly over a long period, but will eventually kill the plant. Gloves should be worn.
*Smothering techniques such as paper mulch barriers are quite effective.
*Canada thistle should never be added to a cold-composting system. All parts of the plant should be burned, thrown away, or put into high-temperature composting systems.

==6. Identify six common insect pests or diseases. Tell what plants they usually affect and how to eliminate or prevent their occurrence.==

=== Slug ===
{{Argicultural pest
|color=tan
| common_name = Great Grey Slug
| latin_name =Limax maximus
| image =DSCF8715 slug curled up lg.jpg
| caption =
| crop = Lettuce and cabbage are their favorites, but they will eat about anything.
| range = Native to Europe, the slugs have been introduced to Northern America and occur along the East and West sides of that continent. The slugs are almost always found near human habitation — usually in lawns, gardens, cellars or in other damp areas.
| description =The Great Grey Slug, ''Limax maximus'' (literally, &quot;great slug&quot;), also known as the Tiger slug or the Spotted leopard slug, is one of the largest kinds of keeled slug (second only to ''Limax cinereoniger''). The species is noted for its dark-spotted pale-grey body and the short keel on its tail. These nocturnal animals can grow to be as long as 8 inches (20 cm), feeding mostly on rotting plant matter and fungi. They live for up to three years and are inactive during the winter.
| control = Diatomite is a naturally occurring, soft, chalk-like sedimentary rock that is easily crumbled into a fine white to off-white powder. It is sometimes used as an insecticide, due to its physico-sorptive properties. The fine powder absorbs lipids from the cuticle, the waxy outer layer of insects' exoskeletons, causing them to dehydrate. This also works against gastropods and is commonly employed in gardening to defeat slugs. However, since slugs inhabit humid environments, efficacy is very low. It is sometimes mixed with an attractant or other additives to increase its effectiveness. 

Among the disadvantages of using diatomaceous earth for pest control include the health risk to humans (see below), and that it is harmful to the many insects that are beneficial to gardens, including predatory beetles and bugs and many detritivores (such as earthworms).

One mechanical control is to cut a soda bottle in half and place it around the plants to keep slugs out.  This is obviously labor intensive, and is therefore not practical for large crops.

=== Colorado potato beetle===
{{Argicultural pest
|color=tan
| common_name = Colorado potato beetle
| latin_name =Leptinotarsa decemlineata
| image =Colorado potato beetle.jpg
| crop = Potato, tomato, eggplant, pepper
| caption =
| range = [[Image:Kartoffelkaefer fg01e.jpg|thumb|300px|Range of ''Leptinotarsa decemlineata'']] Native to the Southwestern USA and Mexico, the Colorado potato beetle spread through the rest of the country, and into much of Canada.  It then spread to continental Europe and Asia.
| description =The Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata, also known as the Colorado beetle, ten-striped spearman, the ten-lined potato beetle) is an important pest of potato crops. It is approximately 10 mm (0.4 inches) long, with a bright yellow/orange body and 5 bold brown stripes along the length of each of its elytra, and it can easily be confused with its close cousin and look-alike, the false potato beetle
| control = Insecticides are often unsuccessful when used against Leptinotarsa because of the beetle's resistance to toxins and ability to rapidly develop resistance to them. The Colorado beetle has developed resistance to all major insecticide classes.  In areas where the CPB has not developed resistance to pesticides, it is crucially important to not repeated reuse the same type of chemical control, or the CPB will develop resistance to it.

The CPB can be hand picked from the plants.  Crop rotation is another effective strategy, the key being to put next year's potato crop as far as possible from last year's crop.  Plants can also be covered with ''floating row covers'' - a thin fabric which allows moisture and air to circulate, but prevents access to the plants by the beetle.
}}

===Japanese beetle ===
{{Argicultural pest
|color=tan
| common_name = Japanese beetle
| latin_name =Popillia japonica
| image =Jbeetle.jpg
| caption =
| range = [[Image:Jbmap.gif|thumb|200px|Map showing the parts of the United States currently infested by Japanese beetles.]] As the name suggests, the Japanese beetle is native to Japan. The insect was first found in the United States in 1916 in a nursery near Riverton, New Jersey. It is thought that beetle larvae entered the United States in a shipment of iris bulbs prior to 1912 when inspections of commodities entering the country began.

| description =The Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) is a beetle about 1.5 cm (0.6 inches) long and 1 cm (0.4 inches) wide (smaller in Canada), with shiny copper-colored elytra and a shiny green top of the thorax and head. It is not very destructive in Japan, where it is controlled by natural enemies, but in America it is a serious pest.
| crop = Rose bushes, grapes, canna, crape myrtles, squash, strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, grapes, plums, pears, peaches, raspberries, blackberries, corn, peas and other plants.
| control = During the larval stage, the Japanese beetle lives in lawns and other grasslands, where it eats the roots of grass. During that stage, it is susceptible to a fatal disease called milky spore disease, caused by a bacterium called milky spore, Paenibacillus (formerly Bacillus) popilliae. The USDA developed this biological control and it is commercially available in powder form for application to lawn areas. Standard applications (low density across a broad area) take from one to five years to establish maximal protection against larval survival (depending on climate), expanding through the soil through repeated rounds of infection, in-host multiplication, release from killed host, and infection. Typically proper application can lead to a 15-20 year period of protection.

On field crops such as squash, floating row covers can be used to exclude the beetles, however this may necessitate hand pollination of flowers. Kaolin sprays can also be used as barriers.

Research performed by many US extension service branches has shown that pheromone traps may attract more beetles than they catch, and so they have fallen out of favor. Natural repellents include catnip, chives, garlic, and tansy, as well as the remains of dead beetles.

===European corn borer ===
{{Argicultural pest
|color=tan
| common_name = European corn borer
| latin_name =Ostrinia nubilalis
| image =Corn borer.jpg
| caption =
| crop = Corn
| range = Native to Europe although it is found in North America as well
| description =The European Corn Borer (''Ostrinia nubilalis'') is a pest of corn. Female corn borer moths lay clusters of eggs on corn leaves, usually on the underside of the leaf.

The egg masses, or clusters, are laid in an overlapping configuration and are whitish-yellow in color. As the larvae develop inside their eggs, the eggs become more and more transparent and the immature caterpillar's black head is eventually visible. The caterpillars hatch by chewing their way out of the eggs.

European corn borer caterpillars damage the ears of corn, as well as the stalks, chewing tunnels which cause the plants to fall over.
| control = Biological control agents of corn borers include the hymenopteran parasitoid Trichogramma.
}}

===Boll weevil ===
{{Argicultural pest
|color=tan
| common_name = Boll weevil
| latin_name =Anthonomus grandis
| image =Cotton_boll_weevil.jpg
| caption =
| crop = Cotton
| range = Thought to be native to Central America, it migrated into the US from Mexico in the late 19th century and had infested all US cotton-growing areas by the 1920s, devastating the industry and the people working there and traumatizing the people of the American south. During the late 20th century it became a serious pest in South America as well. 
| description =The boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis) is a beetle measuring an average length of six millimeters, which feeds on cotton buds and flowers.
| control = The Boll Weevil Eradication Program is a program sponsored by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) that has sought to eradicate the boll weevil in the cotton-growing areas of the United States. It is one of the world's most successful implementations of integrated pest management.  Three main techniques are employed over a 3- to 5-year period: pheromone traps for detection, cultural practices to reduce the weevil’s food supply, and malathion treatments. During the first year, applications of malathion are made every five to seven days starting in late summer. The frequency is reduced to every 10 days during the later part of the growing season until the first frost. The cotton stalks are shredded and plowed into the ground to eliminate their use as a winter shelter. During years 2 through 5, the automatic spraying is supplemented by an intensive trapping program (one trap per 1-2 acres), and malathion applications are made only in those fields where weevils are detected. This phase begins in late spring and continues until the first killing frost. The final phase of the program involves monitoring and trapping at a density of one trap per 10 acres, with spot spraying as required. The program has become more high-tech in recent years, employing GPS mapping technology and bar code readers that transmit trap data electronically.

=== Cutworm ===
{{Argicultural pest
|color=tan
| common_name = Cutworm
| latin_name =Noctuidae
| image =Spodoptera exigua.png
| caption =The beet armyworm (''Spodoptera exigua'') 
| crop = Most often tomato, pepper, pea, or bean
| range = Their distribution is worldwide.
| description =The term cutworm is used for the larvae of many species of moth. Most cutworms are in the moth family Noctuidae, however, many noctuid larvae are not cutworms. Cutworms are notorious agricultural and garden pests. They are voracious leaf, bud, and stem feeders and can destroy entire plants. They get their name from their habit of &quot;cutting&quot; off a seedling at ground level by chewing through the stem. Some species are subterranean and eat roots. Cutworms are usually green, brown, or yellow soft-bodied caterpillars, often with longitudinal stripes, up to one inch in length. There are many variations across the genera.
| control = While there are pesticides which can control these insects, the non-industrial gardener can protect threatened plants by simply impeding the ground-hiding cutworm caterpillar from climbing the plant; they hide in the soil near the plants and climb them at night.

To prevent this, one can:

* Place a &quot;cutworm ring&quot; around the plant. It can be a can with both ends cut off, or anything similar, even a ring made of cardboard. It should be at least four inches high above the soil and go one inch below the surface. Some even use five gallon buckets with the bottom cut out, planting the seedling and bucket at the same time.
* Wrap the stem of the plant in aluminium foil, wax paper, coloured paper, cardboard, or plastic.
* Reputedly as reliable as anything: simply brace both sides of the stem with popsicle sticks, toothpicks, or even sticks from the yard. If they run smoothly up the side of the plant several inches, this apparently stops the cutworm from &quot;wrapping itself around&quot; the plant, necessary for its evolved method of cutting it off. In fact, cutworms do not chew through stems by &quot;wrapping&quot; themselves, so the efficacy of this method is highly doubtful.

| crop = Fruits, vegetables, soybeans
| range = The brown marmorated stink bug is believed to have &quot;hitched a ride&quot; to the United States as a stowaway in packing crates from Asia; it was accidentally introduced there from China or Japan.  Its native range also includes Korea and Taiwan.
| description = Looks similar in appearance to other native species of shield bugs including ''Acrosternum'', ''Euschistus'', and ''Podisus'', except that several of the abdominal segments protrude from beneath the wings and are alternatively banded with black and white (visible along the edge of the bug even when wings are folded) and a white stripe or band on the next to last (4th) antennal segment. The adults are approximately 5/8 inch long and the underside is white or pale tan, sometimes with grey or black markings. The legs are brown with faint white banding.
| control = Infestations should be reported to your local county Cooperative Extension office as this is a fairly new species to invade the United States.  They will be able to help you control them.

==7. Locate two sources of agricultural weather information. How is this information helpful to the farmer?==
# [http://www.usda.gov/oce/weather/pubs/Weekly/Wwcb/index.htm USDA's Weekly Weather and Climate Bulletin]
# [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climateresearch.html U.S. National Climate Data Center]

Climate is what to expect.  Weather is what you get.  Climate is basically a long-term average of what the weather has done in the past.

Knowing the climate helps the farmer plan agricultural activities such as planting and harvesting, as well as assisting in crop selection. Crops need to be in the ground early enough that they will be able to produce their yield before the first frost, but late enough to avoid springtime frosts.  The climate tells the farmer how many growing days to expect, and that can be compared to the number of growing days required by various crops.  Some crops also need to be harvested before the weather gets too hot, and other crops may allow multiple plantings and harvestings per season.

Weather also plays a hand in timing agricultural activities.  A field needs to dry out before it is plowed, and then it may need to dry out for a few more days before it is disced.  Dry weather is also needed to allow hay time to cure between mowing and bailing, and it is sometimes important when applying fertilizers or pesticides.

==8. Assist in planting, cultivating, and harvesting at least four different crops. Maintain a log of work done and problems encountered from seeding to harvest.==
Your log need not be any more complicated than a notebook and pen.  You could include information such as:
*Plowing/Discing
** When was it done?
** What was the condition of the soil?
** Cost
*Planting
**Date
**Amount of seed used
**Method (how was the planting done?)
**Cost
*Fertilizer
**When applied
**What kind was applied
**Cost
*Pest Control
**Dates and types of pesticides and herbicides
**Cultivation dates
**Mechanical/cultural controls applied
**Cost
*Irrigation
**Dates
**Rainfall dates
**Cost
*Harvest
**Date
**Yield

==9. Know the purpose of the following: &lt;br&gt;a. Plowing &lt;br&gt;b. Disking &lt;br&gt;c. Cultivating &lt;br&gt;d. Irrigation &lt;br&gt;e. Harvesting==
===a. Plowing===
The primary purpose of plowing is to turn over the upper layer of the soil, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface, while burying weeds and the remains of previous crops, allowing them to break down. It also aerates the soil, and allows it to hold moisture better. In modern use, a plowed field is typically left to dry out, and is then harrowed before planting.
===b. Disking===
Disking is often carried out on fields to follow the rough finish left by plowing operations. The purpose of this is generally to break up clods and lumps of soil and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or soil structure that is suitable for seeding and planting operations. 

===c. Cultivating===
A cultivator is a farm implement for stirring and pulverizing the soil, either before planting or to remove weeds and to aerate and loosen the soil after the crop has begun to grow.
===d. Irrigation===
Irrigation is the artificial application of water to the soil for assisting in growing crops. In crop production it is mainly used in dry areas and in periods of rainfall shortfalls, but also to protect plants against frost.
===e. Harvesting===
The purpose of harvesting is to collect the salable product grown in a field when it reaches maturity.

==10. Name and identify ten common birds of your locality, and state their value to the farmer.==
The greatest benefit birds provide to farmers is their voracious appetites for insects.  

Please consult Wikibooks' [[Field Guide/Birds|Field Guide to Birds]] to help you identify ten birds in your area.  As of this writing, this field guide is still in its infancy, so you might be well served to purchase a more thorough field guide.  Field guides are generally tailored to a specific area of the world, so be sure to consult one that covers your area.

==11. What is erosion? How can it be prevented?==
Erosion is the displacement of soil by wind, water, or ice by downward or down-slope movement.  It can occur quickly on steep ground - especially if there is nothing growing there.  It can be slowed by minimizing the amount of time the land has nothing growing on it.  When plowing, discing, or planting, it is best to make furrows perpendicular to the slope of the ground.  Plowing straight uphill will cause furrows to act as ever-widening ditches that channel the water quickly away, carrying soil with it.  Plowing across a hill instead slows the descent of rainwater and allows it to drop the sediments it picks up rather than carrying it off.

==12. Visit your local cooperative extension service and find out how the organization helps the farmer. Write a one-page report of your visit.==
The Cooperative Extension Service, also known as the Extension Service of the USDA, is a non-formal educational program implemented in the United States designed to help people use research-based knowledge to improve their lives. The service is provided by the state's designated land-grant universities. In most states the educational offerings are in the areas of agriculture and food, home and family, the environment, community economic development, and youth and 4-H. The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service of the USDA administers funding for Smith Lever Act services in cooperation with state and county governments and land-grant universities.

This table summarizes the cooperative extension programs in each state. (Under the 1890 amendment to the Morrill Act, if a state's land-grant university was not open to all races, a separate land-grant university had to be established for each race.  Hence, some states have more than one land-grant university.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The tank isn't going to run itself. A marine aquarium requires a dedicated hobbyist for proper care. Often an aquarium and its inhabitants can be mistaken as just a decoration or a piece of furniture, but it is much more than that. A dynamic state of being, an aquarium is always changing, and you have to keep up with it to make sure it stays on course.

== Regular Observations and Testing ==

It's important to keep up with your aquarium. Observe the tank often so that you know if something is going wrong or if there is some sort of change. If you just let your aquarium sit in the corner without watching it, something is likely to go wrong under the radar. 

Part of these observations include keeping tabs on all your organisms. Are they all present? Are their behaviors normal? Are they exhibiting normal coloration? An answer of no to such questions may point to some sort of problem which you couldn't have caught without observation. 

Further analysis and observations can be made through test kits mentioned in the equipment section. Although sometimes your animals may not show symptoms, there may be an impending problem that can be found through regular testing of the aquarium with test kits. Often, with a test kit, one can find what important factor of the aquarium is not what it should be in the event of a problem. The use of test kits help us to keep the aquarium's conditions within the ranges of tolerable conditions that the organisms can handle. How often you do tests depends on the aquarist and the system, but weekly is a good idea for a beginning aquarium before its conditions have stabilized.

== Keeping Clean == 

After some time, eventually your tank isn't going to look quite as clean and sterile as it did when you started. 

Often, algae will grow on the surfaces of the rock and the tank glass. Though they pose no actual danger to the animals, they can be an eyesore. Many people purchase hermit crabs or snails to do this job, but in some situations these cleaner organisms are either not enough or not an option. Therefore, it's the responsibility of the aquarist to keep the aquarium clean so that it remains attractive through regular cleaning. Watch out for chemicals that claim to kill algae, as they are often very dangerous to invertebrates as well; such chemicals are often not recommended.

Another problem that arises is salt creep, the effect of salt starting to form crystals on certain surfaces. In anywhere that saltwater sprays or an object isn't always submerged, eventually salt is going to start creeping. Areas to watch out for especially are places where Hang-On-Back systems spill into the aquarium. This salt should be cleaned to keep the tank looking nice. Also, as the salt is leaving the tank, keep up with salinity tests to make sure that it isn't going down.

== Water Maintenance ==

Water is extremely important to maintain as it decides how well your organisms will do. 

As your aquarium runs, eventually water is going to evaporate, lowering the volume of water in the aquarium. This will make all the dissolved substances more concentrated in the aquarium and is also less attractive. Because salt does not evaporate, it is important to fill the tank up with freshwater to replace the evaporated water. Many people have built systems where the freshwater is replace automatically and over time, but you must remember to maintain this system to make sure it is working properly.

Every so often, it will be necessary to do a water change, which means to take out water and replace it with more saltwater. This is important to help remove waste products, pollutants, or other substances that just can't be removed through the nitrogen cycle and other processes. This may be weekly, biweekly, monthly, or even longer, depending on the type of system you have, the capabilities of the filtration system, and other variables. When doing a water change, it is important that the saltwater to be put into the tank is already mixed before adding it; never add salt directly to a tank with living organisms, because if the crystals touch something it can disturb or stress them.

== Quarantine ==

When purchasing a new organism, it is often a good idea to quarantine them in a separate aquarium. A quarantine aquarium doesn't have to be fancy, just enough to house an organism temporarily. There are several advantages to using one.

First and foremost, if the animal is already sick and you didn't know, it's disease will not be passed onto other organisms into your main aquarium by accident. Also, in a quarantine tank, you can treat a disease in isolation without worry about the effect of the disease or medication on other animals.

A quarantine tank also allows you to keep an animal in isolation for other reasons. It will allow the animal to relax in a situation where it doesn't have to immediately compete and interact with other organisms. An animal can overcome the stress of being moved from the store. For example, in some cases, some animals will stop eating due to the stress of being moved. In rehabilitating the organism, it is much easier to get it to eat if other more comfortable organisms aren't competing with it.

TITLE: HOW DOES CHILD ABUSE AFFECT HOW A CHILD DOES IN SCHOOL?
DATE : OCTOBER 2, 2006
WRITTEN BY: DOROTHY JONES
CLASS : SOCIAL AND CULTURAL FOUNDATIONS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION
PROFESSOR: DWIGHT W. ALLEN

	In doing research for this paper, I was actually surprised and al little disappointed at how difficult it is to find material linking child abuse and how well a child learns.  However, I did find some interesting facts.  
	On several websites, I did find that a number of states have passed laws requiring school officials to report suspicions of child abuse cases.  The North Carolina EMS website defines these persons who report cases of child abuse as being “ any person or institution who has sufficient cause to suspect that any child has been abused or neglected........or died as a direct result of maltreatment should report the case of the child to the Department of Social Services in the county that the child lives in or was found in.”  (N.C. EMS website)
	There are three main types of child abuse that were mentioned during research.  These three types of abuse include physical, sexual and emotional  abuse.  Child abuse is defined as “ any act or failure to act that endangers the child’s physical physical and emotional health and development. Physical abuse is defined as “ the direct result of any physical aggressions towards a child, whether it be directly or indirectly intentional or unintentional”.  This type of abuse is the easiest form of abuse to prove. The reasoning for this is because it is the most obvious .  Physical abuse can range from slapping or hitting a child to other more severe forms of physical punishment, such as starving a child or locking him or her in a closet for days on end.   Severe physical punishment can also lead to severe emotional abuse, which will be mentioned shortly.  Sexual abuse is the next easiest form of abuse that can be proven.  In this type of abuse, the children usually display significant knowledge about sexual acts. In some cases, the child has been reported to play with his or her private parts or try to touch another child inappropiately.  This type of abuse is defined as “sexual act between a child and an adult”.  
	Emotional abuse, bu far is the hardest type of abuse to prove; this is because this type of abuse does not leave any physical scars or bruises to be seen.  In many cases this type of abuse can go on for many years without being seen. Examples of this type of abuse can include but are not limited to name calling, negatively comparing the child to someone else, or constantly blamig the child for things that are not his or her fault.  
	In all of these types of abuse mentioned, the victims of these types of abuse often have very low self esteem and generally do not make friends very easily.  Some other signs and symptoms may or may not include any or all of the following: burns or bite marks, unusual bruises or broken bones that keep reoccurring or that can’t be explained, a strong fear of going home or a strong fear of a particular person, wearing clothes that don’t match the weather, uncleanliness, or extreme hunger. In some but not all cases, the child could become overly aggressive, depressed, or withdrawn.  The child may or may not do well in school.  Note that this does not mean that a child who is always fighting is being abused, nor does it mean that the over achieving , shy, quiet child is being abused.  This just simply means that these are possible signs or symptoms of abuse.
	I found a couple of numbers that can be used to report suspected cases of child abuse that can be used in Virginia.  These numbers are 1-800-4 A-CHILD or 1-800-552-7096 .in addition to these numbers that can be called, there are several volunteer organizations that are set up to help victims of child abuse.  The majority of the ones listed below came from th SCANVA website.. One of these organizations is entitled CARE, which stands for Child Abuse Reform Education.  This group was founded by the same group who founded the Kozy Beginnings.  Other groups include SCAN, which means Stop Child Abuse Now and PCAHR, which means Prevent Child Abuse Hampton Roads.  Another national organization that has local chapters in Virginia that I forgot about until something was mentioned on the local news is CASA.  This means Court Appointed Special Advocate.  All of these organizations are nonprofit.  Most of these organizations that have been mentioned are primarily located in the piedmont and eastern shore areas of Virginia.  I didn’t find anything mentioned on the internet for the Southwest Virginia area..  I was actually very surprised to find that other states had more information about child abuse than Virginia did.  
	I do find it interesting that April is considered to be national child abuse prevention month.    Another interesting fact is that since 1983, te blue ribbon campaign has been going on. This is to encourage people to support the prevention of child abuse.  This is also to help educate people that victims of child abuse need the following things: kindness, empathy, friendship, advocacy, and education.  Some of the programs mentioned actually try to educate the parents by suggesting the following tips:
1.	—spending some one-on-one time with your children.
2.	Seek support from family and friends and other members of the community such as your local church.
3.	Praise your children for works well done
4.	Support other stressed out adults
5.	The parents can volunteer with other local programs.

There are also at least five ways that other people of the community can get involved and these are known as the five R’s to get involved and help prevent child abuse.
These include:
1.	Remembering the risk factors
2.	Recognizing the warning signs
3.	Reach out to stressed out people
4.	Raise the issue of child abuse 
5.	Report suspected cases of child abuse
	 In conclusion, some of the topics in this paper were not documented because it comes from personal experience.  I also believe that child abuse really does affect how a child learns in school.  I also believe that the community should be more involved in this matter.

The concept of the fourier series can be expanded to include 2-dimensional and n-dimensional function decomposition as well. Let's say that we have a function in terms of independent variables x and y. We can decompose that function as a double-summation as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty\sum_{j=1}^\infty a_{ij}\phi_{ij}(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is a 2-dimensional set of orthogonal basis functions. We can define the coefficients as:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{ij} = \frac{\langle f(x,y), \phi_{ij}(x,y)\rangle}{\langle \phi_{ij}(x,y),\phi_{ij}(x,y)\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;

This same concept can be expanded to include series with n-dimensions.

Wavelets are orthogonal basis functions that only exist for certain windows in time. This is in contrast to sinusoidal waves, which exist for all times t. A wavelet, because it is dependant on time, can be used as a basis function. A wavelet basis set gives rise to wavelet decomposition, which is a 2-variable decomposition of a 1-variable function. Wavelet analysis allows us to decompose a function in terms of time and frequency, while fourier decomposition only allows us to decompose a function in terms of frequency.

==Mother Wavelet ==

If we have a basic wavelet function &amp;psi;(t), we can write a 2-dimensional function known as the '''mother wavelet function''' as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_{jk} = 2^{j/2}\psi(2^jt - k)&lt;/math&gt;

== Wavelet Series ==

If we have our mother wavelet function, we can write out a fourier-style series as a double-sum of all the wavelets:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \sum_{j=0}^\infty\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_{jk}\psi_{jk}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

==Scaling Function ==

Sometimes, we can add in an additional function, known as a '''scaling function''':

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty c_i\phi_i + \sum_{j=0}^\infty\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_{jk}\psi_{jk}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The idea is that the scaling function is larger than the wavelet functions, and occupies more time. In this case, the scaling function will show long-term changes in the signal, and the wavelet functions will show short-term changes in the signal.</text>

=='''Solid Basics'''==

[[Image:Brillanten.jpg|thumb|250px|Diamonds are the hardest solid forms in nature.]]

So what is a solid? Solids are usually hard because their molecules have been packed together. The closer your molecules are, the harder you are. Solids also can hold their own shape. A rock will always look like a rock unless something happens to it. The same goes for a diamond. Even when you grind up a solid into a powder, you will see tiny little pieces of that solid under a microscope. Liquids will move and fill up any container. Solids keep their shape.

In the same way that a solid holds its shape, the atoms inside of a solid are not allowed to move around too much. This is one of the physical characteristics of solids. Atoms and molecules in liquids and gases are bouncing and floating around, free to move where they want. The molecules in a solid are stuck in place. The atoms still spin and the electrons will still fly around, but the entire atom will not change position.

Solids can be made up of many things. They can have pure elements or a variety of compounds inside. When you get more than one type of compound in a solid it is called a mixture. Most rocks are mixtures of many different compounds. Concrete is a good example of a man-made mixture.

=='''Crystals'''==

The opposite of a mixture is something called a crystal. When a solid is made up of a pure substance and forms slowly, it can become a crystal. Not all pure substances form crystals because it is a delicate process. The atoms are arranged in a regular repeating pattern called a crystal lattice. A crystal lattice is a very exact organization of atoms. 

A good example is carbon. Carbon actually makes more than one kind of crystal lattice, although most elements only make one. A diamond is a perfect crystal lattice while the graphite arrangement is formed into microscopic sheets.

[[Image:2006-02-13 Drop-impact.jpg|thumb|250px|Water is the most common liquid on Earth, and very common in humans as well.]]

The second state of matter we will discuss is a liquid. Solids are hard things you can hold. Gases are floating around you and in bubbles. What is a liquid? Water is a liquid. Your blood is a liquid. Liquids are an in-between state of matter. They can be found in between the solid and gas states. They don't have to be made up of the same compounds. If you have a variety of materials in a liquid, it is called a solution.

One characteristic of a liquid is that it will fill up the shape of a container. If you pour some water in a cup, it will fill up the bottom of the cup first and then fill the rest. The water will also take the shape of the cup. It fills the bottom first because of gravity. The top part of a liquid will usually have a flat surface. That flat surface is because of gravity too. Putting an ice cube (solid) into a cup will leave you with a cube in the middle of the cup; the shape won't change until the ice becomes a liquid.

Another trait of liquids is that they are difficult to compress.  When you compress something, you take a certain amount and force it into a smaller space.  Solids are very difficult to compress and gases are very easy. Liquids are in the middle but tend to be difficult.  When you compress something, you force the atoms closer together.  When pressure goes up, substances are compressed. Liquids already have their atoms close together, so they are hard to compress.  Many shock absorbers in cars compress liquids.

A special force keeps liquids together. Solids are stuck together and you have to force them apart. Gases bounce everywhere and they try to spread themselves out. Liquids actually want to stick together. There will always be the occasional evaporation where extra energy gets a molecule excited and the molecule leaves the system. Overall, liquids have cohesive (sticky) forces at work that hold the molecules together.

==Supercooled Liquids==

A supercooled liquid is a liquid that is put in conditions where the temperature is dropped below zero very rapidly. The result is that the liquid is still liquid, but acts like a solid. It is hard and cannot have its shape changed easily. Glass used in windows is a supercooled liquid. Normal glass is in fact the liquid form of sand, or ''silicon dioxide''. If a pane of glass was left for hundreds of years, it would eventually start to ''drip'', like normal liquids.

=='''Looking for a Gas'''==
[[Image:Chlorine ampoule.jpg|thumb|250px|Most of the gases you encounter daily are invisible, but [[Wikijunior:The Elements/Chlorine|chlorine]] is an example of one you can see.]]
Gases are everywhere. There is something named the atmosphere. That's a big layer of gas that surrounds the Earth, extending from the ground to about 300 miles (480 km) into the air.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/planets/earth/Atmosphere.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; In solids, atoms and molecules are compact and close together. Particles of liquids are generally a little more spread out. However, gases have no definite volume; they expand as much as they can. Their atoms and molecules are full of energy, bouncing around constantly.

Gases can fill a container of any size or shape. That is one of their physical characteristics. Think about a balloon. No matter what shape you make the balloon, it will be evenly filled with the gas's particles. The atoms and molecules are spread equally throughout the entire balloon. Liquids can only fill the bottom of the container, while gases can fill it entirely.

Compared to liquids and solids, gases can also be compressed with relatively little pressure. It happens all the time. Combinations of pressure and decreasing temperature force gases into tubes that we use every day. You might see compressed air in a spray bottle or feel the carbon dioxide rush out of a can of soda. Those are both examples of gas forced into a space smaller than it would want, and the gas escapes the first chance it gets.

You might hear the term vapor. Vapor and gas mean the same thing. The word vapor is used to describe substances that are normally liquids at room temperature, but are currently in their gas form. Compounds like carbon dioxide that are gases at room temperature don't need the term, so scientists will rarely talk about carbon dioxide vapor. Water and [[Wikijunior:The Elements/Mercury|mercury]] are liquids at room temperature, so they're called water vapor and mercury vapor after they're changed to a gas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Numerical Data and Variables ==
The most commonly used and necessary type of variable is the basic letter variable. The available characters are A-Z, θ (theta), and η (eta). On the TI-8x models these are the only types of numeric variables, leaving programming options limited to 28 defined areas in which to store variables in the calculator's memory.
&lt;br&gt;
This variable type is a double long, meaning that it stores data to the 9th decimal place.

This type will only store numerical data. Whether the input is an expression (2+3) or a single number (2.3535), the variable will only hold a single value (such as 5 or 2.3535).

To be added soon:The calculator treats real and complex values as different data types; these can be readily converted. Note that adding a single complex value to a list converts the entire list to complex, which can dramatically increase its size.

==Possible Career Paths==

This is a continuation of [[Movie Making Manual/Education|Teach Yourself Filmmaking]].  In this section, you learn about possible career paths.  This section is still mostly imcomplete and will be expanded shortly.

===Career #1 - Film Editing===

The most important skill that you can learn is film editing.  Anyone who plans to be a film director, film editor, and even film composer, should learn film editing.  This is where filmmaking comes all together.  This is where all the parts must fit perfectly.

====Editing Programs====

To learn film editing, you need a professional editing program.  Even though iMovie comes '''free''' with the Macintosh and Windows Movie Maker 2.1 is available for '''free''' downloading along with Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2), I do '''NOT''' recommend them.  They are great programs but they are not for editing dramatic scenes.  iMovie is designed for editing events and documentaries, not feature films. I believe the same is true for Windows Movie Maker.  Also, iMovie is awkward for editing a conversation which requires '''L Cuts'''.

The next step up is [http://www.avid.com/freedv Avid Free] (Avid Free DV is no longer availabe on Avid website.) which is '''free''' from Avid but only works with DV movies at 29.97 frames per second.  (Motion pictures are filmed at 24 fps.) The Avid Free DV forum has a lot of complaints about loading this software.  So even though it is '''free''' and it is

Another option is '''Final Cut Express''' but it has the same limitation as Avid Free DV which only works on DV movies.  If you want to purchase an older version, try version 2 or better.

Finally, there is '''Final Cut Pro''' which has great flexibility and is almost easy to use.  Unfortunately, even with a student discount, the newest version is terribly expensive.

;Special Note
:Schools which teach film editing seem to prefer Final Cut Express because it costs teachers only $100 yet it has most of the features of Final Cut Pro.  (To use film dailies at 24 frames per second with Final Cut Express, you will need QuickTime Pro which converts movies from one format to another (such as DV Stream).

====Learning Film Editing====

Film editing is not what you think it is.  It is not just &quot;slicing and dicing&quot; digital video but rather film editing is '''the highest form of storytelling'''.   Film editing is combining visual images, dialog (sound), music and sound effects.  It is not just cutting picture and dialog.  

'''Education:'''  The only way you will learn film editing is to edit scenes from '''real''' dramatic productions. Don't use the footage that comes with iMovie (two kids washing a dog).  Instead, you get inside the film studios of Hollywood and edit scenes from real motion picture and episodic television dramas shot on film. If you cannot do this, you buy film dailies on eBay, locate a good scene, digitize the scene, and add time code or frame numbers to make editing easier. If you visit Hollywood, some of the second hand video stores have film dailies purchased from estate sales and out-of-work actors and crew.  These dailies are on video so you have to digitize the footage and to make the editing easier, you need to add a timecode or frame numbers.  This is a lot of work so here is an alternative:

'''Alternative source''' To save time and money, you can buy '''unedited''' scenes from the [http://www.starmovieshop.com Star Movie Shop].  With film dailies, you see how scenes are broken down into individual shots for filming. Their most popular disk is called '''''Hearing Voices'''''.  It is extremely short and can be edited in many different ways in a single class period.    Frequently available on eBay.  Or if you are interested in learning about L-Cuts, the best scene is '''''Fireworks Display.'''''  Shows how L-Cuts can be used to emphasize one actor over another.  The disks cost only about $8 but are only available to film students.

====Which Version? - Final Cut Pro====

If you have an old G4 or G5 Macintosh and you are just starting out in film editing, you do not need the latest and the greatest version of Final Cut Pro.  On eBay, you can purchase '''new''' copies of old versions of Final Cut Pro.  I recommend version 3 which should sell for about $175 for a new, unregistered, full-retail version '''sealed''' in the box.  When you buy anything on eBay, only buy from someone who has 100% positive feedback.

===Career #2 - Film Scoring===

The majority of film scoring is creating '''musical sound effects''' that produce the proper mood or feeling.  Therefore, even if you have limited musical skill, you can create musical sounds that express a '''mood'''.

To get started, all you need is a Macintosh manufactured in the last three years, the newest version of [http://www.apple.com/support/garageband/ GarageBand], [http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/jampacks/orchestra.html Jam Pack: Symphony Orchestra], and an '''edited scene without the film score'''.

:Note:  GarageBand comes free with all new Macintosh computers.  Also, Ben Boldt has two [http://benboldt.spymac.com/instruments.html free packages of symphonic instruments] for GarageBand.

; Expensive Alternative
: Unfortunately, even the [http://www.starmovieshop.com Star Movie Shop] does '''NOT''' offer a disk of edited scenes with the film scoring missing. '''That is really dumb!!!!'''  The only alternative is to buy one of their Editing Workshop disks which comes with a '''long edit''' of the scene designed for film scoring.  ''Home Wrecker'' has a good example of a long edit for film scoring.  (If you are a music student, ask for a huge discount since you only need the film scoring part of the disk.)

:*Update&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; the Star Movie Shop now has a new disk with two specially edited scenes from a motion picture which need a film score.  The disks are called &quot;Green Tea Smoothie&quot;. Has anyone tested this?

;Warning
:Don't be confused by programs which help you do film scoring for documentaries, corporate video, multimedia and event video.  These programs are useless for motion pictures and television dramas.  Programs that just cut and paste pre-recorded music are totally useless for motion pictures.  Don't get suckered in!!!

;No loops
:Do not use loops for narrative film scores.  Loops are for film scores for documentaries, event video and multimedia.

;Free lessons - Wikiversity
:Wikiversity now has a course on [[v:Film scoring for Musicians|Film Scoring for Musicians]].  This course is '''free'''.

:There is also a [[v:Film Scoring Introduction|Film Scoring for Filmmakers]] course which is still under constructions.

===Career #3 - Visual Effects===

When you hear the words '''Visual Effects''', you immediately think of 3D animation.  Long ago, visual effects were based on '''optical compositing''' (which is just '''Photoshop''' for 35mm movie film.)  Apple's [http://www.creativemac.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=52346 Shake] is now the least expensive compositing program at $499.  The much more famous compositing program [http://www.creativemac.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=36827 Adobe AfterEffects] starts at $700.  One advantage of Adobe AfterEffects is you can by an older version new on eBay for learning the program.  Version 5.5 is nice.  Also, you can download crippled trial versions of both [http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects After Effects] and [http://www.apple.com/shake Shake].

If you are not familiar with the concept of compositing, you definitely need to first get a copy of [http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop Adobe Photoshop] (accept no substitute).  Learning this program will give you a basic understanding of compositing images together.  The good news is you can purchase new copies of old versions of Adobe Photoshop which are great for learning the concepts.  Version 4 or later is a good start;  Adobe Photoshop 5.5 is better because it had editable text which version 4 does not.  Look on eBay for an older version which is new, sealed in the box from someone with 100% positive feedback.

===Career #4 - Sound Effects===

Sound effects is working with individual sounds to make them better.  This means you need a program which works with individual sound samples.   I found that the free version of [http://www.bias-inc.com/products/peakLe5 Peak] is awkward to use.  However, there is a free 14-day trial version.  You need to learn to record sound effects in the field (or in sound effects libraries) and then '''sweeten''' the sounds to make them big, fat, and rich sounding.

===Career #5 - Sound Recording===

Sound recording is like using a multi-track tape recorder.  There are a huge number of programs which can do this. Originally, the industry standard was [http://www.digidesign.com/index.cfm?langid=100&amp;navid=105&amp;itemid=23604 Digidesign] but now music programs offer this same feature.  Even [http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband GarageBand] which comes free with all new Macintosh computers can do this (but you still need an interface and professional microphones with XLR connectors.)  A more advanced music program is [http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp Digital Performer].  (Unless you are a professional musician, never get Apple's '''Logic'''.  Too awkward, confusing, and buggy for filmmakers.)

The thing that is special about sound recording is if you buy a Nagra and good boom microphone and a boom, you are in the sound recording business.  While it is not quite as easy as that, this is one of the few careers that you can buy your way into.  If you have the basic equipment, every student film in the country will be eager to hire you for a very low salery.

===Career #6 - Storyboarding===
[[Image:Juliet without Romeo FF3D.png|thumb|right|FrameForge 3D Studio main page from a project at Wikiversity Film School.]]
Most directors do thumbnail storyboards which are storyboards as big as your thumbnail.  A few directors will create more extensive storyboards.  But anything beyond that is usually done by a specialist.

;Option 1 - Basic Storyboarding
:If you are artistically inclined, you can create much more advanced 2D storyboards for movie directors.  2D storyboards can be cartoon style for production boards.

;Option 2 - High Priced Artwork
:If you are extremely artistically inclined, you can create full artistic renderings for the financial investors and the Hollywood studio executives.  There are only a few jobs doing this but the pay is excellent.

;Option 3 - 3D Storyboards
:If you are good with computers, you can create very accurate 3D storyboards.  3D storyboards are photo-accurate storyboards created with a program like [http://www.frameforge3d.com FrameForge 3D Studio] which offers a '''free''' demo version which is an ideal learning tool.  The free demo version is highly recommended to anyone interested in creating storyboards.

:The [[v:filmmaking|Wikiversity Film School]] offers a free course on Basic Filmmaking which centers around the free demo version of FrameForge 3D Studio.

:Another option is to use the '''free''' [http://www.daz3d.com/studio DAZ Studio] which is a 3D animation program for digital figures.

;Option 4 - Animated Storyboards
:For effects shots, filmmakers need an '''animatic''' which is an animated storyboard.  An animatic is edited with an editing program such as Final Cut Pro.

;Prerequisites
:For someone who does storyboards, the most important skill you must learn is how lenses effect a scene.  Before you do storyboards, you must know how a scene will appear if filmed though a 24mm, 34mm, 50mm, 85mm, 135mm lens, 200mm, and 300mm lens (35mm still photography lens equivalents). There are three ways you can learn this skill.
:*One way to learn about lenses is to get a camera which has these lenses and take a lot of pictures of people.
:*Another alternative is to learn DAZ Studio or Poser (DAZ Studio is free) and practice filming human figures with 24mm, 48mm, 85mm, and 135mm lenses (35mm still camera equivelent.)
:*And the best alternative is to use the '''free''' demo version of [http://www.frameforge3d.com FrameForge 3D Studio].  For the free version, you get 20 uses and only 12 characters in the scene and 20 storyboards.  Even with these limitations, you will find this program to be the ideal learning tool for both cinematography and storyboarding.  (Highly recommended [[User:Robert Elliott|Robert Elliott]])
:See the section at the bottom of the page on practicing photography.

;Supplimental Education
:To understand how scenes are broken down into individual shots, look at lots of film dailies from Hollywood, preferably from television dramas which are usually filmed more efficiently than motion pictures.  Currently the best source of film dailies is [http://www.starmovieshop.com Star Movie Shop's] Disk #1 and Disk #2 which together have 25 unedited scenes for you to study and to edit. Only available to film students.

;Free Lessons
:Look at the '''free courses''' from [[v:filmmaking|Wikiversity Film School]].  The first course is for [[v:WikiU_Film_School|Pre-production for Narrative Motion Pictures]] (scripted dramas).  The heart of the course is [http://www.frameforge3d.com/download.php '''FrameForge 3D Studio FREE Demo Version'''] which is free for both the Macintosh and Windows computers.  In this course from Wikiversity, you learn all the steps of creating an '''animatic''' (which is a movie of the storyboards.)  This is the basic introduction to narrative filmmaking.

===Career #7 - Script Writing===

Script writing is two parts.  The first is to write a story.  The second is to format the script.  Both are equally important.

You do not need any software to rough out a script.  However, formatting, editing and polishing a script requires script formatting software.  So if you are going to make a motion picture, you need to learn to use script formatting software such as [http://www.finaldraft.com Final Draft].  They offer '''free''' trial version of the program.

;Recommended Training
:Wikiversity has a filmmaking section has a script formatting section.  You are asked to format a script which is 60 second long using Final Draft's Free demonstration version.  You can start on this project now.  Go to [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Lesson:Formatting_the_script Lesson #001 - Formatting the script].

===Career #8 DVD-Video Authoring===

Authoring DVDs can be an interesting career.  Start by learning the free DVD-Video authoring program which comes with your computer such as [http://www.apple.com/ilife/idvd iDVD].  Then get a professional version of a DVD authoring program.  It does not have to be the current version.  An old version of [http://www.apple.com/dvdstudiopro DVD Studio Pro] (version 2 or better) is fine which can be purchased unopened on eBay.  (Get the retail version, not the educational version which cannot be upgraded later.)

===Career #9 Acting===

If you want to be an actor, you must learn one thing.  Do everything with confidence.  When you are sad in a movie, be sad with confidence.  When you are afraid in a movie, be afraid with confidence.

Most of the background of the business of acting can be learned from a one year subscription to BackStage West.

===Career #10 Lighting===

The rule of lighting for motion pictures is '''never''' point a light at an actor (with the exception of back lighting).  Light must always be bounced or there must be something in front of the light to diffuse the light.  '''Never''' use a lighting kit for still photography because they are designed to point the lights at actors.

The secret to lighting is to turn off all the lights and slowly turn them back on, one by one.  Stop when you like what you see.  Finally, add a very gentle fill light so you can barely see the darkest spot of the scene.

Remember that you are '''painting with color'''.  Gel everything... then slowly pull back until you find a happy medium.

When possible, show the light.  Fog allows you to actually see the light.

Most of the skills of lighting are learned on the movie set.  Few people have access to the HUGE lights used in filmmaking.  Still you can learn a lot by getting DAZ Studio or Poser (DAZ Studio is free) and practice lighting human figures.  You should also be able to do this with Maya Personal Edition which is free.  While the effect of lighting in a 3D animation program is never the same as lighting with real lights, it give you a good idea of what is possible.  Painting with color is one of the things you can do with lights.

==Other Skills Needed For Filmmaking==

In addition, you need to learn some simple skills:

===Practice Still Photography===

If you plan to become a film director, cinematographer or storyboard artist, you need to learn the correct way to film actors and scenery.  To do this, you need to understand '''lenses'''.  The lens of the camera '''distorts''' the image which is extremely desirable.

*Wide angle lenses make the scene seem cold and majestic.
*Telephoto lenses make the scene seem close and warm.
*A plain lens (about 48mm) has no distortion and the image always looks boring.

With certain lenses, you can control the depth of field.  Depth of field can focus the audiences attention so it is a very useful tool for filmmakers.

Camcorders come with the wrong wide angle lens and they have no control of depth of field.  Working with a still SLR camera teaches you this.

;Recommended Education
:To learn how to use the distortion of lenses, buy a '''still camera''' which has the 35mm equivalent of a '''24mm lens''' and a '''85mm to 200mm zoom lens'''.   '''24mm''' is a wide angle lens. If you film scenery with a '''28mm''' or '''32mm''' lens, the landscape will never be as impressive as with a '''24mm''' lens. ('''20mm''' is also good but too expensive and too big to be practical for filmmaking.)  (Note: These are 35mm still camera equivalents.) 

:When you work with these lenses, you will see that portraits are normally shot with a telephoto lens and westerns are filmed with a wide angle lens.  Try doing the opposite.  Try creating portraits with a 24mm lens.  How to you place the subject in his surroundings to get an impressive picture with a full wide-angle lens?  If you want the answer, watch ''Citizen Kane''!!!

===Photoshop===

You need to learn how compositing works.  Mastering [http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop Photoshop] will teach you this.

;Recommended Education
:Get a copy of Photoshop 4 or later and teach yourself the basics of Photoshop.  Back in the stone ages (before personal computers), high schools required that all girls learn to type so they can work in an office.  Typing was the universal application.  Now the universal application is Adobe Photoshop.  No one should leave high school (or even elementary school) without learning Photoshop.  To understand light, channels and selection methods, you need experience using Photoshop.   Note: Programs which cannot access channels are useless for learning compositing. That includes Photoshop Lite.</text>

== What are the applications of modern biotechnology in the medical field? ==

In medicine, modern biotechnology finds promising applications in:

* Pharmacogenomics
* Drug Production
* Genetic Testing
* Gene Therapy

== What is pharmacogenomics? What are its anticipated benefits? ==

Pharmacogenomics is the study of how the genetic inheritance of an individual affects his/her body’s response to drugs. It is a coined word derived from the words “pharmacology” and “genomics”. It is therefore the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics. The vision of pharmacogenomics is to be able to design and produce drugs that are adapted to each person’s genetic makeup.{{gtpcite|16}}

Pharmacogenomics results in the following benefits:{{gtpcite|17}}

1. '''Development of tailor-made medicines.''' Using pharmacogenomics, pharmaceutical companies can create drugs based on the proteins, enzymes and RNA molecules that are associated with specific genes and diseases. These tailor-made drugs promise not only to maximize therapeutic effects but also to decrease damage to nearby healthy cells.

2. '''More accurate methods of determining appropriate drug dosages.''' Knowing a patient’s genetics will enable doctors to determine how well his/ her body can process and metabolize a medicine. This will maximize the value of the medicine and decrease the likelihood of overdose.

3.'''Improvements in the drug discovery and approval process.''' The discovery of potential therapies will be made easier using genome targets. Genes have been associated with numerous diseases and disorders. With modern biotechnology, these genes can be used as targets for the development of effective new therapies, which could significantly shorten the drug discovery process.

4. '''Better vaccines.''' Safer vaccines can be designed and produced by organisms transformed by means of genetic engineering. These vaccines will elicit the immune response without the attendant risks of infection. They will be inexpensive, stable, easy to store, and capable of being engineered to carry several strains of pathogen at once.

== How does biotechnology contribute to drug production? ==

Modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing drugs more easily and cheaply. The first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to combat human diseases. To cite one example, in 1978 Genentech joined a gene for insulin and a plasmid vector and put the resulting gene into a bacterium called Escherichia coli. Insulin, widely used for the treatment of diabetes, was previously extracted from sheep and pigs. It was very expensive and often elicited unwanted allergic responses. The resulting genetically engineered bacterium enabled the production of vast quantities of human insulin at low cost.{{gtpcite|18}}

Since then modern biotechnology has made it possible to produce more easily and cheaply the human growth hormone, clotting factors for hemophiliacs, fertility drugs, erythropoietin and other drugs.{{gtpcite|19}} Most drugs today are based on about 500 molecular targets. Genomic knowledge of the genes involved in diseases, disease pathways, and drug-response sites are expected to lead to the discovery of thousands more new targets.{{gtpcite|20}}

== What is genetic testing? ==

Genetic testing involves the direct examination of the DNA molecule itself. A scientist scans a patient’s DNA sample for mutated sequences.

There are two major types of gene tests. In the first type, a researcher may design short pieces of DNA (“probes”) whose sequences are complementary to the mutated sequences. These probes will seek their complement among the base pairs of an individual’s genome. If the mutated sequence is present in the patient’s genome, the probe will bind to it and flag the mutation. In the second type, a researcher may conduct the gene test by comparing the sequence of DNA bases in a patient’s gene to a normal version of the gene.

== What are the potential uses of genetic testing? ==
Genetic testing can be used to:

* Diagnose a disease.

* Confirm a diagnosis.

* Provide prognostic information about the course of a disease.

* Confirm the existence of a disease in individuals.

* With varying degrees of accuracy, predict the risk of future disease in healthy individuals or their progeny.

Genetic testing is now used for:

* carrier screening, or the identification of unaffected individuals who carry one copy of a gene for a disease that requires two copies for the disease to manifest

* prenatal diagnostic screening

* newborn screening

* presymptomatic testing for predicting adult-onset disorders

* presymptomatic testing for estimating the risk of developing adult-onset cancers

* confirmational diagnosis of symptomatic individuals

* forensic/identity testing

== Are genetic tests now available in the market? ==

Some genetic tests are already available, although most of them are used in developed countries. The tests currently available can detect mutations associated with rare genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington’s disease. Recently, tests have been developed to detect mutation for a handful of more complex conditions such as breast, ovarian, and colon cancers. However, gene tests may not detect every mutation associated with a particular condition because many are as yet undiscovered, and the ones they do detect may present different risks to different people and populations.{{gtpcite|21}}

== What is gene therapy? ==

Gene therapy may be used for treating, or even curing, genetic and acquired diseases like cancer and AIDS by using normal genes to supplement or replace defective genes or to bolster a normal function such as immunity. It can be used to target somatic (i.e., body) or germ (i.e., egg and sperm) cells. In somatic gene therapy, the genome of the recipient is changed, but this change is not passed along to the next generation. In contrast, in germline gene therapy, the egg and sperm cells of the parents are changed for the purpose of passing on the changes to their offspring.

== How is gene therapy done? ==

There are basically two ways of implementing a gene therapy treatment:

1. ''Ex vivo'', which means “outside the body” – Cells from the patient’s blood or bone marrow are removed and grown in the laboratory. They are then exposed to the virus carrying the desired gene. The virus enters the cells, and the desired gene becomes part of the DNA of the cells. The cells are allowed to grow in the laboratory before being returned to the patient by injection into a vein.

2. ''In vivo'', which means “inside the body” – No cells are removed from the patient’s body. Instead, vectors are used to deliver the desired gene to cells in the patient’s body.

== How extensive is the use of gene therapy? ==

Currently, gene therapy use is limited. Somatic gene therapy is primarily at the experimental stage. Germline therapy is the subject of much discussion but it is not being actively investigated in larger animals and human beings.

As of June 2001, more than 500 clinical gene-therapy trials involving about 3,500 patients have been identified worldwide. Around 78% of these are in the United States, with Europe having 18%. These trials focus on various types of cancer, although other multigenic diseases are being studied as well. Recently, two children born with severe combined immunodeficiency disorder (“SCID”) were reported to have been cured after being given genetically engineered cells.

== What are the obstacles to the widespread use of gene therapy techniques to treat patients? ==

Gene therapy faces many obstacles before it can become a practical approach for treating disease.{{gtpcite|22}} At least four of these obstacles are as follows:

1. '''Gene delivery tools'''. Genes are inserted into the body using gene carriers called vectors. The most common vectors now are viruses, which have evolved a way of encapsulating and delivering their genes to human cells in a pathogenic manner. Scientists manipulate the genome of the virus by removing the disease-causing genes and inserting the therapeutic genes. However, while viruses are effective, they can introduce problems like toxicity, immune and inflammatory responses, and gene control and targeting issues.

2. '''Limited knowledge of the functions of genes'''. Scientists currently know the functions of only a few genes. Hence, gene therapy can address only some genes that cause a particular disease. Worse, it is not known exactly whether genes have more than one function, which creates uncertainty as to whether replacing such genes is indeed desirable.

3. '''Multigene disorders and effect of environment'''. Most genetic disorders involve more than one gene. Moreover, most diseases involve the interaction of several genes and the environment. For example, many people with cancer not only inherit the disease gene for the disorder, but may have also failed to inherit specific tumor suppressor genes. Diet, exercise, smoking and other environmental factors may have also contributed to their disease.

4. '''High costs'''. Since gene therapy is relatively new and at an experimental stage, it is an expensive treatment to undertake. This explains why current studies are focused on illnesses commonly found in developed countries, where more people can afford to pay for treatment. It may take decades before developing countries can take advantage of this technology.

== What is the Human Genome Project? ==

The Human Genome Project is an initiative of the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) that aims to generate a high-quality reference sequence for the entire human genome and identify all the human genes.

The DOE and its predecessor agencies were assigned by the U.S. Congress to develop new energy resources and technologies and to pursue a deeper understanding of potential health and environmental risks posed by their production and use. In 1986, the DOE announced its Human Genome Initiative. Shortly thereafter, the DOE and National Institutes of Health developed a plan for a joint Human Genome Project (“HGP”), which officially began in 1990.

The HGP was originally planned to last 15 years. However, rapid technological advances and worldwide participation have accelerated the expected completion date to 2003. In June 2000, scientists announced the generation of a working draft sequence of the entire human genome. The draft provides a road map to an estimated 90% of genes on every human chromosome. Already it has enabled gene hunters to pinpoint genes associated with more than 30 disorders.{{gtpcite|23}}

== What is human cloning? ==

Human cloning is one of the techniques of modern biotechnology. It involves the removal of the nucleus from one cell and its placement in an unfertilized egg cell whose nucleus has either been deactivated or removed.

There are two types of cloning:

1. '''Reproductive cloning.''' After a few divisions, the egg cell is placed into a uterus where it is allowed to develop into a fetus that is genetically identical to the donor of the original nucleus.

2. '''Therapeutic cloning.'''{{gtpcite|24}} The egg is placed into a Petri dish where it develops into embryonic stem cells, which have shown potentials for treating several ailments.{{gtpcite|25}}

The major differences between these two types are shown in Figure 6.

In February 1997, cloning became the focus of media attention when Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute announced the successful cloning of a sheep, named Dolly, from the mammary glands of an adult female. The cloning of Dolly made it apparent to many that the techniques used to produce her could someday be used to clone human beings.{{gtpcite|26}} This stirred a lot of controversy because of its ethical implications.

== What are the concerns regarding the use of modern biotechnology techniques in medicine? ==

Several issues have been raised regarding the use of modern biotechnology in the medical sector. Many of these issues are similar to those facing any new technology that is viewed as powerful and far-reaching. Some of these issues are{{gtpcite|27}}:

1. '''Absence of cure'''. There is still a lack of effective treatment or preventive measures for many diseases and conditions now being diagnosed or predicted using gene tests. Thus, revealing information about risk of a future disease that has no existing cure presents an ethical dilemma for medical practitioners.

2. '''Ownership and control of genetic information'''. Who will own and control genetic information, or information about genes, gene products, or inherited characteristics derived from an individual or a group of people like indigenous communities? At the macro level, there is a possibility of a genetic divide, with developing countries that do not have access to medical applications of biotechnology being deprived of benefits accruing from products derived from genes obtained from their own people. Moreover, genetic information can pose a risk for minority population groups as it can lead to group stigmatization.

At the individual level, the absence of privacy and anti-discrimination legal protections in most countries can lead to discrimination in employment or insurance or other misuse of personal genetic information. This raises questions like, is genetic privacy different from medical privacy?{{gtpcite|28}}

3. '''Reproductive issues'''. These include the use of genetic information in reproductive decision-making and the possibility of genetically altering reproductive cells that may be passed on to future generations. For example, germline therapy forever changes the genetic make-up of an individual’s descendants. Thus, any error in technology or judgment may have far-reaching consequences. Ethical issues like designer babies and human cloning have also given rise to controversies between and among scientists and bioethicists, especially in the light of past abuses with eugenics.{{gtpcite|29}}

4. '''Clinical issues'''. These center on the capabilities and limitations of doctors and other health-service providers, people identified with genetic conditions, and the general public in dealing with genetic information. For instance, how should the public be prepared to make informed choices based on the results of genetic tests? How will genetic tests be evaluated and regulated for accuracy, reliability, and usefulness?

5. '''Effects on social institutions'''.Genetic tests reveal information about individuals and their families. Thus, test results can affect the dynamics within social institutions, particularly the family.

6. '''Conceptual and philosophical implications''' regarding human responsibility, free will vis-à-vis genetic determinism, and the concepts of health and disease. Do genes influence human behavior? If so, does genetic testing mean controlling human behavior? What is considered acceptable diversity? What is normal and what is a disability or disorder, and who decides these matters? Are disabilities diseases that need to be cured or prevented? Where should the line between medical treatment and enhancement be drawn? Who will have access to gene therapy?</text>

== What are the applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture? ==

There are many applications of biotechnology in agriculture.

'''Improved yield from crops'''. Using the techniques of modern biotechnology, one or two genes may be transferred to a highly developed crop variety to impart a new character that would increase its yield.{{gtpcite|30}} However, while increase in crop yield is the most obvious application of modern biotechnology in agriculture, it is also the most difficult one. Current genetic engineering techniques work best for effects that are controlled by a single gene. Many of the genetic characteristics associated with yield (e.g., enhanced growth) are controlled by a large number of genes, each of which has a minimal effect on the overall yield.{{gtpcite|31}} There is, therefore, much scientific work to be done in this area.

'''Reduced vulnerability of crops to environmental stresses'''. Crops containing genes that will enable them to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses may be developed. For example, drought and excessively salty soil are the two most important limiting factors in crop productivity. Biotechnologists are studying plants that can cope with these extreme conditions in the hope of finding the genes that enable them to do so and eventually transferring these genes to the more desirable crops. One of the latest developments is the identification of a plant gene, At-DBF2, from thale cress, a tiny weed that is often used for plant research because it is very easy to grow and its genetic code is well mapped out. When this gene was inserted into tomato and tobacco cells, the cells were able to withstand environmental stresses like salt, drought, cold and heat, far more than ordinary cells. If these preliminary results prove successful in larger trials, then At-DBF2 genes can help in engineering crops that can better withstand harsh environments.{{gtpcite|32}}

Researchers have also created transgenic rice plants that are resistant to rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV). In Africa, this virus destroys majority of the rice crops and makes the surviving plants more susceptible to fungal infections.{{gtpcite|33}}

'''Increased nutritional qualities of food crops'''. Proteins in foods may be modified to increase their nutritional qualities. Proteins in legumes and cereals may be transformed to provide the amino acids needed by human beings for a balanced diet.{{gtpcite|34}} A good example is the work of Professors Ingo Potrykus and Peter Beyer on the so-called Goldenrice™(discussed below).

'''Improved taste, texture or appearance of food'''.Modern biotechnology can be used to slow down the process of spoilage so that fruit can ripen longer on the plant and then be transported to the consumer with a still reasonable shelf life. This improves the taste, texture and appearance of the fruit. More importantly, it could expand the market for farmers in developing countries due to the reduction in spoilage.

The first genetically modified food product was a tomato which was transformed to delay its ripening.{{gtpcite|35}} Researchers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Vietnam are currently working on delayed-ripening papaya in collaboration with the University of Nottingham and Zeneca.{{gtpcite|36}}

'''Reduced dependence on fertilizers, pesticides and other agrochemicals'''. Most of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are on reducing the dependence of farmers on agrochemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein with insecticidal qualities. Traditionally, a fermentation process has been used to produce an insecticidal spray from these bacteria. In this form, the Bt toxin occurs as an inactive protoxin, which requires digestion by an insect to be effective. There are several Bt toxins and each one is specific to certain target insects. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When a susceptible insect ingests the transgenic crop cultivar expressing the Bt protein, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (a lepidopteran insect), which is otherwise controlled by spraying (a more difficult process).

Crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to broad-spectrum herbicide. The lack of cost-effective herbicides with broad-spectrum activity and no crop injury was a consistent limitation in crop weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides were routinely used to control a wide range of weed species detrimental to agronomic crops. Weed management tended to rely on preemergence—that is, herbicide applications were sprayed in response to expected weed infestations rather than in response to actual weeds present. Mechanical cultivation and hand weeding were often necessary to control weeds not controlled by herbicide applications. The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential of reducing the number of herbicide active ingredients used for weed management, reducing the number of herbicide applications made during a season, and increasing yield due to improved weed management and less crop injury. Transgenic crops that express tolerance to glyphosphate, glufosinate and bromoxynil have been developed. These herbicides can now be sprayed on transgenic crops without inflicting damage on the crops while killing nearby weeds.{{gtpcite|37}}

From 1996 to 2001, herbicide tolerance was the most dominant trait introduced to commercially available transgenic crops, followed by insect resistance. In 2001, herbicide tolerance deployed in soybean, corn and cotton accounted for 77% of the 62.6 million hectares planted to transgenic crops; Bt crops accounted for 15%; and stacked genes for herbicide tolerance and insect resistance used in both cotton and corn accounted for 8%.{{gtpcite|38}}

'''Production of novel substances in crop plants'''.Modern biotechnology is increasingly being applied for novel uses other than food. For example, oilseed is at present used mainly for margarine and other food oils, but it can be modified to produce fatty acids for detergents, substitute fuels and petrochemicals.{{gtpcite|39}} Banana trees and tomato plants have also been genetically engineered to produce vaccines in their fruit. If future clinical trials prove successful, the advantages of edible vaccines would be enormous, especially for developing countries. The transgenic plants may be grown locally and cheaply. Homegrown vaccines would also avoid logistical and economic problems posed by having to transport traditional preparations over long distances and keeping them cold while in transit. And since they are edible, they will not need syringes, which are not only an additional expense in the traditional vaccine preparations but also a source of infections if contaminated.{{gtpcite|40}}

== There have been reports about modifying rice to address problems of deficiency in Vitamin A. Is this true, and will the technology be available to developing countries? ==

Yes, there are efforts to improve the nutritional quality of rice. This staple food for two billion people is usually milled to remove the outer layers to prevent their high oil content from causing spoilage. The remaining grains are low in B-carotene, the chemical precursor of vitamin A. Some 400 million people worldwide suffer from vitamin A deficiency while over 3.7 billion people are iron-deficient. Vitamin A deficiency causes five million deaths annually, and blindness in a further 500,000 people, while iron deficiency causes anemia and birth defects.

Golden Rice™is a transgenic crop created by Dr. Ingo Potrykus and his colleagues to improve the nutritional quality of rice by increasing the quantities of beta carotene (the precursor of vitamin A) and improving the crop’s iron content. Several genes have been inserted into the rice genome, including a daffodil gene, allowing the endosperm (the part that remains after milling and polishing) to produce B-carotene. Additionally, a phytase gene (which produces an enzyme to release chemically-bound iron), a gene to increase organic iron, and a gene to aid iron absorption in the digestive tract have been added. The presence of beta carotene in the endosperm of the transgenic rice gives it a golden color. Hence, the name “golden rice”.

The research, which was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Swiss government and the European Union, hopes to provide a cheap form of vitamin supplementation. If it is later proven to be viable and safe, Golden Rice will be distributed in developing countries, with no patents blocking access to it.{{gtpcite|41}} The introduction of vitamin A-producing beta carotene into the rice gene has the potential of addressing the vitamin A problem, especially among those who are too poor to diversify their diets with green vegetables.{{gtpcite|42}}

== How is modern biotechnology in agriculture different from traditional plant breeding techniques? Is modern biotechnology simply a more advanced stage in the biotechnology development continuum? ==

Yes and no. Yes, because both traditional and modern biotechnology involve the transfer of genes from one organism to another. Traditional breeding techniques typically involve the repeated mixing of thousands of genes over several years and many generations of plants to achieve a desired trait. Modern biotechnology accelerates this lengthy process by allowing scientists to insert selected genes directly into a plant.{{gtpcite|43}} This makes modern biotechnology less of an iterative process compared to traditional plant breeding techniques. In this sense, modern biotechnology is simply an extension of traditional breeding.

No, because unlike traditional breeding techniques, modern biotechnology can move genes across species, even family, boundaries to produce novel organisms that do not normally occur in nature. To cite a simplistic example, a brown cow that mates with a yellow cow may produce a calf of a completely new color, but reproductive mechanisms limit the number of new combinations. Cows must breed with other cows or their very near relatives. A farmer cannot breed for a purple cow using traditional sexual reproduction techniques because the necessary purple genes are not available in cows or their near relatives. In contrast, the biological barrier is not as steep, at least in theory, to a genetic engineer. If purple genes are available in another species, say in an iris plant, those genes could be mixed with the genes of the cow to produce purple cows.{{gtpcite|44}}

== How are genes inserted into plants using modern biotechnology? ==
There are currently two commonly used methods for introducing genes into plants genomes:

1. '''Using a plasmid vector.''' As previously discussed, a vector, like the plasmids of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, may be used to introduce the gene or genes of interest into the plant DNA. The resulting cells are then screened to identify those that have successfully expressed the new trait. The modified seeds are sown in the field and grown like any other crop.{{gtpcite|45}}

2. '''Particle bombardment techniques.''' The DNA to be introduced into plant cells is coated onto tiny particles, which are then physically shot into the plant cells. Some of the DNA comes off and are incorporated into the DNA of the target plant.

== Are transgenic crops now commercially available? ==
Yes, genetically modified crops are now available in the market. If you eat corn or soya products, chances are you are consuming genetically modified products. In the United States, it is estimated that 70-85% of all processed/packaged foods contain one or more ingredients that are derived from transgenic crops.{{gtpcite|46}}

James (2002) estimated the global area planted to transgenic crops in 2002 at 58.7 million hectares. More than one-quarter of this area, or 13.5 million hectares, is in six developing countries, namely, China, India, Indonesia, Argentina, South Africa, and Mexico. India, the largest cotton growing country in the world, commercialized Bt cotton for the first time during the year. However, four countries continue to account for 99% of the global transgenic crop area. The USA grew 66% of the global total, followed by Argentina with 23%, Canada with 6%, and China with 4%. China had the highest year-on-year percentage growth, with a 40% increase in its Bt cotton area.{{gtpcite|47}}

The adoption rate for transgenic crops is the highest in the history of agriculture.{{gtpcite|48}} From 1996 to 2000, 15 countries contributed to a more than 25-fold increase in the global area of transgenic crops, from 1.7 million hectares in 1996 to 44.2 million hectares in 2000.{{gtpcite|49}}

== Which transgenic crops dominate in terms of acreage? ==

In 2001, the principal transgenic crops were soybean, with 62% of the global area, followed by corn at 21%, cotton at 12%, and canola at 5%. More than three-quarters of the transgenic crops were modified for herbicide tolerance. The balance was mostly for pest resistance,{{gtpcite|50}} with a few areas planted to potato and papaya with inserted genes for delayed ripening and virus-resistance.{{gtpcite|51}}

== Is genetic engineering in agriculture harmful to the environment? ==

Most of the concerns revolve around the effect of biotechnology products on the environment and on human health.

Like all new technologies, genetic engineering, if not properly studied and regulated, can adversely impact on the environment. However, we need to review the impact on a case-by-case basis. Biotechnology by itself is not good or bad. As with all technologies, it is how people use it that can be good or bad, risky or beneficial. Each biotechnology product must be evaluated in terms of whether it is useful, beneficial and safe. To date, there is no scientific proof that the use of modern biotechnology has an adverse effect on the environment and on human health.

The major issues that have been raised so far against the environmental impact of genetically engineered agricultural products and the corresponding scientific consensus are summarized below:

1. '''Increased weediness.''' One concern is that altered plants may have increased fitness to survive their environments and might grow unaided by human beings in places where they could have unwanted effects. In unmanaged environments, they could displace natural flora and upset entire ecosystems.{{gtpcite|52}} However, in a 10-year study to answer the question of whether transgenes conferring herbicide tolerance or insect resistance on crop plants also confer weediness or invasiveness, it was found that genetically modified crops (those that are commercially available) have no more tendency to become weeds than their conventionally bred counterparts. Apparently, more genes are needed to convert a plant into a weed. Another study also showed that biological invasions have extensive time lags that range from 30-150 years and require the chance concordance of favorable conditions before taking off. The question, however, is whether transgenes would hasten this process.{{gtpcite|53}} This is why potential invasiveness of GM plants is evaluated before any decision to release them into the environment is made.

2. '''Unintended gene flow.''' There is also the concern that if relatives of the altered crops are growing near a field with their conventional counterpart, the new gene could move by means of pollen transfer into the latter. There is merit in this concern. This is why studies have to be done on a case-by-case basis to determine the potential environmental risks due to unintended gene flow. The European Science Foundation and European Environment Agency (2002) recently released their report on the significance of pollen-mediated gene flow from six major crop types that have been genetically engineered and are close to commercial release in the European Union, namely, oilseed rape, sugar beet, potatoes, maize, wheat and barley. They found, among others, that oilseed rape is high-risk for crop-to-crop gene flow and gene flow from crop to wild relatives. Potatoes, wheat, and barley are low-risk crops. Maize and sugar beet are both medium- to high-risk for crop-to-crop gene flow, with the latter having the same level of risk for gene flow from crop to wild relatives. There are no known wild relatives of maize in Europe with which it can hybridize.{{gtpcite|54}}

On the other hand, there is much research on developing alternative measures to mitigate unintended gene flow. At present, seed producers of conventional crops can devise mechanisms to isolate their crop lands from related plants in order to maintain the purity of their lines. In addition, several biotechnology measures to prevent horizontal gene flow, such as apomixis, chloroplast transformation, chromosome-specific cytogenetic system, and transgenetic mitigation, have been suggested. The most controversial is the Technological Protection System (TPS){{gtpcite|55}} developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Delta &amp; Pine. The technique, commonly called GURT (for Genetic Use Restriction Technology), involves a system of three genes that interact to control the fertility of seeds by the seed producer. The objection to TPS has to do with the possibility of pollen dispersal to adjacent fields of the same crop, inadvertently causing the latter to produce sterile seeds. This would also have a severe impact on the common practice of seed saving among small farmers in developing countries.{{gtpcite|56}}

3. '''Change in herbicide use patterns.''' It has been pointed out that widespread use of herbicide-tolerant crops could lead to the rapid evolution of resistance to herbicides in weeds, either as a result of increased exposure to the herbicide or as a result of the transfer of the herbicide trait to weedy relatives of the crops.{{gtpcite|57}} However, to date there is no evidence that this phenomenon is taking place.

4. '''Squandering of valuable pest susceptibility genes.''' Many insects contain genes that render them susceptible to pesticides. Often these susceptibility genes predominate in natural populations of insects. These genes are a valuable natural resource because they allow pesticides to remain as effective pest-control tools. The more benign the pesticide, the more valuable the genes that make pests susceptible to it. It is feared that crops that have been altered to contain the pest-resistance Bt gene can adversely affect the continued susceptibility of pests to the Bt toxin. The continuous exposure of pests to the Bt toxin in altered crops selects for the rare resistance genes in the pest population and in time will render the Bt pesticide useless, unless specific measures are instituted to avoid the development of such a resistance.{{gtpcite|58}} It should be noted, however, that there is really no such thing as permanent resistance to pests and diseases and that insect resistance happens under the current practice of using pesticides or even in nature.

== A few years ago, there was a controversy around the effect of genetically modified corn on Monarch butterflies. What was that controversy all about and did it have scientific basis? ==

Monarch butterfly larvae feed exclusively on the leaves of milkweed plants, which are commonly found in cornfields in the U.S. Pollen from nearby corn can become distributed on the leaves of these plants, and can therefore be eaten by the larvae. In 1999, two studies showed that Monarch butterfly larvae and larvae from related species that were fed leaves dusted with Bt-corn pollen had lower survival rates, compared to those fed leaves dusted with non-Bt corn pollen. These studies were used to suggest that Bt corn was responsible for the recently observed decline in the Monarch butterfly population.

However, subsequent investigations revealed that while a large percentage of Monarch butterfly larvae may feed on milkweed found in the corn belt region of the U.S., there is no overlap between their breeding time and the time of pollen shed through most of this region. Other studies have shown that corn pollen settling on an area decreases rapidly with distance. This and the toxicity studies showing low toxicity of many major Bt-corn strains indicate that pollen densities that could represent significant exposure to feeding larvae are found only within five meters of cornfields, and then rarely.{{gtpcite|59}} The current scientific consensus is that the adverse impact of Bt-corn pollen observed in the laboratory does not occur in the fields. Hence, Monarch butterflies are safe from Bt corn.

== Are GM foods safe to eat? ==

At present, there are no studies to indicate that any of the commercially available GM foods are any less safe than their non-modified counterparts. This, of course, does not mean that all products of biotechnology are safe. Hence, the need for regulations. In fact, GM food products are subjected to more tests than their conventionally-bred counterparts.

The concerns raised about the safety of genetically engineered food products fall into the following categories:

''1. New allergens in the food supply''

There is a concern that transgenic crops could introduce new allergens into foods. However, it is important to keep in mind that eating conventional food is also not risk-free; allergies occur with many new and even known conventional foods. For example, the kiwi fruit was introduced into the U.S. and the European market in the 1960s with no known human allergies; today, there are people allergic to this fruit.{{gtpcite|60}} In February 2002, the Royal Society issued a policy report titled Genetically Modified Plants for Food Use and Human Health—An Update.{{gtpcite|61}} The report concluded that there is currently no evidence that GM foods cause allergic reactions and “the allergenic risks posed by GM plants are in principle no greater than those posed by conventionally derived crops or by plants introduced from other areas of the world.”{{gtpcite|62}}

''2. Antibiotic resistance''

Modern biotechnology often uses genes for antibiotic resistance as “selectable markers”. Early in the genetic engineering process, these markers help select cells that have taken up the foreign genes. Although they have no further use, the genes continue to be expressed in plant tissues. Critics of modern biotechnology argue that the presence of antibiotic-resistance genes could have two harmful effects. First, eating food containing these genes could reduce the effectiveness of antibiotics to fight disease when these antibiotics are taken with meals. Antibiotic resistance genes produce enzymes that can degrade antibiotics. If a tomato with an antibiotic-resistance gene is eaten at the same time as an antibiotic, it could destroy the antibiotic in the stomach. Second, the resistance genes could be transferred to human or animal pathogens, making them impervious to antibiotics. If transfer were to occur, it could aggravate the already serious health problem of antibiotic-resistant disease organisms.

However, unmediated transfers of genetic material from plants to bacteria are highly unlikely. Moreover, several strategies have been developed to avoid the inclusion of antibiotic resistance genes in the commercial transgenic variety.

''3. Production of new toxins''

Many organisms have the ability to produce toxic substances. For plants, such substances help to defend stationary organisms from many predators in their environment. But there is concern that the addition of new genetic material through genetic engineering could trigger the production of toxic substances within plants. This could happen, for example, if the on/off signals associated with the introduced gene were located in the genome in places where they could turn on the previously inactive genes.{{gtpcite|63}}

Human beings typically eat several grams of DNA in their diet each day. Hence, the transgene in a genetically engineered plant is not a new type of material to our digestive systems. It is also present in extremely small amounts. In transgenic corn, for example, the transgenes represent about 0.00018 of the total DNA. Decades of research indicate that dietary DNA has no direct toxicity. In fact, exogenous nucleotides have been shown to play important beneficial roles in gut function and the immune system. Likewise, there is no compelling evidence showing the incorporation and expression of plant-derived DNA, whether a transgene or not, into the genomes of a consuming organism.

Defense processes have evolved, including extensive hydrolytic breakdown of the DNA during digestion, excision of integrated foreign DNA from the host genome, and silencing of foreign gene expression by targeted DNA methylation, that prevent the incorporation or expression of foreign DNA. Thus, there is a minimal possibility of adverse effects arising from the presence of foreign DNA by either direct toxicity or gene transfer.

''4. Effect on nutrients''

Concerns have been raised regarding the possible adverse effect of genetic engineering technology on the nutritional content of food. This is a legitimate concern for regulators. In the U.S., for example, the Food and Drug Administration ensures that the nutritional composition of GM foods is substantially equivalent to that of their conventional counterparts. Studies are performed to determine whether nutrients, vitamins and minerals in the modified food occur at the same levels as in the conventionally-bred food sources. For example, seeds and toasted soybean meal from Roundup Ready™soybeans have been compared to conventional soybeans in terms of protein, oil, fiber, ash, carbohydrates, moisture content, amino acid and fatty acid composition. The results showed that the composition of transgenic lines is equivalent to that of conventional soybean cultivars, except for the trypsin inhibitors in non-toasted soybean meal, which is not consumed. In addition, the equivalence of the feeding value of the transgenic grains was demonstrated in rats, chickens, catfish and dairy cattle.

''5. Concentration of toxic metals''

Some of the new genes being added to crops can remove heavy metals like mercury from the soil and concentrate them in plant tissue. The purpose of creating such crops is to make possible the use of municipal sludge as fertilizer. Sludge contains useful plant nutrients but often cannot be used as fertilizer because it is contaminated with toxic heavy metals. The idea is to engineer plants to remove and sequester those metals in inedible parts of plants. In a tomato, for example, the metals would be sequestered in the roots. Turning on the genes in only some parts of the plant requires the use of genetic on/off switches that turn on only in specific tissues, like roots. Such products could pose the risk of contaminating foods with high levels of toxic metals if the on/off switches are not completely turned off in edible tissues. There are also environmental risks associated with the handling and disposal of the metal-contaminated parts of plants after harvesting. Regulations have to address the peculiar functions of GMOs being used as bioremediation agents.

== A previous study of the adverse effect of GM potatoes on rats is cited by critics of biotechnology as evidence that GM products are unsafe. What happened to that study? ==

The study was found to be inconclusive.

Dr. Arpad Putztai, a senior scientist at the Rowett Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland, came to international attention when he announced to the media that eating genetically modified potatoes depressed rat immune systems and caused changes in their intestinal tract. Dr. Putztai and his co-workers compared rats fed genetically modified potatoes with rats fed non-modified potatoes, with and without added GNA. The genetically modified potatoes appeared to cause changes in the rats’ immune response and the structure of the intestinal lining.

But there was a flaw in the experiment. While its design was apparently correct for this type of feeding study, rats do not like to eat raw potato. As a result, a standard 110-day trial had to be abandoned after only 67 days because the rats were starving. Starvation affects gut histology, and even the lining of the guts of rats eating unmodified potatoes was shown to be abnormal. The presence of other potato toxins could also have had a confounding effect on cells in the intestine, especially since the potato lines were not substantially equivalent

== Does the possible transfer of antibiotic resistance marker genes from ingested GM food to gut microbes pose a significant hazard to human beings? ==

Organisms that contain DNA encoding for antibiotic resistance proteins are common and are becoming more prevalent in the environment. However, there is no documented evidence that the antibiotic resistance markers in GM foods contribute to antibiotic resistance in gut bacteria. Should there be such a contribution, it is expected to be extremely small for several reasons, including the efficient destruction of the resistance gene in the human gut and the extremely low intrinsic rate of plant-microbe gene transfer.

Furthermore, resistance genes occur quite widely already and the antibiotics involved are not widely used in medical practice. Finally, the technology is now available to omit the use of such selections devices and their use is therefore likely to diminish.

== What is the “principle of substantial equivalence”? ==

The term “substantial equivalence” was first mentioned in 1993 in connection with food safety in a report of the OECD Group of National Experts on Safety in Biotechnology. The members of the group agreed that the most practical approach to determining the safety of foods derived by modern biotechnology is to consider whether they represent a substantial equivalent to analogous traditional products. The term substantial equivalence and the underlying approach were borrowed from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s definition of a class of new medical devices that do not differ materially from their predecessors and thus do not raise new regulatory concerns.

According to the OECD definition, the concept of substantial equivalence is based on the idea that existing products used as foods or food sources can serve as a basis for comparison when assessing the safety and the nutritional value of a food or food ingredient that is new or that has been modified by modern biotechnological methods. If a novel food or novel food component is found to be substantially equivalent to an existing food or food component, it can be treated in the same manner with respect to safety. No additional safety concern would be expected. If a novel food or novel food ingredient is not found to be substantially equivalent to its conventional counterpart, this does not imply that it is unsafe. It must simply be evaluated on the basis of its unique composition and properties.{{gtpcite|64}}

== What is the “precautionary principle”? ==
The “precautionary principle” traces its origins to Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, which provides that:

:In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by the States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.

The use of the precautionary principle is to be based to the fullest extent possible on scientific evidence of a given problem. However, it is not always possible to move towards a decision on a purely scientific assessment; any assessment must also involve economic, social and ethical aspects. The precautionary principle is thus more of a political norm than a clearly defined concept.{{gtpcite|65}}

Critics of the precautionary principle have argued that it is poorly defined, not sufficiently grounded in science, stifles development of technology, and hinders trade. It is claimed that it is not a valid principle for evaluating scientific evidence as it distorts reality and leads to the acceptance of false beliefs. Opponents are also concerned that the precautionary principle’s focus on hypothetical risks will distract consumers and policy makers from the policies needed to address known food-borne threats to human health.{{gtpcite|66}}

The precautionary principle has been invoked to justify a prohibition of GM crops. The justification for a ban allegedly considers the potential public health and environmental benefits of the banned GM crop. However, it ignores the probable public health and environmental benefits that would necessarily be foregone as a result of the ban. A comprehensive application of the precautionary principle indicates that a GM crop ban, contrary to the claims of its advocates, would increase overall risks to public health and to the environment, especially in developing countries. Thus, it would be more prudent to study, develop, and possibly commercialize GM crops than to ban such crops, provided reasonable caution is exercised through the regulatory agencies.

== Should it wish to do so, how should a government regulate the use of modern biotechnology? ==
The purpose of a biosafety (short for “biological safety”) system is to control the risks associated with the products of modern biotechnology. An integrated national biosafety system has the following elements:{{gtpcite|67}}

1. '''National policy, strategies and research agenda regarding biosafety'''. The development of a national biosafety system should begin with the elaboration of a national biosafety policy consistent with a country’s other policy objectives on food, agriculture, the environment and sustainable development. This policy will serve as the basis for the crafting of specific legislation and/or regulations on biosafety. It should articulate a framework where competing goals, such as economic, regional development and environmental protection, may be integrated and communicated as a single national vision.

2. '''National inventory and evaluation'''. This is a means to identify and characterize the available resources and regulatory infrastructure in a country, assess their adequacy for supporting a biosystem, and identify gaps where capacities need to be strengthened. The inventory should include the following factors:

* existing regulatory structures and legislation pertaining to the import and export of agricultural commodities, environmental protection, animal and human health safety, and biotechnology

* existing mechanisms for the development of public policy, legislation, and regulations

* existing human, financial and scientific infrastructure

* the current status of biotechnology research and development, including programs for the safe use and handling of GMOs

* existing mechanisms for regional cooperation and regulatory harmonization

* existing capacity building programs

* the role of civil society in policy and regulatory development processes

* administrative and enforcement capacity

3. '''Knowledge, skills and capacity base to develop and implement a biosafety system'''. A strong base of scientific knowledge to support the regulatory system and the development of competencies in product evaluation is critical to any biosafety system. A limited knowledge and skills base will tend to produce regulations that are highly protective, at the expense of innovation.

Some countries have implemented a system of expert advisory committees, while others have relied primarily on scientists and professionals working within government agencies. The advantage of independent advisory committees is that they generally have more transparent accountability frameworks because the expertise and academic credentials of their membership are usually published. However, they may suffer from the part-time volunteer nature of their membership. A combination of these two approaches—expert advisory committees and government scientists and professionals—may be the best arrangement. Product evaluations performed by competent scientists within a regulatory agency could be supplemented by the results of issue-specific expert panel consultations.


:'''Box 3. Risk Assessment '''
{{TextBox|

* ''What is risk assessment?'' 

Risk assessment is a method by which science can be used to address environmental and human health safety concerns. It is broadly defined as the use of scientific data to rank or measure hazards, assess exposure and characterize risks involved in a food-related activity or product. However, risk assessments do not specifically determine whether a product is “safe” or “unsafe”. The use of risk assessment in the development of regulations is related to the expected impact of a particular environmental or food safety problem, the expected impact of protective mitigation measures, and the levels of urgency and controversy surrounding an issue. 


* ''What are the principles of risk assessment as applied to GMOs?'' 

There are four basic principles that have found international acceptance. These are embodied in Annex III of the Cartagena Protocol: 

1. Risk assessment should be carried out in a scientifically sound and transparent manner, and can take into account expert advice of, and guidelines developed by, relevant international organizations. 

2. Lack of scientific knowledge or scientific consensus should not necessarily be interpreted as indicating a particular level of risk, an absence of risk, or an acceptable risk. 

3. Risks associated with living modified organisms or products thereof, namely, processed materials that are of living modified organism origin, containing detectable novel combinations of replicable genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology, should be considered in the context of the risks posed by the non-modified recipients or parental organisms in the likely potential receiving environment. 

4. Risk assessment should be carried out on a case-by-case basis. The required information may vary in nature and level of detail from case to case, depending on the living modified organism concerned, its intended use and the likely potential receiving environment. 


* ''What are the limitations of scientific risk assessment?'' 

In risk assessment analysis, the use of science is not as clear-cut and simple as it may appear initially. First, since scientific knowledge constantly changes and evolves, the best available science about food or environmental issues may be different from one year to the next.

Another complicating factor in the application of science to risk assessment analysis is the disagreement among scientists about conclusions from key influential studies. Ideally, scientists conduct research in a manner that produces precise and accurate results so that study conclusions are authoritative and nonbiased. However, it is not unusual for scientists to disagree about an experiment’s design and conclusions, especially if the results alter the conventional knowledge about a subject. These disagreements may require years of debate and further experimentation in other laboratories before results are accepted by most scientists. Regulations based on professionally disputed scientific studies may not be scientifically defensible once the controversy is resolved through additional data gathering and analysis. 


* ''Given the above limitations, should one continue to use scientific risk assessment in evaluating biotechnology products?'' 

Yes, there is no other internationally accepted standard by which one can effectively assess the risks, if any, posed by GM products. One should, however, be cognizant of the above limitations in arriving at a decision involving GMOs.}}

4. '''Development of regulations.''' A country may adopt either voluntary guidelines or mandatory regulations. Voluntary guidelines are more quickly put in place and are more flexible for the adoption of revisions incorporating new information requirements. However, the public may not be as confident with voluntary guidelines as they would be with mandatory regulations. Thus, there may be value in adopting mandatory regulations.

If a country elects to develop mandatory regulations, it can do so in one of two ways: (1) it can develop a new act and regulations to specifically address GMOs; or (2) it can regulate GMOs using existing legal instruments such as acts, regulations, and presidential decrees. The former has the advantage of establishing a system that specifically addresses the product or process to be regulated, of being crafted to allow flexibility in the face of new technical advances, and of being perceived by the public as a positive response to addressing the concerns about safety of GMOs. However, it could take long to develop such a new act or regulation, especially with the political controversy that GMOs have generated. Also, this could result in GMOs being regulated in perpetuity even if the scientific basis for the separate regulation has long been eroded.

If a mandatory system is adopted, the policy maker should also decide on whether the system should take any of the following forms:{{gtpcite|68}}

* ''ex ante'' regulation in the form of required permits, licenses, regulations, and product approvals before any GM product is used or released, whether for experimental or commercial purposes;

* strict ''ex post facto'' liabilities in the form of damage payments by the biotechnology research organization or business entities; or

* a ''negligence'' rule, which is a combination of the ex ante regulation and ex post facto liabilities.

The biosafety policy developed in most countries emphasizes the ex ante regulatory approach. This approach has the major benefit of providing information to both the producer and consumer of biotechnology products. If a biotechnology organization produces new products according to the regulations, it is less likely to be fined ex post facto. Thus, regulation and product standards reduce risk and thereby allow the market to work more smoothly as the participants are better informed about the rules of the game.

Ultimately, the development of biosafety policy will depend on several factors including the nature of risks, the goal of public policy, the institutional and judicial framework, and the involvement of the private sector in biotechnology research.

Regardless of the type of regulatory framework chosen, care must be taken not to overregulate. An unreasonably stringent regulatory system can prevent beneficial products from being made available to the public.

5. '''Implementation of regulations.''' The final step of putting the system into operation requires the following elements:

* The regulations or guidelines clearly define the structure of the biosafety system.

* People are knowledgeable and well trained.

== What international agreements are relevant to modern biotechnology? ==
Issues related to modern biotechnology have been raised in a number of international fora, including the following:

* Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)

* Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

* Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)

* World Trade Organization (WTO)

* World Health Organization (WHO)

* World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)

* Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)

* Office of International Epizootics (OIE)

* International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC)

* Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)

* World Bank

There are also a number of international agreements that relate to modern biotechnology. The most important are the:

* Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity

* Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade

* Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures

* WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights

== What is the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety? ==

The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity is the first international legally binding tool regarding biosafety in biotechnology. It seeks to contribute to ensuring that there is an adequate level of protection in the safe transfer, handling and use of GMOs resulting from modern biotechnology, especially those that may have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. It also takes into account risks to human health, and specifically focuses on transboundary movements.

The Protocol was adopted in Montreal on January 29, 2000, but will take effect only after at least 50 States have ratified it. In summary, the Protocol:

* Establishes an Advance Informed Agreement procedure for imports of LMOs intended for release into the environment;

* Establishes a simplified procedure for notification and information exchange for LMOs intended for food, feed or for processing, such as agricultural commodities;

* Establishes regimes for assessing and managing risks to biodiversity;

* Details information and documentation requirements; and

* Includes provision for capacity-building and financial resources.{{gtpcite|69}}


:'''Box 4. The Advanced Informed Agreement Procedure '''
{{TextBox|

A Party1 exporting a living modified organism (LMO) to another Party for intentional introduction into the latter’s environment is required to comply with the advance informed agreement procedure laid down by the Cartagena Protocol. The Advance Informed Agreement, which is the heart of the Cartagena Protocol, is as follows: 

1. Prior to the intentional transboundary movement of the LMO, the Party of export should notifies, or requires the exporter2 in its jurisdiction to ensure notification, in writing, to the competent national authority3 of the Party of import. The notification should contain the following minimum information4: 

a. Name, address and contact details of the exporter; 

b. Name, address and contact details of the importer5; 

c. Name and identity of the LMO, as well as the domestic classification, if any, of the biosafety level of the LMO in the State of export; 

d. Intended date or dates of the transboundary movement, if known; 

e. Taxonomic status, common name, point of collection or acquisition, and characteristics of recipient organism or parental organisms related to biosafety; 

f. Centers of origin and centers of genetic diversity, if known, of the recipient organism and/or the parental organisms and a description of the habitats where the organisms may persist of proliferate; 

g. Taxonomic status, common name, point of collection or acquisition, and characteristics of the donor organism or organisms related to biosafety;

h. Description of the nucleic acid or the modification introduce, the technique used, and the resulting characteristics of the LMO; 

i. Intended use of the LMO or products thereof, namely, processed materials that are of LMO origin, containing detectable novel combinations of replicable genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology; 

j. Quantity or volume of the LMO to be transferred; 

k. A previous and existing risk assessment consistent with the risk assessment principles and methodology set forth on the Protocol; 

l. Suggested methods for the safe handling, storage, transport and use, including packaging, labeling, documentation, disposal and contingency procedures, where appropriate; 

m. Regulatory status of the LMO within the State of export (for example, whether it is prohibited in the State of export, whether there are other restrictions, or whether it has been approved for general release) and, if the LMO is banned in the State of export, the reason or reasons for the ban; 

n. Result and purpose of any notification by the exporter to other States regarding the LMO to be transferred; and 

o. A declaration that the above-mentioned information is factually correct. 

2. Within ninety days from receipt of the notification, the Party of import acknowledges such receipt in writing. The acknowledgment should state the following: 

a. the date of receipt of the notification; 

b. whether the notification, prima facie, contained the required minimum information listed above; and 

c. whether the notifier should proceed according to the domestic regulatory framework of the Party of import (which must be consistent with the Cartagena Protocol) or according to the Decision Procedure laid down by the Cartagena Protocol itself. 

The failure by the Party of import to acknowledge receipt of a notification within the 90- day period does not imply consent to the transboundary movement. 

3. If the Party of import requires the notifier to comply with the Decision Procedure of the Protocol, then: 

a. within the same period required to acknowledge the notification, the Party of import informs the notifier, in writing, whether the transboundary transfer may proceed either: (a) only after the Party of import has given its written consent; or (b) after no less than ninety days without a subsequent written consent; and 

b. within two hundred seventy days from receipt of notification, the Party of import should communicate, in writing, to the notifier and to the Biosafety Clearing-House6 of its decision: 

:i. approving the import, with or without conditions, including how the decision will apply to subsequent imports of the same LMO; 

:ii. prohibiting the import; or 

:iii. to request additional information in accordance with its domestic regulatory framework or Annex of the Protocol7 

:iv. to extend the 270-day period by a definite period of time. 

Failure by the Party of import to inform the notifier of its decision within the 270-day period does not imply consent to the transboundary movement. 

The Advance Informed Agreement applies only for the first intentional introduction of the LMO into the environment of the Party of import, as is the case when, for instance, the LMO is being imported for use in field trials. It does not apply in instances where the LMO is: 

• in transit; 

• intended for use in a contained facility8 (e.g., laboratory and greenhouse); or 

• intended or for food, feed, or for processing into food or feed,9 which is covered by the separate procedure outline in Box 5.

'''Notes''' 

1 A State or a regional economic integration organization may be Party to the Cartagena Protocol. A “regional economic integration organization” means “an organization constituted by sovereign States of a given region, to which its member States have transferred competence in respect of matters governed by [the] Protocol and which has been duly authorized , in accordance with its international procedures to sign, ratify, accept, approve or accede to it.” (Cartagena Protocol, Art. 4). One, and thus far the only, example for purposes of the Protocol is the European Union. 

2 An “exporter” is “any legal or natural person, under the jurisdiction of the Party of export, who arranges for a living modified organism to be exported.” (Id., Art. 3(d)). 

3 Each party to the Protocol is required to designate one or more competent national authorities that will be responsible for performing the administrative functions required by the Protocol (Art. 19.1). These functions include the receipt of notifications for purposes of the advance informed agreement procedure. 

4 Id., Art. 8.1 and Annex I. 

5 An “importer” is “any legal or natural person, under the jurisdiction of the Party of import, who arranges for a living modified organism to be imported.” (Id., Art. 3(f)). 

6 The Cartagena Protocol established Biosafety Clearing-House to “facilitate the exchange of scientific, technical, environmental and legal information on, and experience with, living modified organisms.” It is also meant to assist the Parties in their implementation of the protocol, “taking into account the special needs of the developing country Parties, in particular the least developed and small island developing States among them, and countries with economies in transition as well as countries that are centers of origin and centers of genetic diversity.” (Art. 20; emphasis supplied) 

7 The number of days that the Party of import has to wait for additional relevant information is not included 

in computing the period within which the Party of import is to respond to the notifier. (Id., Art. 10.3(c)). 

8 Id., Art. 6. 

9 Id., Art. 7.2.}}


:'''Box 5. Procedure for Transboundary Movement of LMOs Intended for Direct Use as Food or Feed, or for Processing'''
{{TextBox|
The Cartagena Protocol requires a Party making a final decision regarding the domestic use (including placement in the market) of a LMO that may be subject to transboundary movement for direct use as food or feed, or for processing, to inform the other parties, through the Biosafety Clearing-House, of its decision within fifteen days therefrom.1 The notification submitted to the Biosafety Clearing-House should contain the following minimum information2: 

a. The name and contact details of the applicant for a decision for domestic use; 

b. The name and contact details of the authority responsible for the decision; 

c. Name and identity of the LMO; 

d. Description of the gene modification, the technique used, and the resulting characteristics of the LMO; 

e. Any unique identification of the LMO; 

f. Taxonomic status, common name, point of collection or acquisition, and characteristics of recipient organism or parental organisms related to biosafety; 

g. Centers of origin and centers of genetic diversity, if known, of the recipient organism and/or the parental organisms and a description of the habitats where the organisms may persist of proliferate; 

h. Taxonomic status, common name, point of collection or acquisition, and characteristics of the donor organism or organisms related to biosafety; 

i. Approved uses of the LMO; 

j. A risk assessment report consistent with Annex III of the Protocol 

k. Suggested methods for the safe handling, storage, transport and use, including packaging, labeling, documentation, disposal and contingency procedures, where appropriate;

However, a Party may decide to regulate the importation of LMOs intended for direct use as food or feed, or for processing, under its domestic regulatory framework, provided that it is consistent with the Protocol.3 If a developing country Party has no such domestic regulatory framework, and in the exercise of its domestic jurisdiction, it may declare through the Biosafety Clearing-House that its decision prior to the first import of a LMO intended for direct use as food or feed, or for processing, will be taken according to (i) a risk assessment undertaken in accordance with Annex III of the Protocol; and (ii) a decision made within a predictable timeframe, not exceeding two hundred and seventy days.4 Failure by the developing country to communicate its decision within the said period does not imply consent or refusal to the import of the LMO, unless it is otherwise specified by such country.5

== What is the Codex Alimentarius Commission? ==
Food standard setting at the international level is done by the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC). This is an intergovernmental body established to protect consumer health and ensure fair practices in the food trade. The 23rd Session of the CAC, held in 1999, agreed to create an Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Task Force for Foods Derived from Biotechnology to develop standards, guidelines and recommendations regarding the safety and nutritional aspects of genetically modified foods.

The elaboration of food standards by the CAC follows a step-wise procedure, as shown below:


Step 1: Authorization of the elaboration of a text as new work

Step 2: Preparation of a proposed draft

Step 3: Circulation of the proposed draft for comments by governments and observers

Step 4: Consideration of the proposed draft by a Committee or a Task Force

Step 5: Provisional adoption as a draft by the CAC

Step 6: Circulation of the draft for comments by governments and observers

Step 7: Consideration of the draft by a Committee or a Task Force

Step 8: Final adoption by the CAC70

Once a text is adopted at Step 8, it is given the status of an international benchmark under the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement. While the SPS Agreement requires its Members to base their risk management measures on scientific risk assessment, Members applying recognized international standards such as those of the Codex Alimentarius are deemed to be in compliance with their obligations under the SPS Agreement. There is thus a strong incentive for governments to use Codex standards as a basis for national regulations. In doing so, they can strengthen their food control system while avoiding unnecessary trade disputes.

The Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Task Force for Foods Derived from Biotechnology has recently released, at Step 8 of the Elaboration Procedure, the “Draft Principles for the Risk Analysis of Foods Derived from Modern Biotechnology” and the “Draft Guideline for the Conduct of Food Safety Assessment of Foods Derived from Recombinant-DNA Plants”. Both documents are available at www.codexalimentarius.com, and countries wishing to regulate GM foods are well advised to review them.

== What is the Technical Barriers to Trade (“TBT”) Agreement? ==

The TBT Agreement is one of the agreements under the administrative supervision of the WTO. It recognizes that countries should not be prevented from taking regulatory measures necessary to pursue various “legitimate objectives” such as, inter alia, national security requirements, the prevention of deceptive practices, and protection of human health or safety of animal or plant life or the environment. Governments are, however, required to apply technical regulations and standards in a non-discriminatory manner and ensure that they do not restrict trade.

The TBT Agreement incorporates a fundamental principle of general trade law that is relevant to products of modern biotechnology: “like” products should be similarly treated. The intention is to avoid applying different regulatory measures to products with similar characteristics on the ground that they have been produced differently. This is designed to avoid arbitrary and deliberate discrimination against imported products which, although similar, may have been produced with techniques different from those used for domestically produced products. However, there is as yet no formal interpretation as to whether, under the TBT Agreement, products produced using modern biotechnology are “like” their conventional counterparts.

== What is the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement? ==

The SPS Agreement, like the TBT Agreement, is one of the WTO agreements. It applies to all sanitary and phytosanitary measures that may affect international trade. Sanitary and phytosanitary measures are international standards or regulations established to protect human, animal or plant health on quarantine and food safety grounds and cover such concerns as the presence of microbial contaminants, toxins, heavy metals and pesticide residues in food and quarantine risks posed by pests weeds and pathogens that are applied domestically.

In the context of trade in agricultural products, these measures are to be applied only to the extent necessary to protect human life or health and “to protect human life or health from the risk arising from additives, contaminants, toxin or disease causing organisms in foods.” The SPS Agreement removes the right of countries to arbitrarily restrict access to markets on health and safety grounds. It also calls on members to harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary measures on a global basis by adopting international standard guidelines and recommendations, where these exist. Sufficient scientific evidence must be provided if members wish to maintain SPS measures at levels above relevant international standards.

The scientific requirement of the SPS Agreement is important because it provides a more objective approach in determining what is a justified trade restriction and what is hidden protectionism. On the other hand, the agreement may seem inadequate to tackle restrictions introduced on the basis of consumer sentiments in relation to food production methods such as genetic engineering.

When scientific evidence is unavailable or insufficient for a final judgment about the safety of a product or process to be made, Article 5.7 of the SPS Agreement explicitly allows WTO member states to take precautionary measures based on available pertinent information. Members are, however, obliged to seek additional information so that a more objective evaluation of the risks related to the relevant product or process can be made within a reasonable period of time.{{gtpcite|71}}</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pre-emergent herbicides are substances applied to the soil that prevent the successful germination of weed seeds. Timing is important when using these, as the applicator needs to know when to apply them: if applied too early, they may lose their effectiveness by the time weeds are germinating, if applied too late the weeds will already have grown beyond the point where they are vulnerable to this treatment.

'''Multiflora Rose''' ('''''Rosa multiflora'''''), is a species of rose native to China, Japan and Korea, but also present in other parts of the world as an invasive weed. It is particularly problematic for wooded areas and meadows because of its dense growth and copious thorns which make removal difficult.

It is a scrambling shrub climbing over other plants to a height of 3-5 m or sometimes higher in trees, with stout stems with recurved thorns. The leaves are 5-10 cm long, compound, with 5-9 leaflets and feathered stipules. The flowers are produced in long panicles, each flower small, 1.5-4 cm diameter, white or pink, borne in early summer. The hips are reddish to purple, 6-8 mm diameter.

==Ecology==
In eastern North America, Multiflora Rose has become an invasive species, though it was originally planted as a soil conservation measure and as a wildlife attracting plant. It is readily distinguished from American native roses by its flower or seed heads, which bear multiple flowers and hips, often more than a dozen, while the native species bear only one or a few on a branch.

Over time this plant has become a serious ecological problem because of its ability to grow in diverse light, soil, and moisture conditions, and because its seeds are widely broadcast by birds. Once established, it forms nearly impenetrable thickets that displace native understory plants and can become a fire hazard in wilderness areas. Some places classify Multiflora rose as a &quot;noxious weed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nps.gov/plants/alien/fact/romu1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. In grazing areas, this rose is generally considered to be a serious pest, though it is considered excellent fodder for goats.

==Uses==
[[Image:Rosa mulitflora berries.jpg|thumb|Rosa multiflora hips]]
Multiflora Rose is grown as an ornamental plant, and also used as a rootstock for grafting ornamental rose cultivars.

==Control==
Because of the thorny, tough nature of this plant, heavy equipment duch as tractors or backhoes are often employed where possible. 

{{weedcontrol|
| Mowing    = Consistent mowing will exhaust the plant over time
| Coppicing  = Coppicing is effective
| Grinding  = Some resprouting from outer roots may occur
| Pulling  = Pulling is effective, though thorns make it difficult. Thorns may be simply removed from the lower part of the stems to allow for a good grip.
| Flame  = Controlled brush fires will burn the plants down, but does not kill the roots.
| Barriers  = Strong sprouts may lift or puncture through all but the heaviest barriers
| Solarization  = Solarization is not recommended, as the sprouts may rupture the plastic
| Systemic herbicides (synthetic)  = Glyphosate is effective after several treatments
| Grazing  = Goats avidly graze on multiflora rose, and are an effective control over the long term.
| Disposal  = Chipping is not recommended because the curved thorns easily grab clothing or skin as they are pulled into the chipper. Composting takes a considerable amount of time unless chipped or shredded. When dry, multiflora rose is extremely flammable, and so should not be burned during very dry periods. During the winter months, multiflora rose can be used as a brush hay for goats.

==Part A: Description==

In this lesson you will learn to introduce yourself using the standard level of formality or respect. You will also be able to ask someone his name.

First you need to know that the verb ''to be'' is never expressed in Kapampangan. Where there is no verb, it is automatically assumed that the sentence is about something ''being'' something. 
Therefore to ask ''What is your name'', you only need to know the words &quot;What your name?&quot;. Here they are:

{| 
| style=&quot;width:100px&quot; |'''nánu'''|| ''what''
|-
| '''lagyú' ''' || ''name''
|-
| '''mu''' || ''your''
|}

However you also need the article ''the''. This is because Kapampangan literally say ''What is the name your?''

'''Nánu ing lagyú' mu''' or '''Nánung lagyú' mu'''.

The phrase '''nánu ing''', meaning ''what the'' is obviously a very frequent combination. It has evolved into an aggregated word, which is '''nánung'''. It means exactly '''nánu ing''', but is much easier to pronounce and therefore more common.

Note that mu is placed after the name it modifies. This is always the case: possessive pronouns are always placed after the possessed thing.

If your name is George, the answer is '''Áku y George'''

'''Áku''' simply means ''I'' or ''me''. When this word is not at the begining of a sentence, it can be abbreviated into '''ku'''.

'''y''' is an article reserved in the case that the word that follows is a name. It is compulsory unless you are calling someone.

Then you might want to say ''Nice to meet you''. In Kapampangan, the expression used is ''Happy me knowing you''.
We will therefore need 3 more words:

{|
| style=&quot;width:100px&quot; | '''masayá'''|| ''happy''
|-
| '''akilála''' || ''to know''
|-
| '''íka''', '''ka''' || ''you''
|}

Again we see here that the pronoun ''you'', '''íka''', can be abbreviated into '''ka'''. Abbreviation of pronouns is frequent in Kapampangan, we will see more of that in later lessons.

So the phrase ''Happy me to know you'' is '''Masayá áku ing akilála íka''', but Kapampangans are more likely to say '''Masayá ku ing akilála ka'''.

'''ing''' is indicating that '''akilála'''  is a noun, it basically means ''the knowledge of''. 
'''ku ing''', like '''nánu ing''', has evolved into an aggregated word, which is '''kung'''. It means exactly '''áku ing''', but is easier to pronounce and therefore more common.

So the final sentence becomes '''Masayá kung akilála ka'''.

We have just one more words to learn, which is essential in every situation: '''wa'''  ''yes''

==Part B: Application==

It is George's first interview for a job after leaving university. He has an appointment with a future colleague, Kevin, that is in the team he will be working with, and Bob, his future boss. Kevin is of the same age as George, but Bob is a 50 year old professional.  

Try to understand the conversation below between George and Kevin. 

{|

|colspan=2|&lt;font color=gray&gt; Kevin arrives into the room and shakes George's hand.&lt;/font&gt;
|- 
||&lt;font color=gray&gt; George &lt;/font&gt; || - Mayáp a yábak. 
|-
||&lt;font color=gray&gt; Kevin &lt;/font&gt; || - Mayáp a yábak, nánung lagyú' mu? 
|-
||&lt;font color=gray&gt; George &lt;/font&gt; || - Áku y George, íka y Kevin? 
|-
||&lt;font color=gray&gt; Kevin &lt;/font&gt; || - Wa, áku, Masayá kung akilála ra ka, George. 
|-
||&lt;font color=gray&gt; George &lt;/font&gt; || - Komustá, Kevin, masayá kung akilála ra ka.
|- 
|colspan=2|&lt;font color=gray&gt; Bob enters the room &lt;/font&gt; ||
|}

Let us stop here for a second and analyse, sentence by sentence, what is happening.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- bgcolor=&quot;#EFEFEF;&quot; 
!Speaker
!Kapampangan
!English translation
!Very literally
!Comment
|-
||George || Mayáp a yábak pu. ||''Good morning'' || Good morning. || George and Kevin are of the same age and do not feel that they need to speak using the most respectful language together, therefore, '''pu''' is not used here.
|-
||Kevin || Mayáp a yábak, nánung lagyú' mu? ||''Good morning, what is your name?'' || Good morning, what the name yours? || 
|-
||George || Áku y George, íka y Kevin? ||''My name is George, and are you Kevin?'' || I George, You &lt;name&gt;Kevin? ||  '''y''' should be used in front of each name, except when the name is used to call someone. 
|-
||Kevin || Wa, áku, masayá kung akilála ra ka, George. || ''Yes, I am, nice to meet you, George.'' || Yes, me, happy me to know you, George || Note that ''I am'' is simply '''áku''', since the verb ''to be'' is never expressed.
|-
||George || Komustá, Kevin, masayá kung akilála ra ka. ||''Hi, Kevin, nice to meet you.'' || ''Hi/How are you, Kevin. Happy me to know you'' || This time the name &quot;Kevin&quot; is used to ''call'' Kevin, and the '''y''' is not required.
|}

==Part C: Exercises==

Write the following conversation in Kapampangan and then read it aloud:

*Try to indroduce yourself to a person of you age that you meet in a party.
*Express how nice it is to meet them.
*Ask them what is their name.

{{audio|Pam-ph-introduction and greeting conversation.ogg|Listen to the above conversation in Kapampangan}}

==Part D: Summary==

You now know how to introduce yourself in Kapampangan. Also you have learned the following new words and phrases:

{|
| style=&quot;width:150px&quot; | wa || ''yes''
|- 
|| nánu'''|| ''what''
|-
|| mu || ''your''
|-
|| áku, ku || ''I'' or ''me''
|-
|| íka, ka || ''you''
|-
|| lagyú' ''' || ''name''
|-
|| masayá || ''happy''
|-
|| akilála || ''to know''
|-
|| masayá kung akilála ka || ''nice to meet you''
|-
|| y || an article reserved for names.
|}


And you have learned the following grammar rules:

* '''íka''' can be abbreviated into '''ka''', and '''áku''' into '''ku''' 
* The prepositions '''nánu''' and '''ku''' can be merged with '''ing''', thus giving '''nánung''' and '''kung'''.
* Possessive pronouns are always placed after the possessed thing.

==Part A: Description==

Distinction between inclusive we and exclusive we is required in Kapampangan. Inclusive &quot;we&quot; specifically includes the addressees (that is, one of the words for &quot;we&quot; means &quot;you and I&quot;), while exclusive &quot;we&quot; specifically excludes them (that is, another word for &quot;we&quot; means &quot;them and I, but not you&quot;), regardless of who else may be involved.

ikata (dual inclusive),
ikatamu (plural inclusive), 
and ikami (exclusive).

==Part B: Application==

==Part C: Exercises==

==Part D: Summary==

You now know how to use the various Kapampangan translations of &quot;We&quot;. Also you have learned the following new words and phrases:

{|
| Kap. word 1 || Eng. trans 1
|-
| word 2 || trans 2
|}

==Part E: Formal description==

In linguistics, clusivity is a distinction between inclusive and exclusive first-person pronouns and verbal morphology, also called inclusive &quot;we&quot; and exclusive &quot;we&quot;. Inclusive &quot;we&quot; specifically includes the addressees (that is, one of the words for &quot;we&quot; means &quot;you and I&quot;), while exclusive &quot;we&quot; specifically excludes them (that is, another word for &quot;we&quot; means &quot;he/she/they and I, but not you&quot;), regardless of who else may be involved.


Clusivity paradigms may be summarized as a two-by-two grid (this grid addresses only plural forms): 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | !! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Includes the addressee?
|-
! Yes !! No
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Includes&lt;br /&gt;the speaker?
! Yes
|Inclusive we||Exclusive we
|-
! No
|2nd person||3rd person
|}

==Federalist No. 41==
Federalist No. 41 is titled ''&quot;General View of the Powers Conferred by the Constitution&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by James Madison.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE Constitution proposed by the convention may be considered under two general points of view. The FIRST relates to the sum or quantity of power which it vests in the government, including the restraints imposed on the States. The SECOND, to the particular structure of the government, and the distribution of this power among its several branches. Under the FIRST view of the subject, two important questions arise: 1. Whether any part of the powers transferred to the general government be unnecessary or improper? 2. Whether the entire mass of them be dangerous to the portion of jurisdiction left in the several States? Is the aggregate power of the general government greater than ought to have been vested in it? This is the FIRST question. It cannot have escaped those who have attended with candor to the arguments employed against the extensive powers of the government, that the authors of them have very little considered how far these powers were necessary means of attaining a necessary end. They have chosen rather to dwell on the inconveniences which must be unavoidably blended with all political advantages; and on the possible abuses which must be incident to every power or trust, of which a beneficial use can be made. This method of handling the subject cannot impose on the good sense of the people of America. It may display the subtlety of the writer; it may open a boundless field for rhetoric and declamation; it may inflame the passions of the unthinking, and may confirm the prejudices of the misthinking: but cool and candid people will at once reflect, that the purest of human blessings must have a portion of alloy in them; that the choice must always be made, if not of the lesser evil, at least of the GREATER, not the PERFECT, good; and that in every political institution, a power to advance the public happiness involves a discretion which may be misapplied and abused. They will see, therefore, that in all cases where power is to be conferred, the point first to be decided is, whether such a power be necessary to the public good; as the next will be, in case of an affirmative decision, to guard as effectually as possible against a perversion of the power to the public detriment. That we may form a correct judgment on this subject, it will be proper to review the several powers conferred on the government of the Union; and that this may be the more conveniently done they may be reduced into different classes as they relate to the following different objects: 1. Security against foreign danger; 2. Regulation of the intercourse with foreign nations; 3. Maintenance of harmony and proper intercourse among the States; 4. Certain miscellaneous objects of general utility; 5. Restraint of the States from certain injurious acts; 6. Provisions for giving due efficacy to all these powers. The powers falling within the FIRST class are those of declaring war and granting letters of marque; of providing armies and fleets; of regulating and calling forth the militia; of levying and borrowing money. Security against foreign danger is one of the primitive objects of civil society. It is an avowed and essential object of the American Union. The powers requisite for attaining it must be effectually confided to the federal councils. Is the power of declaring war necessary? No man will answer this question in the negative. It would be superfluous, therefore, to enter into a proof of the affirmative. The existing Confederation establishes this power in the most ample form. Is the power of raising armies and equipping fleets necessary? This is involved in the foregoing power. It is involved in the power of self-defense. But was it necessary to give an INDEFINITE POWER of raising TROOPS, as well as providing fleets; and of maintaining both in PEACE, as well as in war? The answer to these questions has been too far anticipated in another place to admit an extensive discussion of them in this place. The answer indeed seems to be so obvious and conclusive as scarcely to justify such a discussion in any place. With what color of propriety could the force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit the force of offense? If a federal Constitution could chain the ambition or set bounds to the exertions of all other nations, then indeed might it prudently chain the discretion of its own government, and set bounds to the exertions for its own safety.''

''How could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely prohibited, unless we could prohibit, in like manner, the preparations and establishments of every hostile nation? The means of security can only be regulated by the means and the danger of attack. They will, in fact, be ever determined by these rules, and by no others. It is in vain to oppose constitutional barriers to the impulse of self-preservation. It is worse than in vain; because it plants in the Constitution itself necessary usurpations of power, every precedent of which is a germ of unnecessary and multiplied repetitions. If one nation maintains constantly a disciplined army, ready for the service of ambition or revenge, it obliges the most pacific nations who may be within the reach of its enterprises to take corresponding precautions.''

''The fifteenth century was the unhappy epoch of military establishments in the time of peace. They were introduced by Charles VII. of France. All Europe has followed, or been forced into, the example. Had the example not been followed by other nations, all Europe must long ago have worn the chains of a universal monarch. Were every nation except France now to disband its peace establishments, the same event might follow. The veteran legions of Rome were an overmatch for the undisciplined valor of all other nations and rendered her the mistress of the world. Not the less true is it, that the liberties of Rome proved the final victim to her military triumphs; and that the liberties of Europe, as far as they ever existed, have, with few exceptions, been the price of her military establishments. A standing force, therefore, is a dangerous, at the same time that it may be a necessary, provision. On the smallest scale it has its inconveniences. On an extensive scale its consequences may be fatal. On any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection and precaution. A wise nation will combine all these considerations; and, whilst it does not rashly preclude itself from any resource which may become essential to its safety, will exert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the danger of resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its liberties. The clearest marks of this prudence are stamped on the proposed Constitution. The Union itself, which it cements and secures, destroys every pretext for a military establishment which could be dangerous. America united, with a handful of troops, or without a single soldier, exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign ambition than America disunited, with a hundred thousand veterans ready for combat. It was remarked, on a former occasion, that the want of this pretext had saved the liberties of one nation in Europe. Being rendered by her insular situation and her maritime resources impregnable to the armies of her neighbors, the rulers of Great Britain have never been able, by real or artificial dangers, to cheat the public into an extensive peace establishment. The distance of the United States from the powerful nations of the world gives them the same happy security. A dangerous establishment can never be necessary or plausible, so long as they continue a united people. But let it never, for a moment, be forgotten that they are indebted for this advantage to the Union alone. The moment of its dissolution will be the date of a new order of things. The fears of the weaker, or the ambition of the stronger States, or Confederacies, will set the same example in the New, as Charles VII. did in the Old World. The example will be followed here from the same motives which produced universal imitation there. Instead of deriving from our situation the precious advantage which Great Britain has derived from hers, the face of America will be but a copy of that of the continent of Europe. It will present liberty everywhere crushed between standing armies and perpetual taxes. The fortunes of disunited America will be even more disastrous than those of Europe. The sources of evil in the latter are confined to her own limits. No superior powers of another quarter of the globe intrigue among her rival nations, inflame their mutual animosities, and render them the instruments of foreign ambition, jealousy, and revenge. In America the miseries springing from her internal jealousies, contentions, and wars, would form a part only of her lot. A plentiful addition of evils would have their source in that relation in which Europe stands to this quarter of the earth, and which no other quarter of the earth bears to Europe. This picture of the consequences of disunion cannot be too highly colored, or too often exhibited. Every man who loves peace, every man who loves his country, every man who loves liberty, ought to have it ever before his eyes, that he may cherish in his heart a due attachment to the Union of America, and be able to set a due value on the means of preserving it.''

''Next to the effectual establishment of the Union, the best possible precaution against danger from standing armies is a limitation of the term for which revenue may be appropriated to their support. This precaution the Constitution has prudently added. I will not repeat here the observations which I flatter myself have placed this subject in a just and satisfactory light. But it may not be improper to take notice of an argument against this part of the Constitution, which has been drawn from the policy and practice of Great Britain. It is said that the continuance of an army in that kingdom requires an annual vote of the legislature; whereas the American Constitution has lengthened this critical period to two years. This is the form in which the comparison is usually stated to the public: but is it a just form? Is it a fair comparison? Does the British Constitution restrain the parliamentary discretion to one year? Does the American impose on the Congress appropriations for two years? On the contrary, it cannot be unknown to the authors of the fallacy themselves, that the British Constitution fixes no limit whatever to the discretion of the legislature, and that the American ties down the legislature to two years, as the longest admissible term. Had the argument from the British example been truly stated, it would have stood thus: The term for which supplies may be appropriated to the army establishment, though unlimited by the British Constitution, has nevertheless, in practice, been limited by parliamentary discretion to a single year. Now, if in Great Britain, where the House of Commons is elected for seven years; where so great a proportion of the members are elected by so small a proportion of the people; where the electors are so corrupted by the representatives, and the representatives so corrupted by the Crown, the representative body can possess a power to make appropriations to the army for an indefinite term, without desiring, or without daring, to extend the term beyond a single year, ought not suspicion herself to blush, in pretending that the representatives of the United States, elected FREELY by the WHOLE BODY of the people, every SECOND YEAR, cannot be safely intrusted with the discretion over such appropriations, expressly limited to the short period of TWO YEARS? A bad cause seldom fails to betray itself. Of this truth, the management of the opposition to the federal government is an unvaried exemplification. But among all the blunders which have been committed, none is more striking than the attempt to enlist on that side the prudent jealousy entertained by the people, of standing armies. The attempt has awakened fully the public attention to that important subject; and has led to investigations which must terminate in a thorough and universal conviction, not only that the constitution has provided the most effectual guards against danger from that quarter, but that nothing short of a Constitution fully adequate to the national defense and the preservation of the Union, can save America from as many standing armies as it may be split into States or Confederacies, and from such a progressive augmentation, of these establishments in each, as will render them as burdensome to the properties and ominous to the liberties of the people, as any establishment that can become necessary, under a united and efficient government, must be tolerable to the former and safe to the latter. The palpable necessity of the power to provide and maintain a navy has protected that part of the Constitution against a spirit of censure, which has spared few other parts. It must, indeed, be numbered among the greatest blessings of America, that as her Union will be the only source of her maritime strength, so this will be a principal source of her security against danger from abroad. In this respect our situation bears another likeness to the insular advantage of Great Britain. The batteries most capable of repelling foreign enterprises on our safety, are happily such as can never be turned by a perfidious government against our liberties. The inhabitants of the Atlantic frontier are all of them deeply interested in this provision for naval protection, and if they have hitherto been suffered to sleep quietly in their beds; if their property has remained safe against the predatory spirit of licentious adventurers; if their maritime towns have not yet been compelled to ransom themselves from the terrors of a conflagration, by yielding to the exactions of daring and sudden invaders, these instances of good fortune are not to be ascribed to the capacity of the existing government for the protection of those from whom it claims allegiance, but to causes that are fugitive and fallacious. If we except perhaps Virginia and Maryland, which are peculiarly vulnerable on their eastern frontiers, no part of the Union ought to feel more anxiety on this subject than New York. Her seacoast is extensive. A very important district of the State is an island. The State itself is penetrated by a large navigable river for more than fifty leagues. The great emporium of its commerce, the great reservoir of its wealth, lies every moment at the mercy of events, and may almost be regarded as a hostage for ignominious compliances with the dictates of a foreign enemy, or even with the rapacious demands of pirates and barbarians. Should a war be the result of the precarious situation of European affairs, and all the unruly passions attending it be let loose on the ocean, our escape from insults and depredations, not only on that element, but every part of the other bordering on it, will be truly miraculous. In the present condition of America, the States more immediately exposed to these calamities have nothing to hope from the phantom of a general government which now exists; and if their single resources were equal to the task of fortifying themselves against the danger, the object to be protected would be almost consumed by the means of protecting them. The power of regulating and calling forth the militia has been already sufficiently vindicated and explained. The power of levying and borrowing money, being the sinew of that which is to be exerted in the national defense, is properly thrown into the same class with it. This power, also, has been examined already with much attention, and has, I trust, been clearly shown to be necessary, both in the extent and form given to it by the Constitution. I will address one additional reflection only to those who contend that the power ought to have been restrained to external taxation by which they mean, taxes on articles imported from other countries. It cannot be doubted that this will always be a valuable source of revenue; that for a considerable time it must be a principal source; that at this moment it is an essential one. But we may form very mistaken ideas on this subject, if we do not call to mind in our calculations, that the extent of revenue drawn from foreign commerce must vary with the variations, both in the extent and the kind of imports; and that these variations do not correspond with the progress of population, which must be the general measure of the public wants. As long as agriculture continues the sole field of labor, the importation of manufactures must increase as the consumers multiply. As soon as domestic manufactures are begun by the hands not called for by agriculture, the imported manufactures will decrease as the numbers of people increase. In a more remote stage, the imports may consist in a considerable part of raw materials, which will be wrought into articles for exportation, and will, therefore, require rather the encouragement of bounties, than to be loaded with discouraging duties. A system of government, meant for duration, ought to contemplate these revolutions, and be able to accommodate itself to them. Some, who have not denied the necessity of the power of taxation, have grounded a very fierce attack against the Constitution, on the language in which it is defined. It has been urged and echoed, that the power &quot;to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States,&quot; amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general welfare. No stronger proof could be given of the distress under which these writers labor for objections, than their stooping to such a misconstruction. Had no other enumeration or definition of the powers of the Congress been found in the Constitution, than the general expressions just cited, the authors of the objection might have had some color for it; though it would have been difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describing an authority to legislate in all possible cases. A power to destroy the freedom of the press, the trial by jury, or even to regulate the course of descents, or the forms of conveyances, must be very singularly expressed by the terms &quot;to raise money for the general welfare. &quot;But what color can the objection have, when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows, and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon? If the different parts of the same instrument ought to be so expounded, as to give meaning to every part which will bear it, shall one part of the same sentence be excluded altogether from a share in the meaning; and shall the more doubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent, and the clear and precise expressions be denied any signification whatsoever? For what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers be inserted, if these and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power? Nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars. But the idea of an enumeration of particulars which neither explain nor qualify the general meaning, and can have no other effect than to confound and mislead, is an absurdity, which, as we are reduced to the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the objection or on the authors of the Constitution, we must take the liberty of supposing, had not its origin with the latter. The objection here is the more extraordinary, as it appears that the language used by the convention is a copy from the articles of Confederation. The objects of the Union among the States, as described in article third, are &quot;their common defense, security of their liberties, and mutual and general welfare. &quot; The terms of article eighth are still more identical: &quot;All charges of war and all other expenses that shall be incurred for the common defense or general welfare, and allowed by the United States in Congress, shall be defrayed out of a common treasury,&quot; etc. A similar language again occurs in article ninth. Construe either of these articles by the rules which would justify the construction put on the new Constitution, and they vest in the existing Congress a power to legislate in all cases whatsoever.''

''But what would have been thought of that assembly, if, attaching themselves to these general expressions, and disregarding the specifications which ascertain and limit their import, they had exercised an unlimited power of providing for the common defense and general welfare? I appeal to the objectors themselves, whether they would in that case have employed the same reasoning in justification of Congress as they now make use of against the convention. How difficult it is for error to escape its own condemnation!''

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE SECOND class of powers, lodged in the general government, consists of those which regulate the intercourse with foreign nations, to wit: to make treaties; to send and receive ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations; to regulate foreign commerce, including a power to prohibit, after the year 1808, the importation of slaves, and to lay an intermediate duty of ten dollars per head, as a discouragement to such importations. This class of powers forms an obvious and essential branch of the federal administration. If we are to be one nation in any respect, it clearly ought to be in respect to other nations. The powers to make treaties and to send and receive ambassadors, speak their own propriety. Both of them are comprised in the articles of Confederation, with this difference only, that the former is disembarrassed, by the plan of the convention, of an exception, under which treaties might be substantially frustrated by regulations of the States; and that a power of appointing and receiving &quot;other public ministers and consuls,&quot; is expressly and very properly added to the former provision concerning ambassadors. The term ambassador, if taken strictly, as seems to be required by the second of the articles of Confederation, comprehends the highest grade only of public ministers, and excludes the grades which the United States will be most likely to prefer, where foreign embassies may be necessary. And under no latitude of construction will the term comprehend consuls. Yet it has been found expedient, and has been the practice of Congress, to employ the inferior grades of public ministers, and to send and receive consuls. It is true, that where treaties of commerce stipulate for the mutual appointment of consuls, whose functions are connected with commerce, the admission of foreign consuls may fall within the power of making commercial treaties; and that where no such treaties exist, the mission of American consuls into foreign countries may PERHAPS be covered under the authority, given by the ninth article of the Confederation, to appoint all such civil officers as may be necessary for managing the general affairs of the United States. But the admission of consuls into the United States, where no previous treaty has stipulated it, seems to have been nowhere provided for. A supply of the omission is one of the lesser instances in which the convention have improved on the model before them. But the most minute provisions become important when they tend to obviate the necessity or the pretext for gradual and unobserved usurpations of power. A list of the cases in which Congress have been betrayed, or forced by the defects of the Confederation, into violations of their chartered authorities, would not a little surprise those who have paid no attention to the subject; and would be no inconsiderable argument in favor of the new Constitution, which seems to have provided no less studiously for the lesser, than the more obvious and striking defects of the old. The power to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations, belongs with equal propriety to the general government, and is a still greater improvement on the articles of Confederation. These articles contain no provision for the case of offenses against the law of nations; and consequently leave it in the power of any indiscreet member to embroil the Confederacy with foreign nations. The provision of the federal articles on the subject of piracies and felonies extends no further than to the establishment of courts for the trial of these offenses. The definition of piracies might, perhaps, without inconveniency, be left to the law of nations; though a legislative definition of them is found in most municipal codes.''

''A definition of felonies on the high seas is evidently requisite. Felony is a term of loose signification, even in the common law of England; and of various import in the statute law of that kingdom. But neither the common nor the statute law of that, or of any other nation, ought to be a standard for the proceedings of this, unless previously made its own by legislative adoption. The meaning of the term, as defined in the codes of the several States, would be as impracticable as the former would be a dishonorable and illegitimate guide. It is not precisely the same in any two of the States; and varies in each with every revision of its criminal laws. For the sake of certainty and uniformity, therefore, the power of defining felonies in this case was in every respect necessary and proper.''

''The regulation of foreign commerce, having fallen within several views which have been taken of this subject, has been too fully discussed to need additional proofs here of its being properly submitted to the federal administration. It were doubtless to be wished, that the power of prohibiting the importation of slaves had not been postponed until the year 1808, or rather that it had been suffered to have immediate operation. But it is not difficult to account, either for this restriction on the general government, or for the manner in which the whole clause is expressed. It ought to be considered as a great point gained in favor of humanity, that a period of twenty years may terminate forever, within these States, a traffic which has so long and so loudly upbraided the barbarism of modern policy; that within that period, it will receive a considerable discouragement from the federal government, and may be totally abolished, by a concurrence of the few States which continue the unnatural traffic, in the prohibitory example which has been given by so great a majority of the Union. Happy would it be for the unfortunate Africans, if an equal prospect lay before them of being redeemed from the oppressions of their European brethren!''

''Attempts have been made to pervert this clause into an objection against the Constitution, by representing it on one side as a criminal toleration of an illicit practice, and on another as calculated to prevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from Europe to America. I mention these misconstructions, not with a view to give them an answer, for they deserve none, but as specimens of the manner and spirit in which some have thought fit to conduct their opposition to the proposed government. The powers included in the THIRD class are those which provide for the harmony and proper intercourse among the States. Under this head might be included the particular restraints imposed on the authority of the States, and certain powers of the judicial department; but the former are reserved for a distinct class, and the latter will be particularly examined when we arrive at the structure and organization of the government. I shall confine myself to a cursory review of the remaining powers comprehended under this third description, to wit: to regulate commerce among the several States and the Indian tribes; to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin; to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the current coin and secureties of the United States; to fix the standard of weights and measures; to establish a uniform rule of naturalization, and uniform laws of bankruptcy, to prescribe the manner in which the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of each State shall be proved, and the effect they shall have in other States; and to establish post offices and post roads. The defect of power in the existing Confederacy to regulate the commerce between its several members, is in the number of those which have been clearly pointed out by experience. To the proofs and remarks which former papers have brought into view on this subject, it may be added that without this supplemental provision, the great and essential power of regulating foreign commerce would have been incomplete and ineffectual. A very material object of this power was the relief of the States which import and export through other States, from the improper contributions levied on them by the latter. Were these at liberty to regulate the trade between State and State, it must be foreseen that ways would be found out to load the articles of import and export, during the passage through their jurisdiction, with duties which would fall on the makers of the latter and the consumers of the former. We may be assured by past experience, that such a practice would be introduced by future contrivances; and both by that and a common knowledge of human affairs, that it would nourish unceasing animosities, and not improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public tranquillity. To those who do not view the question through the medium of passion or of interest, the desire of the commercial States to collect, in any form, an indirect revenue from their uncommercial neighbors, must appear not less impolitic than it is unfair; since it would stimulate the injured party, by resentment as well as interest, to resort to less convenient channels for their foreign trade. But the mild voice of reason, pleading the cause of an enlarged and permanent interest, is but too often drowned, before public bodies as well as individuals, by the clamors of an impatient avidity for immediate and immoderate gain. The necessity of a superintending authority over the reciprocal trade of confederated States, has been illustrated by other examples as well as our own. In Switzerland, where the Union is so very slight, each canton is obliged to allow to merchandises a passage through its jurisdiction into other cantons, without an augmentation of the tolls. In Germany it is a law of the empire, that the princes and states shall not lay tolls or customs on bridges, rivers, or passages, without the consent of the emperor and the diet; though it appears from a quotation in an antecedent paper, that the practice in this, as in many other instances in that confederacy, has not followed the law, and has produced there the mischiefs which have been foreseen here. Among the restraints imposed by the Union of the Netherlands on its members, one is, that they shall not establish imposts disadvantageous to their neighbors, without the general permission. The regulation of commerce with the Indian tribes is very properly unfettered from two limitations in the articles of Confederation, which render the provision obscure and contradictory. The power is there restrained to Indians, not members of any of the States, and is not to violate or infringe the legislative right of any State within its own limits. What description of Indians are to be deemed members of a State, is not yet settled, and has been a question of frequent perplexity and contention in the federal councils. And how the trade with Indians, though not members of a State, yet residing within its legislative jurisdiction, can be regulated by an external authority, without so far intruding on the internal rights of legislation, is absolutely incomprehensible. This is not the only case in which the articles of Confederation have inconsiderately endeavored to accomplish impossibilities; to reconcile a partial sovereignty in the Union, with complete sovereignty in the States; to subvert a mathematical axiom, by taking away a part, and letting the whole remain. All that need be remarked on the power to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, is, that by providing for this last case, the Constitution has supplied a material omission in the articles of Confederation. The authority of the existing Congress is restrained to the regulation of coin STRUCK by their own authority, or that of the respective States. It must be seen at once that the proposed uniformity in the VALUE of the current coin might be destroyed by subjecting that of foreign coin to the different regulations of the different States. The punishment of counterfeiting the public securities, as well as the current coin, is submitted of course to that authority which is to secure the value of both. The regulation of weights and measures is transferred from the articles of Confederation, and is founded on like considerations with the preceding power of regulating coin.''

''The dissimilarity in the rules of naturalization has long been remarked as a fault in our system, and as laying a foundation for intricate and delicate questions. In the fourth article of the Confederation, it is declared &quot;that the FREE INHABITANTS of each of these States, paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice, excepted, shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of FREE CITIZENS in the several States; and THE PEOPLE of each State shall, in every other, enjoy all the privileges of trade and commerce,&quot; etc. There is a confusion of language here, which is remarkable. Why the terms FREE INHABITANTS are used in one part of the article, FREE CITIZENS in another, and PEOPLE in another; or what was meant by superadding to &quot;all privileges and immunities of free citizens,&quot; &quot;all the privileges of trade and commerce,&quot; cannot easily be determined. It seems to be a construction scarcely avoidable, however, that those who come under the denomination of FREE INHABITANTS of a State, although not citizens of such State, are entitled, in every other State, to all the privileges of FREE CITIZENS of the latter; that is, to greater privileges than they may be entitled to in their own State: so that it may be in the power of a particular State, or rather every State is laid under a necessity, not only to confer the rights of citizenship in other States upon any whom it may admit to such rights within itself, but upon any whom it may allow to become inhabitants within its jurisdiction. But were an exposition of the term &quot;inhabitants&quot; to be admitted which would confine the stipulated privileges to citizens alone, the difficulty is diminished only, not removed. The very improper power would still be retained by each State, of naturalizing aliens in every other State. In one State, residence for a short term confirms all the rights of citizenship: in another, qualifications of greater importance are required. An alien, therefore, legally incapacitated for certain rights in the latter, may, by previous residence only in the former, elude his incapacity; and thus the law of one State be preposterously rendered paramount to the law of another, within the jurisdiction of the other. We owe it to mere casualty, that very serious embarrassments on this subject have been hitherto escaped. By the laws of several States, certain descriptions of aliens, who had rendered themselves obnoxious, were laid under interdicts inconsistent not only with the rights of citizenship but with the privilege of residence. What would have been the consequence, if such persons, by residence or otherwise, had acquired the character of citizens under the laws of another State, and then asserted their rights as such, both to residence and citizenship, within the State proscribing them? Whatever the legal consequences might have been, other consequences would probably have resulted, of too serious a nature not to be provided against. The new Constitution has accordingly, with great propriety, made provision against them, and all others proceeding from the defect of the Confederation on this head, by authorizing the general government to establish a uniform rule of naturalization throughout the United States. The power of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is so intimately connected with the regulation of commerce, and will prevent so many frauds where the parties or their property may lie or be removed into different States, that the expediency of it seems not likely to be drawn into question. The power of prescribing by general laws, the manner in which the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of each State shall be proved, and the effect they shall have in other States, is an evident and valuable improvement on the clause relating to this subject in the articles of Confederation. The meaning of the latter is extremely indeterminate, and can be of little importance under any interpretation which it will bear. The power here established may be rendered a very convenient instrument of justice, and be particularly beneficial on the borders of contiguous States, where the effects liable to justice may be suddenly and secretly translated, in any stage of the process, within a foreign jurisdiction. The power of establishing post roads must, in every view, be a harmless power, and may, perhaps, by judicious management, become productive of great public conveniency.''

''Nothing which tends to facilitate the intercourse between the States can be deemed unworthy of the public care.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper continues a theme begun in Federalist No. 41. Here, Madison contends that the grant of specific powers to the federal government actually operates to limit the power of the federal government to act with respect to the states.

In Federalist No. 41, Madison had delineated six classes of power granted to the federal government:
# Security against foreign danger;
# Regulation of intercourse with foreign nations;
# Maintenance of the harmony and proper intercourse among the States;
# Miscellaneous objects of general utility;
# Restraining the States from certain injurious acts;
# Provisions for giving due efficacy to all of these powers.

Madison returns in Federalist No. 42 to classes two and three.

The Supreme Court of the United States, which has frequently cited the Federalist Papers as a source indicating the original intent of the framers of the [[../../Constitution/]], has cited Federalist No. 42 more frequently than any other contribution to the collection.

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE FOURTH class comprises the following miscellaneous powers:1. A power &quot;to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing, for a limited time, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries. &quot;The utility of this power will scarcely be questioned. The copyright of authors has been solemnly adjudged, in Great Britain, to be a right of common law. The right to useful inventions seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors.''

''The public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of individuals. The States cannot separately make effectual provisions for either of the cases, and most of them have anticipated the decision of this point, by laws passed at the instance of Congress. 2. &quot;To exercise exclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular States and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States; and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislatures of the States in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings. &quot;The indispensable necessity of complete authority at the seat of government, carries its own evidence with it. It is a power exercised by every legislature of the Union, I might say of the world, by virtue of its general supremacy. Without it, not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on the State comprehending the seat of the government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other members of the Confederacy. This consideration has the more weight, as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the stationary residence of the government would be both too great a public pledge to be left in the hands of a single State, and would create so many obstacles to a removal of the government, as still further to abridge its necessary independence. The extent of this federal district is sufficiently circumscribed to satisfy every jealousy of an opposite nature. And as it is to be appropriated to this use with the consent of the State ceding it; as the State will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights and the consent of the citizens inhabiting it; as the inhabitants will find sufficient inducements of interest to become willing parties to the cession; as they will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them; as a municipal legislature for local purposes, derived from their own suffrages, will of course be allowed them; and as the authority of the legislature of the State, and of the inhabitants of the ceded part of it, to concur in the cession, will be derived from the whole people of the State in their adoption of the Constitution, every imaginable objection seems to be obviated. The necessity of a like authority over forts, magazines, etc. , established by the general government, is not less evident. The public money expended on such places, and the public property deposited in them, requires that they should be exempt from the authority of the particular State. Nor would it be proper for the places on which the security of the entire Union may depend, to be in any degree dependent on a particular member of it. All objections and scruples are here also obviated, by requiring the concurrence of the States concerned, in every such establishment. 3. &quot;To declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attained. &quot;As treason may be committed against the United States, the authority of the United States ought to be enabled to punish it. But as new-fangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines by which violent factions, the natural offspring of free government, have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on each other, the convention have, with great judgment, opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional definition of the crime, fixing the proof necessary for conviction of it, and restraining the Congress, even in punishing it, from extending the consequences of guilt beyond the person of its author. 4. &quot;To admit new States into the Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the consent of the legislatures of the States concerned, as well as of the Congress. &quot;In the articles of Confederation, no provision is found on this important subject. Canada was to be admitted of right, on her joining in the measures of the United States; and the other COLONIES, by which were evidently meant the other British colonies, at the discretion of nine States. The eventual establishment of NEW STATES seems to have been overlooked by the compilers of that instrument. We have seen the inconvenience of this omission, and the assumption of power into which Congress have been led by it. With great propriety, therefore, has the new system supplied the defect. The general precaution, that no new States shall be formed, without the concurrence of the federal authority, and that of the States concerned, is consonant to the principles which ought to govern such transactions. The particular precaution against the erection of new States, by the partition of a State without its consent, quiets the jealousy of the larger States; as that of the smaller is quieted by a like precaution, against a junction of States without their consent. 5. &quot;To dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States, with a proviso, that nothing in the Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of any particular State. &quot;This is a power of very great importance, and required by considerations similar to those which show the propriety of the former. The proviso annexed is proper in itself, and was probably rendered absolutely necessary by jealousies and questions concerning the Western territory sufficiently known to the public. 6. &quot;To guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of government; to protect each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened), against domestic violence. &quot;In a confederacy founded on republican principles, and composed of republican members, the superintending government ought clearly to possess authority to defend the system against aristocratic or monarchial innovations. The more intimate the nature of such a union may be, the greater interest have the members in the political institutions of each other; and the greater right to insist that the forms of government under which the compact was entered into should be SUBSTANTIALLY maintained. But a right implies a remedy; and where else could the remedy be deposited, than where it is deposited by the Constitution? Governments of dissimilar principles and forms have been found less adapted to a federal coalition of any sort, than those of a kindred nature. &quot;As the confederate republic of Germany,&quot; says Montesquieu, &quot;consists of free cities and petty states, subject to different princes, experience shows us that it is more imperfect than that of Holland and Switzerland. &quot; &quot;Greece was undone,&quot; he adds, &quot;as soon as the king of Macedon obtained a seat among the Amphictyons. &quot; In the latter case, no doubt, the disproportionate force, as well as the monarchical form, of the new confederate, had its share of influence on the events. It may possibly be asked, what need there could be of such a precaution, and whether it may not become a pretext for alterations in the State governments, without the concurrence of the States themselves. These questions admit of ready answers. If the interposition of the general government should not be needed, the provision for such an event will be a harmless superfluity only in the Constitution. But who can say what experiments may be produced by the caprice of particular States, by the ambition of enterprising leaders, or by the intrigues and influence of foreign powers? To the second question it may be answered, that if the general government should interpose by virtue of this constitutional authority, it will be, of course, bound to pursue the authority. But the authority extends no further than to a GUARANTY of a republican form of government, which supposes a pre-existing government of the form which is to be guaranteed. As long, therefore, as the existing republican forms are continued by the States, they are guaranteed by the federal Constitution. Whenever the States may choose to substitute other republican forms, they have a right to do so, and to claim the federal guaranty for the latter. The only restriction imposed on them is, that they shall not exchange republican for antirepublican Constitutions; a restriction which, it is presumed, will hardly be considered as a grievance.''

''A protection against invasion is due from every society to the parts composing it. The latitude of the expression here used seems to secure each State, not only against foreign hostility, but against ambitious or vindictive enterprises of its more powerful neighbors. The history, both of ancient and modern confederacies, proves that the weaker members of the union ought not to be insensible to the policy of this article. Protection against domestic violence is added with equal propriety. It has been remarked, that even among the Swiss cantons, which, properly speaking, are not under one government, provision is made for this object; and the history of that league informs us that mutual aid is frequently claimed and afforded; and as well by the most democratic, as the other cantons. A recent and well-known event among ourselves has warned us to be prepared for emergencies of a like nature. At first view, it might seem not to square with the republican theory, to suppose, either that a majority have not the right, or that a minority will have the force, to subvert a government; and consequently, that the federal interposition can never be required, but when it would be improper. But theoretic reasoning, in this as in most other cases, must be qualified by the lessons of practice. Why may not illicit combinations, for purposes of violence, be formed as well by a majority of a State, especially a small State as by a majority of a county, or a district of the same State; and if the authority of the State ought, in the latter case, to protect the local magistracy, ought not the federal authority, in the former, to support the State authority? Besides, there are certain parts of the State constitutions which are so interwoven with the federal Constitution, that a violent blow cannot be given to the one without communicating the wound to the other.''

''Insurrections in a State will rarely induce a federal interposition, unless the number concerned in them bear some proportion to the friends of government. It will be much better that the violence in such cases should be repressed by the superintending power, than that the majority should be left to maintain their cause by a bloody and obstinate contest. The existence of a right to interpose, will generally prevent the necessity of exerting it. Is it true that force and right are necessarily on the same side in republican governments? May not the minor party possess such a superiority of pecuniary resources, of military talents and experience, or of secret succors from foreign powers, as will render it superior also in an appeal to the sword? May not a more compact and advantageous position turn the scale on the same side, against a superior number so situated as to be less capable of a prompt and collected exertion of its strength? Nothing can be more chimerical than to imagine that in a trial of actual force, victory may be calculated by the rules which prevail in a census of the inhabitants, or which determine the event of an election!''

''May it not happen, in fine, that the minority of CITIZENS may become a majority of PERSONS, by the accession of alien residents, of a casual concourse of adventurers, or of those whom the constitution of the State has not admitted to the rights of suffrage? I take no notice of an unhappy species of population abounding in some of the States, who, during the calm of regular government, are sunk below the level of men; but who, in the tempestuous scenes of civil violence, may emerge into the human character, and give a superiority of strength to any party with which they may associate themselves. In cases where it may be doubtful on which side justice lies, what better umpires could be desired by two violent factions, flying to arms, and tearing a State to pieces, than the representatives of confederate States, not heated by the local flame? To the impartiality of judges, they would unite the affection of friends. Happy would it be if such a remedy for its infirmities could be enjoyed by all free governments; if a project equally effectual could be established for the universal peace of mankind! Should it be asked, what is to be the redress for an insurrection pervading all the States, and comprising a superiority of the entire force, though not a constitutional right? the answer must be, that such a case, as it would be without the compass of human remedies, so it is fortunately not within the compass of human probability; and that it is a sufficient recommendation of the federal Constitution, that it diminishes the risk of a calamity for which no possible constitution can provide a cure. Among the advantages of a confederate republic enumerated by Montesquieu, an important one is, &quot;that should a popular insurrection happen in one of the States, the others are able to quell it. Should abuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that remain sound. &quot;7. &quot;To consider all debts contracted, and engagements entered into, before the adoption of this Constitution, as being no less valid against the United States, under this Constitution, than under the Confederation. &quot;This can only be considered as a declaratory proposition; and may have been inserted, among other reasons, for the satisfaction of the foreign creditors of the United States, who cannot be strangers to the pretended doctrine, that a change in the political form of civil society has the magical effect of dissolving its moral obligations. Among the lesser criticisms which have been exercised on the Constitution, it has been remarked that the validity of engagements ought to have been asserted in favor of the United States, as well as against them; and in the spirit which usually characterizes little critics, the omission has been transformed and magnified into a plot against the national rights. The authors of this discovery may be told, what few others need to be informed of, that as engagements are in their nature reciprocal, an assertion of their validity on one side, necessarily involves a validity on the other side; and that as the article is merely declaratory, the establishment of the principle in one case is sufficient for every case. They may be further told, that every constitution must limit its precautions to dangers that are not altogether imaginary; and that no real danger can exist that the government would DARE, with, or even without, this constitutional declaration before it, to remit the debts justly due to the public, on the pretext here condemned. 8. &quot;To provide for amendments to be ratified by three fourths of the States under two exceptions only. &quot;That useful alterations will be suggested by experience, could not but be foreseen. It was requisite, therefore, that a mode for introducing them should be provided. The mode preferred by the convention seems to be stamped with every mark of propriety. It guards equally against that extreme facility, which would render the Constitution too mutable; and that extreme difficulty, which might perpetuate its discovered faults. It, moreover, equally enables the general and the State governments to originate the amendment of errors, as they may be pointed out by the experience on one side, or on the other. The exception in favor of the equality of suffrage in the Senate, was probably meant as a palladium to the residuary sovereignty of the States, implied and secured by that principle of representation in one branch of the legislature; and was probably insisted on by the States particularly attached to that equality. The other exception must have been admitted on the same considerations which produced the privilege defended by it. 9. &quot;The ratification of the conventions of nine States shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the States, ratifying the same. &quot;This article speaks for itself.''

''The express authority of the people alone could give due validity to the Constitution. To have required the unanimous ratification of the thirteen States, would have subjected the essential interests of the whole to the caprice or corruption of a single member. It would have marked a want of foresight in the convention, which our own experience would have rendered inexcusable. Two questions of a very delicate nature present themselves on this occasion: 1. On what principle the Confederation, which stands in the solemn form of a compact among the States, can be superseded without the unanimous consent of the parties to it? 2. What relation is to subsist between the nine or more States ratifying the Constitution, and the remaining few who do not become parties to it? The first question is answered at once by recurring to the absolute necessity of the case; to the great principle of self-preservation; to the transcendent law of nature and of nature's God, which declares that the safety and happiness of society are the objects at which all political institutions aim, and to which all such institutions must be sacrificed. PERHAPS, also, an answer may be found without searching beyond the principles of the compact itself. It has been heretofore noted among the defects of the Confederation, that in many of the States it had received no higher sanction than a mere legislative ratification. The principle of reciprocality seems to require that its obligation on the other States should be reduced to the same standard. A compact between independent sovereigns, founded on ordinary acts of legislative authority, can pretend to no higher validity than a league or treaty between the parties. It is an established doctrine on the subject of treaties, that all the articles are mutually conditions of each other; that a breach of any one article is a breach of the whole treaty; and that a breach, committed by either of the parties, absolves the others, and authorizes them, if they please, to pronounce the compact violated and void. Should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to these delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with the consent of particular States to a dissolution of the federal pact, will not the complaining parties find it a difficult task to answer the MULTIPLIED and IMPORTANT infractions with which they may be confronted? The time has been when it was incumbent on us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph exhibits. The scene is now changed, and with it the part which the same motives dictate. The second question is not less delicate; and the flattering prospect of its being merely hypothetical forbids an overcurious discussion of it. It is one of those cases which must be left to provide for itself. In general, it may be observed, that although no political relation can subsist between the assenting and dissenting States, yet the moral relations will remain uncancelled. The claims of justice, both on one side and on the other, will be in force, and must be fulfilled; the rights of humanity must in all cases be duly and mutually respected; whilst considerations of a common interest, and, above all, the remembrance of the endearing scenes which are past, and the anticipation of a speedy triumph over the obstacles to reunion, will, it is hoped, not urge in vain MODERATION on one side, and PRUDENCE on the other.''

Federalist No. 44 is titled ''&quot;Restrictions on the Authority of the Several States&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by James Madison.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''A FIFTH class of provisions in favor of the federal authority consists of the following restrictions on the authority of the several States:1. &quot;No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit; make any thing but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, ex-post-facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts; or grant any title of nobility. &quot;The prohibition against treaties, alliances, and confederations makes a part of the existing articles of Union; and for reasons which need no explanation, is copied into the new Constitution. The prohibition of letters of marque is another part of the old system, but is somewhat extended in the new. According to the former, letters of marque could be granted by the States after a declaration of war; according to the latter, these licenses must be obtained, as well during war as previous to its declaration, from the government of the United States. This alteration is fully justified by the advantage of uniformity in all points which relate to foreign powers; and of immediate responsibility to the nation in all those for whose conduct the nation itself is to be responsible.''

''The right of coining money, which is here taken from the States, was left in their hands by the Confederation, as a concurrent right with that of Congress, under an exception in favor of the exclusive right of Congress to regulate the alloy and value. In this instance, also, the new provision is an improvement on the old. Whilst the alloy and value depended on the general authority, a right of coinage in the particular States could have no other effect than to multiply expensive mints and diversify the forms and weights of the circulating pieces. The latter inconveniency defeats one purpose for which the power was originally submitted to the federal head; and as far as the former might prevent an inconvenient remittance of gold and silver to the central mint for recoinage, the end can be as well attained by local mints established under the general authority.''

''The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it. In addition to these persuasive considerations, it may be observed, that the same reasons which show the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States, and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded; retrospective alterations in its value might be made, and thus the citizens of other States be injured, and animosities be kindled among the States themselves. The subjects of foreign powers might suffer from the same cause, and hence the Union be discredited and embroiled by the indiscretion of a single member. No one of these mischiefs is less incident to a power in the States to emit paper money, than to coin gold or silver. The power to make any thing but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts, is withdrawn from the States, on the same principle with that of issuing a paper currency. Bills of attainder, ex-post-facto laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation. The two former are expressly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to some of the State constitutions, and all of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these fundamental charters. Our own experience has taught us, nevertheless, that additional fences against these dangers ought not to be omitted. Very properly, therefore, have the convention added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights; and I am much deceived if they have not, in so doing, as faithfully consulted the genuine sentiments as the undoubted interests of their constituents. The sober people of America are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed the public councils. They have seen with regret and indignation that sudden changes and legislative interferences, in cases affecting personal rights, become jobs in the hands of enterprising and influential speculators, and snares to the more-industrious and lessinformed part of the community. They have seen, too, that one legislative interference is but the first link of a long chain of repetitions, every subsequent interference being naturally produced by the effects of the preceding. They very rightly infer, therefore, that some thorough reform is wanting, which will banish speculations on public measures, inspire a general prudence and industry, and give a regular course to the business of society. The prohibition with respect to titles of nobility is copied from the articles of Confederation and needs no comment. 2. &quot;No State shall, without the consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws, and the net produce of all duties and imposts laid by any State on imports or exports, shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States; and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of the Congress. No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty on tonnage, keep troops or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with another State, or with a foreign power, or engage in war unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay. &quot;The restraint on the power of the States over imports and exports is enforced by all the arguments which prove the necessity of submitting the regulation of trade to the federal councils. It is needless, therefore, to remark further on this head, than that the manner in which the restraint is qualified seems well calculated at once to secure to the States a reasonable discretion in providing for the conveniency of their imports and exports, and to the United States a reasonable check against the abuse of this discretion.''

''The remaining particulars of this clause fall within reasonings which are either so obvious, or have been so fully developed, that they may be passed over without remark. The SIXTH and last class consists of the several powers and provisions by which efficacy is given to all the rest. 1. Of these the first is, the &quot;power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof. &quot;Few parts of the Constitution have been assailed with more intemperance than this; yet on a fair investigation of it, no part can appear more completely invulnerable. Without the SUBSTANCE of this power, the whole Constitution would be a dead letter. Those who object to the article, therefore, as a part of the Constitution, can only mean that the FORM of the provision is improper. But have they considered whether a better form could have been substituted? There are four other possible methods which the Constitution might have taken on this subject. They might have copied the second article of the existing Confederation, which would have prohibited the exercise of any power not EXPRESSLY delegated; they might have attempted a positive enumeration of the powers comprehended under the general terms &quot;necessary and proper&quot;; they might have attempted a negative enumeration of them, by specifying the powers excepted from the general definition; they might have been altogether silent on the subject, leaving these necessary and proper powers to construction and inference. Had the convention taken the first method of adopting the second article of Confederation, it is evident that the new Congress would be continually exposed, as their predecessors have been, to the alternative of construing the term &quot;EXPRESSLY&quot; with so much rigor, as to disarm the government of all real authority whatever, or with so much latitude as to destroy altogether the force of the restriction.''

''It would be easy to show, if it were necessary, that no important power, delegated by the articles of Confederation, has been or can be executed by Congress, without recurring more or less to the doctrine of CONSTRUCTION or IMPLICATION. As the powers delegated under the new system are more extensive, the government which is to administer it would find itself still more distressed with the alternative of betraying the public interests by doing nothing, or of violating the Constitution by exercising powers indispensably necessary and proper, but, at the same time, not EXPRESSLY granted. Had the convention attempted a positive enumeration of the powers necessary and proper for carrying their other powers into effect, the attempt would have involved a complete digest of laws on every subject to which the Constitution relates; accommodated too, not only to the existing state of things, but to all the possible changes which futurity may produce; for in every new application of a general power, the PARTICULAR POWERS, which are the means of attaining the OBJECT of the general power, must always necessarily vary with that object, and be often properly varied whilst the object remains the same.''

''Had they attempted to enumerate the particular powers or means not necessary or proper for carrying the general powers into execution, the task would have been no less chimerical; and would have been liable to this further objection, that every defect in the enumeration would have been equivalent to a positive grant of authority. If, to avoid this consequence, they had attempted a partial enumeration of the exceptions, and described the residue by the general terms, NOT NECESSARY OR PROPER, it must have happened that the enumeration would comprehend a few of the excepted powers only; that these would be such as would be least likely to be assumed or tolerated, because the enumeration would of course select such as would be least necessary or proper; and that the unnecessary and improper powers included in the residuum, would be less forcibly excepted, than if no partial enumeration had been made. Had the Constitution been silent on this head, there can be no doubt that all the particular powers requisite as means of executing the general powers would have resulted to the government, by unavoidable implication. No axiom is more clearly established in law, or in reason, than that wherever the end is required, the means are authorized; wherever a general power to do a thing is given, every particular power necessary for doing it is included. Had this last method, therefore, been pursued by the convention, every objection now urged against their plan would remain in all its plausibility; and the real inconveniency would be incurred of not removing a pretext which may be seized on critical occasions for drawing into question the essential powers of the Union. If it be asked what is to be the consequence, in case the Congress shall misconstrue this part of the Constitution, and exercise powers not warranted by its true meaning, I answer, the same as if they should misconstrue or enlarge any other power vested in them; as if the general power had been reduced to particulars, and any one of these were to be violated; the same, in short, as if the State legislatures should violate the irrespective constitutional authorities. In the first instance, the success of the usurpation will depend on the executive and judiciary departments, which are to expound and give effect to the legislative acts; and in the last resort a remedy must be obtained from the people who can, by the election of more faithful representatives, annul the acts of the usurpers. The truth is, that this ultimate redress may be more confided in against unconstitutional acts of the federal than of the State legislatures, for this plain reason, that as every such act of the former will be an invasion of the rights of the latter, these will be ever ready to mark the innovation, to sound the alarm to the people, and to exert their local influence in effecting a change of federal representatives. There being no such intermediate body between the State legislatures and the people interested in watching the conduct of the former, violations of the State constitutions are more likely to remain unnoticed and unredressed. 2. &quot;This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. &quot;The indiscreet zeal of the adversaries to the Constitution has betrayed them into an attack on this part of it also, without which it would have been evidently and radically defective. To be fully sensible of this, we need only suppose for a moment that the supremacy of the State constitutions had been left complete by a saving clause in their favor. In the first place, as these constitutions invest the State legislatures with absolute sovereignty, in all cases not excepted by the existing articles of Confederation, all the authorities contained in the proposed Constitution, so far as they exceed those enumerated in the Confederation, would have been annulled, and the new Congress would have been reduced to the same impotent condition with their predecessors. In the next place, as the constitutions of some of the States do not even expressly and fully recognize the existing powers of the Confederacy, an express saving of the supremacy of the former would, in such States, have brought into question every power contained in the proposed Constitution. In the third place, as the constitutions of the States differ much from each other, it might happen that a treaty or national law, of great and equal importance to the States, would interfere with some and not with other constitutions, and would consequently be valid in some of the States, at the same time that it would have no effect in others. In fine, the world would have seen, for the first time, a system of government founded on an inversion of the fundamental principles of all government; it would have seen the authority of the whole society every where subordinate to the authority of the parts; it would have seen a monster, in which the head was under the direction of the members. 3. &quot;The Senators and Representatives, and the members of the several State legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and the several States, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution. &quot;It has been asked why it was thought necessary, that the State magistracy should be bound to support the federal Constitution, and unnecessary that a like oath should be imposed on the officers of the United States, in favor of the State constitutions. Several reasons might be assigned for the distinction. I content myself with one, which is obvious and conclusive. The members of the federal government will have no agency in carrying the State constitutions into effect. The members and officers of the State governments, on the contrary, will have an essential agency in giving effect to the federal Constitution. The election of the President and Senate will depend, in all cases, on the legislatures of the several States. And the election of the House of Representatives will equally depend on the same authority in the first instance; and will, probably, forever be conducted by the officers, and according to the laws, of the States. 4. Among the provisions for giving efficacy to the federal powers might be added those which belong to the executive and judiciary departments: but as these are reserved for particular examination in another place, I pass them over in this. We have now reviewed, in detail, all the articles composing the sum or quantity of power delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government, and are brought to this undeniable conclusion, that no part of the power is unnecessary or improper for accomplishing the necessary objects of the Union. The question, therefore, whether this amount of power shall be granted or not, resolves itself into another question, whether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union shall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union itself shall be preserved.''

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''HAVING shown that no one of the powers transferred to the federal government is unnecessary or improper, the next question to be considered is, whether the whole mass of them will be dangerous to the portion of authority left in the several States. The adversaries to the plan of the convention, instead of considering in the first place what degree of power was absolutely necessary for the purposes of the federal government, have exhausted themselves in a secondary inquiry into the possible consequences of the proposed degree of power to the governments of the particular States. But if the Union, as has been shown, be essential to the security of the people of America against foreign danger; if it be essential to their security against contentions and wars among the different States; if it be essential to guard them against those violent and oppressive factions which embitter the blessings of liberty, and against those military establishments which must gradually poison its very fountain; if, in a word, the Union be essential to the happiness of the people of America, is it not preposterous, to urge as an objection to a government, without which the objects of the Union cannot be attained, that such a government may derogate from the importance of the governments of the individual States? Was, then, the American Revolution effected, was the American Confederacy formed, was the precious blood of thousands spilt, and the hard-earned substance of millions lavished, not that the people of America should enjoy peace, liberty, and safety, but that the government of the individual States, that particular municipal establishments, might enjoy a certain extent of power, and be arrayed with certain dignities and attributes of sovereignty? We have heard of the impious doctrine in the Old World, that the people were made for kings, not kings for the people. Is the same doctrine to be revived in the New, in another shape that the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed to the views of political institutions of a different form? It is too early for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the public good, the real welfare of the great body of the people, is the supreme object to be pursued; and that no form of government whatever has any other value than as it may be fitted for the attainment of this object. Were the plan of the convention adverse to the public happiness, my voice would be, Reject the plan. Were the Union itself inconsistent with the public happiness, it would be, Abolish the Union. In like manner, as far as the sovereignty of the States cannot be reconciled to the happiness of the people, the voice of every good citizen must be,''

''Let the former be sacrificed to the latter. How far the sacrifice is necessary, has been shown. How far the unsacrificed residue will be endangered, is the question before us. Several important considerations have been touched in the course of these papers, which discountenance the supposition that the operation of the federal government will by degrees prove fatal to the State governments. The more I revolve the subject, the more fully I am persuaded that the balance is much more likely to be disturbed by the preponderancy of the last than of the first scale. We have seen, in all the examples of ancient and modern confederacies, the strongest tendency continually betraying itself in the members, to despoil the general government of its authorities, with a very ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itself against the encroachments. Although, in most of these examples, the system has been so dissimilar from that under consideration as greatly to weaken any inference concerning the latter from the fate of the former, yet, as the States will retain, under the proposed Constitution, a very extensive portion of active sovereignty, the inference ought not to be wholly disregarded. In the Achaean league it is probable that the federal head had a degree and species of power, which gave it a considerable likeness to the government framed by the convention. The Lycian Confederacy, as far as its principles and form are transmitted, must have borne a still greater analogy to it. Yet history does not inform us that either of them ever degenerated, or tended to degenerate, into one consolidated government. On the contrary, we know that the ruin of one of them proceeded from the incapacity of the federal authority to prevent the dissensions, and finally the disunion, of the subordinate authorities. These cases are the more worthy of our attention, as the external causes by which the component parts were pressed together were much more numerous and powerful than in our case; and consequently less powerful ligaments within would be sufficient to bind the members to the head, and to each other. In the feudal system, we have seen a similar propensity exemplified. Notwithstanding the want of proper sympathy in every instance between the local sovereigns and the people, and the sympathy in some instances between the general sovereign and the latter, it usually happened that the local sovereigns prevailed in the rivalship for encroachments.''

''Had no external dangers enforced internal harmony and subordination, and particularly, had the local sovereigns possessed the affections of the people, the great kingdoms in Europe would at this time consist of as many independent princes as there were formerly feudatory barons. The State government will have the advantage of the Federal government, whether we compare them in respect to the immediate dependence of the one on the other; to the weight of personal influence which each side will possess; to the powers respectively vested in them; to the predilection and probable support of the people; to the disposition and faculty of resisting and frustrating the measures of each other. The State governments may be regarded as constituent and essential parts of the federal government; whilst the latter is nowise essential to the operation or organization of the former. Without the intervention of the State legislatures, the President of the United States cannot be elected at all. They must in all cases have a great share in his appointment, and will, perhaps, in most cases, of themselves determine it. The Senate will be elected absolutely and exclusively by the State legislatures. Even the House of Representatives, though drawn immediately from the people, will be chosen very much under the influence of that class of men, whose influence over the people obtains for themselves an election into the State legislatures. Thus, each of the principal branches of the federal government will owe its existence more or less to the favor of the State governments, and must consequently feel a dependence, which is much more likely to beget a disposition too obsequious than too overbearing towards them. On the other side, the component parts of the State governments will in no instance be indebted for their appointment to the direct agency of the federal government, and very little, if at all, to the local influence of its members. The number of individuals employed under the Constitution of the United States will be much smaller than the number employed under the particular States.''

''There will consequently be less of personal influence on the side of the former than of the latter. The members of the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments of thirteen and more States, the justices of peace, officers of militia, ministerial officers of justice, with all the county, corporation, and town officers, for three millions and more of people, intermixed, and having particular acquaintance with every class and circle of people, must exceed, beyond all proportion, both in number and influence, those of every description who will be employed in the administration of the federal system. Compare the members of the three great departments of the thirteen States, excluding from the judiciary department the justices of peace, with the members of the corresponding departments of the single government of the Union; compare the militia officers of three millions of people with the military and marine officers of any establishment which is within the compass of probability, or, I may add, of possibility, and in this view alone, we may pronounce the advantage of the States to be decisive. If the federal government is to have collectors of revenue, the State governments will have theirs also. And as those of the former will be principally on the seacoast, and not very numerous, whilst those of the latter will be spread over the face of the country, and will be very numerous, the advantage in this view also lies on the same side.''

''It is true, that the Confederacy is to possess, and may exercise, the power of collecting internal as well as external taxes throughout the States; but it is probable that this power will not be resorted to, except for supplemental purposes of revenue; that an option will then be given to the States to supply their quotas by previous collections of their own; and that the eventual collection, under the immediate authority of the Union, will generally be made by the officers, and according to the rules, appointed by the several States. Indeed it is extremely probable, that in other instances, particularly in the organization of the judicial power, the officers of the States will be clothed with the correspondent authority of the Union.''

''Should it happen, however, that separate collectors of internal revenue should be appointed under the federal government, the influence of the whole number would not bear a comparison with that of the multitude of State officers in the opposite scale.''

''Within every district to which a federal collector would be allotted, there would not be less than thirty or forty, or even more, officers of different descriptions, and many of them persons of character and weight, whose influence would lie on the side of the State. The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will, for the most part, be connected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State. The operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger; those of the State governments, in times of peace and security. As the former periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter, the State governments will here enjoy another advantage over the federal government. The more adequate, indeed, the federal powers may be rendered to the national defense, the less frequent will be those scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over the governments of the particular States. If the new Constitution be examined with accuracy and candor, it will be found that the change which it proposes consists much less in the addition of NEW POWERS to the Union, than in the invigoration of its ORIGINAL POWERS. The regulation of commerce, it is true, is a new power; but that seems to be an addition which few oppose, and from which no apprehensions are entertained. The powers relating to war and peace, armies and fleets, treaties and finance, with the other more considerable powers, are all vested in the existing Congress by the articles of Confederation. The proposed change does not enlarge these powers; it only substitutes a more effectual mode of administering them. The change relating to taxation may be regarded as the most important; and yet the present Congress have as complete authority to REQUIRE of the States indefinite supplies of money for the common defense and general welfare, as the future Congress will have to require them of individual citizens; and the latter will be no more bound than the States themselves have been, to pay the quotas respectively taxed on them. Had the States complied punctually with the articles of Confederation, or could their compliance have been enforced by as peaceable means as may be used with success towards single persons, our past experience is very far from countenancing an opinion, that the State governments would have lost their constitutional powers, and have gradually undergone an entire consolidation. To maintain that such an event would have ensued, would be to say at once, that the existence of the State governments is incompatible with any system whatever that accomplishes the essential purposes of the Union.''

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''RESUMING the subject of the last paper, I proceed to inquire whether the federal government or the State governments will have the advantage with regard to the predilection and support of the people. Notwithstanding the different modes in which they are appointed, we must consider both of them as substantially dependent on the great body of the citizens of the United States.''

''I assume this position here as it respects the first, reserving the proofs for another place. The federal and State governments are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people, constituted with different powers, and designed for different purposes. The adversaries of the Constitution seem to have lost sight of the people altogether in their reasonings on this subject; and to have viewed these different establishments, not only as mutual rivals and enemies, but as uncontrolled by any common superior in their efforts to usurp the authorities of each other. These gentlemen must here be reminded of their error. They must be told that the ultimate authority, wherever the derivative may be found, resides in the people alone, and that it will not depend merely on the comparative ambition or address of the different governments, whether either, or which of them, will be able to enlarge its sphere of jurisdiction at the expense of the other. Truth, no less than decency, requires that the event in every case should be supposed to depend on the sentiments and sanction of their common constituents. Many considerations, besides those suggested on a former occasion, seem to place it beyond doubt that the first and most natural attachment of the people will be to the governments of their respective States.''

''Into the administration of these a greater number of individuals will expect to rise. From the gift of these a greater number of offices and emoluments will flow. By the superintending care of these, all the more domestic and personal interests of the people will be regulated and provided for. With the affairs of these, the people will be more familiarly and minutely conversant. And with the members of these, will a greater proportion of the people have the ties of personal acquaintance and friendship, and of family and party attachments; on the side of these, therefore, the popular bias may well be expected most strongly to incline. Experience speaks the same language in this case. The federal administration, though hitherto very defective in comparison with what may be hoped under a better system, had, during the war, and particularly whilst the independent fund of paper emissions was in credit, an activity and importance as great as it can well have in any future circumstances whatever.''

''It was engaged, too, in a course of measures which had for their object the protection of everything that was dear, and the acquisition of everything that could be desirable to the people at large. It was, nevertheless, invariably found, after the transient enthusiasm for the early Congresses was over, that the attention and attachment of the people were turned anew to their own particular governments; that the federal council was at no time the idol of popular favor; and that opposition to proposed enlargements of its powers and importance was the side usually taken by the men who wished to build their political consequence on the prepossessions of their fellow-citizens. If, therefore, as has been elsewhere remarked, the people should in future become more partial to the federal than to the State governments, the change can only result from such manifest and irresistible proofs of a better administration, as will overcome all their antecedent propensities. And in that case, the people ought not surely to be precluded from giving most of their confidence where they may discover it to be most due; but even in that case the State governments could have little to apprehend, because it is only within a certain sphere that the federal power can, in the nature of things, be advantageously administered. The remaining points on which I propose to compare the federal and State governments, are the disposition and the faculty they may respectively possess, to resist and frustrate the measures of each other. It has been already proved that the members of the federal will be more dependent on the members of the State governments, than the latter will be on the former. It has appeared also, that the prepossessions of the people, on whom both will depend, will be more on the side of the State governments, than of the federal government. So far as the disposition of each towards the other may be influenced by these causes, the State governments must clearly have the advantage.''

''But in a distinct and very important point of view, the advantage will lie on the same side. The prepossessions, which the members themselves will carry into the federal government, will generally be favorable to the States; whilst it will rarely happen, that the members of the State governments will carry into the public councils a bias in favor of the general government. A local spirit will infallibly prevail much more in the members of Congress, than a national spirit will prevail in the legislatures of the particular States. Every one knows that a great proportion of the errors committed by the State legislatures proceeds from the disposition of the members to sacrifice the comprehensive and permanent interest of the State, to the particular and separate views of the counties or districts in which they reside. And if they do not sufficiently enlarge their policy to embrace the collective welfare of their particular State, how can it be imagined that they will make the aggregate prosperity of the Union, and the dignity and respectability of its government, the objects of their affections and consultations? For the same reason that the members of the State legislatures will be unlikely to attach themselves sufficiently to national objects, the members of the federal legislature will be likely to attach themselves too much to local objects. The States will be to the latter what counties and towns are to the former. Measures will too often be decided according to their probable effect, not on the national prosperity and happiness, but on the prejudices, interests, and pursuits of the governments and people of the individual States. What is the spirit that has in general characterized the proceedings of Congress? A perusal of their journals, as well as the candid acknowledgments of such as have had a seat in that assembly, will inform us, that the members have but too frequently displayed the character, rather of partisans of their respective States, than of impartial guardians of a common interest; that where on one occasion improper sacrifices have been made of local considerations, to the aggrandizement of the federal government, the great interests of the nation have suffered on a hundred, from an undue attention to the local prejudices, interests, and views of the particular States. I mean not by these reflections to insinuate, that the new federal government will not embrace a more enlarged plan of policy than the existing government may have pursued; much less, that its views will be as confined as those of the State legislatures; but only that it will partake sufficiently of the spirit of both, to be disinclined to invade the rights of the individual States, or the preorgatives of their governments. The motives on the part of the State governments, to augment their prerogatives by defalcations from the federal government, will be overruled by no reciprocal predispositions in the members. Were it admitted, however, that the Federal government may feel an equal disposition with the State governments to extend its power beyond the due limits, the latter would still have the advantage in the means of defeating such encroachments. If an act of a particular State, though unfriendly to the national government, be generally popular in that State and should not too grossly violate the oaths of the State officers, it is executed immediately and, of course, by means on the spot and depending on the State alone. The opposition of the federal government, or the interposition of federal officers, would but inflame the zeal of all parties on the side of the State, and the evil could not be prevented or repaired, if at all, without the employment of means which must always be resorted to with reluctance and difficulty.''

''On the other hand, should an unwarrantable measure of the federal government be unpopular in particular States, which would seldom fail to be the case, or even a warrantable measure be so, which may sometimes be the case, the means of opposition to it are powerful and at hand. The disquietude of the people; their repugnance and, perhaps, refusal to co-operate with the officers of the Union; the frowns of the executive magistracy of the State; the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which would often be added on such occasions, would oppose, in any State, difficulties not to be despised; would form, in a large State, very serious impediments; and where the sentiments of several adjoining States happened to be in unison, would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter. But ambitious encroachments of the federal government, on the authority of the State governments, would not excite the opposition of a single State, or of a few States only. They would be signals of general alarm. Every government would espouse the common cause. A correspondence would be opened. Plans of resistance would be concerted. One spirit would animate and conduct the whole. The same combinations, in short, would result from an apprehension of the federal, as was produced by the dread of a foreign, yoke; and unless the projected innovations should be voluntarily renounced, the same appeal to a trial of force would be made in the one case as was made in the other. But what degree of madness could ever drive the federal government to such an extremity. In the contest with Great Britain, one part of the empire was employed against the other.''

''The more numerous part invaded the rights of the less numerous part. The attempt was unjust and unwise; but it was not in speculation absolutely chimerical. But what would be the contest in the case we are supposing? Who would be the parties? A few representatives of the people would be opposed to the people themselves; or rather one set of representatives would be contending against thirteen sets of representatives, with the whole body of their common constituents on the side of the latter. The only refuge left for those who prophesy the downfall of the State governments is the visionary supposition that the federal government may previously accumulate a military force for the projects of ambition. The reasonings contained in these papers must have been employed to little purpose indeed, if it could be necessary now to disprove the reality of this danger. That the people and the States should, for a sufficient period of time, elect an uninterupted succession of men ready to betray both; that the traitors should, throughout this period, uniformly and systematically pursue some fixed plan for the extension of the military establishment; that the governments and the people of the States should silently and patiently behold the gathering storm, and continue to supply the materials, until it should be prepared to burst on their own heads, must appear to every one more like the incoherent dreams of a delirious jealousy, or the misjudged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal, than like the sober apprehensions of genuine patriotism.''

''Extravagant as the supposition is, let it however be made. Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger. The highest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the British arms, will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it. Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it. Let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of America with the suspicion, that they would be less able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual possession, than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors. Let us rather no longer insult them with the supposition that they can ever reduce themselves to the necessity of making the experiment, by a blind and tame submission to the long train of insidious measures which must precede and produce it. The argument under the present head may be put into a very concise form, which appears altogether conclusive. Either the mode in which the federal government is to be constructed will render it sufficiently dependent on the people, or it will not. On the first supposition, it will be restrained by that dependence from forming schemes obnoxious to their constituents. On the other supposition, it will not possess the confidence of the people, and its schemes of usurpation will be easily defeated by the State governments, who will be supported by the people. On summing up the considerations stated in this and the last paper, they seem to amount to the most convincing evidence, that the powers proposed to be lodged in the federal government are as little formidable to those reserved to the individual States, as they are indispensably necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Union; and that all those alarms which have been sounded, of a meditated and consequential annihilation of the State governments, must, on the most favorable interpretation, be ascribed to the chimerical fears of the authors of them.''

This Federalist Paper examines the relative strength of the state and federal governments under the proposed [[../../Constitution|United States Constitution]].

Madison stresses that the federal and state governments are two totally different agencies. He articulates that they are separate yet can collaborate, and that the power lies in the people. The natural attachment of the people will always be to the governments of their respective states, so the federal government must be, in a sense, extraordinarily congenial to the people.

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''HAVING reviewed the general form of the proposed government and the general mass of power allotted to it, I proceed to examine the particular structure of this government, and the distribution of this mass of power among its constituent parts. One of the principal objections inculcated by the more respectable adversaries to the Constitution, is its supposed violation of the political maxim, that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments ought to be separate and distinct. In the structure of the federal government, no regard, it is said, seems to have been paid to this essential precaution in favor of liberty. The several departments of power are distributed and blended in such a manner as at once to destroy all symmetry and beauty of form, and to expose some of the essential parts of the edifice to the danger of being crushed by the disproportionate weight of other parts. No political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic value, or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty, than that on which the objection is founded.''

''The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, selfappointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny. Were the federal Constitution, therefore, really chargeable with the accumulation of power, or with a mixture of powers, having a dangerous tendency to such an accumulation, no further arguments would be necessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the system. I persuade myself, however, that it will be made apparent to every one, that the charge cannot be supported, and that the maxim on which it relies has been totally misconceived and misapplied. In order to form correct ideas on this important subject, it will be proper to investigate the sense in which the preservation of liberty requires that the three great departments of power should be separate and distinct. The oracle who is always consulted and cited on this subject is the celebrated Montesquieu. If he be not the author of this invaluable precept in the science of politics, he has the merit at least of displaying and recommending it most effectually to the attention of mankind. Let us endeavor, in the first place, to ascertain his meaning on this point. The British Constitution was to Montesquieu what Homer has been to the didactic writers on epic poetry. As the latter have considered the work of the immortal bard as the perfect model from which the principles and rules of the epic art were to be drawn, and by which all similar works were to be judged, so this great political critic appears to have viewed the Constitution of England as the standard, or to use his own expression, as the mirror of political liberty; and to have delivered, in the form of elementary truths, the several characteristic principles of that particular system. That we may be sure, then, not to mistake his meaning in this case, let us recur to the source from which the maxim was drawn. On the slightest view of the British Constitution, we must perceive that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments are by no means totally separate and distinct from each other. The executive magistrate forms an integral part of the legislative authority. He alone has the prerogative of making treaties with foreign sovereigns, which, when made, have, under certain limitations, the force of legislative acts. All the members of the judiciary department are appointed by him, can be removed by him on the address of the two Houses of Parliament, and form, when he pleases to consult them, one of his constitutional councils. One branch of the legislative department forms also a great constitutional council to the executive chief, as, on another hand, it is the sole depositary of judicial power in cases of impeachment, and is invested with the supreme appellate jurisdiction in all other cases. The judges, again, are so far connected with the legislative department as often to attend and participate in its deliberations, though not admitted to a legislative vote. From these facts, by which Montesquieu was guided, it may clearly be inferred that, in saying &quot;There can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or body of magistrates,&quot; or, &quot;if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers,&quot; he did not mean that these departments ought to have no PARTIAL AGENCY in, or no CONTROL over, the acts of each other. His meaning, as his own words import, and still more conclusively as illustrated by the example in his eye, can amount to no more than this, that where the WHOLE power of one department is exercised by the same hands which possess the WHOLE power of another department, the fundamental principles of a free constitution are subverted. This would have been the case in the constitution examined by him, if the king, who is the sole executive magistrate, had possessed also the complete legislative power, or the supreme administration of justice; or if the entire legislative body had possessed the supreme judiciary, or the supreme executive authority. This, however, is not among the vices of that constitution. The magistrate in whom the whole executive power resides cannot of himself make a law, though he can put a negative on every law; nor administer justice in person, though he has the appointment of those who do administer it. The judges can exercise no executive prerogative, though they are shoots from the executive stock; nor any legislative function, though they may be advised with by the legislative councils. The entire legislature can perform no judiciary act, though by the joint act of two of its branches the judges may be removed from their offices, and though one of its branches is possessed of the judicial power in the last resort. The entire legislature, again, can exercise no executive prerogative, though one of its branches constitutes the supreme executive magistracy, and another, on the impeachment of a third, can try and condemn all the subordinate officers in the executive department. The reasons on which Montesquieu grounds his maxim are a further demonstration of his meaning. &quot;When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body,&quot; says he, &quot;there can be no liberty, because apprehensions may arise lest THE SAME monarch or senate should ENACT tyrannical laws to EXECUTE them in a tyrannical manner. &quot; Again: &quot;Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for THE JUDGE would then be THE LEGISLATOR.''

''Were it joined to the executive power, THE JUDGE might behave with all the violence of AN OPPRESSOR. &quot; Some of these reasons are more fully explained in other passages; but briefly stated as they are here, they sufficiently establish the meaning which we have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author.''

''If we look into the constitutions of the several States, we find that, notwithstanding the emphatical and, in some instances, the unqualified terms in which this axiom has been laid down, there is not a single instance in which the several departments of power have been kept absolutely separate and distinct. New Hampshire, whose constitution was the last formed, seems to have been fully aware of the impossibility and inexpediency of avoiding any mixture whatever of these departments, and has qualified the doctrine by declaring &quot;that the legislative, executive, and judiciary powers ought to be kept as separate from, and independent of, each other AS THE NATURE OF A FREE GOVERNMENT WILL ADMIT; OR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT CHAIN OF CONNECTION THAT BINDS THE WHOLE FABRIC OF THE CONSTITUTION IN ONE INDISSOLUBLE BOND OF UNITY AND AMITY. &quot; Her constitution accordingly mixes these departments in several respects. The Senate, which is a branch of the legislative department, is also a judicial tribunal for the trial of impeachments. The President, who is the head of the executive department, is the presiding member also of the Senate; and, besides an equal vote in all cases, has a casting vote in case of a tie. The executive head is himself eventually elective every year by the legislative department, and his council is every year chosen by and from the members of the same department. Several of the officers of state are also appointed by the legislature. And the members of the judiciary department are appointed by the executive department. The constitution of Massachusetts has observed a sufficient though less pointed caution, in expressing this fundamental article of liberty. It declares &quot;that the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or either of them; the executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them; the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them. &quot; This declaration corresponds precisely with the doctrine of Montesquieu, as it has been explained, and is not in a single point violated by the plan of the convention. It goes no farther than to prohibit any one of the entire departments from exercising the powers of another department. In the very Constitution to which it is prefixed, a partial mixture of powers has been admitted. The executive magistrate has a qualified negative on the legislative body, and the Senate, which is a part of the legislature, is a court of impeachment for members both of the executive and judiciary departments. The members of the judiciary department, again, are appointable by the executive department, and removable by the same authority on the address of the two legislative branches.''

''Lastly, a number of the officers of government are annually appointed by the legislative department. As the appointment to offices, particularly executive offices, is in its nature an executive function, the compilers of the Constitution have, in this last point at least, violated the rule established by themselves. I pass over the constitutions of Rhode Island and Connecticut, because they were formed prior to the Revolution, and even before the principle under examination had become an object of political attention. The constitution of New York contains no declaration on this subject; but appears very clearly to have been framed with an eye to the danger of improperly blending the different departments. It gives, nevertheless, to the executive magistrate, a partial control over the legislative department; and, what is more, gives a like control to the judiciary department; and even blends the executive and judiciary departments in the exercise of this control. In its council of appointment members of the legislative are associated with the executive authority, in the appointment of officers, both executive and judiciary. And its court for the trial of impeachments and correction of errors is to consist of one branch of the legislature and the principal members of the judiciary department. The constitution of New Jersey has blended the different powers of government more than any of the preceding. The governor, who is the executive magistrate, is appointed by the legislature; is chancellor and ordinary, or surrogate of the State; is a member of the Supreme Court of Appeals, and president, with a casting vote, of one of the legislative branches. The same legislative branch acts again as executive council of the governor, and with him constitutes the Court of Appeals. The members of the judiciary department are appointed by the legislative department and removable by one branch of it, on the impeachment of the other. According to the constitution of Pennsylvania, the president, who is the head of the executive department, is annually elected by a vote in which the legislative department predominates. In conjunction with an executive council, he appoints the members of the judiciary department, and forms a court of impeachment for trial of all officers, judiciary as well as executive. The judges of the Supreme Court and justices of the peace seem also to be removable by the legislature; and the executive power of pardoning in certain cases, to be referred to the same department. The members of the executive counoil are made EX-OFFICIO justices of peace throughout the State. In Delaware, the chief executive magistrate is annually elected by the legislative department. The speakers of the two legislative branches are vice-presidents in the executive department. The executive chief, with six others, appointed, three by each of the legislative branches constitutes the Supreme Court of Appeals; he is joined with the legislative department in the appointment of the other judges. Throughout the States, it appears that the members of the legislature may at the same time be justices of the peace; in this State, the members of one branch of it are EX-OFFICIO justices of the peace; as are also the members of the executive council. The principal officers of the executive department are appointed by the legislative; and one branch of the latter forms a court of impeachments. All officers may be removed on address of the legislature. Maryland has adopted the maxim in the most unqualified terms; declaring that the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other. Her constitution, notwithstanding, makes the executive magistrate appointable by the legislative department; and the members of the judiciary by the executive department. The language of Virginia is still more pointed on this subject. Her constitution declares, &quot;that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct; so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other; nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time, except that the justices of county courts shall be eligible to either House of Assembly. &quot; Yet we find not only this express exception, with respect to the members of the irferior courts, but that the chief magistrate, with his executive council, are appointable by the legislature; that two members of the latter are triennially displaced at the pleasure of the legislature; and that all the principal offices, both executive and judiciary, are filled by the same department. The executive prerogative of pardon, also, is in one case vested in the legislative department. The constitution of North Carolina, which declares &quot;that the legislative, executive, and supreme judicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other,&quot; refers, at the same time, to the legislative department, the appointment not only of the executive chief, but all the principal officers within both that and the judiciary department. In South Carolina, the constitution makes the executive magistracy eligible by the legislative department.''

''It gives to the latter, also, the appointment of the members of the judiciary department, including even justices of the peace and sheriffs; and the appointment of officers in the executive department, down to captains in the army and navy of the State.''

''In the constitution of Georgia, where it is declared &quot;that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct, so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other,&quot; we find that the executive department is to be filled by appointments of the legislature; and the executive prerogative of pardon to be finally exercised by the same authority. Even justices of the peace are to be appointed by the legislature. In citing these cases, in which the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments have not been kept totally separate and distinct, I wish not to be regarded as an advocate for the particular organizations of the several State governments. I am fully aware that among the many excellent principles which they exemplify, they carry strong marks of the haste, and still stronger of the inexperience, under which they were framed. It is but too obvious that in some instances the fundamental principle under consideration has been violated by too great a mixture, and even an actual consolidation, of the different powers; and that in no instance has a competent provision been made for maintaining in practice the separation delineated on paper. What I have wished to evince is, that the charge brought against the proposed Constitution, of violating the sacred maxim of free government, is warranted neither by the real meaning annexed to that maxim by its author, nor by the sense in which it has hitherto been understood in America. This interesting subject will be resumed in the ensuing paper.''

''IT WAS shown in the last paper that the political apothegm there examined does not require that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments should be wholly unconnected with each other. I shall undertake, in the next place, to show that unless these departments be so far connected and blended as to give to each a constitutional control over the others, the degree of separation which the maxim requires, as essential to a free government, can never in practice be duly maintained. It is agreed on all sides, that the powers properly belonging to one of the departments ought not to be directly and completely administered by either of the other departments. It is equally evident, that none of them ought to possess, directly or indirectly, an overruling influence over the others, in the administration of their respective powers. It will not be denied, that power is of an encroaching nature, and that it ought to be effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it.''

''After discriminating, therefore, in theory, the several classes of power, as they may in their nature be legislative, executive, or judiciary, the next and most difficult task is to provide some practical security for each, against the invasion of the others.''

''What this security ought to be, is the great problem to be solved. Will it be sufficient to mark, with precision, the boundaries of these departments, in the constitution of the government, and to trust to these parchment barriers against the encroaching spirit of power? This is the security which appears to have been principally relied on by the compilers of most of the American constitutions. But experience assures us, that the efficacy of the provision has been greatly overrated; and that some more adequate defense is indispensably necessary for the more feeble, against the more powerful, members of the government. The legislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex. The founders of our republics have so much merit for the wisdom which they have displayed, that no task can be less pleasing than that of pointing out the errors into which they have fallen. A respect for truth, however, obliges us to remark, that they seem never for a moment to have turned their eyes from the danger to liberty from the overgrown and all-grasping prerogative of an hereditary magistrate, supported and fortified by an hereditary branch of the legislative authority. They seem never to have recollected the danger from legislative usurpations, which, by assembling all power in the same hands, must lead to the same tyranny as is threatened by executive usurpations. In a government where numerous and extensive prerogatives are placed in the hands of an hereditary monarch, the executive department is very justly regarded as the source of danger, and watched with all the jealousy which a zeal for liberty ought to inspire. In a democracy, where a multitude of people exercise in person the legislative functions, and are continually exposed, by their incapacity for regular deliberation and concerted measures, to the ambitious intrigues of their executive magistrates, tyranny may well be apprehended, on some favorable emergency, to start up in the same quarter. But in a representative republic, where the executive magistracy is carefully limited; both in the extent and the duration of its power; and where the legislative power is exercised by an assembly, which is inspired, by a supposed influence over the people, with an intrepid confidence in its own strength; which is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a multitude, yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passions, by means which reason prescribes; it is against the enterprising ambition of this department that the people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their precautions. The legislative department derives a superiority in our governments from other circumstances. Its constitutional powers being at once more extensive, and less susceptible of precise limits, it can, with the greater facility, mask, under complicated and indirect measures, the encroachments which it makes on the co-ordinate departments. It is not unfrequently a question of real nicety in legislative bodies, whether the operation of a particular measure will, or will not, extend beyond the legislative sphere. On the other side, the executive power being restrained within a narrower compass, and being more simple in its nature, and the judiciary being described by landmarks still less uncertain, projects of usurpation by either of these departments would immediately betray and defeat themselves. Nor is this all: as the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people, and has in some constitutions full discretion, and in all a prevailing influence, over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former. I have appealed to our own experience for the truth of what I advance on this subject. Were it necessary to verify this experience by particular proofs, they might be multiplied without end. I might find a witness in every citizen who has shared in, or been attentive to, the course of public administrations. I might collect vouchers in abundance from the records and archives of every State in the Union. But as a more concise, and at the same time equally satisfactory, evidence, I will refer to the example of two States, attested by two unexceptionable authorities. The first example is that of Virginia, a State which, as we have seen, has expressly declared in its constitution, that the three great departments ought not to be intermixed. The authority in support of it is Mr. Jefferson, who, besides his other advantages for remarking the operation of the government, was himself the chief magistrate of it. In order to convey fully the ideas with which his experience had impressed him on this subject, it will be necessary to quote a passage of some length from his very interesting &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia,&quot; p. 195. &quot;All the powers of government, legislative, executive, and judiciary, result to the legislative body. The concentrating these in the same hands, is precisely the definition of despotic government. It will be no alleviation, that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands, and not by a single one. One hundred and seventy-three despots would surely be as oppressive as one. Let those who doubt it, turn their eyes on the republic of Venice. As little will it avail us, that they are chosen by ourselves. An ELECTIVE DESPOTISM was not the government we fought for; but one which should not only be founded on free principles, but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy, as that no one could transcend their legal limits, without being effectually checked and restrained by the others.''

''For this reason, that convention which passed the ordinance of government, laid its foundation on this basis, that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments should be separate and distinct, so that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time. BUT NO BARRIER WAS PROVIDED BETWEEN THESE SEVERAL POWERS. The judiciary and the executive members were left dependent on the legislative for their subsistence in office, and some of them for their continuance in it. If, therefore, the legislature assumes executive and judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be made; nor, if made, can be effectual; because in that case they may put their proceedings into the form of acts of Assembly, which will render them obligatory on the other branches. They have accordingly, IN MANY instances, DECIDED RIGHTS which should have been left to JUDICIARY CONTROVERSY, and THE DIRECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE, DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF THEIR SESSION, IS BECOMING HABITUAL AND FAMILIAR. &quot;The other State which I shall take for an example is Pennsylvania; and the other authority, the Council of Censors, which assembled in the years 1783 and 1784. A part of the duty of this body, as marked out by the constitution, was &quot;to inquire whether the constitution had been preserved inviolate in every part; and whether the legislative and executive branches of government had performed their duty as guardians of the people, or assumed to themselves, or exercised, other or greater powers than they are entitled to by the constitution. &quot; In the execution of this trust, the council were necessarily led to a comparison of both the legislative and executive proceedings, with the constitutional powers of these departments; and from the facts enumerated, and to the truth of most of which both sides in the council subscribed, it appears that the constitution had been flagrantly violated by the legislature in a variety of important instances. A great number of laws had been passed, violating, without any apparent necessity, the rule requiring that all bills of a public nature shall be previously printed for the consideration of the people; although this is one of the precautions chiefly relied on by the constitution against improper acts of legislature. The constitutional trial by jury had been violated, and powers assumed which had not been delegated by the constitution.''

''Executive powers had been usurped. The salaries of the judges, which the constitution expressly requires to be fixed, had been occasionally varied; and cases belonging to the judiciary department frequently drawn within legislative cognizance and determination. Those who wish to see the several particulars falling under each of these heads, may consult the journals of the council, which are in print. Some of them, it will be found, may be imputable to peculiar circumstances connected with the war; but the greater part of them may be considered as the spontaneous shoots of an ill-constituted government. It appears, also, that the executive department had not been innocent of frequent breaches of the constitution. There are three observations, however, which ought to be made on this head: FIRST, a great proportion of the instances were either immediately produced by the necessities of the war, or recommended by Congress or the commander-in-chief; SECONDLY, in most of the other instances, they conformed either to the declared or the known sentiments of the legislative department; THIRDLY, the executive department of Pennsylvania is distinguished from that of the other States by the number of members composing it. In this respect, it has as much affinity to a legislative assembly as to an executive council. And being at once exempt from the restraint of an individual responsibility for the acts of the body, and deriving confidence from mutual example and joint influence, unauthorized measures would, of course, be more freely hazarded, than where the executive department is administered by a single hand, or by a few hands.''

''The conclusion which I am warranted in drawing from these observations is, that a mere demarcation on parchment of the constitutional limits of the several departments, is not a sufficient guard against those encroachments which lead to a tyrannical concentration of all the powers of government in the same hands.'' 

''PUBLIUS.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper argued for separation of powers; in this one Madison argues that the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government must not be totally divided.

Federalist No. 47 argued that the branches of government can be connected, while remaining &quot;separate and distinct&quot;. The argument of No. 48 is that, in order to practically maintain the branches as &quot;separate and distinct&quot;, they must have &quot;a constitutional control&quot; over each other.

The paper begins by asserting that &quot;power is of an encroaching nature&quot;, i.e. those with power will attempt to control everything they can. It then asks how this tendency can be stopped, in order to preserve the &quot;separate and distinct&quot; quality of the branches of government. It then makes the claim that merely defining the boundaries of the branches is an insufficient safeguard. It singles out the legislative branch as being particularly successful in taking over power.

As an aside from the main argument, the paper notes that the danger of the legislative branch taking over has not been thought about by the &quot;founders of our republics&quot;, i.e. the people who wrote the thirteen state constitutions.

The paper offers a number of reasons why legislative over-reaching is more likely in a &quot;representative republic&quot;, as distinct from other types of government. These reasons include the claim that the legislature is &quot;sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a multitude, yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passions&quot; and that its powers are both &quot;more extensive, and less susceptible of precise limits&quot;.

Then two examples of legislative over-reaching are given: Virginia and Pennsylvania.

The Virginia example is primarily a long quote from Thomas Jefferson's ''Notes on the State of Virginia'', in which he corroborates the claims of the paper.

In respect of Pennsylvania, the paper summarizes the conclusions of a report by a &quot;Council of Censors&quot; on apparent violations of the Pennsylvania constitution; it found many. A small rebuttal is made to the claim in the report that many violations were committed by the executive branch, not only the legislative branch.

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE author of the &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia,&quot; quoted in the last paper, has subjoined to that valuable work the draught of a constitution, which had been prepared in order to be laid before a convention, expected to be called in 1783, by the legislature, for the establishment of a constitution for that commonwealth. The plan, like every thing from the same pen, marks a turn of thinking, original, comprehensive, and accurate; and is the more worthy of attention as it equally displays a fervent attachment to republican government and an enlightened view of the dangerous propensities against which it ought to be guarded.''

''One of the precautions which he proposes, and on which he appears ultimately to rely as a palladium to the weaker departments of power against the invasions of the stronger, is perhaps altogether his own, and as it immediately relates to the subject of our present inquiry, ought not to be overlooked. His proposition is, &quot;that whenever any two of the three branches of government shall concur in opinion, each by the voices of two thirds of their whole number, that a convention is necessary for altering the constitution, or CORRECTING BREACHES OF IT, a convention shall be called for the purpose. &quot;As the people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter, under which the several branches of government hold their power, is derived, it seems strictly consonant to the republican theory, to recur to the same original authority, not only whenever it may be necessary to enlarge, diminish, or new-model the powers of the government, but also whenever any one of the departments may commit encroachments on the chartered authorities of the others. The several departments being perfectly co-ordinate by the terms of their common commission, none of them, it is evident, can pretend to an exclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries between their respective powers; and how are the encroachments of the stronger to be prevented, or the wrongs of the weaker to be redressed, without an appeal to the people themselves, who, as the grantors of the commissions, can alone declare its true meaning, and enforce its observance? There is certainly great force in this reasoning, and it must be allowed to prove that a constitutional road to the decision of the people ought to be marked out and kept open, for certain great and extraordinary occasions. But there appear to be insuperable objections against the proposed recurrence to the people, as a provision in all cases for keeping the several departments of power within their constitutional limits. In the first place, the provision does not reach the case of a combination of two of the departments against the third. If the legislative authority, which possesses so many means of operating on the motives of the other departments, should be able to gain to its interest either of the others, or even one third of its members, the remaining department could derive no advantage from its remedial provision. I do not dwell, however, on this objection, because it may be thought to be rather against the modification of the principle, than against the principle itself. In the next place, it may be considered as an objection inherent in the principle, that as every appeal to the people would carry an implication of some defect in the government, frequent appeals would, in a great measure, deprive the government of that veneration which time bestows on every thing, and without which perhaps the wisest and freest governments would not possess the requisite stability. If it be true that all governments rest on opinion, it is no less true that the strength of opinion in each individual, and its practical influence on his conduct, depend much on the number which he supposes to have entertained the same opinion. The reason of man, like man himself, is timid and cautious when left alone, and acquires firmness and confidence in proportion to the number with which it is associated. When the examples which fortify opinion are ANCIENT as well as NUMEROUS, they are known to have a double effect. In a nation of philosophers, this consideration ought to be disregarded. A reverence for the laws would be sufficiently inculcated by the voice of an enlightened reason. But a nation of philosophers is as little to be expected as the philosophical race of kings wished for by Plato. And in every other nation, the most rational government will not find it a superfluous advantage to have the prejudices of the community on its side. The danger of disturbing the public tranquillity by interesting too strongly the public passions, is a still more serious objection against a frequent reference of constitutional questions to the decision of the whole society. Notwithstanding the success which has attended the revisions of our established forms of government, and which does so much honor to the virtue and intelligence of the people of America, it must be confessed that the experiments are of too ticklish a nature to be unnecessarily multiplied. We are to recollect that all the existing constitutions were formed in the midst of a danger which repressed the passions most unfriendly to order and concord; of an enthusiastic confidence of the people in their patriotic leaders, which stifled the ordinary diversity of opinions on great national questions; of a universal ardor for new and opposite forms, produced by a universal resentment and indignation against the ancient government; and whilst no spirit of party connected with the changes to be made, or the abuses to be reformed, could mingle its leaven in the operation. The future situations in which we must expect to be usually placed, do not present any equivalent security against the danger which is apprehended. But the greatest objection of all is, that the decisions which would probably result from such appeals would not answer the purpose of maintaining the constitutional equilibrium of the government. We have seen that the tendency of republican governments is to an aggrandizement of the legislative at the expense of the other departments. The appeals to the people, therefore, would usually be made by the executive and judiciary departments. But whether made by one side or the other, would each side enjoy equal advantages on the trial? Let us view their different situations. The members of the executive and judiciary departments are few in number, and can be personally known to a small part only of the people. The latter, by the mode of their appointment, as well as by the nature and permanency of it, are too far removed from the people to share much in their prepossessions. The former are generally the objects of jealousy, and their administration is always liable to be discolored and rendered unpopular. The members of the legislative department, on the other hand, are numberous. They are distributed and dwell among the people at large. Their connections of blood, of friendship, and of acquaintance embrace a great proportion of the most influential part of the society. The nature of their public trust implies a personal influence among the people, and that they are more immediately the confidential guardians of the rights and liberties of the people. With these advantages, it can hardly be supposed that the adverse party would have an equal chance for a favorable issue. But the legislative party would not only be able to plead their cause most successfully with the people. They would probably be constituted themselves the judges.''

''The same influence which had gained them an election into the legislature, would gain them a seat in the convention. If this should not be the case with all, it would probably be the case with many, and pretty certainly with those leading characters, on whom every thing depends in such bodies. The convention, in short, would be composed chiefly of men who had been, who actually were, or who expected to be, members of the department whose conduct was arraigned. They would consequently be parties to the very question to be decided by them. It might, however, sometimes happen, that appeals would be made under circumstances less adverse to the executive and judiciary departments. The usurpations of the legislature might be so flagrant and so sudden, as to admit of no specious coloring. A strong party among themselves might take side with the other branches. The executive power might be in the hands of a peculiar favorite of the people. In such a posture of things, the public decision might be less swayed by prepossessions in favor of the legislative party. But still it could never be expected to turn on the true merits of the question. It would inevitably be connected with the spirit of pre-existing parties, or of parties springing out of the question itself. It would be connected with persons of distinguished character and extensive influence in the community. It would be pronounced by the very men who had been agents in, or opponents of, the measures to which the decision would relate. The PASSIONS, therefore, not the REASON, of the public would sit in judgment. But it is the reason, alone, of the public, that ought to control and regulate the government. The passions ought to be controlled and regulated by the government.''

''We found in the last paper, that mere declarations in the written constitution are not sufficient to restrain the several departments within their legal rights. It appears in this, that occasional appeals to the people would be neither a proper nor an effectual provision for that purpose. How far the provisions of a different nature contained in the plan above quoted might be adequate, I do not examine. Some of them are unquestionably founded on sound political principles, and all of them are framed with singular ingenuity and precision.''

==Federalist No. 50==
Federalist No. 50 is titled ''&quot;Periodic Appeals to the People Considered&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton or James Madison.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''IT MAY be contended, perhaps, that instead of OCCASIONAL appeals to the people, which are liable to the objections urged against them, PERIODICAL appeals are the proper and adequate means of PREVENTING AND CORRECTING INFRACTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION. It will be attended to, that in the examination of these expedients, I confine myself to their aptitude for ENFORCING the Constitution, by keeping the several departments of power within their due bounds, without particularly considering them as provisions for ALTERING the Constitution itself. In the first view, appeals to the people at fixed periods appear to be nearly as ineligible as appeals on particular occasions as they emerge.''

''If the periods be separated by short intervals, the measures to be reviewed and rectified will have been of recent date, and will be connected with all the circumstances which tend to vitiate and pervert the result of occasional revisions. If the periods be distant from each other, the same remark will be applicable to all recent measures; and in proportion as the remoteness of the others may favor a dispassionate review of them, this advantage is inseparable from inconveniences which seem to counterbalance it. In the first place, a distant prospect of public censure would be a very feeble restraint on power from those excesses to which it might be urged by the force of present motives. Is it to be imagined that a legislative assembly, consisting of a hundred or two hundred members, eagerly bent on some favorite object, and breaking through the restraints of the Constitution in pursuit of it, would be arrested in their career, by considerations drawn from a censorial revision of their conduct at the future distance of ten, fifteen, or twenty years? In the next place, the abuses would often have completed their mischievous effects before the remedial provision would be applied. And in the last place, where this might not be the case, they would be of long standing, would have taken deep root, and would not easily be extirpated. The scheme of revising the constitution, in order to correct recent breaches of it, as well as for other purposes, has been actually tried in one of the States. One of the objects of the Council of Censors which met in Pennsylvania in 1783 and 1784, was, as we have seen, to inquire, &quot;whether the constitution had been violated, and whether the legislative and executive departments had encroached upon each other. &quot; This important and novel experiment in politics merits, in several points of view, very particular attention. In some of them it may, perhaps, as a single experiment, made under circumstances somewhat peculiar, be thought to be not absolutely conclusive. But as applied to the case under consideration, it involves some facts, which I venture to remark, as a complete and satisfactory illustration of the reasoning which I have employed. First. It appears, from the names of the gentlemen who composed the council, that some, at least, of its most active members had also been active and leading characters in the parties which pre-existed in the State.''

''Secondly. It appears that the same active and leading members of the council had been active and influential members of the legislative and executive branches, within the period to be reviewed; and even patrons or opponents of the very measures to be thus brought to the test of the constitution. Two of the members had been vice-presidents of the State, and several other members of the executive council, within the seven preceding years. One of them had been speaker, and a number of others distinguished members, of the legislative assembly within the same period.''

''Thirdly. Every page of their proceedings witnesses the effect of all these circumstances on the temper of their deliberations. Throughout the continuance of the council, it was split into two fixed and violent parties. The fact is acknowledged and lamented by themselves. Had this not been the case, the face of their proceedings exhibits a proof equally satisfactory. In all questions, however unimportant in themselves, or unconnected with each other, the same names stand invariably contrasted on the opposite columns. Every unbiased observer may infer, without danger of mistake, and at the same time without meaning to reflect on either party, or any individuals of either party, that, unfortunately, PASSION, not REASON, must have presided over their decisions. When men exercise their reason coolly and freely on a variety of distinct questions, they inevitably fall into different opinions on some of them. When they are governed by a common passion, their opinions, if they are so to be called, will be the same.''

''Fourthly. It is at least problematical, whether the decisions of this body do not, in several instances, misconstrue the limits prescribed for the legislative and executive departments, instead of reducing and limiting them within their constitutional places.''

''Fifthly. I have never understood that the decisions of the council on constitutional questions, whether rightly or erroneously formed, have had any effect in varying the practice founded on legislative constructions. It even appears, if I mistake not, that in one instance the contemporary legislature denied the constructions of the council, and actually prevailed in the contest. This censorial body, therefore, proves at the same time, by its researches, the existence of the disease, and by its example, the inefficacy of the remedy. This conclusion cannot be invalidated by alleging that the State in which the experiment was made was at that crisis, and had been for a long time before, violently heated and distracted by the rage of party. Is it to be presumed, that at any future septennial epoch the same State will be free from parties? Is it to be presumed that any other State, at the same or any other given period, will be exempt from them? Such an event ought to be neither presumed nor desired; because an extinction of parties necessarily implies either a universal alarm for the public safety, or an absolute extinction of liberty. Were the precaution taken of excluding from the assemblies elected by the people, to revise the preceding administration of the government, all persons who should have been concerned with the government within the given period, the difficulties would not be obviated. The important task would probably devolve on men, who, with inferior capacities, would in other respects be little better qualified. Although they might not have been personally concerned in the administration, and therefore not immediately agents in the measures to be examined, they would probably have been involved in the parties connected with these measures, and have been elected under their auspices.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Because the Moody / Crouch impersonation is so central to the fourth book, I am strongly suggesting that we allow both the false Moody and the real one to appear in the Character pages here under Alastor Moody. If there are no details about Moody in the fourth book &quot;Role in the books&quot; section, it would be a spoiler indeed, one that even a Beginner Spoiler wouldn't be able to avoid. &quot;A major character? And he gets only about two lines? What's going on here? I gotta read this.&quot; Oops.

Details of Barty Crouch's life as himself can and should appear in the Barty Crouch Jr. section, such as they are.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lush is an interpreted language, but individual functions and class methods may be compiled, either to just speed it up, or to enable inline C/C++ code.

== Compiling pure lush functions ==
Functions and class methods may be compiled, with a few modifications. Here's a simple function that we'd like to compile:
&lt;code&gt;
 ;; Prints the size, sum, and mean of a vector
 (de print-mean (vec)
   (let* ((v-size (idx-dim vec 0))
          (v-sum (idx-sum vec)
          (v-mean (/ v-sum v-size))
     (printf &quot;Sum = %f, size = %d, mean = %f\n&quot; v-sum v-size v-mean)
     ())
&lt;/code&gt;
Below we've added some type declarations make the function compilable, and followed it with a compilation command:
&lt;code&gt;
 ;; Prints the size, sum, and mean of a vector
 (de print-mean (vec)
   ((-idx1- (-double-)) vec)
   (let* ((v-size (idx-dim vec 0))
          (v-sum (idx-sum vec)
          (v-mean (/ v-sum v-size))
     ((-int-) v-size)
     (printf &quot;Sum = %f, size = %d, mean = %f\n&quot; v-sum v-size v-mean)
     ())
 
 ; compile &quot;print-mean&quot;
 (dhc-make () print-mean)
&lt;/code&gt;

To be compilable, lush functions must:
* Declare the types of any objects of ambiguous type.
* Use only compilable functions and expressions.
* List the function in the compilation statement at the end of the source file.

=== Declare types ===
In the above function, the lines immediately following the arguments declare the argument types. Note the function doesn't bother declaring the types of any other variable. This is because '''you only need to declare types for function arguments and non-double numeric types.''' This is because function argument types aren't evident at compile-time unless specified, and lush assumes that all numbers are &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;s unless told otherwise.

All type declarations are of the form:
 ((''type_name'') ''var_name'')
For example:
 ((-int-) my-int)

The following lists the type names of the compilable lush types, along with their C++ equivalents:
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
|-
! Lush type !! C++ type !! Description
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;-int-&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;
|  32-bit integer
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;-float-&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;
| 32-bit real
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;-double-&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;
| 64-bit real
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;-short-&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;
| 16-bit integer
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;-byte-&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;
| 8-bit integer
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;-ubyte-&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;
| 8-bit unsigned integer
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;-gptr-&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt;
| Type-indpenedent pointer (size is platform dependent).
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;-gptr- &quot;std::string&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;std::string*&lt;/code&gt;
| Type-specific pointer (same size as &lt;code&gt;-gptr-&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt;)
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;-str-&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;
| Lush string
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;-idx- (-double-)&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;
| Lush tensor (&lt;code&gt;-double-&lt;/code&gt; could be any basic type name.*)
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;-obj- (htable)&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;
| Any other class (&lt;code&gt;htable&lt;/code&gt; is the class name for Lush hash tables).
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Tensors can't contain ''type-specific'' pointers. In other words, the following is not allowed:
 ;; NOT ALLOWED: a tensor of char* pointers
 ((-idx1- (-gptr- &quot;char&quot;)) my-char-pointer-tensor)
But this would be fine:
 ;; A tensor of void* pointers
 ((-idx2- (-gptr-)) my-pointer-tensor)

=== Only use compilable functions ===
Unfortunately, not all lush functions or expressions are compilable. Most functions that are not compilable are those that involve list manipulation. More generally, any particularly &quot;lispy&quot; feature of lush (lambda forms, hooks, code manipulation) will usually not be compilable. To see whether a particular function is compilable, use the function &lt;code&gt;compilablep&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;code&gt;
 ? (compilablep double-matrix)
 = t
 ? (compilablep range)
 = () 
&lt;/code&gt;
Note that &lt;code&gt;compilablep&lt;/code&gt; will only take single function and macro names, not complex lush expressions.

While list manipulation is generally non-compilable, an expression with a list in it is not necessarily non-compilable. For example, the function &lt;code&gt;idx-transclone&lt;/code&gt; necessarily takes a list as one of its arguments, but is still compilable. &lt;!-- So, what's the rule on list compatibility? Is it that list that can be determined at compile-time (e.g. '(1 2 3) ) are ok? Can you assign such &quot;fixed&quot; lists to variables? What is the type declaration of lists? --&gt;

=== Add a compilation command ===
After making your functions compilation-friendly, you must call a compilation function at the end of the source file to actually compile them. Here's a function and two class methods, followed by the compilation function &lt;code&gt;dhc-make&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;code&gt;
 (de some-func (...)
   ... )
 
 (de my-class object
   ... )
 
 (defmethod my-class method-1 (...)
   ... )
 
 (defmethod my-class method-2 (...)
   ... )
 
 (dhc-make ()
           (some-func)
           (my-class method-1
                     method-2))
&lt;/code&gt;
The compilation function actually does 3 things:
* Transcribes the functions/methods into equivalent C code. The C source files for the file &lt;code&gt;src-dir/src-file.lsh&lt;/code&gt; will be in &lt;code&gt;src-dir/C/src_file.c&lt;/code&gt;.
* Compiles this C source file into an object file using gcc.
* Links the resulting object file into memory.
The compilation function only runs if the C source file is older than the Lush source file.

== Mixing in C/C++ code ==
You can insert C/C++ code into lush functions using the &lt;code&gt;#{ ... #}&lt;/code&gt; construct:
&lt;code&gt;
 (de 
You can interleave lush and native code pretty densely:

=== Accessing lush data from C/C++ code ===
The table below shows how to access different lush objects from C/C++ code:
{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
|-
! Type !! lush name !! C/C++ name
|-
| basic type
| &lt;code&gt;my-double&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;$my_double&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| tensor type
| &lt;code&gt;my-float-tensor&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;float* raw_data = IDX_PTR( $my_float_tensor, float )&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| string
| &lt;code&gt;my-str&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;char* c_string = $my_str-&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| object slots
| &lt;code&gt;:my-obj:some-slot&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;$my_obj-&gt;some_slot&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| object method
| &lt;code&gt;(==&gt; my-obj some-method arg1)&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;$my_obj-&gt;vtbl-&gt;M_some_method($arg1)&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| global function
| &lt;code&gt;(add-numbers num1 num2)&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;C_add_numbers($num1, $num2)&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| global constant
| &lt;code&gt;@MY_CONSTANT&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;MY_CONSTANT&lt;/code&gt;
|}

=== Different compilation functions ===
==== dhc-make ====
==== dhc-make-with-libs ====
==== dhc-make-with-c++ ====
=== C code in the compilation function ===
You can stick preprocessor statements and other C code right into the compilation function:

==== #include and #define ====
==== C functions that call the Lush functions ====
If there are lots of them, you can put them in .h and .c files for better readability:
 (dhc-make ()
           #{
           #include &quot;c_funcs.h&quot;
           #}
           
           lush-func-1
           lush-func-2
           ''...''
           
           #{
           #include &quot;c_funcs.c&quot;
           #})

== Linking to libraries ==
libload can return null; be careful.

== Compiling and linking C/C++ source files ==
lushmake. Proper lushmake syntax? The way I do it, it doesn't pay attention to dependencies.

== Quirks ==
=== The problem of hidden arguments ===
One problem with lush functions compiled into C code is that any lush objects that you instantiate within the function become arguments in the C version of the function. These arguments that only show up in the C version of a lush function are called &quot;hidden arguments.&quot; the lush function's signature (e.g. the number and types of arguments it takes) can change. This is because of

=== Booleans ===

=== No &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; return type ===
Lush functions that return &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;code&gt; (a.k.a. &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;) will return a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; in its C incarnation. This can be a problem when you really need your function to not return anything, say when using it as a callback function for some C API that expects a void-returning function:

A &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;-returning function in &lt;code&gt;my-src.lsh&lt;/code&gt;:
 (de my-callback ()
   ...
   ())
...becomes a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;-returning function in &lt;code&gt;C/my_src.c&lt;/code&gt;
 char* C_my_callback(){
 ...
 }

In this case, your best bet is to wrap the lush function in a C function that returns void. The question then is: how do I compile this wrapper function? The simplest way is to stick it right in the compilation function at the end of &lt;code&gt;my-src.lsh&lt;/code&gt;:
 (dhc-make ()
           #{ void callback_wrapper(); #}
           my-callback
           ''... other lush functions &amp; methods ...''
           ''...''
           ''...''
           #{ void callback_wrapper(){ C_my_callback(); } #} )

'''Stack or Heap?''':

=== No &lt;code&gt;cout&lt;/code&gt; ===
Dynamic allocation of wrapped C++ classes: the casting bug

== Issues to consider before compiling ==

There are several issues to consider before deciding whether or not you really want to compile your lush code.
 to be compiled can be more of a hassle than writing the same code in c/c++, for a number of reasons:
* Compilable Lush isn't as feature-rich or visually clean as C++
* Lush compiler errors can be even more opaque than those of C/C++ compilers, especially if macros are involved.
* Loss of debuggability

      <text xml:space="preserve">Somebody knows how to configure php debuger in eclipse??? Write to me admin@it-ideas.eu
Download the dbg Debugger from here:
http://dd.cron.ru/dbg/downloads.php


== Debugger installation for wampp2 distribution (wampp 2.2 contains PHP 4.3.2) ==

1) copy php_dbg.dll (you must extract it from the downloaded file, according to
your php version, and rename to php_dbg.dll) to
&lt;pre&gt;c:\wampp2\php\extensions&lt;/pre&gt;

2) edit C:\wampp2\php\php.ini, and review the following parameters:

; this is to see output while debugging
implicit_flush = On
 
; check this parameter
extension_dir = \wampp2\php\extensions\

; add the dbg extension
extension=php_dbg.dll

; Add this section at the end of php.ini:
[debugger]&lt;br&gt;
debugger.enabled = true&lt;br&gt;
debugger.profiler_enabled = true&lt;br&gt;
debugger.JIT_host = clienthost&lt;br&gt;
debugger.JIT_port = 7869

Note: if you would like to use only one php.ini you can maintain for example a central c:\windows\php.ini and delete the C:\wampp2\php\php.ini and C:\wampp2\apache\bin\php.ini

Additional information about the debugger can be found here: DbgBasedDebugger

== Debugger installation for xampp distribution (xampp 1.6.3a contains PHP 5.2.3) ==

1) copy php_dbg.dll (you must extract it from the downloaded file, according to
your php version, and rename to php_dbg.dll) to
&lt;pre&gt;c:\xampp\php\extensions&lt;/pre&gt; and &lt;pre&gt;c:\xampp\php\ext&lt;/pre&gt;

2) edit C:\xampp\apache\bin\php.ini, and review the following parameters:

; this is to see output while debugging
implicit_flush = On
 
; check this parameter
extension_dir = \xampp\php\ext\

; Add this section at the end of php.ini:
[debugger]&lt;br&gt;
extension=php_dbg.dll&lt;br&gt;
debugger.enabled=on&lt;br&gt;
debugger_profiler_enabled=on&lt;br&gt;
debugger.hosts_allow=localhost&lt;br&gt;
debugger.hosts_deny=ALL&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Forest
In a Disney tradition Snow White escapes to an area with lots of green grasses, meadows, breathe taking water falls. Bambi, flower and cheap and dales are signing and living in peace and harmony in a lash beautiful forest peacefully together. To some degree it is true. Forest is where lots of trees, shrubs, herbs, and mosses do grow. However, a visitor may also fine smaller form of life such as insets and bugs as well as larger animals such as deer and bears manage to occupy the same environment. This delicate form of life has been around for more than 3 billion years ago. They even outlived Dinosaur who appeared and disappeared around the same time. The forest managed to survive until the arrival of civilized man.

In our planet we are lucky to have Tropical as well as well as Hard Wood forest which abundance of life can be found there.

Henry David Thoreau in 1840 said” a primitive forest, of five hundred or a thousands acres , where a stick should never be cut for fuel, a common possession forever, for instruction and recreation…Let us keep the New World New.”

Forest is amazing landscape; if it gets distributed by humans or animals or wild fire can recover by itself. The forests not only play a major role in the existence of animal’s life; it also contributes to the human welfare as well.

Profits, politics, and being just ignorant because the forests to loss their trees being cut down by the big logging g industry without replacing a new one. Not even one single seed has been planted where the tree has been cut. Years ago after a heavy rain the land would weak up to the fresh smell of grass. The trees would stand up like a giant barrier in event of a flood. Now that there are fewer tree many sad tragedy happens; in CA a family was sleep when was swept away by flood without a trace. Many animals are close to be being extinct. Beautiful lash green space is gone and with it the bird’s nests has been destroyed for good.

Before human race takes over the forest there was a balance between the birds and insets .In 1998 one of the hottest summer ever known the mosquito populations were doubled all over the planet. The World Health Organization announces it as “quantitative leaps in Malaria cases around the world.”

The treat of our very existence is at stick; it is in the hands of our scientists to come up with a solution before it is too late. As one of the citizens of the world I urge the governments around the world to listen to them. You live in the same planet with the rest of us and you shall share the same faith as the rest of us also</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Phoenix, welcome to wikibooks!

I have been doing alot of cleanup work on the algebra book, although I admit that I haven't contributed to that book much. However, If you would like to help, I have prepared an outline for how the book ''should look'' [[User:Whiteknight/Algebra|HERE on my user page]]. That outline covers several books ([[Algebra]], [[Linear Algebra]], and [[Abstract Algebra]]), but if you are unfamiliar with some of the advanced subjects, that's perfectly fine. 

I would like to merge the content of the [[Intermediate Algebra]] book into the [[Algebra]] book, because I dont see a reason why we should have two books on the same subject. 

I have been very busy lately, between work and school, and I haven't had the time to work enough on these books. But, I would like to do more of it in the upcoming weeks. You are more then welcome to chip in in any way that you can. If you have any other questions, please let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:26, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Keyboard function==

===Typewriters===
The earlier keyboards attached to the typewriter had its bugs to work out, many of the keys when typed too fast and would run into each other and get tangled up. To fix this they took the keys and rearranged them so people would type slower and less chance of the keys being mixed up. Then the QWERTY and DVORAK keyboard was born.

===QWERTY===
Is designed to slow down the typer's speed. It spaces the keys out to slow down the average typing and is now the most common key board there is. C. L. Sholes is the inventor of the QWERTY keyboard.

===Context Keys===
Context keys make other keys behave differently.  For example, using the &quot;ctrl&quot; key or the &quot;alt&quot; key when using other keys.

===Function Keys===
Used to call up a menu or perform a function, they are located in a cluster on the left side or in a row across the top of the keyboard (F1, F2, etc.). They are often used with the shift, control and alt keys to extend the number of options.
Many programs extend the usefulness of the function keys by using key combinations. The most common combinations are Shift + a function key, Alt + a function key, and Crtl + a function key. These combinations can be very useful. For instance, in Microsoft Word, when any text is highlighted, pressing the Shift key plus the F3 key will change the case of the text from all caps, initial caps, to all lowercase. Shift + F7 will choose the Thesaurus command. These shortcuts allow you to access such functions with one keystroke rather than three or four mouse clicks.

'''F1'''-As a throwback to DOS days, you will find that the F1 key will often bring up a help menu. If you press F1 while working in a program, help for that program will usually appear. If you press F1 while at the Windows desktop or when the Windows Explorer is open, a Windows help screen will pop up. If you happen to be working in a program and would like to see the Windows help screen, simply press the Windows key (the key with the Windows logo on the bottom row of keys) on your keyboard and press F1 at the same time.

'''F2'''-You can use the F2 key to rename an item when working in Windows. Highlight any folder or file, and press F2. You will then be able to type a new name for the object. After you type the new name, just click outside the name box or press the enter key to make the name change. This works just like right-clicking a file or folder and selecting Rename.

'''F3'''-When you are working in Windows, the F3 key will open the Find Files window.

'''F4'''-The F4 key has some very useful functionality. You can press F4 to open the Address bar when working in Internet Explorer. This will allow you to type the address of a Web page for quick access. You can also press the Alt key and the F4 key at the same time to close the open Window that you are currently working on.

'''F5'''-The F5 key is the refresh key. You can press F5 when viewing a Web page to make sure that you have the most current version of that Web page. You can also use F5 when in Windows to refresh the screen. This can be a handy shortcut. If perhaps you are viewing the contents of a floppy disk and you insert a new floppy, your screen will still show the contents of the first floppy. Just press F5 to refresh the screen and see the contents of the floppy you just insert

'''F6'''-This key is often used to move the cursor around the structure of the program. Pressing it will often cycle you from window to window.

'''F7'''-The F7 key does not have any functionality in Windows. It may, however be used in some individual programs. To find out if it is available in the program you are using, bring up the program's help screen and type in the words function key.

'''F8'''-The F8 key can be used to access Safe Mode if pressed during the computer's boot up process. This is a trouble-shooting mode, which will start the computer with minimal drivers.

'''F9'''-The F9 key does not have any functionality in Windows. It may, however, be used in some individual programs. To find out if it is available in the program you are using, bring up the program's help screen and type in the words function key.

'''F10'''-This key is used to activate the menu bar in many programs. You can use F10 to highlight the first menu choice, and then use the arrow keys to move around the menus. Pressing the Shift key while pressing F10 will bring up the shortcut menu. This is similar to right-clicking on an object.

'''F11'''-Press F11 when you are working in Internet Explorer and the window will open to full screen mode. This will make all the toolbars disappear and can be useful to see more information on the screen. Press F11 when you are in full screen mode will toggle you back to your normal view.

'''F12'''-The F12 key does not have any functionality in Windows. It may, however be used in some individual programs. To find out if it is available in the program you are using, bring up the program's help screen and type in the words function key.

==Types of Keyboards==

===Wired===
The very basic and first keyboard was wired to the back of the computer. Current day keyboards are hooked up to a USB port or a PS2 port. In the beginning there was no USB or PS2 ports, so the keyboard had to hook up to a special keyboard connector port.
Included in the wired keyboard and virtually every keyboard are the standard keys. There is all the letters of the alphabet, numbers zero through nine, a delete and backspace key and an alt and control key (for altering the function of another key). Some of the more sophisticated keyborads come with scroll wheels to make scrolling more efficient as well as special keys for different functions like the backlighting or volume control. For safety purposes, some keyboards come equipped with a biometric reader.

===Wireless===
By having an infrared sensor hooked to your USB or PS2 ports, the keyboards with the infrared sensor can send messages to a receiver placed anywhere within the sensor's range. This is handy for those who need to move the keyboard away from the desk or the wire does not reach to the back of the computer. Now a days the keyboards use their own special sensors (radio or Bluetooth) so there are no mixed signals coming from other objects.


Besides having a wired keyboard which you are tied to the computer at all times you can enhance your experience by using a wireless keyboard. 
The advantages of a wireless keyboard include that you are not tied to the hard drive and can use it anywhere within the vicinity of the signal you are receiving from the sensor you connect to the computer. 
On the other hand the disadvantages are you are always changing the batteries on a weekly basis. Thank god they invented rechargeable batteries or you would spend a fortune every month for a pack of batteries.

===Foldable===
Collapsible and easily folded up for easy travel. This is designed for the person on the go. They are designed specifically for PDAs.

===One Handed===
Designed to have all keys in one hand, this key board makes it easy for people to type having all keys more accessible.

===Optical Virtual===
The latest in keyboards, designed to project a image from a sensor onto a table. The light bounces off your fingertips and relays information back to the sensor on where your finger position is depending on where the keys are hitting. Optical Virtual keyboards have been around since 2008 thanks to the engineers at IBM. It has been noted that some of the optical keyboards primarily use a laser to detect finger tip movements, however, other optical keyboards use an infrared beam (invisible beam) as a secondary beam for more accurate results when typing. Optical keyboards can cost the consumer anywhere from 100 dollars up to several hundred.

===Ergonomic Type Keyboards===
Ergonomic keyboards are designed specifically to provide the user with increased comfort and to minimize the risk for hand and wrist injuries. One of the best examples of a ergonomic styled keyboard is the split-key keyboard. These keyboards are designed with a &quot;curved&quot; key layout which is designed to fit the curve of a user's hand so that it has less strain on it and thereby minimizing injury. One of the best examples of an ergonomic keyboard is the split-key keyboard which separates the keyboard into 2 or more sections and allows the users hands and arms to be in a position that is more natural and more comfortable than the standard keyboard.

===Touch Screens Keyboards===
Touch screens allow the user to touch the computer screen with their fingers to select commands or otherwise provide input to the computer associated with the touch screen. There are also multi-touch screens, they recognize input from more than one finger at a time, making it easier and faster to write. Touch screens are found on consumer kiosks, and mobile device up to commercial and other point of sale systems.

==Keyboard Switches==

===Membrane=== 
These switches use a continuous membrane with circuitry built directly into it.  Pressing a key on the membrane completes the circuit.  These types of switches generally provide no audible response and have poor tactile response.

===Mechanical===
These switches are individual points of contact under each key.  There are a variety of different mechanical switches, of which Cherry MX Black, Cherry MX Brown, and Cherry MX Blue are a few examples.  The varying switches all have different attributes, examples being tactile response, audible response, force required to activate, and activation point.
[[File:Cherry blue switch.jpg|thumb|Cherry Blue Switch]]
  
===Rubber Dome===
These switches are a combination of both the mechanical and membrane styles.  In this style there are rubber domes built into a membrane with a conductive material in the center that is used to activate on key press.  This type of switch generally has good tactile response and no audible response.</text>

==Source Data Entry versus Keyboard Entry==

Society is continually attempting to increase speed and efficiency.  This, too, applies to methods of inputting data into computer systems.  Why keep the old, slower, antiquated and less efficient systems of data entry if there are alternatives?

Keyboard entry of some form was once the only means of inputting data into a computer.  A person would enter the data by typing in the information or data using a keyboard.  Today, this has changed significantly.

The interim step of typing in data has often been removed from the process and digital or “machine-readable data” maybe created by “source data-entry devices” and, as a result, input directly into the processor.  Alternatively, the data maybe created and put on magnetic media or output directly onto paper.  This is achieved through the use of source data-entry devices  (Williams &amp; Sawyer, 2007, Using Information Technology: A Practical Introduction to Computers &amp; Communications,  7th ed.,  Montreal: McGraw-Hill Irwin, p. 265).  While few, if any, keystrokes maybe required to achieve data input (depending upon the application and equipment), in general, the keyboard entry process is eliminated and information is automatically entered in digital form from the “source” itself – whether that is a document, bar code, etc.

The following sections will more closely examine scanners, bar-code readers, fax machines, mark- and character-recognition devices, as well as the time and labour saving advantages of these “source data-entry devices.”

==Scanners and Readers: An Overview of Types==

Scanning and reading devices are types of source data entry machines to input automatically data (i.e. prices, code, etc.) in digital form from external sources like bar code to the computer. These types of machine-readable data differ from keyboard data-entry. The main difference between keyboard entry and source data entry is the form of entering data, while scanning devices scan data automatically, in the keyboard you need to type or enter prices or data on the keyboard. 

Other scanning devices (source data-entry devices) different than scanners are bar-code readers, mark- and character-recognition devices, fingerprint scanners, and fax machines.

==Fax Machines - The Early Entry==

The word “Fax” in Latin terms means – make a copy or make similar.  The first fax machine was invented in 1843 by an inventor by the name of Alexander Bain a Scottish mechanic (http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventors/a/fax_machine.htm).  Alexander received the first patent to improve and produce electric currents used in electric telegraph.  Alexander’s first fax machine consisted of a pendulum with a stylus mounted on top which would scan a metal surface.  Alexander Bain was also fascinated with clocks so he combined parts of a clock as well as features of the telegraph to come up with the first fax machine (http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventors/a/fax_machine.htm).  

After Alexander Bain invented the first fax machine other inventors decided to further develop the product.  The second inventor who made additions to the fax machine was Giovanni Caselli who was an Italian Physicist.  In 1862 he built on to Bain’s creation and built a “Pantatelegraph”, which was a synchronizing agent http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/story051.htm. In 1924 The American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T)developed the telephotography machine (a type of fax machine) that was used to send political convention photos long distance for newspaper. In 1926, RCA invented the Radiophoto that faxed by using radio broadcasting technology. It wasn't untill 1947 when Alexander Muirhead invented a very successful fax machine. On March 4, 1955, the first radio fax transmission was sent across the continent.
In 1966 a company that was known as Magnovox developed a more savvy version of a fax machine called a Magnafax Telecopier. Marketed by Xerox, it was a more compact machine that could transmit signals and be connected to the phone line (http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/story051.htm).  It took approximately 6 minutes to send a letter which was an amazing improvement from the earlier versions. 

==Scanners - A Closer Look== 

 
A scanner is a machine that helps enable in the reading of data and information printed on paper such as text, image, drawings, and photos by using optical (light-sensing) technology. This data can be converted into digital form to the computer. A scanner is commonly connected to the computer through of ''USB'', ''Firewire'', ''Parallel'' or ''SCSI port''. Electronic imaging technology is used by scanner to digitalize images.

Users can store on a storage device, display on a monitor, transmit to another computer, and process by a computer.  The files produced by a scanner are images as bit map so that you can not directly edit text that has been scanned if the scanner has an optical character recognition (OCR) system to convert the image into the ASCII characters. 

Scanner differs from one another in the following respects:

'''Dot and Bitmap:'''  Images are conjunction of light, dark or colour dots. A dot is the smallest identifiable part of an image. A grid of dots stored as digital code is called bitmap. Bitmap defines a display space and the colour for each pixel.  

'''Resolution:''' Is the number of pixel of individual points of color contained on a display monitor, expressed in terms of the number of pixels on the horizontal axis and the number on the vertical axis.  Also is called as the density of bitmaps (http://searchsmb.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,290660,sid44_gci212895,00.html retrieved on November 25, 2006)

'''Types of Scanners:''' There are larger scanners as sheet-fed and flatbed scanners, and half-page scanners. Also, there are other available scanners such as business-card, slide, photo scanners, and DocuPen that can scan text from books and articles.

==Bar-Code Readers - Reading Between the Lines==

Consumers have become accustomed to the use of bar codes on products in the retail industry.  Although oftentimes frustrating, especially when missing or unreadable, the use of bar codes on consumer products is commonplace.  

These are the vertical marks on most products.  While there are various kinds of bar code systems, the system most often in use in North America is called the UPC or Universal Product Code as established by the UCC (Uniform Code Council).  

There are also different types of codes, including 1D, 2D and 3D.  

* 1D is the conventional or ordinary vertical style of bar code most of us would recognize on the majority of our purchases.  

* 2D bar codes are less familiar, and exist in two forms (1) a series of hexagons and (2) different-sized rectangles.  These bar codes may be found on our medicine bottles/containers or used by such companies as UPS.  The rectangular format for 2D bar codes is more appropriate for items with limited space considerations, because the data maybe stored or recorded along the height as well as the length of the rectangles. 

One of the most commonly used 2D bar codes today is the QR (quick response) code. This is the code that can be scanned by a consumer on their mobile phone which links the consumer and that particular brand. Consumers are able to find more information about that brand simply by using the camera on the mobile phone to scan the QR code. Consumers might also obtain coupons for that brand or even purchase tickets for an event by scanning the QR code.

   [[File:Qr_code.png|thumb|QR CODE]]

* 3D bar codeshave surface height differences and are most appropriate for “… metal, hard rubber, and other surfaces to which ordinary bar codes will not adhere”  (Williams &amp; Sawyer, pp. 266-268).

In order to make these bar codes usable, it is necessary to read them with a bar-code reader.  The &quot;photoelectric or optical scanners … translate the symbols in the bar code into digital code – a source data entry system --  thereby eliminating the need – in most cases --  for check-out clerks or inventory checkers having to enter prices or quantities into the computer system via a keyboard&quot; (Williams &amp; Sawyer, p. 267).

===How does it work?===
An item’s bar code and corresponding information (price, description, etc.)  is stored in the company’s computer.  When the bar code is scanned the details saved to that bar code are retrieved by the point-of-sale terminal.  These details will be condensed and printed on your receipt.  The details of the sale are recorded in the computer for accounting, inventory counts and assists with management decision-making with respect to product lines (Williams &amp; Sawyer, p. 267).

“Bar code technology saves … loads of money in the long and short term and provides … computer data that’s both accurate and timely beyond expectations … [and] a field known as AIDC or “Automated Identification and Data Collection [can] eliminate relatively-ancient forms of data collection like writing on paper (1,000 years old) and keyboarding (100+ years old) and replace them with computerized and automated strategies”  (http://www.aurorabarcode.com/  Retrieved, Nov 21, 2006).

The use of bar codes and readers has enabled businesses, especially retail enterprises, to advance to a more automated process, the self-scanning checkout.  This will be examined in more detail below.

==Mark- and Character-Recognition Devices==
Character Optical Recognition devices

This software converts characters from an image into actual text for computer processing.  Optical character recognition is visual scanning tool that will read text in hard data and convert it into a text that the computer can read (http://www.auditmypc.com/acronym/OCR.asp).  


Optical mark recognition

This type of software is dramatically different from character optical recognition device.  This mechanism will read and scan marks from a page that is a printed document.  Remember Scantron everyone??? These type of machines will read your answers on a scantron test as well as read lottery numbers on a scanned ticket (http://www.sve.man.ac.uk/mvc/Service/OMR/).  The optical mark recognition machine does not read text it detects shaded or written marks in a shaded area.  This machine is incredibly fast as it can scan and read up to 3,000 sheets per hour (http://www.sve.man.ac.uk/mvc/Service/OMR/).  The optical mark scanner is connected to your personal computer which can then run the special OMR software

==New Age==

IRIS Pen - '''You SCAN it TYPES'''

A pen scanner that recognizes different fonts ranging from typed textbooks, magazines, faxes, spreadsheets to handwritten notes. It works just like a highlighter

How do you use this technology?

1. Simply glide over the text, Data or Image.

2. The pen is attached through your USB port and information is tranfered to Microsoft Word, Excel etc.

==Saving Time and Labour -- The Self Service System==

Do you hate those long lineups at the checkout counter?  Are you frustrated with the checkout clerk that takes too long … in your opinion?  Well, maybe the answer lies in the ever-increasing use of self-service or self-scanning checkouts.  

The use of self-service systems is becoming more prevalent, especially in light of the decreasing availability, and increasing costs, of labour.  

At the self-serve gas bar you may encounter the credit or debit card payment option and at the larger, local retail establishment, you may be able to scan and pay for your purchases using a NCR FastLane self-service scanning system.  The latter system uses bar codes and associated readers in addition to a means of checking or weighing items to verify one’s purchase(s) with the bar code and price (Williams &amp; Sawyer, p. 268).
==3D Scanners==
3D printers are capable of physically producing a model with obvious applications in the product development industries. The printers are capable of being made with in a few minutes (depending on the size) in shop. The printer itself looks like a scaled up version of the common office document printer.

==Types of Scanners==
[[File:Dokumentenscanner.jpg|100px|thumb|A Document Scanner]]

'''Flatbed Scanners''' scan flat objects, one page at a time. They are the most common type of scanner. Flatbed scanners work a bit like photocopiers, which means that what is being scanned has to be kept perfectly still so as to let the scanning mechanism do its work and capture the image. They can also scan slides and film negatives. Scanners used in high-volume businesses have automatic document feeders to scan large amounts of paper documents with just one command.

'''Portable Scanners''' capture text and other data while on the move. There are ''full-page portable scanners'' that allow it to capture entire documents and ''handheld scanners'' that scan text one line at a time. These scanners are powered by batteries and the content they store is transferred to a computer using either a cable or a wireless connection.

==KeyScan &quot;Imaging Keyboard&quot; with Integrated Document Scanner==

The KeyScan keyboard scanner scans a variety of paper documents and plastic cards up to 1mm thickness. The unique &quot;No-Touch AutoScan&quot; software allows you to place the document on the feeding tray of the imaging keyboard without touching any buttons. This multi-function sheet-feed scanner has a single USB connection for both the keyboard and built-in scanner. 600-dpi optical resolution provides high-quality images, high scan speeds and exceptional monochrome performance. This integrated KeyScan keyboard scanner saves you a lot of workspace in your workplace. The function keys provide easier access to internet connectivity. Scanning type: Sheet-feed scanner.</text>

      <comment>Added 6/8 timing to time signature section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Good rhythm is almost essential to good guitar, and probably the simplest to understand. Let's start with some terms:

; Beat
; Bars
; Time signature

All bars (measures) consist of a number of beats. A very easy way to grasp the idea of bars is to learn a 12 bar blues. The time signature shows the number of beats in a bar and the note that will be used for counting. For example, 4/4 - the top of the fraction shows the number of beats and the bottom of the fraction shows the note unit used for counting; which in this case is a quarter note. 4/4 is usually referred to as common time. It may appear on the stave of printed music as either 4/4 or as a &quot;C&quot; as shown below. Whichever way the same information is given - the piece of music has four beats to a bar and the counting note is the quarter note.

[[Image:4-4 Takt.png|4/4, or common time]]

All the notes in Western music have a fractional relationship. We know that in 4/4 time we will be using the quarter note as the reference for counting. Play an open string note slowly and repeatedly while counting in fours. Now play the open string note only when you count 1 and 3. You have just played a half note. To play eighth notes count &quot;1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and&quot; in the same time you would normally count &quot;1-2-3-4&quot;. For sixteenth notes the count is &quot;1-e-and-a-2-e-and-a-3-e-and-a-4-e-and-a&quot;. Here is a list of note values used in Western music:
 
; whole note
; half note
; quarter note
; eighth note
; sixteenth note

In common time a whole note consists of four quarter notes or four beats. Each half note is two beats and quarter note is one beat.
 
There are other possible signatures, 3/4, 2/4, 6/8, 7/4 are some. However it must be noted that over 90 percent of the music ever written has been in common time. Triple time or 3/4 is the second most used time signature. Once again the bottom of the fraction tells us that the counting note is to be a quarter note but this time each bar is to only have a count of 3. This is easily felt by playing and counting &quot;1-2-3&quot;. Triple time may also be called &quot;Waltz time&quot;. Since time signatures are fractional the question will arise as to what is the difference between 3/4 timing and 6/8 timing. If you come across a 6/8 time signature it is best to take this as an indication to play the piece of music &quot;briskly&quot; with even emphasis. It must be remembered at all times that 4/4 timing is the most widely used time signature especially so in rock and pop music.

To further apply the concept of beats, bars and time-signatures; let's play a simple chord progression. Play G and D over two bars with a 4/4 time signature.

It will look like this (each measure separated by a pipe and each beat denoted with a dash):

 G         D
 |- - - - |- - - -|
  v v v v  v v v v 
The &quot;v&quot; from now on denotes a downstroke and a &quot;^&quot; denotes an upstroke. 
Here. you are playing a downstroke on each beat (each tick of the metronome) and nothing in between.  Some people find it easier to practice this without playing any chord, and muting all the strings.  Try that too. 

Let's do some upstrokes now.  


 G         D
 |- - - - |- - - - |
  v^v^v^v^ v^v^v^v^

Here, you are downstroking on the tick (intuitively called the 'downbeat') and upstroking in between the ticks ( the upbeat.  A good way to do this is to count your beats, &quot;one-and two and three and four&quot;  going down on the numbers and up on the ands. Most strumming patterns you can here this going on, but slightly more complicated.  Make sure you are going down on downbeats and up on upbeats.  A lot of people who start playing tend to not follow this, and it mixes up your rhythm badly.  If you keep to this pattern, even with more complicated patterns, you will not lose track of the beat.

If you listen to the above pattern, it will start to sound boring.  But it is the basis of all other patterns.  When you hear a more complicated pattern, most likely the player is missing some strums.  Like this:
 

 G         D
 |- - - - |- - - - |
  v^v^v^v^ v^v^v^v^

==== Joy-stick ====
A Joystick is a general control device that transmits it's angle with two or three dimensions to a computer. It consists of a handheld stick that pivots and how it works is similar to that of a mouse. It also consists of a base and a trigger. You connect the Joystick into the &quot;Joystick input&quot; of your computer for use. They are used usually for games but also are used for things like cranes and trucks. They were especially popular in the mid-90's for control games like Flight Simulator, a flying game.A joystick is very popular and even today some kids use joysticks to play there everyday game.(pac man)etc.

==== Light-pen ====
An input device that utilizes a light-sensitive detector to select objects on a display screen. A light pen is similar to a mouse, except that with a light pen you can move the pointer and select objects on the display screen by directly pointing to the objects with the pen.

==== Touch-screen ====
How to use a touch screen; Touch screen/Pads are devices that are used by a person by simply touching the screen and controlling the mouse with his or her fingers tips along the screen. End users are able to scroll up and down and side to side to find information they are looking for. Touch Pads usually come in the shape of a rectangle and are becoming very common stand alone devices.

[[File:IPad 2 Black Front.jpg|thumb|IPad 2 Black Front]]

Touch Screens are display screens that are sensitive to the touch of a finger or a pointing device.
This removes the keyboard and/or the mouse as the primary input device for interacting with the display's content.  A basic touchscreen has three main components: a touch sensor, a controller, and a software driver. A touch screen sensor is a clear glass panel with a touch responsive surface. The controller is a small PC card that connects between the touch sensor and the PC. The driver is a software update for the PC system that allows the touchscreen and computer to work together. Touchscreen computer systems are perfect for multi-media applications, kiosks, restaurants, computer based training, ATMs (automated teller machines), PDAs (personal digital assistants), retail settings, handicapped, real-estate, executive information systems, and much more. 
  
There are a number of types of touch screen technology: ''' A resistive touch screen panel''' is coated with a thin metallic electrically conductive and resistive layer that causes a change in the electrical current which is registered as a touch event and sent to the controller for processing. '''Surface wave technology''' uses ultrasonic waves that pass over the touch screen panel when the panel is touched. '''A capacitive touch screen panel''' is coated with a material, typically indium tin oxide that conducts a continuous electrical current across the sensor.   Capacitive sensors must be touched with a conductive device being held by a bare hand or a finger, unlike resistive and surface wave panels that can use anything that can point, such as a finger or stylus. '''An infrared touch screen panel''' employs one of two very different methodologies. One method used thermal induced changes of the surface resistance. This method was sometimes slow and required warm hands. Another method is an array of vertical and horizontal IR sensors that detected the interruption of a modulated light beam near the surface of the screen IR touch screens have the most durable surfaces and are used in many military applications that require a touch panel display. '''In a''' '''strain gauge configuration''' the screen is spring mounted on the four corners and strain gauges are used to determine deflection when the screen is touched. '''Optical Imaging''': A relatively-modern development in touch screen technology, two or more image sensors are placed around the edges (usually the corners) of the screen. Infrared backlights are placed in the camera's field of view on the other sides of the screen. A touch shows up as a shadow and each pair of cameras can then be triangulated to locate the touch and  '''Dispersive Signal Technology:''' is the newest technology, introduced in 2002. It uses sensors to detect the mechanical energy in the glass that occur due to a touch. Complex algorithms then interpret this information and provide the actual location of the touch. The technology claims to be unaffected by dust and other outside elements, including scratches. Since there is no need for additional elements on screen, it also claims to provide excellent optical clarity. Also, since mechanical vibrations are used to detect a touch event, any object can be used to generate these events, including fingers and styluses. The technology is still quite new and is not currently widely available. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen

[[File:C-TableImage.svg|thumb|left|500px|Shows the position of Carbon on the periodic chart.]]
[[File:Carbon.gif|thumb|Carbon's symbol on the Periodic Table]]
{{clear}}
==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
[[Image:Diamond-and-graphite-with-scale.jpg|thumb|left|Diamonds and graphite (the stuff that pencil leads are made of) are both made of carbon.]]&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* Carbon has the highest melting point of all of the elements at 3652 °C(6605 °F).
* Most molecules known to science contain carbon.
* Carbon is one of the four main elements in most or all living things (the others are hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.)
* When carbon is heated to a very high temperature it sublimates (changes directly from a solid to a gas).
&lt;/div&gt;
How carbon looks depends on the molecule shape carbon makes.  Carbon has many [[w:allotrope|allotropes]] (see Wikipedia article).  The most famous type of carbon shape is diamond.  Diamond is clear but very shiny.  It is very valuable and the hardest substance from nature.  It is number 10 on the Mohs scale of hardness.  Low quality diamonds can be made from other forms of carbon.  Diamond is also notable for being one of the few substances which conducts heat very well but does not conduct electricity.

Another well known type of carbon is graphite, which is used in pencils.  Graphite is grey instead of clear, and very soft, registering about 1 on the Mohs scale of hardness.

==How was it discovered and how did it get its name?==
Carbon was known prehistorically by ancient people who produced it in the form of charcoal. The name is based on the Latin name ''carbo'', which means charcoal.

==Where is it found?==
Carbon is found in many places. Diamonds, graphite, and oil all contain carbon and can all be found underground.  Carbon is also present in all living things, in organic molecules such as fat and sugar.  Carbon is also found in the atmosphere as part of carbon dioxide and other compounds.  Organic chemistry is a branch of chemistry that is dedicated to studying carbon-containing compounds.  Some scientists speculate that without carbon, life couldn't exist at all.  Others suggest that life based on [[../Silicon|silicon]] is possible.

[[Image:GregBiffleCar.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A racing car. The body of the car is made from steel, it burns petroleum, and it drives on asphalt. All of these substances contain carbon. The car also releases carbon dioxide (the air you breathe out) into the atmosphere as it burns petroleum.]]

==What are its uses?==
Diamonds are often used as decorations and in jewelry. Because diamonds are so hard, they are sometimes used to make blades to cut things, but these blades are very expensive. Graphite is very soft. Because of this, it is often used in pencils. &quot;Lead&quot; pencils are actually carbon.

Carbon separates the oxygen from iron in iron ore in furnaces and allows the useful metal iron to be made. Much carbon is used in making iron. 
When carbon is heated with iron in a furnace, steel is made.

When carbon is combined with hydrogen it forms a molecule called a 'hydrocarbon'. Hydrocarbons are very important because they are used for energy and fuel. Petroleum, such as the gas in your car, is a hydrocarbon and it is used to power vehicles and to make lubricants, among other things.

Carbon is sometimes used in filtration as &quot;activated carbon&quot;, and helps to clean some unwanted materials from water.

When carbon is laid out into a 2-D sheet, it becomes a type of carbon called graphene. Graphene might be used to make computers in the future.

==Is it dangerous?==
Carbon is relatively safe by itself. However, inhaled soot or smoke, which contain carbon, are bad for your lungs. Carbon is part of carbon dioxide which is linked to global warming. Incomplete burning of hydrocarbons releases carbon monoxide, which is very dangerous because it keeps the hemoglobin in your blood from picking up oxygen and basically suffocates your cells, so try not to breathe in the exhausts from your car.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For some weeds, particularly invasive species, biocontrols have been selected and developed as a form of passive control in natural areas. While they are rarely used in garden situations, they are sometimes employed in managing meadows or woodlands. Most weed biocontrols are insects, though certain fungi are also used for some cases.

Biocontrols are much more commonly used for management of pest animals and microorganisms.

'''Organic weed management''' is a particular approach to garden weed control that does not make use of synthetic chemicals. All of the weed profiles in Horticulture include both organic and non-organic methods for controlling particular weeds, since the only excluded methods are those that use the various synthetic herbicides: otherwise the methods are identical.

Organic weed control is most difficult when there are well-established perennial weeds, particularly in densely planted gardens. While methods such as [[../Paper Mulch Barriers|paper mulch barriers]] often work well in these situations, they may not be appropriate in mixed borders with shallow-rooted shrubs. In these cases, vigilance in pulling or cultivating is the only available approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
The user may enter more text than used in a typical single line input field and/or the programmer wants to use a large block of multi-line text to capture user input.

== Method ==
When you have text input that spans multiple lines you can use the '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' control.  The format of the textarea control is the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:textarea ref=&quot;XPathExpression&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:label&gt;Note:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
&lt;/xf:textarea&gt;
&lt;/source &gt;

== Screen Image ==
Here is a screen image using the FireFox XForms extension:

[[Image:XForms-textarea.jpg|center|frame|XForms textarea control with label]]

Note that the label is aligned at the bottom of the left edge.

== Sample Style Sheet ==
Here is some sample CSS code that changes all of the text areas in a form to be 7 characters high and 500 pixels wide.
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
textarea {
   font-family: sans-serif;
   height: 7em;
   width: 500px;
}
&lt;/source &gt;

== Sample Program ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html 
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; 
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;XForms textarea&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;xf:model&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;data&gt;
               &lt;MyTextValue /&gt;
            &lt;/data&gt;
         &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;xf:textarea ref=&quot;MyTextValue&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:label&gt;Note:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
      &lt;/xf:textarea&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
One of the challenges is to be able to format the size of the textarea correctly.  This is usually done in a style sheet.

== Aligning the labels ==
Some forms place textareas within tables.  These tables put the labels on the left cell and the textarea input box on the right.  The following CSS will then align the labels at the top of the row.
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
/* align the label at the top of the left area */
xf|textarea &gt; xf|label {
   vertical-align: top;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''Black Walnut''' or '''American Walnut''' (''Juglans nigra'' L.) is a native of eastern North America, where it grows, mostly alongside rivers, from southern Ontario to southeast South Dakota, and from to Georgia to central Texas. It is seen both as a valuable tree and a serious landscape problem because it produces an allelopathic substance called juglone that interferes with the healthy development of other plants, causing wilting and yellowing of the foliage or in many cases death. 

==Description==
The Black Walnut is a large deciduous tree attaining heights of 30–40 metres (100–130 feet). Under forest competition it develops a tall, clear bole, while the open-grown form has a short bole and broad crown with large, wide-spreading branches. The bark is grey-black and deeply furrowed. The pith of the twigs contains air spaces. The leaves are alternate, 30–60 cm long, odd-pinnate with 15–23 leaflets, the largest leaflets located in the centre, 7–10 cm long and 2–3 cm broad. The male flowers are in drooping catkins 8–10 cm long, the female flowers terminal, in clusters of two to five, ripening in the autumn into a fruit with a brownish-green, semi-fleshy husk and a brown corrugated nut. The whole fruit, including the husk, falls from early to late autumn. The nut itself is dense and very hard. 

==Ecology==
Black walnuts grow in both mature forests and open areas, though more common in the latter because the seedlings are not shade tolerant. They are frequently found in groves, and are often found in association with Black Raspberries, which seem to thrive under the canopy of black walnuts.

The ellelopathic chemical juglone is a very serious issue in the garden, as it suppresses or kills many garden plants, including most lawn grasses (though bluegrass is unaffected). See [[v:allelopathy|allelopathy]] on Wikiversity for materials related to juglone in the landscape.

==Uses==
While rarely planted due to its various problems, black walnuts do provide a nice dappled shade during the summer, have a good branch structure, and of course provide nuts. However, the tree has serious liabilities such as a very late leaf-out in spring, early leaf drop in autumn with little or no fall color, and the large, heavy nuts are actually quite hazardous to anyone underneath them both when they are ripe and on windy days in summer. 

==Maintenance==
Black walnuts are tough trees that usually have few needs, though some trees can be prone to wind damage. The most serious maintenance concern is the nuts, which not only are difficult to pick up, but also pose a hazard to anyone below the trees when they are ripe, to the point that helmets should be worn when working under them from early autumn until the last nuts come down in early winter. The branches are quite strong and heavy, making them easy to climb in, however the rough bark easily snags ropes and throw lines.

==Control==
{{weedcontrol|
| Mowing = Effective.
| Cultivation = Does not work well, due to the deep roots.
| Mulching (for prevention)   = Mulches actually encourage walnuts, as squirrels will be more prone to dig in mulched beds.
| Girdling  = Black walnut will regrow from the base after girdling.
| Coppicing = Can be a good management approach to prevent seed production, as the regrowth stems do not flower for some years afterwards.
| Grinding = Effectively kills the tree, but the juglone will persist in the soil for many years afterwards as the outer roots break down.
| Pulling = 
| Flame  = 
| Barries  = 
| Solarization = 
| Pre-emergents (organic)  = 
| Pre-emergents (synthetic)  = 
| Contact herbicides (organic)  = 
| Contact herbicides (synthetic)  = 
| Systemic herbicides (organic)  = 
| Systemic herbicides (synthetic)  = 
| Drench herbicides (organic)  = 
| Drench herbicides (synthetic)  = 
| Biocontrols (microorganisms)  = 
| Biocontrols (animal)  = 
| Biocontrols (plants)  = Goldenrod is allelopathic to Black Walnut
| Grazing  = Goats will strip and kill young plants, but older trees are protected by the thick bark
| Nutritional controls  = 
| Disposal  = Leaves can be composted as normal, but wood chips, roots, and nuts require a longer period in order to ensure that the juglone is decomposed. Chips should not be used for garden pathways, and are toxic to horses so should never be used as stall bedding.
}}

==Harvesting==
The extraction of the kernel from the fruit of the Black Walnut is difficult. The shell is covered by a thick, indehiscent husk that exudes a dark, staining, strong-smelling juice. Once the husk is removed, the nut itself poses an additional challenge because it is quite literally a hard nut to crack.

The husk is best removed when green, as the nuts taste better if it is removed then. Several methods are used:
*Rolling the nut underfoot on a hard surface such as a driveway is a common method, or on gravel driveways running them over with a vehicle is also a good option.
*Commercial huskers use a car tire rotating against a metal mesh. 
*Some take a thick plywood board and drill a nut sized hole in it (from one to two inches in diameter) and smash the nut through using a hammer. The nut goes through and the husk remains behind. To keep the husk juices from splattering, a board or canvas scrap may be used to cover the nut before hammering.
*There are also grinders specifically designed for de-husking black walnuts, but these will likely be difficult to find.
After the husks are removed, the nuts should be stored in a dry place for at least two weeks to cure. Traditionally they are hung up in bags or baskets to provide better air circulation and prevent molds.

After curing, the nuts can be cracked with a hammer, axe, or a heavy nut-cracker (screw types work better than squeeze types due to the strength of the shell). The meat can then either be roasted or salted for long-term storage.

===Wood===
Black Walnut is highly prized for its dark-colored true heartwood. It is heavy and strong, yet easily split and worked. Walnut wood has historically been used for gunstocks, furniture, flooring, coffins, and a variety of other woodworking products. It is so valuable that so-called &quot;Walnut Rustlers&quot; have been known to harvest it illegally by posing as forestry officials, cutting trees during the night, and even using helicopters to take them away quickly; such overharvesting has greatly reduced its numbers and range since colonial times. 

Landscape trees can sometimes be sold for the lumber, as long as the branches begin fairly high off the ground and the trunk is quite thick, since the outer, light-colored wood is not valuable as lumber (but makes very good firewood).

==Pests and diseases==
Black walnuts rarely succumb to pests and diseases unless otherwise weakened, but otherwise can be affected by the same problems as the English walnut (''[[../Juglans regia/]]''). The most common aesthetic problem is the fall webworm (''[[../Hyphantria cunea/]]'').

The default layout for a textarea is often not what you want.  The size of the textarea may not be correct or the label may not be positioned correctly.  This program shows you how to change this.

== Screen Image ==
Here is a sample screen image.  The example includes the default textarea and a small, medium, large and extra large version.  Note that if the content exceeds the textarea a scroll bar is automatically added to the control.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Blended Learning can simply be defined as the use of two or more technologies to deliver training to the student. These technologies can range from m-Learning (Mobile Learning) to ILT (Instructor Led Training) to Self-Paced Learning. Choose your methods wisely so that they effectively communicate your message to the student. 

For Example it might be said that anything can be taught via CBT (computer based training), however this may not be the best approach in the case of teaching a Ferrari mechanic how to adjust the valves on an Enzo. I personally would want to know that if I brought my Enzo to the dealership to have the engine worked on in any capacity that perhaps the person about to perform the work has done more than a cbt. Perhaps Ferrari used the blended learning approach and maybe it would look like this (very simplified):

*Introduction or history of Ferrari motors - Video Presentation 
*Overview of the Enzo - CBT/WBT
*Components of the Ferrari Enzo motor - Distance Learning
*Connecting Test Equipment on Ferraris - Simulation 
*How to adjust the valves - ILT 
*Adjusting valves - Self Paced Practice
*Adjusting valves - Instructor Facilitated
*Certified Exam - Instructor Facilitated

All of these things could have been taught via any given technology or methodology, however it is safe to say that certain methodologies are best suited for delivering certain types of material.

Blended learning techniques are designed to take account of the different learning styles of end users, and age and education factors are important determinents of this. For this reason, you need to consider your demographics carefully and select the most appropriate `mix' for your target audience. Older students generally prefer an ILT approach; however younger, more `tech savvy' end users are often happier with on-line learning.

== Small restructuring... ==
I've done a small restructuring to enable the creation of small chapters and comply with the request to fragment the text.
A linear approach was not fallowed on the development of the content so rearrangements are not extremely useful but I've selected a down to top approach and worked the sections titles a bit to provide more context and structural consistency. If no one opposes the changes and no better section names appear in 7 days I will try to split the content based on the created structure.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:56, 8 April 2010 (UTC)

== Time to get this moving again. ==

It looks like this Wikibook was largely if not compeltely abandoned, which is a serious shame because there's ''so'' much to say. I have an academic interest in historical computing and unless objections show up, I intend to start working on it.

==What does it look and feel like?==
Calcium is a soft, gray metal.  When it burns, it burns with a yellowish-red flame.  When it is exposed to air, it develops a gray-white coating because it reacts with the oxygen in the air to form a coating of calcium oxide (lime.)

==How was it discovered?==
Calcium has been known since Ancient Roman times. The Romans discovered a way to make calcium oxide by heating limestone in a furnace. However, it wasn't until 1808 that pure calcium was isolated by Sir Humphrey Davy.

==Where did its name come from?==
Calcium gets its name from ''calcis'', which is a Latin word that means lime.

'''Did You Know?'''
* As wet calcium hydroxide combines with air it becomes hard calcium carbonate. This chemical reaction is what causes cement to harden.
* Calcium is the most common metal in animals.
* Stalactites and stalagmites are made primarily of calcium carbonate.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Calcium is not found pure as an element due to its great tendency to react with other elements to form compounds, but it is commonly found in the compound calcium carbonate (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Many rocks such as limestone, marble, chalk, and calcite contain this substance. Limestone caves are a great example of where calcium can be found. Seashells and snail shells are primarily of calcium carbonate. Eggshells are mostly made from this compound too. 

Calcium is also found in significant amounts in many foods. Dairy products like milk, yogurt and cheese contain calcium. Green vegetables also often have calcium. Broccoli, collard greens, almonds, sesame seeds, and beans all contain significant amounts of calcium.

==What are its uses?==
Calcium is important for our body to run. It helps build strong bones and teeth, and it allows our muscles and brain cells work.

Calcium is an important substance in the building industry, because calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used in cement and mortar. Calcium carbonate is also used in plastics and adhesives as a filler. Because calcium oxide (CaO) neutralizes acid it can be used to decrease the effects of acid rain in rivers and lakes. Calcium is also commonly used in heartburn and antacid tablets.

==Is it dangerous?==

No, most calcium compounds aren't dangerous.  In fact, calcium is an essential nutrient that is needed by the human body to help build strong bones and teeth. 

Calcium metal has a very high boiling/melting point.

[[File:Oxygen.gif|thumb|Oxygen's symbol on the Periodic Table]]
{{clear}}
==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
[[File:Liquid Oxygen.gif|thumb|left|150px|Liquid oxygen is blue.]] Oxygen comes in two common forms, diatomic oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), although larger molecules such as O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; can occur under very rare conditions.  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a colorless gas in most conditions, but when it is liquid it is blue.  O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a blue, toxic gas with a sharp odor.

==How was it discovered?==
In 1772, Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that heating mineral oxides generated a gas that supported combustion (burning) better than air.  He was able to collect a pure form of this gas for his experiments, but waited several years to publish his results.

In the meantime, in 1774, Joseph Priestley independently performed similar experiments to generate and collect oxygen gas.  Like Scheele, he demonstrated oxygen's ability to support combustion better than air.  In addition, he showed oxygen was able to support life in mice up to four times as long as in air.  He promptly published his results and is generally credited as the discoverer of oxygen.

==Where did its name come from?==
Oxygen comes from Greek and means &quot;acid forming.&quot; When oxygen was named, scientists thought all acids contain oxygen, but now we know that's not true, although most of them do (acetic acid, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH, which is the acid in vinegar, and sulfuric acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or oil of vitriol, do contain oxygen, but hydrochloric acid, HCl, does not.)

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* Oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust.
* Most of the oxygen in our atmosphere comes from photosynthesis in plants or biosynthesis in bacteria.
* Oxygen is the third most common element in the universe.
* Oxygen is responsible for 61% of your body weight.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Oxygen is found all over the Earth, in the crust and in the atmosphere. Oxygen is also found in the water that covers most of the earth's surface.

==What are its uses?==
[[Image:Scuba-diving.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Scuba divers use tanks filled with a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen to breathe under water. Water itself is made from oxygen and hydrogen atoms.]]  Without oxygen, life as we know it would not exist.  There are only a few microbes known that do not require oxygen to live.  Every other life form including tiny bacteria, fungus, trees, animals and people needs oxygen.  Oxygen is crucial to our bodies &amp;mdash; we need oxygen from the air to survive.

Ozone in the atmosphere helps shield the Earth from harmful UV rays given off by the sun.

Oxygen is used along with another gas called acetylene to power metal welding or cutting torches. Rockets carry oxygen in tanks to mix with fuel. The combustion of the fuel and the oxygen is what propels the rocket. 

Scuba divers carry tanks of oxygen mixed with nitrogen that allow them to breathe under water.

It is also used in respirators in hospitals for people who can't get enough oxygen themselves (for instance, if they can't breathe on their own.)

==Is it dangerous?==
O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can actually be toxic, even though we rely on it to survive.  This is only true at very high concentrations of oxygen.

Ozone can be toxic because it oxidizes things even more easily than O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Oxygen can also help the spread of fire, so it can be dangerous for that reason.

Oxygen is very reactive, and, as a result, can combine with other elements very easily. Some of those compounds are more dangerous than the element. Oxides of nitrogen and sulfur are very dangerous.

[[Image:Au-TableImage.png|thumb|left|400px|Shows the position of gold on the periodic chart.]]
[[Image:Gold.gif|thumb|Gold's symbol on the Periodic Table]]
{{clr}} 
[[File:Calice du sacre Tau.jpg|thumb|A French chalice (cup) 800 years old.  It shows many ways that gold can be worked.]]
Gold is a yellow precious metal that is valued for its beauty and shine.  Gold is softer than many other metals and can be formed into different shapes using simple tools and without fire or other heat. Because it can be found in clumps and is easy to work, it is believed to be the first metal that was used by humans. It has been used for making coins and jewelry for thousands of years. Today it is still used to make jewelry.  Because it is a rare metal, it is a symbol of wealth. It is also used in electronic devices such as computers.  

Gold may be worked into all sorts of shapes.  It can be rolled into tiny shapes. It can be pulled into thin wire, which can be twisted and plaited.  It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.  It can be made very thin, and stuck onto other metal.  It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called &quot;illuminated manuscripts&quot;.     

Gold does not &quot;react&quot; with many other chemicals.  This means that it does not lose its shine, or rust, or burn, or explode.   When ancient gold coins or jewellery are found, they look as shiny and beautiful as the day they were made.

==Where did its name come from?==
Gold gets its English name from the Germanic word ''gulþa'' (meaning gold). The Old English word ''geolu'' means yellow. In Latin, gold was called ''aurum''. That is why the chemical symbol for gold is '''Au'''.

==Where is it found?==
Gold is rare, which means it is difficult to find. Gold is usually found underground, where it is dug out of ''mines'' that are tunnelled deep into the earth.  Gold is usually found as thin layers in rocks, but is also sometimes found in lumps.  A lump of gold is called a nugget.

Gold can sometimes be found above the ground in the sand and gravel bars of streams.   Flakes and grains of gold that are trapped in rock come loose as the rock is broken up by the force of the water.  The water then carries the gold downstream. When the stream slows down, the gold settles along with sand and gravel.  People sometimes look for loose gold in streams, or in places where streams have once flowed.  This is called &quot;prospecting&quot;.  A prospector often carries a wide pan, to scoop up the sand and gravel from the bottom of a stream and swish it around, looking for tiny flakes and nuggets of gold. This is called &quot;panning for gold&quot;.

[[Image:Wisoff_on_the_Arm_-_GPN-2000-001069.jpg|thumb|Gold is used to coat the visor of space suits in order to protect the astronaut's eyes from infrared radiation.]]

==Is it dangerous?==
Gold is not dangerous.  Very pure gold leaf (sometimes called &quot;edible gold&quot;) is safe to eat and is sometimes used to decorate food.  Gold is so safe to put in your mouth that many people have false teeth and fillings made out of gold.  Sometimes gold has &quot;impurities&quot;.  This means that small amounts of different chemicals are in the gold.  The impurities in the gold may be poisonous. 

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* Gold was probably the first metal used by humans.
* Gold is so soft that people used to bite gold coins to make sure they were real.
* A single gram of gold can be pounded into a sheet of gold leaf covering a square meter.
&lt;/div&gt;

Helium is seen on earth as a colorless and odorless gas. It is the clearest element, and even in a liquid state (which can only be achieved by either applying great pressure or extreme cold) it is almost completely transparent.  However, in a plasma state (see below,) it emits a pinkish glow.

==How was it discovered?==

Helium was discovered in the Sun in 1868 by an astronomer, Sir Norman Lockyer. He was using a technique (then new) called spectrography, which breaks light into its separate colors. Each element produces a different spectral pattern of bright lines. Lockyer noticed a line in sunlight that didn't match any known element and realized it belonged to a new element not found on Earth.

About 27 years later, in 1895, Sir William Ramsay discovered helium on Earth in a uranium mineral, cleveite. It was discovered independently about the same time by P.T. Cleve and Nils Langlet.

==Where did its name come from?==
Helium gets its name from ''Helios'', the Greek god of the sun.

'''Did You Know?'''
* Helium is the second most common element in the universe.
* Helium is a noble gas, so it doesn't react very easily.
* Helium was used to learn that the structure of the atom had a dense nucleus and an electron cloud.
* Even at absolute zero, helium is still a liquid.  It can only be solidified by applying extreme pressure to liquid helium.
* Near absolute zero, liquid helium will crawl along any surface; this is called ''superfluidity''. Superfluid helium has zero viscosity (thickness.)
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Helium is found very commonly in the universe, but not very common on Earth. Today, most helium comes from Texas and Kansas in the United States. It is extracted along with natural gas from wells drilled into the ground.

==What are its uses?==
Helium is used to inflate balloons and blimps because it is the second lightest element (after Hydrogen), but doesn't burn like Hydrogen can.

Helium is often used (along with oxygen and sometimes nitrogen) in breathing gas for divers that go very deep, where high pressure is needed. (Normal air at this pressure causes ''nitrogen narcosis'', a state similar to being drunk.)

Liquid helium is the coldest liquid known (even at absolute zero, it remains a liquid) and is often used in cryogenic applications such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), where the extreme cold makes it possible to create extreme magnetic fields.

==Is it dangerous?==
Though helium is nontoxic, if you breathe in too much helium you can suffocate through lack of oxygen.

[[File:Quartz Brésil.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A quartz crystal. Quartz is made of Silicon Dioxide]]Silicon is a dark grey and metallic-looking solid.

==How was it discovered?==
Silicon was first identified by Antoine Lavoisier in 1787. It was then discovered by Jons Jacob Berzelius in Stockholm, Sweden in 1824.

==Where did its name come from?==
Silicon gets its name from ''silicis'', which is Latin for flint.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* Silicon is the second-most abundant element in the Earth's crust, behind only oxygen.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Silicon is present in the sun and meteorites. Silicon makes up one quarter of the earth's crust. It is the second most abundant element on Earth, behind only oxygen. Silicon is not found free in nature, but occurs chiefly as silicon dioxide and as silicates. Sand, quartz, rock crystal, amethyst, agate, flint, jasper, and opal are some of the forms in which the dioxide appears. Granite, feldspar, clay, and mica are some of the silicate minerals.

==What are its uses?==
[[Image:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A computer chip is etched on a thin wafer of silicon.]]Silicon is one of the most useful elements. In the form of sand and clay it is used to make concrete and brick. Silicates are used in making enamels, and pottery. Silica, as sand, is the principal ingredient of glass. Glass can be made into bottles, windows, lenses, and thousands of other objects. 

Silicon can be used in transistors, solar cells, microprocessors and other electronic devices. It is an important ingredient in steel. Silicon carbide is used as an abrasive, and is used to coat some sandpapers

==Is it dangerous?==
No, silicon is not generally dangerous, but miners and stonecutters can develop a serious lung disease known as silicosis if they breathe in too much silicate dust, because the sharp edges of the silicate particles tear the alveoli (parts used to absorb oxygen from the air) and cause damage to the lungs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is a Microprocessor? ==

A '''microprocessor''' ('''microscopic processor''' or '''processor on a chip''') is the miniaturized circuitry of a computer processor -- the CPU, the part that processes, or manipulates, data into information.  It is the most important part of personal computers and workstations.  It controls logic of almost all digital devices, for example: mobile devices, clocks and computers.  Microprocessors are different on the basis of instructions set, bandwidth and clock speed. It is very tiny in size but it can perform various operations within a matter of few seconds.  It is like a engine that goes on when the computer starts.  Computers cannot perform any operations without a microprocessor. Microprocessors take the data as an input, translate it into a machine language and display the result as an output.  We use so many things in our daily life which work with embedded systems and microprocessors are a part of it. Microprocessors technology has taken a once bulky series of switches and miniaturized powerful electronic circuitry to be able to fit in personal computers, cell phones, pda's, and other popular devices. When referring to microprocessors, people are usually talking about the CPU, which is made up of at least one microprocessor that handles the chief &quot;brain&quot; functions.

According to scientific law, the speed of microprocessors will increase rapidly from year to year, and you can see evidence of this as current technology becomes outdated very quickly. Microprocessors are necessary in almost any engineering project. Circuit board design may depend on a specific microprocessor construction that can be supplied through contract manufacturing, and outsourced services.

Some examples of Microprocessor brands are:

*Pentium 4 Processor
*G4 by Macintosh
*G5 by Macintosh

== Workstation ==
The Work Station Computer is an expensive, powerful personal computer, usually used for the complex scientific mathematical and engineering Calculations and for computer aided design and manufacturing. These computers are commonly used by engineers and other scientific people who would need the extra power in a computer for many many , calculations. The workstation offer many capabilities similar to the midsized main frames, such as designing car engines and intricate mechanical functions. The workstations have incredible graphic capabilities witch has helped catch the public's eye. The capabilities of a low end workstation overlap those of a high end desktop microcomputer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Power supply==

The computer's power supply unit (PSU) turns the mains voltage (110V or 240V [[alternating current]]) into the different [[direct current]] voltages required by the computer's components.

For personal computers, there are three types of PSU still in use: AT, ATX and ATX-2.  ATX-2 is the most recent standard.  AT is only in use in the oldest personal computers.

==Bays==
A bay is a shelf or an opening used for the installation of drives into the computer(Ex. Hard drive or DVD drive). A computer may come equipped with 4 to 8 bays, empty bays are covered by a panel.When the bay is accessible its open to the outside of the PC, and if its hidden its closed inside the PC case.

==CD-ROM==

&lt;B&gt;CD-ROM&lt;/B&gt; (an abbreviation of &quot;Compact Disc Read-Only Memory&quot;) is a compact disc that contains data accessible by a computer. While the compact disc format was originally designed for music storage and playback, the format was later adapted to hold any form of binary data. CD-ROMs are popularly used to distribute computer software, including games and multimedia applications, though any data can be stored . Some CDs hold both computer data and audio with the latter capable of being played on a CD player, whilst data is only usable on a computer. These are called Enhanced CDs.
There are several formats used for data stored on compact discs, known collectively as the Rainbow Books. These include the original Red Book standards for CD audio, White Book and Yellow Book CD-ROM[1]. ISO 9660 defines the standard file system of a CD-ROM, although it is due to be replaced by ISO 13490. UDF format is used on user-writeable CD-R and CD-RW discs that are intended to be extended or overwritten. The bootable CD specification, to make a CD emulate a hard disk or floppy, is called El Torito

==Motherboard==
&lt;p&gt;The ''Motherboard'' is a flat circuit board housed in the computer's case. Several indispensable  computer components such as microprocessors chips, RAM chips,ROM chips, expansion slots, and co-processor slots operate from the motherboard, which according to the '''Using Information Technology''' text is akin to the central nervous system. It contains a number of components that are critical to the function of the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's explore some of these components in more detail starting with the microprocessors or ''Central Processing Unit''. CPU is the computer's brain. It converts data into information which tells the computer what to do. For example, when you left click on the Windows Explorer Icon on your desk top. This command is first sent to the CPU which relays a message telling the Windows Explorer Icon to open. Even simple actions like typing &quot;A&quot; on the key pad must be processed by the CPU before it can appear on your screen. Some of the leading microprocessor or microchip makers are, Intel,IBM, and Apple. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;''Random Access Memory'' or RAM is the main primary storage facility on you computer. It keeps information more readily accessible but stores it only temporarily.If your computer freezes or the power goes off, while you are working on a Word document for example, all your work will be lost. Thus, it is important to frequently save your work which will store your document in a secondary storage facility (hard drive) where it is retrievable even if your computer malfunctions.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;ROM or ''Read Only Memory'' is a nonvolatile storage facility where information cannot be readily added or removed by the user with out special knowledge. Instructions like how to start the computer or where to put icons on the desktop are stored here. The manufacturer puts these instructions in the ROM when the computer is being assembled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;''Flash Memory'' is nonvolatile memory that can be used by the computer or user.  It can be erased electronically and rewritten. Most computers use flash memory for start-up instructions because it is easy to update.  Flash memory is used in different portable devices such as mobile phones, digital cameras, portable digital media players and portable computers.  Flash memory is also used in storage media such as flash memory cards and USB flash drives.
&lt;p&gt;[[File:Flash memory cards size.jpg|100px|thumb|Flash memory cards]]

&lt;p&gt;The motherboard also houses ''expansion slots'' which allow the user to expand the computers capabilities. If you want to add a video card, sound card, fax machine or printer, the connectivity for these devices is found on the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; All things considered, clearly the motherboard is an indispensable component of the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

4 types of Memory

=1.RAM =

So what is RAM Memory?

Basically Ram, or random access memory, temporarily stores both software instruction and data. It is stored both before and after it is processed by the CPU. It is basically your computers short term memory.

RAM, is only temporarily memory, as it requires electicity to maintain the information stored in it. Hence, once the power is off the information is gone. Because of this, RAM is also been dubbed the Volatile storage area.

RAM is just like CPU, it also contains the electronic circuits etched onto chips, which in turn, are plugged to motherboard, hence called memory modules. Every computer is installed with different memory modules, like desktop and servers computer use dual in line memory modules whereas notebooks use small version memory modules namely small outline DIMM or SO-DIMM. In addition to that, many personal computers today are installed with two to four slots among them one will always be filled, but other slots are always available to install additional memory modules to it; to increase the performance of the computer.

Ram is measured in megabytes. Most computers today provide at least 256MB of RAM memory... of course this can be increased. The easiest wasy to tell if you overloading your RAM memory is to open several applications at the same time and run each. The response rate ( quickness) on how the applications respond from your inputs, will give you and idea of the amount of information your RAM can handle at any one time.... The more programs or applications running the slower the response.. Reason for this is that once the RAM becomes overloaded, the software will then start running applications off your hard drive which of course slows the overall performance of the computer. 

There are 4 types of RAM Memory:

#DRAM  - Dynamic RAM
#SDRAM - Synchronous Dynamic Ram
#SRAM  - Static Ram
#DDR-SDRAM - Double date rate synchronous dynamic ram

ROM meaning Read-Only Memory is memory whose contents can be accessed and read but can't be changed. It is mainly used in computers but it is also used in other electronic devices. Since it can't really be written to, it's main use is the distribution of Firmware. ROM is in the shape of a &quot;computer chip&quot;. It can only be read with the exception of being written on once during the step called &quot;programming&quot;. ROM's also cannot be erased or re-programmed. There are many different types of ROM including PROM's(Programmable Read-Only Memory). ROM is measured in Megabytes.

These nonvolatile chips are attached to the motherboard inside the system unit.  ROM chips store the permanent instructions for the computer (also known as firmware) and the information stored here is retrieved as needed by the computer.  Being nonvolatile, the information is not lost once the computer has been shut off.  

ROM would include such things as the computer's BIOS (basic input/output system), which are the instructions the computer follows for booting up.  It would also include directions for performing a POST (power-on self-test).  Neither the BIOS nor the POST can be updated in traditional ROM.  However, with the advent of flash memory and its replacing of traditional ROM, these operations can now be updated during the life of the device.

=3.CMOS=
Also known as a RTC/NVRAM  or CMOS RAM, CMOS is short for Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor. CMOS is an on-board semiconductor chip powered by a CMOS battery inside IBM compatible computers that stores information such as the system time and system settings for your computer. A CMOS is similar to the Apple Macintosh computer's PRAM.

Flash memory is the most common type of storage for portable devices such as digital cameras and phones.  It can be used to transfer data from one device to another, and most computers today come with a flash memory card reader.  Secure Digital (SD) is one of the most widely used flash memory media and it comes in different sizes.  The standard size are generally used for cameras, and the miniSD and microSD are generally used for cell phones, and are about one quarter to one half the size of the standard SD card.  There are adapters available for the smaller sized SD cards so they can be used in the standard flash memory card reader.  The capacity for these cards is growing and is up to 4 GB for standard cards and 32 GB for high-capacity cards.

=4.Flash=
'''Flash memory'''- is a form of non-volatile computer memory that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed.

'''''Flash memory is available in 3 forms:'''''
1. ''Flash memory card'' (aka RAM cards)- Removable storage media that is indersted into a flash memory port. It retains data when the power is turned off.
2. ''Flash memory sticks''- Flash memory that plugs into a memory stick port which is very convenient to transport and use.
3. ''Flash Memory drives''- finger sized module of flash memory that plugs into the USB portsof nearly any PC or Mac.

&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''FUTURE OF RAM'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

As the ever quickening world of technology grows, new hardware is being demanded. RAM that we know now is volatile. When power is cut to the computer, data isn't retained in RAM. New methods are under development of nonvolatile RAM where data will continue to be held while no power is being supplied. Magnetic RAM is on the threshold of becoming very useful. It uses magnetic polarization to store information.

'''Flash memory''' is a nonvolatile chip that is used for storing items from a computer or from a user. This can also be easily erased and rewritten as often as needed. They are built into all types of technology devices, like cell phones, cameras, portable computers and IPod’s. Flash memory can come in different sizes. The most common GB people purchase is 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, and 32GB. 

[[File:USB Flash Drive animated.gif|thumb|right|USB Flash Drive]]
Flash Memory Drives or USB flash drives are a portable storage device that use a type of electronic memory called flash memory.  Flash memory is referred to as solid-state, meaning that what makes it work is electronic and not mechanical.  Flash drives can be used to back-up/store information such as text documents and pictures.  They are compatible with a variety of devices from computers to digital cameras and even video game systems!  Flash drives are a convenient and fairly inexpensive mode for storing information and allowing the user to take important data with them for use wherever they made need it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==INFRA-RED Port==

'''History:'''

The notion of infra-red was developed by Sir William Hersehel in the 1800's. The infra-red port is designed to communicate with other devices equipped with IRDA ports without the use of wires.

Examples of infra-red enabled devices include:
* T.V.
* VCR
* PDA's
* Laptops

==USB Ports== 
==== Purpose of USB ==== 
USB was designed to be low cost and to be used in cheap devices like mice and game controllers with the ability to connect multiple USB devices and have faster speed and also easier to use with its capability of &quot;plug and play&quot;, which allows you to remove the device while the PC is running. 
==== The USB Connection and Its Standards ==== 
The newest version of USB is 2.0 and most of the PCs today have the 2.0 USB port. Older PC versions that have USB 1.1 will have to buy a 2.0 add-on upgrade to be able to hook up 2.0 USB devices. 
One of the benefits USB ports have is what is called a &quot;daisy chain&quot;, or the ability to connect multiple USB devices to a single USB port on one computer. When more USB devices are needed a USB hub can be connected which enables the &quot;daisy chain&quot; to become very large. The problem with chaining too many devices is that the data signal weakens. There are some USB ports like modems, that are more efficient and transfer data faster when connected directly to the main USB port on the PC. 
Wireless USB technology was introduced in 2004 which can be very useful in home and office environments, because it ranges from 9 to 30 feet. Wireless USB products became available in 2006.Fire Wire is an analog of USB cable, designed and used on all products created by Apple Corp. This is a high-speed external connector that provides connection between a computer and peripheral devices. For the specialist is also known as IEEE 1394. Simply how it works. There are two kinds – backplane bus- rates are 12.5,25, or 50 MB per second and  the cable interface – rates are 100, 200 or 400 MB per second. Fire Wire provides two types of f data transfer: asynchronous and isochronous. Asynchronous is for traditional load-and-store applications where data transfer can be initiated and an application interrupted as a given length of data arrives in a buffer. Isochronous data transfer ensures that data flows at a pre-set rate so that an application can handle it in a timed way. For multimedia applications, this kind of data transfer reduces the need for buffering and helps ensure a continuous presentation for the viewer. Comparing a similar Universal Serial Bus (USB) and Fire Wire could find a couple differences. USB is less expensive, but the data transfer is limited to 12 Mbps.

==Dedicated==
Dedicated ports are computer interface slots which are connected to a computers motherboard for the sole purpose of its defined 
application; other hardware needing uses to this port will earth have to be conformed of not use it at all. The most common applications are external: mouse and keyboards. The reverse of a general port.

==SCSI==

SCSI ports (pronounced &quot;scuzzy&quot;) are for transmitting fast data to up to seven devices in a daisy chain. SCSI stands for &quot;small computer system interface&quot;. Personal computers are able to communicate with hardware such as disk drives, tape drives, CD-ROM drives, printers and scanners much quicker. The current set of SCSIs are parallel interfaces that were developed at Apple Computer and are still used in the Macintosh today. SCSI ports continue to be built into PCs today, and as such, are supported by all major operating systems.

SCSI is also more flexible than previous parallel data transfer interfaces. Ultra-2 SCSI can transfer data up to eighty megabytes per second. Seven to fifteen devices can be connected to one SCSI port in the daisy-chain fashion, dependent on the bus width. One circuit board or card can accommodate all the peripherals.

The original SCSI is known as SCSI-1, which evolved into SCSI-2, also known as &quot;plain SCSI&quot; because it became widely accepted. SCSI-3 has extra specialized command sets that meet the needs of specific device types.

A SCSI standard is Ultra-2 which increases the burst rate up to 80 megabytes per second. It has a longer cabling distance of up to twelve meters because it uses low voltage differential signalling. This low voltage differential lowers power requirements and manufacturing costs.

The latest SCSI standard of Ultra-3 increases the burst rate from 80 megabytes per second to 160 megabytes per second. It does this by operating at the full clock rate as opposed to the half-clock rate of Ultra-2. Disk drives supporting Ultra-3 have faster data transfer rates. As well, Ultra-3 ensures the integrity of transferred data.

As we know, computer technology advances rapidly, and it is only a matter of time that a new SCSI standard of Ultra-4 is developed.

Specialized Expansion Ports 

'''Ethernet''' is the most widely-installed local area network (LAN) technology. Ethernet was developed by the Xerox Corporation in 1970. An Ethernet LAN typically uses coaxial cable or special grades of twisted pair wires. The coaxial cable was later replaced with point-to-point links connected together by hubs and/or switches in order to reduce installation costs, increase reliability, and enable point-to-point management and troubleshooting. Ethernet is also used in wireless LANs. 

The Infra-red Data Association, often referred to as '''IrDA''', is a non-profit organization whose goal is to develop globally adopted specifications for infra-red wireless communication.  IrDA was formed in 1994.
IRDA is a port much like what you would find on your TV/VCR remote. This port allows two computers or a computer and a device to communicate amongst each other without the use of wires. For the devices to communicate via IrDA they must have a direct line of sight.

Musical Instrument Digital Interface '''(MIDI)''' ports are used to connect electronic musical instruments, computers, sound cards, samplers and other show equipment to exchange data. There are many different cables/connectors that are used to transport MIDI data between the devices. MIDI does not transmit audio, it simply transmits real time digital data.

'''Bluetooth''' ports consist of short-range radio waves that transmit up to 30 feet.  It is used to connect cell phones to computers but also to connect computers to printers, keyboards, headsets, and other appliances. 
Bluetooth wireless technology simplify communication and synchronization between devices. It is a global standard that eliminates wires and cables between both stationary and mobile devices.  It also facilitates both data and voice communication. It offers the possibility of ''ad hoc'' networks and delivers the ultimate synchronicity between all your personal devices.  

'''FireWire''' ports speed up the movement of multimedia data and large files and enable easy connection of digital camcorders, cameras, digital video tapes/disks, PCs, TVs, printers and music systems directly to a personal computer. The connection enables simple, low-cost, high bandwidth realtime data interfacing. FireWire is Apple Computer's name for the IEEE 1394 High Speed Serial Bus. FireWire is similar to a USB port, but much more powerful. Users can transfer images with no image degradation.


The original '''FireWire''' was faster than a USB when it first debuted. The initial FireWire had transfer rates of up to 400Mbps. The difference between FireWire and USB are that FireWire are built for devices that work with a lot of data i.e audio equipment. FireWires can connect up to 63 devices. Firewire devices are known as hot pluggables, which mean they can be connected and disconnected at any time. FireWire devices allow devices to draw their power from their connection. The latest version of FireWire cables use a 9 pin configuration but some Firewire devices use 4 pin configurations to save space. Today FireWire cables can achieves speeds up to 800 Mbps. http://computer.howstuffworks.com/firewire4.htm


==Parallel==

===Definition===

According to authors William and Sawyer the definition of a parallel port is equal to 8 bits (1 byte). Below is a picture of what a parallel port looks like.

[[Image:Parallelport.jpg|300px]]

Often a parallel port will be used for connected a printer to the computer.  A parallel port is beginning to be phased out and USB is taking over what a parallel port once did.

==Serial Ports==
A serial port is considered to be one of the most basic external connectors on the computer. It is a connector for a line that sends bits one after another. Serial ports are usually used to connect peripheral devices such as keyboards, monitors, and modems because they do not require fast transmission of data. A serial port is also useful for sending data over a long distance.

==External SATA ports==
[[File:SATA2 und eSATA-Stecker.jpg|100px|thumb|SATA2 und eSATA-Stecker]]
'''eSATA''' ports are used most commonly with external hard drives. The connection through the port is much faster than it a USB or FireWire port. The reason for the faster speed is because eSATA does not have to translate the data between the computer and the interface. When using a USB or FireWire port, the data must be translated before the command can be executed. This characteristic also translates to less lag during the connection process when using an eSATA port. An eSATA port provides a signal for the external devices, but not power; therefore, the device does need its own power supply. The connector cables are much narrower than some used with much older technology.

==What is the Periodic Table of Elements?==

Although scientists know of many elements, the properties of many of them are similar.  Thus if they are grouped on the basis of their properties, it becomes easy to study and compare their properties.  The periodic table of elements is a way of organising all the known elements.  In the early days, elements were classified into only two groups: metals and non-metals.  But some elements showed the properties of both metals and non-metals.  They were called as metalloids.

===History of the Periodic Table===
{{wikipedia|History of the periodic table}}
====Early History====
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from antiquity, as these can all be discovered in nature in native form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools. Aristotle, a philosopher, theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire. This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he also theorised that they change into new substances to form what we see.

Hennig Brand was the first person to discover a new element. Brand was a bankrupt German merchant who was trying to discover the Philosopher's Stone — a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base metals into gold. He experimented with distilling human urine until in 1669 he finally obtained a glowing white substance which he named phosphorus. He kept his discovery secret, until 1680 when Robert Boyle rediscovered it and it became public.

By 1809, a total of 47 elements had been discovered. As the number of known elements grew, scientists began to recognize patterns in the way chemicals reacted and began to devise ways to classify the elements.

====Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier ====

Antoine Lavoisier's ''Traité Élémentaire de Chimie (Elementary Treatise of Chemistry'', 1789, translated into English by Robert Kerr) is considered to be the first modern chemical textbook. It contained a list of elements, or substances that could not be broken down further, which included oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, mercury, zinc, and sulfur. It also forms the basis for the modern list of elements. His list, however, also included light and caloric, which he believed to be material substances. While many leading chemists of the time refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation.

This model only classified elements into metals and non-metals and thus was not accepted.

====Alexandre-Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois====
Alexandre-Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois, a French geologist, was the first person to notice the ''periodicity'', the '''periodic''' or repetitive nature, of the elements &amp;mdash; similar elements seem to occur at regular intervals when they are ordered by their atomic weights.  He devised an early form of periodic table, which he called the '''telluric helix'''.  With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight, de Chancourtois saw that elements with similar properties lined up vertically. His chart included some ions and compounds in addition to elements. His paper was published in 1862, but used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include a diagram; as a result, it received little attention until the work of Dmitri Mendeleev.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.annales.org/archives/x/chancourtois.html Annales des Mines history page].&lt;/ref&gt;

====John Newlands====
John Newlands was an English chemist who in 1863 classified &lt;ref&gt;in a letter published in the Chemical News in February 1863, according to the [http://www.nndb.com/people/480/000103171/ Notable Names Data Base]&lt;/ref&gt; the 56 elements that had been discovered at the time into 11 groups which were based on similar physical properties. He noted that many pairs of similar elements existed which differed by some multiple of eight in atomic weight.

====The first periodic table====

[[Image:Дмитрий Иванович Менделеев 4.gif|thumb|right|Dmitri Mendeleev]] 

Dmitri Mendeleev, also spelt Dmitry Mendeleyev, middle name (patronymic) Ivanovich, a Siberian-born Russian chemist, was the first scientist to make a periodic table much like the one we use today. Mendeleev arranged the elements in a table ordered by atomic mass. It is sometimes said that he played &quot;chemical solitaire&quot; on long train rides using cards with various facts of known elements.&lt;ref&gt;''Physical Science'', Holt Rinehart &amp; Winston (January 2004), page 302 ISBN 0-03-073168-2&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 1869, a formal presentation was made to the Russian Chemical Society, entitled ''The Dependence Between the Properties of the Atomic Weights of the Elements''.  His table was published in an obscure Russian journal but quickly republished in a German journal, ''Zeitschrift für Chemie'', in 1869. It stated

# The elements, if arranged according to their atomic weights, exhibit an apparent periodicity of properties.
# Elements which are similar as regards to their chemical properties have atomic weights which are either of nearly the same value (e.g., Pt, Ir, Os) or which increase regularly (e.g., K, Rb, Cs).
# The arrangement of the elements, or of groups of elements in the order of their atomic weights, corresponds to their so-called valencies, as well as, to some extent, to their distinctive chemical properties; as is apparent among other series in that of Li, Be, Ba, C, N, O, and Sn (probably an error for Li, Be, B, C, N, O and F, since the symbols for the elements weren't completely standardized yet at that time).
# The elements which are the most widely diffused have small atomic weights.
# The magnitude of the atomic weight determines the character of the element, just as the magnitude of the molecule determines the character of a compound body.
# We must expect the discovery of many yet unknown elements&amp;ndash;for example, elements analogous to [[Wikijunior:The Elements/aluminium|aluminium]] and [[Wikijunior:The Elements/silicon|silicon]]&amp;ndash;whose atomic weight would be between 65 and 75.
# The atomic weight of an element may sometimes be amended by a knowledge of those of its contiguous elements. Thus the atomic weight of [[Wikijunior:The Elements/tellurium|tellurium]] must lie between 123 and 126, and cannot be 128.
# Certain characteristic properties of elements can be foretold from their atomic weights.

'''Advantages'''
* Mendeleev predicted the discovery of other elements and left space for these new elements, namely eka-silicon (germanium), eka-aluminium (gallium), and eka-boron (scandium). Thus, there was no disturbance in the periodic table. 
* He predicted (often accurately as it turned out) properties of some of these then missing elements as well as properties of some of their compounds.
* He pointed out that some of the then current atomic weights were incorrect.
* He provided for variance from atomic weight order

'''Drawbacks'''
* There was no place for the isotopes of the various elements.
* His table did not include any of the [[Wikijunior_The_Elements/Gases|noble gases]], which hadn't been discovered. But these were added by Sir William Ramsay as Group 0, without any disturbance to the basic concept of the periodic table.

Unknown to Mendeleev, Lothar Meyer was also working on a periodic table. In his work published in 1864, Meyer presented only 28 elements, classified not by atomic weight but by valence alone. Also, Meyer never came to the idea of predicting new elements and correcting atomic weights. Only a few months after Mendeleev published his periodic table of all known elements (and predicted several new elements to complete the table, plus some corrected atomic weights), Meyer published a virtually identical table. Some people consider Meyer and Mendeleev the co-creators of the periodic table, although most agree that Mendeleev's accurate prediction of the qualities of the undiscovered elements lands him the larger share of credit. In any case, at the time Mendeleev's predictions greatly impressed his contemporaries and were eventually found to be correct.  An English chemist, William Odling, also drew up a table that is remarkably similar to that of Mendeleev in 1864.

====Henry Moseley====
In 1914, Henry Moseley found a relationship between an element's X-ray wavelength and its atomic number and therefore resequenced the table by electronic charge rather than atomic weight. Before this discovery, atomic numbers were just sequential numbers based on an element's atomic weight. Moseley's discovery showed that atomic numbers had an experimentally measurable basis. 

Moseley's research also showed that there were gaps in his table at atomic numbers 43 and 61 which are now known to be radioactive and not naturally occurring. Following in the footsteps of Dmitri Mendeleyev, Henry Moseley also predicted new elements.

====Glenn T. Seaborg====
During his Manhattan Project research in 1944, Glenn T. Seaborg experienced unexpected difficulty isolating [[Wikijunior:The Elements/Americium|Americium]] (95) and [[Wikijunior:The Elements/Curium|Curium]] (96). He began wondering if these elements more properly belonged to a different series which would explain why the expected chemical properties of the new elements were different. In 1945, he went against the advice of colleagues and proposed a significant change to Mendelev's table: the actinide series. 

Seaborg's actinide concept of heavy element electronic structure, predicting that the actinides form a transition series analogous to the rare earth series of lanthanide elements, is now well accepted in the scientific community and included in all standard configurations of the periodic table. The actinide series are the second row of the f-block (5f series) and comprise the elements from [[Wikijunior:The Elements/Actinium|Actinium]] to [[Wikijunior:The Elements/Lawrencium|Lawrencium]]. Seaborg's subsequent elaborations of the actinide concept theorized a series of superheavy elements in a transactinide series comprising elements 104 through 121 and a superactinide series inclusive of elements 122 through 153.

==Transformations of Graphs==
====Reflection====
# &lt;math&gt;y = -f \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is a reflection of &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; through the x axis.
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (-x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is a reflection of &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; through the y axis.
#&lt;math&gt;y = \begin{vmatrix}f\left(x\right)\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is a reflection of &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; when y &lt; 0, through the x-axis.
#&lt;math&gt;y =f\left(\begin{vmatrix}x\end{vmatrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a reflection of &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; when x &lt; 0, through the y-axis.
#&lt;math&gt;y = f^{-1} \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is a reflection of &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; through the line y = x.&lt;br&gt;Note: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} \left (x \right )&lt;/math&gt; exists only if &lt;math&gt;f \left (x \right )&lt;/math&gt; is [[Wikipedia:bijective|bijective]], that is, [[Wikipedia:one-to-one|one-to-one]] and [[Wikipedia:onto|onto]].

====Stretching====
# &lt;math&gt;y = af \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is stretched toward the x-axis if &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; a &lt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt; and stretched away from the x-axis if &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;. In both cases the change is by a units.
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (bx \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is stretched away from the y-axis if &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; b &lt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt; and stretched toward the y-axis if &lt;math&gt;b &gt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;. In both cases the change is by b units.

===Translations===
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x - h \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of f(x) by h units to the right.
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x + h \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of f(x) by h units to the left.
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right ) + k\,&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of f(x) by k units upwards.
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right ) - k\,&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of f(x) by k units downwards.
==Natural Functions==
#&lt;math&gt;e^{\ln x} = \ln e^x = x\,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;y\left(t\right)=y_0e^{kt}\,&lt;/math&gt;, where y(t) is the final value, &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial value, k is the growth constant, t is the elapsed time.
#&lt;math&gt;k = - \frac {\ln 2}{half-life}&lt;/math&gt;, k for calculations involving half-lives.

==Trigonometry==
===Reciprocal Trigonometric Functions and their Inverses===
* &lt;math&gt; \sec \theta \equiv \frac{1}{\cos \theta}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cosec}\ \theta \equiv \frac{1}{\sin \theta}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \cot \theta \equiv \frac{1}{\tan \theta}\equiv \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \sec ^2 \theta \equiv 1 + \tan ^2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{cosec} ^2\ \theta \equiv 1 + \cot ^2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;

===Angle Sum and Difference Identities===
*&lt;math&gt;\sin(A \pm B) = \sin(A) \cos(B) \pm \cos(A) \sin(B)\,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\cos(A \pm B) = \cos(A) \cos(B) \mp \sin(A) \sin(B)\,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\tan(A \pm B) = \frac{\tan(A) \pm \tan(B)}{1 \mp \tan(A)\tan(B)}&lt;/math&gt;
Note: The sign &lt;math&gt;\mp&lt;/math&gt; means that if you add the angles (A+B) then you subtract in the identity and vice versa. It is present in the cosine identity and the denominator of the tangent identity.

===Double Angle Identities===
* &lt;math&gt; \sin 2A \equiv 2 \sin A \cos A&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \cos 2A \equiv \cos ^2 A - \sin ^2 A \equiv 1 - 2\sin ^2 A \equiv 2\cos ^2 A - 1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \tan 2A \equiv \frac{2 \tan A}{1 - \tan ^2 A}&lt;/math&gt;

===Combination of Trigonometric Functions===

'''Nanotechnology in the Middle Ages?'''

The Duke TIP eStudies Nanotechnology course will be adding more to this section (this will be completed by 22 Jun 08)

One of the first uses of nanotechnology was in the Middle Ages. It was done by using gold nanoparticles to make red pigments in stained glass showing that nanotechnology has been around for centuries. The gold when clumped together appears gold, but certain sized particles when spread out appear different colors.

Where are they taking us?
By Steven A Edwards

In the year 1974 at the Tokyo Science University, Professor Norio Taniigrichi came up with the term [[nanotechnology]].

Nanotechnology was first used to describe the extension of traditional silicon machining down into regions smaller than one micron (one millionth of a meter) by Tokyo Science University Professor Norio Taniguchi in 1974. It is now commonly used to describe the engineering and fabrication of objects with features smaller than 100 nanometers (one tenth of a micron).

&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanotechnology has been used for thousands of years, although people did not know what they were doing. For example, stained glass was the product of nanofabrication of gold. Medieval forgers were the first nanotecnologists in a sense, because they, by accident, found out a way to make stained glass.

'''A Vision'''

Richard Feynman was a man of great importance to the field of nanotechnology. He was a man with a vision. He believed that with research we could change things on a small scale. In his famous speech [http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/feynman.html There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom] in 1959, [[w:Richard_Feynman| Richard Feynman]] discussed the possibility of manipulating and controlling things on a molecular scale in order to achieve electronic and mechanical systems with atomic sized components. He concluded that the development of technologies to construct such small systems would be interdisciplinary, combining fields such as physics, chemistry and biology, and would offer a new world of possibilities that could radically change the technology around us.

'''Miniaturization'''

A few years later, in 1965, [[w:Moore_Law Gordon| Moore]] noted that the number of transistors on a chip had roughly doubled every other year since 1959, and predicted that the trend was likely to hold as each new generation of [[w:Microsystems|microsystems]] would help to develop the next generation at lower prices and with smaller components. To date, the semiconductor industry has been able to fulfill Moore's Law, in part through the reduction of lateral feature sizes on silicon chips from around 10 micrometers in 1965 to 45-65 nm in 2007 via changing from the use of optical contact lithography to deep ultraviolet projection lithography.

In 1974 in Japan, Norio Taniguchi coined the word &quot;nano-technology&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Taniguchi&quot;&gt;
N. Taniguchi, &quot;On the Basic Concept of 'Nano-Technology',&quot; Proc. Intl. Conf. Prod. Eng.
Tokyo, Part II, Japan Society of Precision Engineering, 1974.
&lt;/ref&gt;
to describe semiconductor processes such as thin film deposition and ion beam milling exhibiting characteristic control on the order of a nanometer: &quot;‘Nano-technology’ mainly consists of the processing of separation, consolidation, and deformation of materials by one atom or one molecule.&quot; 

Since Feynman's 1959 speech the arts of &quot;seeing&quot; and &quot;manipulation&quot; at the nanoscale have progressed from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to various forms of scanning probe microscopy including [[w:Nanotechnology/STM|scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)]] developed by Binnig and Rohrer at [[IBM]] Zurich and [[w:Nanotechnology/AFM|atomic force microscopy (AFM)]] devloped by (Binnig and Quate?) The STM, in particular, is capable of single-atom manipulation on conducting surfaces and has been used to build &quot;quantum corrals&quot; of atoms in which quantum mechanical wave function phenomena can be discerned. These atomic-scale manipulation capabilities prompt thoughts of building up complex atomic structures via manipulation rather than traditional stochastic chemistry. (Note: this pragraph is still rough and references are needed.)

Motivated by Feynman’s beliefs building things nanoscale top-down, Eric Drexler devoted much of his research to making a universal assembler. The American engineer [[w:K._Eric_Drexler| Eric Drexler]] has speculated extensively about the laboratory synthesis of machines  at the molecular level via manipulation techniques, emulating biochemistry and producing components much smaller than any microprocessor via techniques which have been called [[w:Molecular_nanotechnology|molecular nanotechnology]] or MNT.

(New York: John Wiley, 1992).
&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful realization of the [[w:Molecular_nanotechnology|MNT]] dream would comprise a collection of
technologies which are not currently practical, and the dream has resulted in considerable hyperbolic description of the resulting capabilities. While realization of these capabilities would be a vindication of the hype associated with MNT, concrete plans for anything other than computer modeling of finished structures are scant. Somehow, a means has to be found for MNT design evolution at the nanoscale which mimics the process of biological evolution at the molecular scale. Biological evolution proceeds by random variation in ensemble averages of organisms combined with culling of the less-successful variants and reproduction of the more-successful variants, and macroscale engineering design also proceeds by a process of design evolution from simplicity to complexity as set forth somewhat satirically by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall John Gall]: &quot;A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.  . . . A complex system designed from scratch never works and can not be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a system that works.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;JohnGall&gt; 
Gall, John, (1986) Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail, 2nd ed. Ann Arbor, MI : The General Systemantics Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;
A breakthrough in [[w:Molecular_nanotechnology|MNT]] is needed which proceeds from the simple atomic ensembles which can be built with, e.g., an [[w:Nanotechnology/STM|STM]] to complex [[w:Molecular_nanotechnology|MNT]] systems via a process of design evolution. A handicap in this process is the difficulty of seeing and manipulation at the nanoscale compared to the macroscale which makes deterministic selection of successful trials difficult; in contrast biological evolution proceeds via action of what Richard Dawkins has called the &quot;blind watchmaker&quot;
&lt;ref name = &quot;Dawkins&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
comprising random molecular variation and deterministic survival/death.


'''Technological development and limits'''

The impact on society and our lives of the continuous downscaling of systems is profound, and continues to open up new frontiers and possibilities. However, no exponential growth can continue forever, and the semiconductor industry will eventually reach the atomic limit for downsizing the transistor.
Atoms in solid matter are  typically one or two hundred picometers apart so nanotechnology involves manipulating individual structures which are between ten and ten thousand atoms across; for example, the gate length of a 45 nm transistor is about 180 silicon atoms long. Such very small structures are vulnerable to molecular level damage by cosmic rays, thermal activity, and so forth. The way in which they are assembled, designed and used is different from prior microelectronics.


'''New ways'''

Today, as that limit still seems to be some 20 years in the future, the growth is beginning to take new directions, indicating that the atomic limit might not be the limiting factor for technological development in the future, because systems are becoming more diverse and because new effects appear when the systems become so small that quantum effects dominate.
The semiconductor devices show an increased diversification, dividing for instance processors into very different systems such as those for cheap disposable chips, low power consumption portable devices, or high processing power devices. Microfabrication is also merging with other branches of science to include for instance chemical and optical micro systems. In addition, microbiology and biochemistry are becoming important for applications of all the developing methods. This diversity seems to be increasing on all levels in technology and many of these cross-disciplinary developments are linked to nanotechnology.

'''Diversification'''

As the components become so small that quantum effects become important, the diversity will probably further increase as completely new devices and possibilities begin to open up that are not possible with the bulk materials of today's technology.

'''The nanorevolution?'''

The visions of Feynman are today shared by many others: when nanotechnology is seen as a general cross disciplinary technology, it has the potential to create a coming &quot;industrial&quot; revolution that will have a major impact on society and everyday life, comparable to or exceeding the impact of electricity and information technology.

=Nanocomponents, Tools, and Methods=

'''A positive spiral'''

As an emerging technology, the methods and components of nanotechnology are under continuous development and each generation is providing a better foundation for the following generation.

'''Seeing 'nano' '''

With regards to the methods, the [[w:Scanning_tunneling_microscope| Scanning tunneling microscope (STM)]] and [[w:Atomic_force_microscope| Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)]] were developed in the 1980s and opened up completely new ways to investigate nanoscale materials. An important aspect was the novel possibility to directly manipulate nanoscale objects. Transmission and scanning electron microscopes ([[w:Transmission_electron_microscopy|TEM]] and [[w:Scanning_electron_microscope|SEM]]) had been available since the 30s, and offered the possibility to image as well as create nanodevices by [[w:Electron_beam_lithography|electron beam lithography]].

'''New nanomaterials'''

Several unique nanoscale structures were also discovered around 1990: the [[w:Buckyball| Carbon-60]] molecule and later the [[w:Carbon_nanotubes| carbon nanotubes]]. In recent years, more complex nanostructures such as [[w:Nanowire| semiconductor nanowire]] heterostructures have also proven to be useful building blocks or components in nanodevices.

'''So what can I use this 'nano' for?'''

The applications of such nanocomponents span all aspects of technology: Electronics, [[w:Optics|optics]]/photonics, medical, and biochemical, as well as better and smarter materials. But to date few real products are available with nanoscale components, apart from traditional nanoscale products, such as paint with nanoparticles or catalytic particles for chemical reactors. 

Prototype devices have been created from individual nanocomponents, but actual production is still on the verge. As when integrated electronics were developed, nanotechnology is currently in the phase where component production methods, characterization methods, tools for manipulation and integration are evolving by mutual support and convergence.

'''Difficult nanointegration'''

A main problem is reliable integration of the nanoscale components into [[w:Microsystems|microsystems]], since the production methods are often not compatible. For fabrication of devices with integrated nanocomponents, the optimal manipulation technique is of course to have the individual components self-assembling or growing into the required complex systems. Self assembly of devices in liquids is an expanding field within nanotechnology but usually requires the components to be covered in various surfactants, which usually also influence the component properties. To avoid surface treatments, nanotubes and whiskers/wires can be grown on chips and [[w:Microsystems|microsystems]] directly from pre-patterned catalytic particles. Although promising for future large scale production of devices, few working devices have been made by the method to date.

The prevailing integration technique for nanowire/tube systems seems to be [[w:Electron_beam_lithography| electron beam lithography (EBL)]] of metal structures onto substrates with randomly positioned nanowires deposited from liquid dispersions. By using flow alignment or electrical fields, the wire deposition from liquids can be controlled to some extent. The EBL method has allowed for systematic investigations of nanowires' and tubes' electrical properties, and creation of high performance electronic components such as field-effect transistors and chemical sensors. These proof-of-principle devices are some of the few but important demonstrations of devices nanotechnology might offer. In addition, nanomechanical structures have also recently been demonstrated, such as a rotational actuator with a carbon nanotube axis built by [http://www.physics.berkeley.edu/research/zettl/pdf/285.Nat424fennimore.pdf#search=%22Fennimore%20rotational%20actuator%22 Fennimore et al].

A more active approach to creating nanowire structures is to use [[w:Scanning_probe_microscopy| Scanning probe microscopy(SPM)]] to push, slide and roll the nanostructures across surfaces. SPM manipulation has been used to create and study nanotube junctions and properties. The ability to manipulate individual nanoscale objects has hence proven very useful for building proof-of-principle devices and prototypes, as well as for characterizing and testing components.

'''Top-down manufacturing''' takes bulky products and shrinks them to the nano scale, vs. bottom-up manufacturing is when individual molecules are placed in a specific order to make a product.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Drexler, ''Engines of Creation''&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''bottom-up self-assembly''' method may be important for future large scale production as well as many of the different approaches to improve the top-down lithographic processes. Such techniques could hence become important factors in the self-sustaining development of nanotechnology.

=Hot and hyped=

'''Suddenly everything is 'nano' '''

There's no question that the field of nanotechnology has quite a sense of hype to it - many universities have created new nanotech departments and courses. But there is also a vision behind the hype and emerging results - which are truly very few in industrial production, but nevertheless hold promise for a bright future. In the hype, many things that were once chemistry, microtechnology, [[w:Optics|optics]], mesoscopic or cluster physics, have been reborn as nanotechnology.

'''Nanotech is old'''

You can find nanotechnology in the sunscreen you use in the summer, and some paints and coatings can also be called nanotech since they all contain nanoparticles with unique optical properties. In a way, nanoparticles have been known in [[w:Optics|optics]] for hundreds of years if you like to take a broad perspective on things, since they have been used to [[w:Stain_glass|stain and color glasses]], etc. since the middle ages.  Nano-size particles of gold were used to create red pigments.&lt;ref&gt;Nanotech Pioneers, Steven A. Edwards (WILEY-VCH, 2006, Weinheim)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[w:Catalysis|Catalysis]] is a major industrial process, without which not many of the materials we have around us today would be possible to make, and catalysis is often highly dependent on nanoscale catalytic particles. In this way thousands of tons of nanotechnology have been used with great benefit for years.

Nanoscale wires and tubes have only recently really been given attention with the advent of [[w:Carbon_nanotube|carbon nanotubes]] and semiconductor nanowires, while nanoscale films are ever present in antireflection coatings on your glasses and binoculars, and thin metal films have been used for sensitive detection with [[w:Plasmon#Surface_plasmons|surface plasmons]] for decades. Surface plasmons are excitations of the charges at a surface. Nanowires actually were observed in the middle ages - well, they did not have the means to observe them, but saw whiskers grow from melted metals.

The better control over the nanostructure of materials has led to optimization of all these phenomena - and the emergence of many new methods and possibilities.

'''An example'''

Take for instance nano-optics: The surface plasmons turn out to be very efficient at enhancing local electrical fields and work as a local amplifier for optical fields, making a laser seem much more powerful to atoms in the vicinity of the surface plasmon. From this comes the surface enhanced [[w:Raman spectroscopy|raman spectroscopy]] which is increasingly used today because it makes it possible to do sensitive raman spectroscopy on the large majority of samples that would otherwise be impossible to make such spectra on. In addition, [[w:Photonic_crystal| photonic crystals]], fancy new quantum light sources that can make single photons on demand and other non-classical photon states are being developed, based on nanotechnology.

'''The future'''

There are definitely future scientific applications and commercial potential of all these new methods to handle light, use it for extremely sensitive detection and control its interaction with matter - and so it seems nanotechnology, being about making smaller versions of existing technology as well as new technology, is worth a bit of hype.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Linking Elements ==
Is it at all possible to link the images to the pages on that particular element? [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 20:02, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
:I see that this has been done, and that the table has been wikified. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 17:56, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;WARNING: This page is 50 kilobytes long; some browsers may have problems editing pages approaching or longer than 32kb. Please consider breaking the page into smaller sections.&quot; ==

I propse that in order to deal with this we simnplify the history section. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 23:41, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

== Missing Actinium! ==

The box for [[Wikijunior The Elements/Actinium|Actinium]] (number 89) is incorrect.  It contains a duplicate of the [[Wikijunior The Elements/Lanthanum|Lanthanum]] (number 57) box.  --[[User:Eliyahu|Eliyahu]] 07:20, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

:I have corrected the text box, but there is no &lt;tt&gt;Actinium.gif&lt;/tt&gt; image for that square now.  Could someone less graphically challenged than myself :) please upload one.  The symbols is '''Ac''', the number is 89, and the atomic mass is 227.0277.  Thanks. --[[User:Eliyahu|Eliyahu]] 07:51, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

== Practical Application ==
A practical application stems from my firm's use of gas from a local landfill.  Each month, we do a gas use inventory, and we correct earlier specific gravity assumption from an periodic gas composition analysis.  The correction involves scaling via the molecular weights of the main components oxygen, nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

Chemistry and Biochemistry are in many ways nanotechnologies working with nanoscale structures. In physics the classical laws of motion are not always valid on the nanoscale where a quantum mechanical model often is more suitable, and there are often a wealth of forces that are important that we do not consider very much in classical physics - the surface forces.

This part is about how nanosystems move, the forces that control the motion, and the ways we can model it.

=Metallic Nanostructures=

=Gold=
The red color in some stained glasses has through centuries been made from gold nanoparticles, and its also gold particles that make the red color in many pregnancy tests. Gold nanoparticles are used on many technoogies: they have a red color because of a plasmon resonance and the noble metal makes them good for specific binding of molecules with thiol groups.


==Copper==

When copper is viewed on the nano level, several changes occur. the temperature of the metal decreases, as well as the fatigue limit decreases.  Also, the tensile stress and elongation rate of the copper decreases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My late father, a Yorkshireman and inveterate eater of Yorkshire pudding (along with black pudding, and tripe and onions), once told me that his family used Yorkshire pudding as the basis for both a sweet and a savoury dish.

Made with meat juices (usually beef) it was a savoury; made without meat juices and spread usually with [[jam]], it became a dessert.

Although we tended to create individual Yorkshire puddings as depicted in the illustration in the article, in fact the majority of Yorkshire pudding was apparently made in a single very large shallow baking tin. [[User:PeterBrooks|PeterBrooks]] 20:34, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Conchs''' are mollusks that are related to the [[cookbook:snail|snail]]. They thrive in warm salt water, and tend to be found in tropical areas. Conch meat is also called &quot;scungilli&quot;.

Conch meat is eaten either raw, as in a salad, or cooked, as in fritters or jumbo. Conch is an important part of many [[cookbook:Caribbean cuisines|Caribbean cuisines]].

=Potential environmental impacts of nanotechnology=
So far most of the focus has been on the potential health and environmental risks of nanoparticles and only a few studies has been made of the overall environmental impacts during the life cycle such as [[w:Ecological_footprint|ecological footprint (EF)]] or [[w:life_cycle_analysis|life cycle analysis (LCA)]]. The life cycle of nanoproducts may involve both risks to human health and environment as well as environmental impacts associated with the different stages.

The topics of understanding and assessing the environmental impacts and benefits of nanotechnology throughout the life cycle from extraction of raw materials to the final disposal have only been addressed in a couple of studies. The U.S. EPA, NCER have sponsored a few projects to investigate Life Cycle Assessment methodologies. Only one of these has yet published results on automotive catalysts

Heresome of the potential environmental impacts related to nanotechnological products in their life cycle are discussed followed by some recommendations to the further work on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of nanotechnological products.

However, when relating to existing experience in micro-manufacturing (which to a large extent resembles the top-down manufacturing of nanomaterials) several environmental issues emerge that should be addressed. There are indications that especially the manufacturing and the disposal stages may imply considerable environmental impacts. The toxicological risks to humans and the environment in all life cycle stages of a nanomaterials have been addressed above. Therefore, the potentially negative impacts on the environment that will be further explored in the following are:

*Increased exploitation and loss of scarce resources;
*Higher requirement to materials and chemicals;
*Increased energy demand in production lines;
*Increased waste production in top down production;
*Rebound effects (horizontal technology);
*Increased use of disposable systems;
*Disassembly and recycling problems.

==Exploitation and loss of scarce resources==
Exploitation and loss of scarce resources is a concern since economic consideration is a primary obstacle to use precious or rare materials in everyday products. When products get smaller and the components that include the rare materials reach the nanoscale, economy is not the most urgent issue since it will not significantly affect the price of the product. Therefore, developers will be more prone to use materials that have the exact properties they are searching. For example in the search for suitable hydrogen storage medias Dillon et al. 
&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillon9b&quot;&gt;Dillon AC, Nelson BP, Zhao Y, Kim Y-H, Tracy CE and Zhang SB: Importance of Turning to Renewable Energy Resources with Hydrogen as a Promising Candidate and on-board Storage a Critical Barrier. Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 895, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
experimented with the use of fullerenes doped with Scandium to increase the reversible binding of Hydrogen. Other examples are the use of Gallium and other rare metals in electronics. While an increased usage of such materials may be foreseen due to the expected widespread use of nanotechnological products, the recycling will be more difficult (will be discussed more in detail later), resulting in non-recoverable dissemination of scarce resources.

==Energy intensity of materials==
An issue apart from the loss of resources is the fact that the extraction of most rare materials uses more energy and generates more waste than more abundant materials. Table 1 illustrates the energy intensity of a range of materials.

=Life cycle assessment (LCA)=

As mentioned there are not many studies on LCA of nanotechnology and much information has to be understood from extrapolation of experiences from MEMS and micro manufacturing.

In the micro world LCA has predominantly been used in the Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sector. The rapid development of technologies and limited availability of data makes full blown LCAs difficult and rather quickly outdated. An example is the manufacture of a PC for which the energy requirement in the late 1980’s were app. 2150 kWh whereas in the late 90’s efficiency were improved and only 535 kWh were necessary
&lt;ref name=&quot;Schischke10&quot;&gt;Schischke, K.; Griese, H. Is small green? Life Cycle Aspects of Technology Trends in Microelectronicss and Microsystems. http://www. lcacenter. org/InLCA2004/papers/Schischke_K_paper. pdf 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
.

Using old data could result in erroneous results. Looking at the overall environmental impact this fourfold increase in efficiency has been overcompensated by an increase in number of sold computers from app. 21 mio to more than 150 mio
&lt;ref name=&quot;Schischke10&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
causing an overall increase in environmental impact. This is often referred to as a rebound effect. For the development of cell phones, the same authors conclude that life cycle impacts vary significantly from one product generation to the next; hence generic product life cycle data should incorporate a “technology development factor” for main parameters.

A major trend is that shrinking product dimensions raise production environment requirements to prevent polluting the product. It involves energy intensive heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Clean room of class 10.000 for example requires app. 2280 kWh/m2∙a whereas a class 100 requires 8440 kWh/m2∙a. The same increase of requirements is relevant for supply materials like chemicals and gases. The demand for higher purity levels implies more technical effort for chemical purification, e.g. additional energy consumption and possibly more waste. Most purification technologies are highly energy intensive, e.g. all distillation processes, which are often used in wet chemical purification, account in total for about 7 % of energy consumption of the U.S. chemical industry
&lt;ref name=&quot;Plepys11&quot;&gt;Plepys, A. The environmental impacts of electronics. Going beyond the walls of semiconductor fabs. IEEE: 2004; pp 159-165.&lt;/ref&gt;
.
Chemicals used in large volumes in semiconductor industry are hydrofluoric acid (HF), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH). These materials are used in final cleaning processes and require XLSI grades (0.1 ppb). Sulphuric acid is also used in large amounts, but it is a less critical chemical and mainly requires an SLSI level purity
&lt;ref name=&quot;Plepys11&quot;&gt;Plepys, A. The environmental impacts of electronics. Going beyond the walls of semiconductor fabs. IEEE: 2004; pp 159-165.&lt;/ref&gt;
.

Micromanufacturing of other types of products also puts higher requirements on the quality and purity of the materials, e.g. a smaller grain size in metals because of the smaller dimensions of the final product. Additionally, a considerable amount of waste is produced. For example, up to 99% of the material used for microinjection moulding of a component may be waste since big runner are necessary for handling and assembly. However, recycling of this waste may not be possible due to requirements to and reduction of the material strength
&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarasua12&quot;&gt;Sarasua, J. R.; Pouyet, J. Recycling effects on microstructure and mechanical behaviour of PEEK short carbon-fibre composites. Journal of Materials Science 1997, 32, 533-536.&lt;/ref&gt;
. 

Miniaturisation also cause new problems in electronics recycling. Take-back will hardly be possible. If they are integrated into other product they need to be compatible with the recycling of these products (established recycling paths)
&lt;ref name=&quot;Schischke10&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
.

The very small size and incorporation into many different types of products including product with limited longevity suggests an increased use of disposable systems is required.

==Life cycle assessment of nanotechnology==

As mentioned previously only few LCA studies have until now been performed for nanotechnological products. A two day workshop on LCA of nanotechnological products concluded that the current ISO-standard on LCA (14040) applies to nanotechnological products but also that some development is necessary
&lt;ref name=&quot;Klöpffer3b&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;&gt;Something funny is happening with ref klöpffer3b&lt;/ref&gt;

The main issues are that:sometimes it cracks the nerve 
*There is no generic LCA of nanomaterials, just as there is no generic LCA of chemicals.
*The ISO-framework for LCA (ISO 14040:2006) is fully suitable to nanomaterials and nanoproducts, even if data regarding the elementary flows and impacts might be uncertain and scarce. Since environmental impacts of nanoproducts can occur in any life cycle stage, all stages of the life cycle of nanoproducts should be assessed in an LCA study.
*While the ISO 14040 framework is appropriate, a number of operational issues need to be addressed in more detail in the case of nanomaterials and nanoproducts. The main problem with LCA of nanomaterials and nanoproducts is the lack of data and understanding in certain areas.
*While LCA brings major benefits and useful information, there are certain limits to its application and use, in particular with respect to the assessment of toxicity impacts and of large-scale impacts.
*Within future research, major efforts are needed to fully assess potential risks and environmental impacts of nanoproducts and materials (not just those related to LCA). There is a need for protocols and practical methodologies for toxicology studies, fate and transport studies and scaling approaches.
*International cooperation between Europe and the United States, together with other partners, is needed in order to address these concerns.
*Further research is needed to gather missing relevant data and to develop user-friendly eco-design screening tools, especially ones suitable for use by small and medium sized enterprises.

Some of the concerns regarding the assessment of toxicological impacts is closely linked to the risk assessment of nanoparticles and have to await knowledge building in this area. However, the most striking is the need for knowledge and cases where LCA are applied in order to increase understanding of nanotechnological systems – what are the potential environmental impacts? How do they differ between different types of nanotechnologies? Where should focus be put in order to prevent environmental impacts? Etc.

== Principles for the Revision and Development of this Chapter of the Wikibook ==
''Unless they are held together by book covers or hypertext links, ideas will tend to split up as they travel. We need to develop and spread an understanding of the future as a whole, as a system of interlocking dangers and opportunities. This calls for the effort of many minds. The incentive to study and spread the needed information will be strong enough: the issues are fascinating and important, and many people will want their friends, families, and colleagues to join in considering what lies ahead. If we push in the right directions - learning, teaching, arguing, shifting directions, and pushing further - then we may yet steer the technology race toward a future with room enough for our dreams.'' [http://e-drexler.com/p/06/00/EOC_Cover.html -Eric Drexler, Engines of Creation, 1986]


Our method for growing and revising this chapter devoted to Nanotechnology &amp; Society will emphasize an open source approach to &quot;nanoethics&quot; - we welcome collaboration from all over the planet as we turn our collective attention to revising and transforming the current handbook.  Nature abhors a vacuum, so we are lucky to begin not with nothing but with a significant beginning begun by a Danish scientist,   [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:KristianMolhave Kristian Molhave]. You can read the [[/Correspondence|correspondence for the project]].


Our principles for the revision and development of this section of the wikibook will continue to develop and will be based on those of wikibooks [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Manual_of_Style manual of style]

== Introduction ==
Nanotechnology is already a major vector in the rapid technological development of the 21st century. While the wide ranging effects of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007–2009 financial crisis] on the venture capital and research markets have yet to be understood, it is clear from the example of the [http://www.understandingnano.com/nanotechnology-electronics.html integrated circuit industry] that nanotechnology and nanoscience promise to (sooner or later) transform our [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library IT infrastructure.] Both the World Wide Web and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer peer-to-peer technologies] (as well as wikipedia) demonstrate the radical potential of even minor shifts in our IT infrastructure, so any discussion of nanotechnology and society can, at the very least, inquire into the plausible effects of radical increases in information processing and production. The effects of, for example, distributed knowledge production, are hardly well understood, as the recent Wikileaks events have demonstrated. The very existence of distributed knowledge production irrevocably alters the global stage.

Given the [http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/ddt/02.htm history of DDT] and other highly promising chemical innovations, it is now part of our technological common sense to seek to &quot;debug&quot;  emerging technologies. This debugging includes, but is not limited to, the effects of nanoscale materials on our health and environment, which are often not fully understood. The very aspects of nanotechnology and nanoscience that excite us - the unusual physical properties of the nanoscale (e.g. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Nanotechnology/Health_effects_of_nanoparticles increase in surface area]) - also pose problems for our capacity to predict and control nanoscale phenomena, particularly in their connections to the larger scales - such as ourselves!   This wikibook assumes (in a purely heuristic fashion) that to think effectively about the implications of nanotechnology and emerging nanoscience, we must (at the very least) think in evolutionary terms. Nanotechnology may be a significant development in the evolution of human capacities. As with any other technology (nuclear, bio-, info), it has a range of socio-economic impacts that influences and transforms our context. While &quot;evolution&quot; often conjures images of ruthless competition towards a &quot;survival of the fittest,&quot; so too should it involve visions of collective symbiosis: According to Margulis and Sagan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Margulis, Lynn | coauthors = Sagan, Dorion | title= Marvellous microbes | journal= Resurgence | date=2001 | volume=206 | pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Life did not take over the globe by combat, but by networking&quot; (i.e., by cooperation)&lt;ref&gt;Witzany, G. (2006) The Serial Endosymbiotic Theory (SET): The Biosemiotic Update. Acta Biotheoretica 54: 103-117&lt;/ref&gt;. 


Perhaps in this wikibook chapter we can begin to grow a community of feedback capable of such cooperative debugging. Here we will create a place for sharing plausible implications of nanoscale science and technology based on emerging peer reviewed science and technology. Like all chapters of all wikibooks, this is offered both as an educational resource and collective invitation to participate. Investigating the effects of nanotechnology on society requires that we first and foremost become informed participants, and definitions are a useful place to begin.


Strictly speaking, nanotechnology is a discourse. As a dynamic field in rapid development across multiple disciplines and nations, the definition of nanotechnology is not always clear cut. Yet, it is still useful to begin with some definitions. &quot;Nanotechnology&quot; is often used with little qualification or explanation, proving ambiguous and confusing to those trying to grow an awareness of such tiny scales.  This can be quite confusing when the term &quot;nano&quot; is used both as a nickname for nanotechnology and a buzzword for consumer products that have no incorporated nanotechnology (eg. &quot;nano&quot;- [http://tatanano.inservices.tatamotors.com/tatamotors/ car] and [http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/ ipod]). It is thus useful for the student of nanoscale science to make distinctions between what is &quot;branded&quot; as nanotechnology and what this word represents in a broader sense.  Molecular biologists could argue that since DNA is ~2.5 nm wide, life itself is nanotechnological in nature -- making the [http://www.azom.com/Details.asp?ArticleID=3533 antibacterial silver nanoparticles] often used in current products appear nano-primitive in comparison. [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html SI units], the global standard for units of measurement, assigns the &quot;nano&quot; prefix for 10 &lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt; meters, yet in usage &quot;nano&quot; often extends to 100 times that size. International standards based on SI units offer definitions and terminology for clarity, so we will follow that example while incorporating the flexibility and open-ended nature of a wiki definition. Our [[Nanotechnology/Glossary|emerging glossary of nano-related terms]] will prove useful as we explore the various discourses of nanotechnology.

== Imagining Nanotechnology ==
As a research site and active ecology of design,  the discussions in all of the many discourses of nanotechnology and nanoscience must imagine beyond the products currently marketed or envisioned. It thus often traffics in science fiction style scenarios, what psychologist [http://www.fiu.edu/~psylaw/fisher.htm Roland Fischer] called the &quot;as-if true&quot; register of representation. Indeed, given the challenges of representing these minuscule scales smaller than a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum wavelength of light], &quot;speculative ideas&quot; may be the most accurate and honest way of describing our plausible collective imaginings of the implications of nanotechnology. Some have proposed great advantages derived from utility fogs of [http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Flyswim.html flying nanomachinery] or [http://www.foresight.org/nanodot/?p=1551 self replicating nanomachines], while others expressed fears that such technology could lead to the end of life as we know it when self replicating nanites take over in a ''hungry [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo grey goo]'' scenario. Currently there is no theorized mechanism for creating such a situation, though the outbreak of a synthesized organism may be a realistic concern with some analogies to some of the feared scenarios. More profoundly, thanks to historical experience we know that technological change alters our planet in radical and unpredictable ways.  Though speculative, such fears and hopes can nevertheless influence public opinion considerably and challenge our thinking thoroughly. Imaginative and informed criticism and enthusiasm are gifts to the development of nanotechnology and must be integrated into our visions of the plausible impacts on society and the attitudes toward nanotechnology.  


While fear leads to overzealous avoidance of a technology, the hype suffusing nanotechnology can be equally misleading, and makes many people brand products as &quot;nano&quot; despite there being nothing particularly special about it at the nanoscale. Examples have even included illnesses caused by a &quot;nano&quot; product that turned out to have nothing &quot;nano&quot; in it.


Between the fear and the hype, efforts are made to map the plausible future impact of nanotechnology. Hopefully this will guide us to a framework for the development of nanotechnology, and avoidance of excessive fear and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_circus hype in the broadcast media]. So far, nanotechnology has probably been more disposed to hype, with much of the public relatively uninformed about either risks or promises. Nanotechnology may follow the trend of biotechnology, which saw early fear ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asilomar_Conference_on_Recombinant_DNA Asilomar]) superseded by enthusiasm ([http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/home.shtml The Human Genome Project]) accompanied by widespread but narrowly focused fear ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism genetically modified organisms]).


What pushes nano research between the fear and hype of markets and institutions? Nanotechnology is driven by a market pull for better products (sometimes a military pull to computationally &quot;own&quot; battlespace), but also by a push from [http://www.nanotech.net/content/conference/themes/investment/public-funding-nanotechnology-international-perspectives public funding] of research hoping to open a bigger market as well as explore the fundamental properties of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter matter] on the nanoscale. The push and pull factors also change our education, particularly at universities where cross-disciplinary nano-studies are increasingly available.  


Finally, nanotechnology is a part of the evolution of not only our technological abilities, but also of our knowledge and understanding. The future is unknown, but it is certain to have a range of socio-economic impacts, sculpting the ecosystem and society around us.   


This chapter looks at these societal and environment aspects of the emerging technology.

== Building Scenarios for the Plausible Implications of Nanotechnology ==

[http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/wiki/The_Scenarios_Project Scenario building] requires [http://ag.arizona.edu/futures/sce/scemain.html scenario planning].

== Technophobia and Technophilia Associated with Nanotechnology ==

=== Technophobia ===

Technophobia exists presently as a societal reaction to the darker aspects of modern technology.  As it concerns the progress of nanotechnology, technophobia is and will play a large role in the broader cultural reaction. Largely since the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution industrial revolution], many different individuals and collectives of society have feared the unintended consequences of technological progress.  Moral, ethical, and aesthetic issues propagating from emergent technologies are often at the forefront discourse of said technologies.  When society deviates from the natural state, human conciseness tends to question the implications of a new rationale.  Historically, several groups have emerged from the swells of technophobia, such as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddites Luddites] and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish Amish].

=== Technophilia ===
It is interesting to contemplate the role that technophilia has played in the development of nanotechnology. Early investigators such as Drexler drew on the utopian traditions of science fiction in imagining a Post Scarcity and even immortal future, a strand of nanotechnology and nanotechnology that continues with the work of Kurzweil and, after a different fashion, Joy. In more contemporary terms, it is the technophilia of the market that seems to drive nanotechnology research: faster and cheaper chips.

== Anticipatory Symptoms: The Foresight of Literature ==

''...reengineering the computer of life using nanotechnology could eliminate any remaining obstacles and create a level of durability and flexibility that goes beyond the inherent capabilities of biology.
''--[[W:Ray_Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]], [[W:The_Singularity_Is_Near|The Singularity is Near]]


''The principles of physics, as far as I can see, do not speak against the possibility of maneuvering things atom by atom.  It would be, in principle, possible...for a physicist to synthesize any chemical substance that the chemist writes down..How?  Put the atoms down where the chemist says, and so you make the substance.  The problems of chemistry and biology can be greatly helped if our ability to see what we are doing, and to do things on an atomic level, is ultimately developed--a development which I think cannot be avoided.''
--[[W:Richard_Feynman|Richard Feynman]], [http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/feynman.html There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]


There is much horror, revulsion, and delight regarding the promise and peril of nanotechnology explored in science fiction and popular literature.  When machinery can allegedly outstrip the capabilities of biological machinery (See [[W:Ray_Kurzweil|Kurzweil's]] notion of [[W:The_Singularity_Is_Near|transcending biology]]), much room is provided for speculative scenarios to grow in this realm of the &quot;as-if true&quot;.  The &quot;good nano/bad nano&quot; rhetoric is consistent in nearly all scenarios posited by both trade science and sci-fi writers.  The &quot;grey goo&quot; scenario plays the role of the &quot;bad nano&quot;, while &quot;good nano&quot; is traffics in immortality schemes and a post scarcity economy. The good scenario usual features a &quot;nanoassembler&quot;, an as yet unrealized machine run by physics and information--a machine that can create anything imagined from blankets to steel beams with a schematic and the push of a button. Here &quot;good nano&quot; follows in the footsteps of &quot;good biotech&quot;, where life extension and radically increased health beckoned from somewhere over the DNA rainbow. Reality, of course, has proved more complicated


Grey goo, the fear that a self-replicating nanobot set to re-create itself using a highly common atom such as carbon, has been played out by many sources and is the great cliche of nanoparanoia.  There are two notable science fiction books dealing with the grey goo scenario.  The first, [[W:Aristoi_(novel)|Aristoi]] by [[W:Walter_John_Williams|Walter John Williams]], describes the scenario with little embellishment.  In the book, Earth is quickly destroyed by a goo dubbed &quot;Mataglap nano&quot; and a second Earth is created, along with a very rigid hierarchy with the ''Aristoi''--or controllers of nanotechnology--at the top of the spectrum.  The other, [[W:Chasm_City|Chasm City]] by [[W:Alastair_Reynolds|Alastair Reynolds]], describes the scenario as a virus called the ''melding plague.''  It converts pre-existing nanotechnology devices to meld and operate in dramatically different ways on a cellular level.  This causes the namesake city of the novel to turn into a large, mangled mess wildly distorted by a mass-scale malfunctioning of nanobots.


The much more delightful (and more probable) scenario of a machine that can create anything imagined with a schematic and raw materials is dealt with extensively in [[W:The_Diamond_Age|The Diamond Age]] or [[W:A_Young_Lady's_Illustrated_Primer|A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer]] by [[W:Neil_Stephenson|Neil Stephenson]] and [[W:The_Singularity_Is_Near|The Singularity is Near]] by [[W:Ray_Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]].  Essentially, the machine works by combining nanobots that follow specific schematics and produces items on an atomic level--fairly quickly.  The speculated version has ''The Feed'', a grid similar to today's electrical grid that delivers molecules required to build its many tools.

In many organization R&amp;D models, two general categories of technology development are examined.  “Sustainable technologies” are those new technologies that improve existing product and market performance.  Known market conditions of existing technologies provide valuable opportunities for the short-term success of additions and improvements to those technologies.  For example, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone iphone’s] entrance into the cellular market was largely successfully due to the existence of a pre-existing consumer cell phone market.  On the other hand, “disruptive technologies” (e.g. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer peer-to-peer networks], [http://twitter.com/ Twitter]) often enter the market with little or nothing to stand on - they are unprecedented in scale, often impossible to contain and highly unpredictable in their effects.  These technologies often have few short-term benefits and can result in the failure of the organizations that invest in such radical market introductions. 


At least some nanotechnologies are likely to fit into this precarious category of disruptive technologies.  Corporations typically have little experience with disruptive technologies, and as a result it is crucial to include outside expertise and processes of dissensus as early as possible in the monitoring of newly synthesized technologies.  The formation of a community of diverse minds, both inside and outside cooperate jurisdiction, is fundamental to the process of planning a foreseeable environment for the emergence of possible disruptive technologies. Here, non-corporate modalities of governance (e.g. standards organizations, open source projects, universities) may thrive on disruptive technologies where corporations falter.  Ideally in project planning, university researchers, contributors, post-docs, and venture capitalists should consult top-level management on a regular basis throughout the disruptive technology evaluation process.  This ensures a broad and clear base of technological prediction and market violability that will pave a constructive pathway for the implementation of the unforeseeable.


A cooperative paradigm shift is more often than not needed when evaluating disruptive technologies.  Instead of responding to current market conditions, the future market itself must be formulated.  Taking the next giant leap in corporate planning is risky and requires absolute precision through maximum redundancy &quot;with a thousand pairs of eyes, all bugs are shallow.&quot;  Alongside consumer needs, governmental, political, cultural, and societal values must be added into the equation when dealing such high-stakes disruptive technologies such as nanotechnology.  Therefore, the dominant function of nanotech introduction is not derived from a particular organization’s nanotech competence base, but from a future created by an inter-organizational ecosystem of multiple institutions.

== Early Symptoms ==
 
=== Global Standards ===
Global standards organizations have already worked on [http://www.astm.org/Standards/E2490.htm metrological standards] for nanotechnology, making uniformity of measurement and terminology more likely.  
Global  organizations such as [http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm ISO], [http://www.iec.ch/ IEC], [http://www.oasis-open.org/home/index.php OASIS], and [http://www.bipm.org/ BIPM] would seem likely venues for standards in ''Nanotechnology &amp; Society''. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission IEC] has included [http://www.mel.nist.gov/tripdf/NIST/15_Bennett-IEC-TC-113-for-Tri-National-06Feb08_final.pdf environmental health and safety] in its purview.

===Examples of Hype===
Predicted revolutions tend to be difficult to make, and the nanorevolution might turn in other directions than initially anticipated.  A lot of the exotic nanomaterials that have been presented in the media have faded away and only remain in science fiction, perhaps to be revisited by later researchers.  Some examples of such materials are [http://nanopedia.case.edu/NWPage.php?page=quantum.corrals artificial atoms or quantum corrals], the [http://www.spaceelevator.com/ space elevator], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanorobotics nanites].  Nano-hype exists in our collective consciousness due to the many products with which carry the nano-banner.  The BBC demonstrated in 2008 the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7183085.stm joy of nano] that we currently embrace globally.  


The energy required to fabricate nanomaterials and the resulting ecological footprint might not make the nanoversion of an already existing product worth using – except in the beginning when it is an exotic novelty. [http://www.nanoforum.org/educationtree/modernlife/modernlife-sportsequipment.htm Carbon nanotubes in sports gear] could be an example of such overreach.  Also, a fear of the toxicity, both biologically and ecologically speaking, from newly synthesized nanotechnologies should be examined before ''full throttle'' is set on said technologies.  Heir apparent to the thrones of the Commonwealth realms, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales Charles, Prince of Wales], has made his concerns about nano-implications known in a [http://nanotechweb.org/cws/article/tech/19874 statement] he gave in 2004.  Questions have been raised about the safety of [http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s1165709.htm zinc oxide nanoparticles] in sunscreen, but the [http://www.fda.gov/ FDA] has already approved of its sale and usage.  In order to expose the realities and complexities of newly introduced nanotechnologies, and avoid another anti-biotech movement, [http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2001/12/48738 nano-education] is the key.

==Surveys of Nanotechnology==

Since 2000, there has been increasing focus on the health and environmental impact of nanotechnology. This has resulted in several reports and ongoing surveillance of nanotechnology.  [http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: Opportunities and Uncertainties] is a report by the [http://royalsociety.org/ UK  Royal Society] and the [http://www.raeng.org.uk/ Royal Academy of Engineering].  [http://www.nanorisk.org/ Nanorisk] is a bi-monthly newsletter published by [http://www.nanowerk.com/ Nanowerk LLC].  Also, the [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/ Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars] is starting a new [http://www.nanoproject.org project on emerging nanotechnologies] (website is under construction) that among other things will try to map the available nano-products and work to ensure possible risks are minimized and benefits are realized.

==Nanoethics==

Nanoethics, or the study of nanotechnology's ethical and social implications, is a rising yet contentious field. Nanoethics is a controversial field for many reasons. Some argue that it should not be recognized as a proper area of study, suggesting that nanotechnology itself is not a true category but rather an incorporation of other sciences, such as chemistry, physics, biology and engineering. Critics also claim that nanoethics does not discover new issues, but only revisits familiar ones. Yet the scalar shift associated with engineering tolerances at 10-9th suggests that this new mode of technology is analogous to the introduction of entirely new &quot;surfaces&quot; to be machined.  Writing technologies or [http://kplab.evtek.fi:8080/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=ExternalSymbolicStorageSystemESSS ''external symbolic storage''] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_Donald Merlin Donald]) and the wheel both opened up entirely new dimensions to technology - consciousness and smoothed spaced respectively. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Deleuze Deleuze] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Félix_Guattari Guattari]) 


Outside the realms of industry, academia, and geek culture, many people learn about nanotechnology through fictional works that hypothesize necessarily speculative scenarios which scientists both reject and, in the tradition of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment gedankenexperiment], rely upon.  Perhaps the most successful [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme meme] associated with nanotechnology has ironically been [http://www.michaelcrichton.net/ Michael Chrichton's] treatment of self-replicating ''nanobots'' running amok like a pandemic virus in his 2002 book, [http://books.google.com/books?id=_o9D4dXUHLEC&amp;dq=Michael+Chrichton+2002+book+Prey&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VvgGS8jmHdK7lAeTy7SFBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Prey].


In the [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199710--.htm mainstream media], reports proliferate about the risks that nanotechnology poses to the environment, health, and safety, with conflicting reports within the growing nanotechnology industry and its trade press, both silicon and print.  To orient the ethical and social questions that arise within this rapidly changing evolutionary dynamic, some scholars have tried to  define nanoscience and nanoethics in disciplinary terms, yet the success of Chrichton's treatment may suggest that nanoethics is more likely to be successful if it makes use of narrative as well as definitions. Wherever possible, this wikibook will seek to use both well defined terms and offer the framework of narrative to organize any investigation of ''nanoethics''. [http://www.nanoethics.org/wiley.html Nanoscience and Nanoethics: Definning The Disciplines]&lt;ref&gt; Patrick Lin and Fritz Allhoff, Nanoethics: The Ethical and Social Implications of Nanotechnology. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; is an excellent starting guide to the this newly emerging field.

===Prisoner's Dilemma and Ethics===

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma  prisoner's dilemma] constitutes a problem in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory game theory]. It was originally framed by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_M._Flood Merrill Flood] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Dresher Melvin Dresher] working at [http://www.rand.org/ RAND] in 1950. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_W._Tucker Albert W. Tucker] formalized the game with prison sentence payoffs and gave it the ''prisoner's dilemma'' name ([http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/economists/prisoners_dilemma.html Poundstone], 1992).  In its classical form, the prisoner's dilemma (&quot;PD&quot;) is presented as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Two suspects are arrested by the police. The police have insufficient evidence for a conviction, and, having separated both prisoners, visit each of them to offer the same deal. If one testifies (defects from the other) for the prosecution against the other and the other remains silent (cooperates with the other), the betrayer goes free and the silent accomplice receives the full 10-year sentence. If both remain silent, both prisoners are sentenced to only six months in jail for a minor charge. If each betrays the other, each receives a five-year sentence. Each prisoner must choose to betray the other or to remain silent. Each one is assured that the other would not know about the betrayal before the end of the investigation. How should the prisoners act?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If we assume that each player cares only about minimizing his or her own time in jail, then the prisoner's dilemma forms a non-zero-sum game in which two players may each cooperate with or defect from (betray) the other player. In this game, as in all game theory, the only concern of each individual player (prisoner) is maximizing his or her own payoff, without any concern for the other player's payoff. The unique equilibrium for this game is a Pareto-suboptimal solution, that is, rational choice leads the two players to both play defect, even though each player's individual reward would be greater if they both played cooperatively.
In the classic form of this game, cooperating is strictly dominated by defecting, so that the only possible equilibrium for the game is for all players to defect. No matter what the other player does, one player will always gain a greater payoff by playing defect. Since in any situation playing defect is more beneficial than cooperating, all rational players will play defect, all things being equal.


In the iterated prisoner's dilemma, the game is played repeatedly. Thus each player has an opportunity to punish the other player for previous non-cooperative play. If the number of steps is known by both players in advance, economic theory says that the two players should defect again and again, no matter how many times the game is played. Only when the players play an indefinite or random number of times can cooperation be an equilibrium. In this case, the incentive to defect can be overcome by the threat of punishment. When the game is infinitely repeated, cooperation may be a subgame perfect equilibrium, although both players defecting always remains an equilibrium and there are many other equilibrium outcomes. In casual usage, the label &quot;prisoner's dilemma&quot; may be applied to situations not strictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games, for instance, those in which two entities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so, but find it merely difficult or expensive, not necessarily impossible, to coordinate their activities to achieve cooperation.

==Open Source Nanotechnology==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-pool_resource Common property resource] management is critical to many areas of society.  Public spaces such as forests and rivers are natural commons that can generally be utilized by anyone.  With these natural spaces, resource management is in place to minimize the impact of any single user.  With the advent of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property intellectual property], such as publications, designs, artwork, and more recently, computer software, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent patent] system seeks to control the distribution of such information in order to secure the livelihood of the developer.  Open source is a development technique whereby the design is decentralized and open to the community for collaboration.


While patents reward knowledge generation by an individual or company, the reward of open source is usually the rapid development of a quality product.  It is characterized by reliability and adaptability through continual revisions.  The most notable usage for open source is in the software development community.  The [http://www.linux.org/ Linux operating system] is continually improved by a large volunteer community, who desire to make robust software that can compete with the profit-based software companies while making it freely downloadable for users.  The incentive for programmers is a highly regarded reputation in the community and individual pride in their work.  


Author [http://www.bryanbruns.com/ Bryan Bruns] believes that this open source model can be applied to the development of nanotechnology.

The article describes roles of the open source nanotechnology community based on the claim that the technology for nanotechnology manufacturing will one day be ubiquitous.

''Building equipment, food and other materials might become as easy, and cheap, as printing on paper is now. Just as a laborious process of handwriting texts was transformed first into an industrial technology for mass production and then individualized in computer printers, so also the manufacturing of equipment and other goods might also reach the same level of customized production. If &quot;assemblers&quot; could fabricate materials to order, then what would matter would not be the materials, but the design, the knowledge lying behind manufacture. The most important part of nanotechnology would be the software, the description of how to assemble something. This design information would then be quintessentially an information resource, software''. -[http://www.bryanbruns.com/ Bryan Bruns], [http://www.cm.ksc.co.th/~bruns/opennan2.htm Nanotechnology and the Commons - Implications of Open Source Abundance in Millennial Quasi-Commons]


Several important elements of an open source nanotechnology community will be:
*Establishment of standards - early adopters will have the task of developing standards of nanotechnology design and production for which the rest of the community will improve gradually.
*Development of containment strategies - built-in failsafes that will prevent the unchecked reproduction and operation of &quot;nanoassemblers&quot;.  One possible scheme is the design of specialized inputs for nanoassemblers that are required for operation--the machine has to stop when the input runs out.
*Innovative nanotechnology design and modelling tools - software that allows users to design and model technology produced in the nanoscale before using time and materials to fabricate the technology.
*Transparency to external monitoring - the ability to observe the development of technology reduces the risk of &quot;unsafe&quot; or &quot;unstable&quot; designs from being released into the public.
*Lowered cost - the price of managing an open source community is insignificant compared to the cost of management to secure intellectual property.

===Application of Open Source to Nanotechnology===
There are many currently existing open source communities that can serve as working models for an open source nanotechnology community.  Internet forums promote knowledge and community input.  In addition, new forum users are quickly exposed to a wealth of knowledge and experience.  This type of format is easily accessible and promotes widespread awareness of the topic.  One such community is:

[H]ard|OCP (http://www.hardforum.com)
&quot;[H]ard|OCP (Hardware Overclockers Comparison Page) is an online magazine that offers news, reviews, and editorials that relate to computer hardware, software, modding, overclockingcooling, owned and operated by Kyle Bennett, who started the website in 1997&quot;[1]. Hardforum is a direct parallel to an traditional open source software community. Members obtain recognition, reputation, and respect by spending time and effort within the community. Members can create and discuss diverse topics that are not limited to just software. Projects focusing on case modding are of key interest as a parallel example of what is possible for a nanotechnology project. Within these case modding projects, specific steps, documention, results, and pictures are all shared within the community for both good and bad comments. The information is presented in a pure and straight forward manor for the purpose of information sharing.

==Socioeconomic Impact of Nanotechnology==
Predicting is difficult, especially about the future and nanotech is likely not going to take us where we first anticipated.  
 
===For a Perspective===
*Nuclear technology was hailed the new era of humanity in the 60’s, but today is left with little future as a power source due to low availability for long term Uranium sources[http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19426051.200-earths-natural-wealth-an-audit.html] and evidence that utilization of nuclear power systems still generates appreciable CO2 emissions[http://www.energybulletin.net/node/15345 ]. The development of nuclear technology however has provided us with a wide range of therapeutic tools in hospitals and taught us a thorough lesson on assessing the potential environmental impact before taking a new technology to a large scale.  

*DDT was once the cure-all for malaria and mosquito related diseases as well as a general pesticide for agriculture. It turned out that DDT accumulated in the food chain and was banned, leading to a rise in the plagues it had almost eradicated. Today DDT is still generally banned by slowly reintroduced to be used where it has a high efficiency and will not be spread into nature and in minute quantities compared to  when it was lavishly sprayed onto buildings, fields and wetlands in the 1950’s. [http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19626242.000-histories-how-the-world-let-malaria-off-the-hook.html]   

*I need references for this one:

Polymer technology was ‘hot’ in the early 90’s but results were not coming as fast as anticipated, leading to a rapid decline in funding. But after the ‘fall’, the technology has matured and polymer composites are now finding applications everywhere. One could say the technology  was actually very worthy of funding but expectations were too high leading to disappointment. But time has been working for polymer technology even without large scale funding and now it is reemerging –often disguised as nanotechnology.   

*Biotechnology, especially genemodified crops, were promised to eradicate hunger and malnutrition[[reference needed]]. Fears of the environmental impact led to strict legislation limiting its use in practical applications, and many cases have since proven the restrictions sensible as new an unexpected paths for cross-breeding have been discovered[[reference needed]. However, the market pull for cheaper products leads to increased GM production worldwide with a wide range of socio-economic impacts such as poor farmers dependence on expensive GM seeds, nutrition aspects and health influence[[reference needed].   

These examples do not even include the military aspects of the technologies or the spin-off to civil life from military research – which is luckily quite large considering that in the US the military research budget is about 40% of the annual research funding [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off] [[reference needed and check up on the number!]].

===Socioeconomic Impact===
The examples in the previous section demonstrate clearly how difficult it is to predict the impact of new technology society because of contingency - the inability to know which trajectories today determine the future.  

Contingency stem from two main causes:

1) Trends versus events

Events -Taking a non-linear dynamics and somewhat mathematical point of view, Events (in nonlinear dynamics) are deterministic and so can be described with a model but they are also unpredictable (i.e. the model does not give point predictions when exactly they will occur)

Trends – The trends we observe depend largely on the framing we have in our perception of problems and their solutions. The framing is the analytical lens through which we perceive evolution and it changes over time.

=== Impact of Nanotechnologies on Developing Countries ===
Many in developing countries suffer from very basic needs, like malnutrition and lack of safe drinking water. Many have poor infrastructure in private and public R&amp;D., including small public research budgets and virtually no venture capital.Even if they are developing such infrastructures, they still have little experience in technology governance, including the launch and conduct of research programs, safety and environmental regulations, marketing and patenting strategies, and so on. These are a couple of points to point out on the effect of Nanoenabled cheap produced solar-cells on these counties:

*	Whether a product is useful and its use is beneficial to a country are difficult to assess in advance.

*	The Problem with many technologies is that scientific context often ( by definition) ignores the prevailing socioeconomic and cultural factors of a technology, such as social acceptance, customs and specific needs.

*	Expensive healthcare products only benefit the economic elite and risk increasing the health divide between the poor and rich.

*	According to the NNI, nanotechnology will be the “next industrial revolution”. This can be a unique opportunity for developing countries to quickly catch up with their economical development.

*	About two billion people worldwide have no access to electricity (World Energy Council, 1999), especially in rural areas.

*	Nanotechnology seems to be a promising potential in increasing efficiency and reducing cost of solar cells.

*	Solar technologies seem to be particularly promising for developing countries in geographic areas with high solar radiation.

*	Many international organizations have promoted solar rural electrification since the 1980’s, such as UNESCO’s summer schools on Solar Electricity for Rural Areas and the Solar Village program.

*	The real challenges of these technologies are largely of an educational and cultural nature.

*	Implementing open source into nanotechnology, cheap solar cells for rural communities might be a possibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Singapore Sling''' is a cocktail that was invented by Mr. Ngiam Tong Boon for the Raffles Hotel in Singapore sometime between 1910 and 1915. At one point the recipe fell into disuse and was actually forgotten by the bar staff. The recipe currently used by the hotel (and repeated at the Wikibooks link below) was the result of recreating the original recipe based on the memories of former bartenders and some written notes that they were able to discover.

The original recipe, which no longer includes club soda, is rarely used outside the Raffles Hotel. A notable exception is on all Singapore Airlines flights, where the drink is free in all classes of travel.

== Standard Mix ==

* 30 ml gin
* 15 ml [http://www.heering.com Heering Cherry Liqueur]
* 7.5 ml D.O.M Benedictine
* 7.5 ml Cointreau
* 120 ml Pineapple juice
* 15 ml fresh lime juice
* 10 ml grenadine
* dash of Angostura bitters
* Garnish: maraschino cherry, pineapple chunk, and orange slice

The cost of a pre-mixed Singapore Sling at Raffles Hotel, Singapore is $25.90SGD (including the 10% service charge and 7% tax) (January 8, 2009). If you want a real one, ask the bartender to mix it for you.

      <comment>/* Alternate double quotes */  noted the case of the %Q operator</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ruby Programming/TopNav|prev=Strings|next=Here documents}}

In Ruby, there's more than one way to quote a string literal. Much of this will look familiar to [[w:Perl|Perl]] programmers.

== Alternate single quotes ==

Let's say we are using single quotes to print out the following path.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts 'c:\bus schedules\napolean\the portland bus schedule.txt'
&lt;/source&gt;

The single quotes keep the &lt;code&gt;\b&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;\t&lt;/code&gt; from being treated as [[w:escape sequences|escape sequences]] (the same cannot be said for wikibooks' syntax highlighting). But consider the following string literal.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts 'c:\napolean\'s bus schedules\tomorrow\'s bus schedule.txt'
&lt;/source&gt;

Escaping the apostrophes makes the code less readable and makes it less obvious what will print out. Luckily, in Ruby, there's a better way. You can use the &lt;code&gt;%q&lt;/code&gt; operator to apply [[../Strings#Single quotes|single-quoting rules]], but choose your own [[w:delimiter|delimiter]] to mark the beginning and end of the string literal.

 puts %q!c:\napolean's documents\tomorrow's bus schedule.txt!
 puts %q/c:\napolean's documents\tomorrow's bus schedule.txt/
 puts %q^c:\napolean's documents\tomorrow's bus schedule.txt^
 puts %q(c:\napolean's documents\tomorrow's bus schedule.txt)
 puts %q{c:\napolean's documents\tomorrow's bus schedule.txt}
 puts %q&lt;c:\napolean's documents\tomorrow's bus schedule.txt&gt;

Each line will print out the same text &amp;ndash; &quot;&lt;code&gt;c:\napolean's documents\tomorrow's bus schedule.txt&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. You can use any punctuation you want as a delimiter, not just the ones listed in the example.

Of course, if your chosen delimiter appears inside of the string literal, then you need to escape it.

 puts %q#c:\napolean's documents\tomorrow's \#9 bus schedule.txt#

If you use matching braces to delimit the text, however, you can nest braces, without escaping them.

 puts %q(c:\napolean's documents\the (bus) schedule.txt)
 puts %q{c:\napolean's documents\the {bus} schedule.txt}
 puts %q&lt;c:\napolean's documents\the &lt;bus&gt; schedule.txt&gt;

== Alternate double quotes ==

The &lt;code&gt;%Q&lt;/code&gt; operator (notice the case of Q in &lt;code&gt;%Q&lt;/code&gt;) allows you to create a string literal using [[../Strings#Double quotes|double-quoting rules]], but without using the double quote as a delimiter. It works much the same as the &lt;code&gt;[[#Alternate single quotes|%q]]&lt;/code&gt; operator.


 print %Q^Say:\tHello world\n\tHello world\n^
 print %Q(Say:\tHello world\n\tHello world\n)


Just like double quotes, you can [[../Strings#Interpolation|interpolate]] Ruby code inside of these string literals.

 name = 'Charlie Brown'
 
 puts %Q!Say &quot;Hello,&quot; #{name}.!
 puts %Q/What is &quot;4 plus 5&quot;? Answer: #{4+5}/</text>

      <comment>/* Diagonal Matrix */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Analysis}}

Matrices that follow certain predefined formats are useful in a number of computations. We will discuss some of the common matrix formats here. Later chapters will show how these formats are used in calculations and analysis.

== Diagonal Matrix ==

A diagonal matrix is a matrix such that:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{ij} = 0, i \ne j&lt;/math&gt;

In otherwords, all the elements off the main diagonal are zero, and the diagonal elements may be (but don't need to be) non-zero.

== Companion Form Matrix ==

If we have the following characteristic polynomial for a matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;|A - \lambda I| = \lambda^n + a_{n-1}\lambda^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1\lambda^1 + a_0&lt;/math&gt;

We can create a '''companion form''' matrix in one of two ways:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -a_0 \\
                       1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -a_1 \\
                       0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -a_2 \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -a_3 \\
                       \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 &amp; -a_{n-1} 
       \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Or, we can also write it as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} -a_{n-1} &amp; -a_{n-2} &amp; -a_{n-3} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_1 &amp; a_0 \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                       \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 &amp; 0 
       \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Jordan Canonical Form ==

To discuss the Jordan canonical form, we first need to introduce the idea of the '''Jordan Block''':

=== Jordan Blocks ===

A jordan block is a square matrix such that all the diagonal elements are equal, and all the super-diagonal elements (the elements directly above the diagonal elements) are all 1. To illustrate this, here is an example of an n-dimensional jordan block:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
                       0 &amp; a &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; a &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
                       \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; a &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
                       0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; a 
       \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Canonical Form ===

A square matrix is in '''Jordan Canonical form''', if it is a diagonal matrix, or if it has one of the following two block-diagonal forms:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}D &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
                      0 &amp; J_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
                      \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots \\
                      0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; J_n
       \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Or:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}J_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
                      0 &amp; J_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
                      \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots \\
                      0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; J_n
       \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The where the D element is a diagonal block matrix, and the J blocks are in Jordan block form.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Analysis}}

If we have functions, and we use a matrix as the input to those functions, the output values are not always intuitive. For instance, if we have a function ''f(x)'', and as the input argument we use matrix ''A'', the output matrix is not necessarily the function ''f'' applied to the individual elements of ''A''.

== Diagonal Matrix ==

In the special case of diagonal matrices, the result of ''f(A)'' is the function applied to each element of the diagonal matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix} 
             a_{11} &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
             0 &amp; a_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
             \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
             0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{nn}
           \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Then the function ''f(A)'' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;f(A) = \begin{bmatrix} 
             f(a_{11}) &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
             0 &amp; f(a_{22}) &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
             \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
             0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; f(a_{nn})
           \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Jordan Cannonical Form ==

Matrices in Jordan Canonical form also have an easy way to compute the functions of the matrix. However, this method is not nearly as easy as the diagonal matrices described above. 

If we have a matrix in Jordan Block form, ''A'', the function ''f(A)'' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;f(A) = \begin{bmatrix} 
             \frac{f(a)}{0!} &amp; \frac{f'(a)}{1!} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{f^{(r-1)}(a)}{(r-1)!} \\
             0 &amp;  \frac{f(a)}{0!} &amp; \cdots &amp;  \frac{f^(r-2)(a)}{(r-2)!} \\
             \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
             0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp;  \frac{f(a)}{0!}
           \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The matrix indices have been removed, because in Jordan block form, all the diagonal elements must be equal.

If the matrix is in Jordan Block form, the value of the function is given as the function applied to the individual diagonal blocks.</text>

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(\lambda) = |A-\lambda I| = (-1)^n(\lambda^n + a_{n-1}\lambda^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Then the Cayley-Hamilton theorem states that the matrix ''A'' itself is also a valid solution to that equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(A) = (-1)^n(A^n + a_{n-1}A^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Another theorem worth mentioning here (and by &quot;worth mentioning&quot;, we really mean &quot;fundamental for some later topics&quot;) is stated as:

{{TextBox|If &amp;lambda; are the eigenvalues of matrix ''A'', and if there is a function ''f'' that is defined as a linear combination of powers of &amp;lambda;:

:&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda) = \sum_{i = 0}^\infty b_i \lambda^i&lt;/math&gt;

If this function has a radius of convergence ''S'', and if all the eigenvectors of ''A'' have magnitudes less then ''S'', then the matrix ''A'' itself is also a solution to that function:

:&lt;math&gt;f(A) = \sum_{i = 0}^\infty b_i A^i&lt;/math&gt;}}</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ruby Programming/TopNav|prev=Alternate quotes|next=ASCII}}

For creating multiple-line strings, Ruby supports [[w:here document|here documents]] (heredocs), a feature that originated in the [[w:Bourne shell|Bourne shell]] and is also available in [[w:Perl|Perl]] and [[w:PHP|PHP]].

== Here documents ==

To construct a here document, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; operator is followed by an identifier that marks the end of the here document. The end mark is called the terminator. The lines of text prior to the terminator are joined together, including the newlines and any other whitespace.

 puts &lt;&lt;GROCERY_LIST
 Grocery list
 ------------
 1. Salad mix.
 2. Strawberries.*
 3. Cereal.
 4. Milk.*
 
 * Organic
 GROCERY_LIST

The result:

 $ '''grocery-list.rb'''
 Grocery list
 ------------
 1. Salad mix.
 2. Strawberries.*
 3. Cereal.
 4. Milk.*
 
 * Organic

If we pass the &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; function multiple arguments, the string literal created from the here document is inserted into the argument list wherever the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; operator appears. In the code below, the here-document ''(containing the four grocery items and a blank line)'' is passed in as the third argument. We get the same output as above.

 puts 'Grocery list', '------------', &lt;&lt;GROCERY_LIST, '* Organic'
 1. Salad mix.
 2. Strawberries.*
 3. Cereal.
 4. Milk.*
 
 GROCERY_LIST

You can also have multiple here documents in an argument list. We added a blank line at the end of each here document to make the output more readable.

 puts 'Produce', '-------', &lt;&lt;PRODUCE, 'Dairy', '-----', &lt;&lt;DAIRY, '* Organic'
 1. Strawberries*
 2. Blueberries
 
 PRODUCE
 1. Yogurt
 2. Milk*
 3. Cottage Cheese
 
 DAIRY

The result:

 $ '''grocery-list.rb'''
 Produce
 -------
 1. Strawberries*
 2. Blueberries
 
 Dairy
 -----
 1. Yogurt
 2. Milk*
 3. Cottage Cheese
 
 * Organic

We have been using the &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; function in our examples, but you can pass here documents to any function that accepts Strings.

== Indenting ==

If you indent the lines inside the here document, the leading whitespace is preserved. However, there must not be any leading whitespace before the terminator.

 puts 'Grocery list', '------------', &lt;&lt;GROCERY_LIST
     1. Salad mix.
     2. Strawberries.
     3. Cereal.
     4. Milk.
 GROCERY_LIST

The result:

 $ '''grocery-list.rb'''
 Grocery list
 ------------
     1. Salad mix.
     2. Strawberries.
     3. Cereal.
     4. Milk.

If, for readability, you want to also indent the terminator, use the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/code&gt; operator. 

 puts 'Grocery list', '------------', &lt;&lt;-GROCERY_LIST
     1. Salad mix.
     2. Strawberries.
     3. Cereal.
     4. Milk.
     GROCERY_LIST

Note, however, that the whitespace before each line of text ''within'' the here document is still preserved.

 $ '''grocery-list.rb'''
 Grocery list
 ------------
     1. Salad mix.
     2. Strawberries.
     3. Cereal.
     4. Milk.

== Quoting rules ==

You may wonder whether here documents follow [[../Strings#Single quotes|single-quoting]] or [[../Strings#Double quotes|double-quoting]] rules. If there are no quotes around the identifier, like in our examples so far, then the body of the here document follows double-quoting rules.

 name = 'Charlie Brown'
 
 puts &lt;&lt;QUIZ
 Student: #{name}
 
 1.\tQuestion: What is 4+5?
 \tAnswer: The sum of 4 and 5 is #{4+5}
 QUIZ

The result:

 $ '''quiz.rb'''
 Student: Charlie Brown
 
 1.&amp;#09;Question: What is 4+5?
 &amp;#09;Answer: The sum of 4 and 5 is 9

Double-quoting rules are also followed if you put double quotes around the identifier. However, do not put double quotes around the terminator.

 puts &lt;&lt;&quot;QUIZ&quot;
 Student: #{name}
 
 1.\tQuestion: What is 4+5?
 \tAnswer: The sum of 4 and 5 is #{4+5}
 QUIZ

To create a here document that follows single-quoting rules, place single quotes around the identifier.

 puts &lt;&lt;'BUS_SCHEDULES'
 c:\napolean's documents\tomorrow's bus schedule.txt
 c:\new documents\sam spade's bus schedule.txt
 c:\bus schedules\the #9 bus schedule.txt
 BUS_SCHEDULES

The result:

 $ '''bus-schedules.rb'''
 c:\napolean's documents\tomorrow's bus schedule.txt
 c:\new documents\sam spade's bus schedule.txt
 c:\bus schedules\the #9 bus schedule.txt</text>

{{eqn|Lyapunov's Equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;AM + MB = C&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are constant square matrices, and M is the solution that we are trying to find. If ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are of the same order, and if ''A'' and ''B'' have no eigenvalues in common, then the solution can be given in terms of matrix exponentials:

:&lt;math&gt;M = -\int_0^\infty e^{Ax}Ce^{Bx}dx&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <comment>/* Matrix Definiteness */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Analysis}}

If we have an n &amp;times; 1 vector x, and an n &amp;times; n symmetric matrix M, we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;x^TMx = a&lt;/math&gt;

Where a is a scalar value. Equations of this form are called '''quadratic forms'''.

== Matrix Definiteness ==

Based on the quadratic forms of a matrix, we can create a certain number of categories for special types of matrices:

#if &lt;math&gt;x^TMx &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; for all x, then the matrix is '''positive definite'''. 
#if &lt;math&gt;x^TMx \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; for all x, then the matrix is '''positive semi-definite'''. 
#if &lt;math&gt;x^TMx &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; for all x, then the matrix is '''negative definite'''. 
#if &lt;math&gt;x^TMx \le 0&lt;/math&gt; for all x, then the matrix is '''negative semi-definite'''. 

These classifications are used commonly in control engineering.</text>

==Ingredients==

* 1 large egg plant (aubergine)
* Greek olive oil
* Salt

===Meat Sauce===

* One large onion, chopped
* Six cloves of garlic, chopped
* Three tablespoons of olive oil
* One kilogram (2.2 lbs) of minced/ground beef or lamb
* One large (28 oz) tin of diced tomatoes
* One cup of red wine
* Two tablespoons of chopped, fresh parsley
* Two tablespoons of chopped, fresh Greek basil (optional)
* Two bay leaves
* One teaspoon of sugar
* One cinnamon stick
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Two tablespoons of tomato paste

===Cheese Sauce===

* Three tablespoons of butter
* Four tablespoons of plain flour
* Two cups of milk
* Sprinkle of nutmeg, cinnamon and black pepper
* Half a cup of freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
* One cup of grated cheese (tasty, Edam, whatever)
* One egg

==Procedure==

Cut egg plant into 5mm slices. Lay the slices out and sprinkle liberally with salt. This leaches out the bitterness. Leave these for at least an hour.

Heat olive oil in a saucepan and add onion and garlic. Sauté these until the onion starts to change colour. Add the meat and brown thoroughly. Add bay leaves and cinnamon stick, and continue to stir the meat until all the moisture from the meat is gone. Add tomatoes, herbs and sauces. Mix through and allow to cook for fifteen minutes, stirring occasionally. Add wine and continue to cook until the sauce is very thick. It should have very little moisture in it all. Remove the bay leaves and cinnamon stick! Allow to cool.

In another saucepan, melt butter over a low heat. Remove from heat and add the flour. Blend this through thoroughly, then return to the heat and cook gently for three minutes, stirring continuously so that it does not catch (burn). Remove from heat and add the milk. Mix this through then return to the heat and allow mixture to boil. Allow sauce to cook gently for one minute, stirring continuously. Remove from heat, add cheeses, nutmeg, cinnamon and pepper and mix through.  Stand sauce aside and allow to cool.

Rinse the slices of egg plant under running water and dry on paper towels. Heat olive oil in a frying pan. Place slices of egg plant in the pan and quickly turn to coat both sides in the hot oil. Fry until the slices are cooked (when they change colour and become soft). Drain. Repeat with remaining slices.

In a large casserole dish, lay slices of egg plant to cover the bottom. Cover with a layer of the meat sauce. Repeat layering egg plant and meat sauce until within three centimetres of the top of the dish.

Add the egg to the cool, cheese sauce and mix through thoroughly. Spoon this on the top layer in the casserole dish and sprinkle with extra grated cheese. Bake at 200 degrees C for 45 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool and set for ten minutes.

Serve with a tossed Greek salad, red wine and crusty garlic bread.

This is the Catsoulis family recipe from the Greek island of Kythera.

==Ingredients==

* Flathead fillets
* Plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]], seasoned with [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:pepper]]
* Tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 2 cloves of chopped, fresh [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 sprig of fresh [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]] leaves, chopped
* Half a cup of brown [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]

==Procedure==

Toss fillets in seasoned flour. Heat oil in a pan and add garlic and rosemary leaves. Cook slightly, then add the fish. When the fish is cooked, remove from pan and drain off excess oil. There should be enough flour in the pan (fallen from the fish) to make the sauce. If there isn’t, add a tablespoon of flour to the pan juices and brown. Add vinegar (and stand back!). Add a little water and stir to make gravy. Spoon over fish and serve with a Greek salad.

===''Kotopoulo Kapama''===

This is the Catsoulis family version, from the Greek island of Kythera.

==Ingredients== 

* Chicken pieces (one per person)
* 2 large onions, finely chopped
* 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
* 1 tin of tomatoes, or 300g of high-quality, fresh tomatoes
* 3 tablespoons of olive oil
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 3 bay leaves
* Half tablespoon of finely chopped, fresh parsley 
* Half cup of red wine (shiraz)
* 3 tablespoons of tomato paste

===Options===

* 1 carrot (cut into thick slices)
* 1 stick of celery (cut into thin 3&quot; strips)
* Finely chopped celery leaves
* Quarter of a teaspoon of ground cloves
 

==Procedure==

Heat oil in saucepan and add onion. Stir gently until onion is well browned. Add chicken, bay leaves and cinnamon and thoroughly brown chicken on all sides. The objective is to get as much &quot;stock&quot; from the skin as possible as this adds to the flavour later on. 

Add tomatoes, garlic, wine and water, and cook through. Add parsley, celery leaves, celery, carrot. Pour on enough water to cover. Allow to cook slowly for at least two hours. It is important to cook over a low heat so that sauce does not catch. Stirring or agitation will only cause the vegetables and chicken pieces to break up.

Serve with thin spaghetti or vermicelli. Grate cheese generously over dish. 

====Notes====

The fresher the ingredients, the better it will taste. It is important to get as much &quot;stock&quot; from the chicken as possible. This is the reason for leaving the skin and bone on, although too much skin will result in a ‘fatty’ dish. The chicken should be browned for at least 10 minutes before the tomatoes are added.

If wine is added, it should be a good wine. When wine is used in cooking, the alcohol boils off leaving only the taste of the wine, therefore a poor quality wine will do little for the flavour.

Don't be overgenerous when adding ingredients as an imbalance will shift the final result. In particular, strong sauces should only be used in small quantities.

An additional, small piece of pumpkin may be finely chopped and added to thicken the sauce. It will cook away completely but will enhance the flavour.</text>

=NanoMedicine=

Helping improve humanity is one of the promises of nanotechnology.  Much hope and hype has surrounded nanomedicine.  Research is actively pursuing the benefits of nanotechnology enabled medicine and the promise of organ specific drug delivery and cancer treatments.  But, there is no consensus among the research and medicine community that shows the toxic effects of heavy metal nanoparticles in the body when used as &quot;treatments&quot;.  This chapter will highlight some of the research findings in the nanomedicine area.

Scientists are working to find &quot;nanostructers&quot; for many different kinds of cures, including Parkin's and Cardiovascular Disease, treatment for cancer, nanomaterial for new artificial limbs, and nanodevices that could restore hearing and vision.

==Example #1: Nanosilver==
For thousands of years, silver has been known to be a potent bacteria killer. However, due to the fact that silver could not dissolve well, it's efficiency as an antimicrobial has been slim. This problem has been solved by the company Nucryst Pharmaceuticals. To combat it's inability to dissolve, they use a nanocrystalline form of silver to fight off bacteria. Silver ions rapidly kill microbes in a variety of ways which include blocking the cell respiration pathway, interfering with components of the microbial electron transport system, binding DNA, and inhibiting DNA replication.
 
Their first product with the silver is Anticoat, a dressing for serious burns. Anticoat antimicrobial barrier dressing works to reduce or kill off bacteria, have high absorbency rates, continue working for a full 7 days, and are easy to remove without disrupting the wound. When the dressing is removed, it peels off in one peice and a new coat can be applied. A high absorbency rate is required because many wounds release a lot of body fluids and a good absorbency rate will maintain a healthy wound environment. It is usable for a week and can also be used for serious words. Also, now they are exploring the anti-inflammatory properties of silver for use in atopic dermatitis and certain respiratory conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Steven A. Where are They Taking Us? Weinham Wiley-Vich, 2006. Chapter 8, page 129: Section-Delivering Drugs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example #2: Regenerating Neurons==
There is a research team at USC that is working on producing artificial motor neurons.  These neurons could serve several functions; including letting people with paralyzed limbs use their limbs again.  These fake neurons would essentially take over the functions of the real motor neurons.  Using this technology doctors could replace motor neurons since neurons do not grow back.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Steven A. The Nanotech Pioneers, Where Are They Taking Us. Weinheim: wiley-vch, 2006. 
Taken from chap 8, pages 159-161:  section- Artificial Cells.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example 3: Peptides for wound healing==
Researchers at MIT have found liquids called peptides that form a nanoscale barrier in seconds, stopping the flow of blood. later. when the wound is healed, the solution breaks down and can be used by the body as new tissue. The same scientists also reported that a peptide partially restored a hamster's vision.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2006/hemostasis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples #6: Malaria==
Dr. Subra Suresh, a professor at MIT, using nanotechnology, has studied malaria, an infection spread by mosquitoes, in which tiny parasites infect the red blood cell. Using “laser tweezers” and two nano-sized glass beads fused to the red blood cell surface, he found that infected cells may be as much as 15-times stiffer than normal cells, which causes them to clog up small blood vessels. He is now looking at the effect of different genes in the parasite that may produce this effect as this may allow the finding of a treatment for this world wide disease.

==Example #7: Increased drug dispersion from nanoparticles==
One of the greatest prospects of nanomedicine is in drug delivery.  On the most basic level current drugs ground into a smaller state have a greater surface area which allows them to dissolve more quickly in the stomach.  A variation on this idea is using small crystals of medicine.  These crystals allow every molecule to be close to the surface which creates an enviroment where even the most slow dissolving compounds will dissolve quickly.&lt;ref&gt; The Nanotech Pioneers. Edwards Steven A. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example #8: Drug delivery polymer nanoparticles==
Drug delivery is one of the best benefits of nanomedicine. There are many different schemes for improving drug delivery, for example, molecules can be put into nanoscale cavities inside polymers. The polymer can then be swallowed as part of a tablet or pill, and when the polymer opens inside the body, the drugs can be released into the body.
More complex schemes have also been developed, such as getting drugs through cell walls and into the cell. Efficient drug delivery is essential, because many diseases depend on processes within the cell, and can only be affected with drugs delivered into the cell.&lt;ref&gt;Ratner, Mark, and Daniel Ratner. Nanotechnology A Gentle Introduction To The Next Big Idea. New Jersey: Prentice Hall PTR, 2003. Chapter 8, page 110-111: Section-Drug Delivery.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example #9: IMEDD (Intelligent MicroEngineered Drug Delivery)==

IMEDD (Intelligent MicroEngineered Drug Delivery) is trying to make tiny drug deliver pumps. The researchers at IMEDD are working with Terry Conlisk, who is an engineer at Ohio State, who has made a computer model that helps small drug reservoirs pump out drugs when they are needed. They use this principal to work the pumps, &quot;If a fluid is positively or negatively charged and there is a like charge to the inner surfaces of a channel, the charges will repel each other. The result is that the fluid will flow down the channel.&quot; In their experiments, they have been able to put almost 0.5 nL of saline per minute through a channel only 7nm wide. Medical researchers hope to use this technology to push tiny amounts of drugs into the body exactly where they are needed. They accomplish this by a technique developed by a team of scientists and engineers at ASU called photocapillarity. Photocapillarity is defined as &quot;the microfluidic actuation of water in an enclosed capillary or microchannel using light&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Steven A. Where are They Taking Us? Weinham Wiley-Vich, 2006. Chapter 8, page 140-141: Section- Pumps.&lt;/ref&gt;

=Targeting Cancer=

Cancer is the focus of many new nanomedicine therapies under development for repairing damaged tissues and treating and detecting cancer by developing medical interventions at the molecular scale that couples nanotechnology, clinical science, and the life sciences. 
People are developing innovative drug and gene delivery strategies and modulating molecular events can control cell processes such as initiating, enhancing, and maintaining macro- and micro- vasculature to ensure tissue viability, vessel networks within tissue engineered constructs and autologous tissue flaps and grafts. Developing novel synthetic, natural, or hybrid materials to control cell-material interactions, biomechanics, angiogenesis, and the in vivo release of therapeutic agents.

==Cancer example #1: Nanoparticles Generate Supersonic Shock Waves to Target Cancer==
Researchers from UCM (the University of Missouri-Columbia) and the United States Army have made a nano-sized “bomb”. This bomb can target drug delivery to cancer tumors without damage to any other cells. The nano thermites produce shock waves in the Mach 3 range. Cancer fighting drugs would be administered via a needle, and then a device would send a pulse into the tumor. The pulse would create little holes in the tumor, so the drugs can enter.&lt;ref&gt;Apperson, S.. [http://www.physorg.com/news119702507.html &quot;Nanoparticles Generate Supersonic Shock Waves to Target Cancer''[[Physorg.com]]'', [[2008]]. Retrieved on [[2008-6-23]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancer example #2: monitor post-treatment relapse==
MNC is working with the Medical School at Swansea to develop a nanoscale sensor that would be put into the body and would be capable of detecting the growth of cancerous cells in patients.  It would monitor post-treatment relapse.  This way of finding the cancer cells at an early stage would reduce mortality rates dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Bunting, Swansea University.

==Cancer Example #3: Photodynamic therapy==
Photodynamic therapy (a type of treatment for cancer that is nothing like chemotherapy) is directed to hit the spot where the cancer is, it is a therapeutic idea. What happens during photodynamic therapy?  They would put a metal nanodot or a molecular dot (the particle) inside your body and then they would shine a type of light to illuminate it from the outside. Then the light is absorbed by which ever particle they put in your body.  So if you have a metal nanodot and it have absorbed the light the energy will heat the metal nanodot up making every tissue that it near heat up to. But with the molecular dot the light absorbed creates oxygen molecules that are very energetic. And since the oxygen molecules are highly reactive it chemically reacts or destroy the organic molecules that are beside it (example: tumors).&lt;ref&gt;Ratner, Mark and Daniel Ratner. Nanotechnology A Gentle Introduction To The Next Big Idea. New Jersey: Prentice Hall PTR, November 2002. Chapter 8 page.113: section-Photodynamic Therapy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancer Example #4: NIH Roadmap's Nanomedicine initiative==
NIH Roadmap's Nanomedicine initiative is working on advancing the study of nanotechnology.  They hope to be able to detect cancer cells before a tumor develops and accurately destroy them, and have nano-sized pumps in your body that deliver medicines into your body where you need it.  They believe they will be able to do this in ten years.

=MRI - Magnetic resonance imaging=
==MRI Example #1: MRI nanoparticles==
Biophan is a company specializing in nanomedical applications. One of their projects is to make MRIs safer for patients with microelectronic implants that include metals. By using a coating of nanomagnetic particles, these devices, including pacemakers, are shielded from the radio waves from the MRI machine and current (which could harm the patient) caused by electromagnetic radiation is reduced. It was also found that these particles could be used as contrast agents to allow for a clearer image by creating sharper contrast among the different tissue types in the body during an MRI scan. Biophan is also working towards longer lasting batteries for pacemakers and other medical devices (by using body heat), smart drug delivery, and other nanomedicine projects. &lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Steven A. (2006). ''The Nanotech Pioneers: Where Are They Taking Us?'', Chapter 8, pages 134-138. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. ISBN 3527312900. &lt;/ref&gt;

==MRI Example #2: magnetic nanoparticles==
Magnetic nanoparticles have shown promise as contrast-enhancing agents for improving cancer detection using magnetic resonance imaging, as miniaturized heaters capable of killing malignant cells, and as targeted drug delivery vehicles. Now, researchers at the University of Nebraska have developed a novel coating for magnetic nanoparticles that allows the particles to carry large amounts of drug and to disperse efficiently in water. This development may enable targeted delivery of water-insoluble anticancer agents or imaging agents.

=The story of the 'Nanobacteria'=
In 1988, Olavi Kajander discovered what he described as &quot;nanobacteria.&quot;  Something was killing his mammalian cells, and after looking closer using an electron microscope, he found something inside of the cells.  However, this was not any normal bacterium- the organisms had diameters between 20 and 200 nanometers.  Their sizes were too small to support a complex metabolism like the bacteria known to microbiologists.  Though his nanobacteria was dismissed by most of the rest of the scientific world, Kajander had become attached to them.  After multiple failed attempts to prove their scientific legibility, he connected their hard outer shells-made up of calcium phosphate- and kidney stones, which are caused by calcium compounds. It turns out that the so-called &quot;nanobacteria&quot; were related to, not only kidney stones, but ovarian cancer, Alzheimer's, and prostatitis. Though they are not recognized as true bacteria and have no DNA or RNA, nanobacteria can reproduce, albeit slowly. Strange. Interestingly enough, nanobacteria has been reported in underground rock and other such geological formations. Further, there are claims that nanobacteria have been found in meteorites and, after being transported into zero gravity, nanobacteria has been found to reproduce at a much faster rate than when on earth. Some wonder if nanobacteria is not really from earth, but outer space.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Steven (2006). ''The Nanotech Pioneers'', p.141-143. WILEY-VCH, Weinheim. ISBN 3527312900&lt;/ref&gt;

=BioMedicine=

==Herb Example #1: Clinacanthus nutans ==

In Thailand the leaves of Sabah Snake Grass (Clinacanthus nutans) had been used by traditional healers to treat herpes infections and it's shown to have verifieable antiviral activity. It was found that C. Nutons was able to increase lymphocyte proliferation significantly and reduce the activity of natural killer cells (NK Cells) significantly. &lt;ref&gt;[http://interesjournals.org/IRJPP/Pdf/2012/October/Na-Bangchang%20et%20al.pdf &quot;Anticancer activity and immunostimulating effect on NK-cell activity of a well-known Thai folkloric remedy&quot; ''[[interesjournals.org]]'', [[2012]]. Taken on [[2013-1-12]].&lt;/ref&gt; It's shown to increase immune response activity strong enough to cure different diseases. It's beliefed that it can cure cancer aswell. It possess a strong anti-inflammatory activity, because of the ability to inhibit the neutrophil responsiveness as evidenced by the significant inhibtiion of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. C. nutans is a plant used extensively by traditional healers of southern Thailand and North-western Malaysia as a remedy for envenomation be it snakes or venomous insects like scorpions and bees effectively. Cherdchu et al did not find any antivenin activity, that's why it's not known how it's works as Antivenom. Pannangpetch et al looked found antioxidant and protective effects against free radical-induced haemolysis properties in ethanolic extracts of the leaves of C. nutans. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globinmed.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79320 &quot;Pre-Clinical Data for Clinacanthus nutans (Burm.f.) Lindau&quot;. Taken on [[2013-1-12]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herb Example #2: Annona muricata ==
There is evidence indicating that the fruit's extracts selectively inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells by downregulating expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in vitro and in a mouse model, but the effect has not been studied in humans. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globinmed.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85402:annona-muricata&amp;catid=199:safety-of-herbal&amp;Itemid=139 &quot;Pre-Clinical Data for Annona muricata&quot;.

      <comment>/* Templates */ Fixed link to avoid redirect.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the style manual for [[Horticulture]].

==Structure==
For ease of linking, this book uses a flat structure. All chapters should thus be of the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Horticulture/CHAPTER]], not [[Horticulture/Chapter/PAGE]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 

By using the flat structure, links from chapter to chapter can be easily made using the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[[../CHAPTER/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

==Categories==
There are several subcategories of this book, arranged hierarchically. The [[:Category:Horticulture|Main Category]] should include only the subcategories, the main page and new pages that don't seem to fit into any of the current categories, or that have not yet had appropriate page templates added to them. Any new subcategories should be placed in [[:Category:Horticulture]], only the main page should be in the main category. For ease of use categories should sort subpages alphabetically using &lt;nowiki&gt;|{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to give for example &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Horticulture/Pests|{{SUBPAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

The current list of categories is as follows. Further indented categories are subcategories of the main ones:
{{#categorytree:Horticulture|mode=categories|hideroot}}

==Images== 
Images should be uploaded to commons, rather than to wikibooks, since this book cross-links with wikipedia, wikiversity, and other projects.

Since this book is intended to be printable, avoid thumbnails except in galleries. For best print quality, make images at least 300px.

==Plant profiles==
Plant profiles should:

*Be placed in as many subcategories as are needed, so long as they are not redundant (e.g., &quot;Fruit trees&quot; and &quot;Weed trees&quot;, but not also &quot;Horticulture&quot;)
*Use the appropriate templates (if you don't know how to use them, just drop them on there in the proper place so another editor can fill them out).
*Use Wikipedia transwikis as a base when there is good information there.
*'''Use scientific names only''': Common names have caused considerable confusion and tension on Wikipedia. Common names can be pointed to in the index, so do not make redirects from common names.

===Templates===
The plant pages use templates to provide structure and consistency. Most of thee plant profiles are based on transwikis from Wikipedia using the Import tool. After an article is transwikied and moved to Horticulture, adding &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:plantprof}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the top of the page (generally just before the &quot;taxobox&quot;) and remove any categories or interwiki links at the bottom of the page.

Additional templates are used to identify specific types of plants and other things grown. See [[Horticulture/Using Templates]] for more information.

===Pest and disease lists===
The Pest and disease lists are compiled from various source materials, including sources on the plants themselves, as well as sources on the pests and diseases themselves. These lists can be kept up-to-date using the '''What links here''' page (on the sidebar). 

The early lists are from a donated website, &quot;Johnny's Plant Profiles&quot;, which was hosted by [[User:SBJohnny]] from 2000 through 2005. These lists were compiled for the purpose of databasing to find alternate hosts (including both garden plants and weeds) as part of an organic IPM program, and that databasing approach has been used as part of building this book as well (using [[Special:Wantedpages]] to find the most linked pests and diseases. 

The weakness of these lists is that they assume a very high level of knowledge about the individual pests and diseases, since it lists only the pest organisms, rather than the symptoms of any given pest or disease problem. For this reason, these should eventually be replaced by troubleshooting sections (see below).

===Troubleshooting sections===
Troubleshooting sections will be like keys for using symptoms to provide causes and treatments.

==External links==
External links on the module page should be avoided, unless used as references. External link sections from transwikis should for the most part be deleted. Linking to external sites on the talk page is usually acceptable if used in order to alert authors to more information that might be included or where questions can be asked (web forums, etc.).

Links to nurseries and local services should never be included under any circumstances.

Links to commercial websites about specific garden products should be included only on pages directly discussing that product.

==NPOV==
This book uses a '''Neutral Point of View''', so several things need to be kept in mind.
#Since this text is intended to address a wide geographical audience (all gardens in regions prone to freezing), a geographically neutral language is required:
##Plants should not be discussed as &quot;native&quot;, but rather &quot;native to such and such regions&quot;
##Likewise, &quot;invasive&quot; should be avoided as a stand-alone term, using &quot;invasive in this/these region(s)&quot; instead
##Hardiness should be described using zones, rather than using language like &quot;hardy perennial&quot; or &quot;tender perennial&quot;
##Weed species should be discussed as to their weediness in general or in specific regions. 
#Aesthetic language is of course par for the course in a Garden book, but superlatives should be avoided.  
##&quot;This tomato has sweet, firm flesh, and is good for slicing&quot; is fine, but &quot;this is the world's best slicing tomato&quot; is certainly over the top.
##Imperatives should be avoided at all costs (e.g., &quot;this plant should never be destroyed, but always transplanted to other gardens&quot;.
#Aside from the upper-level chapters on organic gardening, permaculture, and so on, organic-specific pages should be avoided. Plant, pests and disease profiles should instead simply list both organic and non-organic approaches.

==Focus limitations==
Information about the plant other than garden-related issues is encouraged, but &quot;how-to&quot; information outside the scope of horticulture should be discussed in other books. 
*Discussion of the harvesting and storage of food and medicinal crops should be included, but specific recipes and preparations should be instead added to the [[Cookbook]] or to an herbal medicine book.
*Discussion of material uses (lumber, etc.) should be limited to the properties of the material and examples for how it is used. Specific discussions of how to make specific use of a material should be given in another book (or another chapter, if the use is garden-related).
*Links to websites about products made from plant materials are not permitted.

== Motivation ==
People who design forms frequently have to maintain many code tables.  These code tables may change frequently and there may be processes that update a database of centrally maintained code tables.  So you want each form to dynamically get the current relevant codes from an XML file or a RESTful web service.

This sample program demonstrates how to read a list of codes with labels directly from a file or code-table web service.  In this example the file that contains the codes is just a well-formed XML file in the same directory that the form is located in.

== Loading XML instance data from a local file or web service ==

The following code fragment, usually in the HTML head, demonstrates how to read XML data from a local file in the same directory as the form by using the &quot;src&quot; attribute of the instance.

=== Loading a Single Codes Table into a Single Instance ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;xf:model&gt;
      &lt;xf:instance src=&quot;XMLSchemaTypeCode.xml&quot; id=&quot;XMLSchemaTypeCode&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/xf:model&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Loading Codes from a Web Service ===

It is common to have a single web service load all code tables.  This service can be passed parameters such as the name of the code table as well as the group the person is a part of.  This can narrow down the list of selections for long lists.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;xf:model&gt;
      &lt;xf:instance id=&quot;ApprovalCodes&quot; src=&quot;/db/mdr/services/all-codes.xq?code=ApprovalCodes&amp;group=editor&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/xf:model&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Loading all Codes into a single Instance ===
The problem with loading individual code tables into individual instances is that you must perform a separate HTTP get for each code table.  This is not a problem for forms with one or two small selection lists.  But for large forms with many selection lists this can slow down form response time.  The solution is to load '''all''' codes into a single instance with a single HTTP GET request.  Each code table can then be selected from this instance.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;xf:model&gt;
      &lt;xf:instance src=&quot;/db/mdr/services/all-codes.xq?form=DataElementManager&amp;group=admin&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/xf:model&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this second example all the codes in the entire form are generated by a service of the Metadata Registry (MDR).  The data returned by this server is a collection of codes for each select1 control in the form.

This will look for a well-formed XML file in the current directory and load it into the model instance.

Note that in this case the model is given an id.  This is necessary to allow multiple code tables to each be read into their own separate model.

== Screen Image ==

Here is a screen image of the program.  As the user selects from the drop-down list, the value of the output is immediately updated.

[[Image:XForms-select-from-file.jpg|frame|center]]

Note that label on the screen is not the same as the label stored in the model.

== Sample Program ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
  xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
  xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot; &gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Select List From File&lt;/title&gt;
      
      /* the default model */
      &lt;xf:model&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;MyData&gt;
                  &lt;MyXMLSchemaTypeCode/&gt;
            &lt;/MyData&gt;
         &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
      
      /* read the codes from an external file into this model */
      &lt;xf:model id=&quot;XMLSchemaTypeCode&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance src=&quot;XMLSchemaTypeCode.xml&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
      
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This selection list was read from a file.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;xf:select1  ref=&quot;/MyData/MyXMLSchemaTypeCode&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:label&gt;Select XML Schema data type: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
         &lt;xf:itemset model=&quot;XMLSchemaTypeCode&quot; nodeset=&quot;/XMLSchemaTypeCode/item&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label ref=&quot;label&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;xf:value ref=&quot;value&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/xf:itemset&gt;
      &lt;/xf:select1&gt;
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;/MyData/MyXMLSchemaTypeCode&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:label&gt;Value of MyXMLSchemaTypeCode: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
      &lt;/xf:output&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample XML Data ==
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;XMLSchemaTypeCode&gt;
   &lt;label&gt;XML Schema Type:&lt;/label&gt;

      &lt;value&gt;dateTime&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Time (HH:MM:SS-06:00)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;time&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Date (yyyy-mm-dd)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;date&lt;/value&gt;

   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Decimal (0.00)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;decimal&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Any URI&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;anyURI&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Integer (...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;integer&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Non-Positive Integer (...,-2,-1,0)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;nonPositiveInteger&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Negative Integer (...,-2,-1)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;negativeInteger&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Long (-9,223,372T .. 9,223,372T)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;long&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Int (-2,147,483,648 .. 2,147,483,647)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;int&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Short (-32,768 .. 32,767)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;short&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Byte (-128 .. 127)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;byte&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Non-negative Integer (0..N)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;nonNegativeInteger&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Positive Integer (1..N)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;positiveInteger&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Unsigned Long (0 .. 18,446,744T)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;unsignedLong&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Unsigned Int (0 .. 4,294,967,295)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;unsignedInt&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Unsigned Short (0.. 65,535)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;unsignedShort&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
   &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Unsigned Byte (0..255)&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;unsignedByte&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/XMLSchemaTypeCode&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that to be well-formed the XML file MUST contain a root data element that must match the node-set argument.

== Extracting data from an XML REST web service ==

You can replace the instance '''src''' attribute with a path directly to a XML REST web service.  For example, if you put all your code tables into a project resources collection the path would look like the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:instance src=&quot;../resources/code-tables/PersonGenderCode.xml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

or if your system codes are stored in a single XML file and you have a wrapper XQuery

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:instance src=&quot;../resources/code-tables/get-codes-for.xq?element=PersonGenderCode&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Selection Lists From A Single Instance ==
To keep your forms fast, it is usually better to do a single HTTP GET operation for all your codes.  Forms that have many selection lists will take a long time to load if each list does a separate HTTP GET operation.  For large forms it is easy to get a 10x speedup in form load times.

=== Structure of Code Tables Instance ===
The following is a sample structure of all codes loaded into a single instance:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:instance id=&quot;code-tables&quot;&gt;
   &lt;code-tables&gt;
      &lt;code-table&gt;
         &lt;code-table-name&gt;MyElementCode&lt;/code-table-name&gt;
         &lt;items&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;
               &lt;label&gt;Joe Smith&lt;/label&gt;
               &lt;value&gt;42&lt;/value&gt;
            &lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;
               &lt;label&gt;Sue Johnson&lt;/label&gt;
               &lt;value&gt;47&lt;/value&gt;
            &lt;/item&gt;
         &lt;items&gt;
      &lt;/code-table&gt;
      &lt;code-table&gt;
         &lt;code-table-name&gt;ColorCode&lt;/code-table-name&gt;
         &lt;items&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;
               &lt;label&gt;Red&lt;/label&gt;
               &lt;value&gt;1&lt;/value&gt;
            &lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;
               &lt;label&gt;Orange&lt;/label&gt;
               &lt;value&gt;2&lt;/value&gt;
            &lt;/item&gt;
         &lt;items&gt;
      &lt;/code-table&gt;
   &lt;/code-tables&gt;
&lt;/xf:instance&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Sample Select1 ===
Once your data is loaded into your model, each of your '''select1''' or '''select''' controls can get its data directly from the model using the''' xf:itemset''' element.  Itemset works just like repeat and uses nodeset (not ref) to get all its values.  Here is an example of how to get the itemset data from your code-tables instance.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:select1 ref=&quot;instance('save-data')/MyElementName&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:label&gt;My Element:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
   &lt;xf:itemset nodeset=&quot;instance('code-tables')/code-table[code-table-name='MyElementCode']/items/item&quot;&gt;
       &lt;xf:label ref=&quot;label&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;xf:value ref=&quot;value&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/xf:itemset&gt;
&lt;/xf:select1&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the predicate [code-table-name='MyElementCode'] will only put the items for that code into the selection list.

== Auto Generation of Code Tables from Metadata Registry ==
Because XML Schema does not contain information for presentation we use the following workflow as a &quot;best practice&quot;.

# Store all label/value pairs in external code table files or get this information from a web service.
# For each form, create a web service that will generate a code-tables element for all the codes used in that form.
# Load the code-tables element into a separate  instance in your model with an id of &quot;code-tables&quot;.
# Select the code table out of that instance for each select1 or select element by getting a code table with that name.

== Discussion ==
When a group of complex forms that share common codes needs to be placed in their own directory and yet still link to a central directory of codes, you can also use relative code table linking.  For example a sibling directory could be called &quot;code-tables&quot; and the src=&quot;MyCode.xml&quot; statement could be modified to be src=&quot;../code-tables/MyCode.xml&quot;.

If you have an XML Schema for the form you can also extract a list of all enumerations for each simpleType.  This list of codes can then be passed to a web service that creates a list of all the codes in your registry.  This allows the form to automatically be updated when new codes are added to the XML Schema.

If you have a RESTful web service that contains all the codes for a form, you can replace this web service URI for the XML file.

__TOC__
== What is Free Direct Instruction Science 1 (Free DI Science 1) Image:25%.svg ==

Free DI Science 1 is the teacher's guide for teaching science at the second or third grade level depending on ability of learner and state standards.

Each section is numbered and can be taught in one day. Each section also contains scripted instructions for the teacher. Most sections contain workbook pages, images, and/and video clips.

Short video clips (5 to 20 seconds) can be added to integrate current events into the curriculum.  For instance, the idea of science is to  ask questions and get answers.  Could there be life on Mars?  To answer that we sent rockets and rovers to Mars to get pictures and samples of the surface.  You can show video clips, often free from NASA, a government agency, that shows rover taking samples.

Also, pictures can be added to enhance and describe scientific ideas, experiments, or events.

== What order do I teach this in? ==
Each state has different standards that include subject matter to be taught at specific times.  This makes teaching this science module more difficult. It might be a good idea to align your state standards to this curriculum and make some modifications.  Please make a note of your state standards and it's alignment to this program in the talk section (discussion tab).

==Physical Science==
===Understand structure and properties of matter.===
*Objects that sink and float
*Describe shapes of objects

===Chemical &amp; Physical Changes===
*Water in open container disappears, water in closed container doesn't
*Water in glass is shorter than same amount of water that is frozen

===Force===
*Difference between resting and moving objects
*Things fall to the ground unless they are held up

===Energy - interactions &amp; transformations===
*Sun is a source of energy and warms land, air, and water
*Without the sun, it would be very cold

==Life Sciences==
===Organisms: Understand the characteristics, structure, and functions of organisms.===
*Sort and classify collections by features (flies, swims, gills)
*Use senses to find out about the world around you and yourself (smell, touch, hear, see)
*Living things are people, animals &amp; plants
*All living things need water, food, and air

===Heredity: traits in living things===
*When animals have babies they are called offspring
*Many offspring have 2 parents
*People might keep animals from having offspring (dogs, cats)
*Sequence parts of a cycle

===Diversity/interdependence===
*Plants &amp; animals may look alike and do similar things but others are different
*Living things are everywhere but in different places
**Habitats of weeds, aquatic plants, insects, worms, and amphibians
**Ways in which animals &amp; plants depend on each other (i.e. animals depend on plants &amp; animals)

==Earth Science==
===Earth materials===
*Made of rock, soil, water, air
*Materials can be used again (recycled)
*Observe changes in weather (clouds, precipitation)

==Space Science==
===Earth in solar system &amp; universe - Earth, sun, moon, and solar system===
*Identify the sun &amp; moon during the day (have calendar with moon phases)
*Identify moon and stars seen at night (moon is either crescent or big)

==Scientific Inquiry==
===Ask questions and get answers based on observations - hypothesis===
*Raise questions about the world around the students
*Describe things in terms of their number, shape, size, and color
*Make observations

===Design investigation to answer question===
*Follow a list of steps

===Collect and present data===
*Describe or draw simple observations
*Record data on form
*Transfer from form to simple graphs
*Observe changes in world

==Concepts==
*May not work if parts are missing (batteries)
*Observe and describe changes
*Difference between statement &amp; question
*One person can have an effect on others
*Magifiers can help people see things that they couldn't otherwise

      <text xml:space="preserve">This cookbook identifies example programs that demonstrate best practices.  An XForms Best Practice is a specific way of solving a general problem that has been selected from among posible solutions by various authors.  There are a variety of reasons for best practices but in general best practices increase program modularity, maintainability and flexibility.

The following logo will appear next to sample programs that constitute a best practice:
[[Image:XForms-best-practice.jpg|50px]].

These should also be some reason in each example why this solution is usually preferred by developers over other solutions as well as give some indication of why this may not be appropriate in some situations.

Although a best practice is usually the preferred way of solving a given problem, it is not always the right choice for all circumstances.  For example developers frequently put a style sheet in an external file but if you are doing training and want the example to contain the CSS file, there are good reasons to put the CSS file directly in the html header.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A possible final test with explanatory notes==

This test was once used to monitor the broad learning of university chemists at the end of the 1st year and is intended to check, somewhat lightly, a range of skills in only 50 minutes. It contains a mixture of what are perceived to be both easy and difficult questions so as to give the marker a good idea of the student's algebra skills and even whether they can do the infamous ''integration by parts''.
----
(1) Solve the following equation for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2+2x-15 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

It factorises with 3 and 5 so : &lt;math&gt;(x+5)(x-3) = 0&lt;/math&gt; therefore the &lt;b&gt;roots&lt;/b&gt; are -5 and +3, not 5 and -3!
----
(2) Solve the following equation for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2x^2-6x -20 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Divide by 2 and get &lt;math&gt;x^2-3x -10 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

This factorises with 2 and 5 so : &lt;math&gt;(x-5)(x+2) = 0&lt;/math&gt; therefore the &lt;b&gt;roots&lt;/b&gt; are 5 and -2.
----
(3) Simplify

&lt;math&gt;\ln w^6 - 4\ln w&lt;/math&gt;

Firstly &lt;math&gt;6\ln w - 4\ln w &lt;/math&gt; so it becomes &lt;math&gt;2\ln w&lt;/math&gt;.

----
(4) What is

&lt;math&gt;\log_{2} \frac 1 { 64}&lt;/math&gt;

64 = 8 x 8 so it also equals &lt;math&gt;2^3 &lt;/math&gt;x&lt;math&gt; 2^3&lt;/math&gt; ''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 { 64}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the answer is -6.

----
(5) Multiply the two complex numbers

&lt;math&gt;3+5i  ~~~~ {\rm and} ~~~~ 3-5i&lt;/math&gt;

These are complex conjugates so they are &lt;math&gt;3^2&lt;/math&gt; minus &lt;math&gt;i^2 &lt;/math&gt;x&lt;math&gt; 5^2&lt;/math&gt; ''i.e.'' plus 25 so the total is 34.

----
(6) Multiply the two complex numbers

&lt;math&gt;(5,-2)  ~~~~ {\mathrm and}  ~~~~ (-5,-2)&lt;/math&gt;

The real part is -25 plus the &lt;math&gt;4i^2&lt;/math&gt;. The cross terms make &lt;math&gt;-10i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;+10i&lt;/math&gt; so the imaginary part disappears.

----
(7) Differentiate with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {3x^2}-3x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Answer: &lt;math&gt; ~~~~~~~- \frac 2 {3x^3}-6x&lt;/math&gt;

----
(8)   &lt;math&gt; \frac  6 {x^4} +3  x^3&lt;/math&gt;

Answer: &lt;math&gt; ~~~~~~~ 9  {x^2} - \frac  {24} {x^5} &lt;/math&gt;

----
(9)   &lt;math&gt; \frac{2}{\sqrt x} + 2 \sqrt x&lt;/math&gt;

Answer:
&lt;math&gt; ~~~~~~\frac 1 {\sqrt x} - \frac 1 {\sqrt {x^3}}&lt;/math&gt;

----
(10)   &lt;math&gt;x^3 (  x - ( 2x + 3 ) (2x - 3) )&lt;/math&gt;

Expand out the difference of 2 squares first.....collect and multiply....then just differentiate term by term giving: &lt;math&gt; ~~~~ 20x^4 -4x^3 + 27x^2&lt;/math&gt;

----
(11)   &lt;math&gt;3x^3  \cos 3x&lt;/math&gt;

This needs the product rule.... Factor out the &lt;math&gt;9x^2&lt;/math&gt; .... &lt;math&gt; 9x^2( \cos 3x - x \sin 3x)&lt;/math&gt;

----
(12)   &lt;math&gt;\ln ( 1 - x)^2&lt;/math&gt;

This could be  a chain rule problem.......
&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 { ( 1 - x)^2}  . 2 . (-1) . ( 1 - x )&lt;/math&gt;

or you could take the power 2 out of the log and go straight to the same answer with a shorter version of the chain rule to:&lt;math&gt;- \frac 2 {( 1 - x)}&lt;/math&gt;.

----
(13) Perform the following integrations:

&lt;math&gt;\int  \left( 2 \cos^2 \theta + 2 \theta \right) {\rm d}\theta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\cos^2&lt;/math&gt; must be converted to a double angle form as shown many times.... then all 3 bits are integrated giving .......

&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta \sin \theta +  \theta +  \theta^2&lt;/math&gt;
----
(14)   &lt;math&gt;\int \left( 8 x^{-3} - \frac 4 x + \frac 8 {x^3} \right) {\rm d}x&lt;/math&gt;

Apart from &lt;math&gt; - \frac 4 x &lt;/math&gt;, which goes to &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt;, this is straightforward polynomial integration. Also there is a nasty trap in that two terms can be telescoped to &lt;math&gt;\frac {16} { x^3}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;-(\frac 8 {x^2} + 4 \ln x)&lt;/math&gt;

----
(15) What is the equation corresponding to the determinant:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
b &amp; \frac 1 {\sqrt 2}  &amp; 0\\
\frac 1 {\sqrt 2}&amp; b &amp; 1\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; b\\
\end{vmatrix}
= 0&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is &lt;math&gt;b(b^2-1)&lt;/math&gt; the second &lt;math&gt;-\frac 1 {\sqrt 2} (\frac b {\sqrt 2} - 0 )&lt;/math&gt; and the 3rd term zero. This adds up to &lt;math&gt;b^3 -3 /2 b&lt;/math&gt;.

----
(16) What is the general solution of the following differential equation:

&lt;math&gt;\frac {{\rm d} \phi} { {\rm d} r} = \frac  {\rm A} r&lt;/math&gt;

where A is a constant..

&lt;math&gt;\theta = A \ln r + k&lt;/math&gt;.
----
(17) Integrate by parts: &lt;math&gt;\int x \sin x  {\rm d} x&lt;/math&gt;

Make &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; the factor to be differentiated and apply the formula, taking care with the signs... &lt;math&gt;\sin x - x \cos x&lt;/math&gt;.

----
(18)The Maclaurin series for which function begins with these terms?

&lt;math&gt;1 + x +  x^2/  2! + x^3 / 3! + x^4/  4! + \dots&lt;/math&gt;

It is &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt;....
----
(19)Express

&lt;math&gt;\frac {x-2} {(x-3)(x+4)}&lt;/math&gt;
as partial fractions.

It is ..... &lt;math&gt;~~~~~\frac 1 {7(x-3)} + \frac 6 {7(x+4)}&lt;/math&gt;

----
(20) What is &lt;math&gt;2e^{i4\phi} - \cos 4 \phi&lt;/math&gt; in terms of sin and cos             

This is just Euler's equation..... &lt;math&gt;2e^{i4\phi} = 2\cos 4 \phi - 2 i \sin 4 \phi&lt;/math&gt;

so one &lt;math&gt;\cos 4 \phi&lt;/math&gt; disappears to give ... &lt;math&gt;\cos 4 \phi - 2 i \sin 4 \phi&lt;/math&gt;.

=== 50 Minute Test II===
(1) Simplify &lt;math&gt;2\ln (1 / x^3) + 5\ln x&lt;/math&gt;
----
(2)What is &lt;math&gt;\log_{10} \frac 1 { 10~000}&lt;/math&gt;
----
(3) Solve the following equation for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t^2-3t-4 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
----
(4) Solve the following equation for &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;w^2+4w-12 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
----
(5) Multiply the two complex numbers
&lt;math&gt;(-4,3) ~~~~ {\rm and } ~~~~~ (-5,2)&lt;/math&gt;
----
(6) Multiply the two complex numbers
&lt;math&gt;3+2i ~~~~ {\rm and }  ~~~~~~ 3-2i&lt;/math&gt;
----
(7) The Maclaurin series for which function begins with these terms?

&lt;math&gt;x - x^3/  6 + x^5 / 120 + \dots&lt;/math&gt;
----
(8) Differentiate with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;x^3 ( 2 - 3x )^2&lt;/math&gt;
----
(9) &lt;math&gt;\frac {\sqrt x} 2 - \frac {\sqrt 3} {2 \sqrt x}&lt;/math&gt;
----
(10)&lt;math&gt;x^4-3x^2+{\rm k}&lt;/math&gt;

where k is a constant.
----
(11) &lt;math&gt;\frac 2 {3x^4}-{\rm A}x^4&lt;/math&gt;

where A is a constant.
----
(12)   &lt;math&gt;3x^3 e^{3x}&lt;/math&gt;
----
(13)   &lt;math&gt;\ln ( 2 - x)^3&lt;/math&gt;
----
(14) Perform the following integrations:

&lt;math&gt;\int \left( 3 w^4 - 2 w^2 + \frac 6 {5 w^2} \right) {\rm d}w&lt;/math&gt;
----
(15)   &lt;math&gt;\int  \left( 3 \cos \theta  + \theta \right) {\rm d}\theta&lt;/math&gt;
----
(16) What is the equation belonging to the determinant
\begin{vmatrix}
x &amp; 0  &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; x &amp; i \\
0 &amp; i &amp; x   \\
\end{vmatrix}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Meteorology_TOC|show=ch1|float=right}}

The defininitions of Meteorology can be confusing, mainly because people mess them up constantly and don't correct themselves. If you know these few definitions and can remember their differences, you can do anything you want with this subject, mainly because people will believe you more easily.

==Weather==
; Weather : The current state of the atmosphere at any time.
That's pretty easy to remember. But, it can also be confusing. Nothing limits the weather you talk about, so it can be the weather around you or your entire country. Perhaps half of the planet. Weather is what is happening now, or happened in the past, but only at one given moment.

==Meteorology==
; Meteorology : Simply stated: the study of weather and climate.
The technical term is the study of the atmosphere and its phenomena. This means that anything that happens with the weather: wind, rain, snow, sun, dew, frost, fog, etc. is open for study in Meteorology. When it is quite easy to become an expert in any one thing, it can be difficult to study weather and climate because everything is interconnected. If you want to study fog for example, you must know about condensation, dew point, vapor pressures, and atmospheric stability to say the least.

People often confuse meteorology with weather forecasting. They are not the same thing. According to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-logy|Wikipedia]], words ending in -logy are the study of something. Weather forecasters do not study the weather. They look at different sources of information and predict what it is going to do. Most of the time, now, computers predict it anyways, so they don't have to do much. Meteorology, in fact, is a science. It is the study of physics of the world. Forecasting is predicting which is not science and thusly, not meteorology.

==Climate==
; Climate : The description of a specific location by its weather history over a period of time.
Climate is the description of a location by its average weather history over time. No matter the length of time, climate is the average weather during that time. Of course, that can be temperature, rain fall, wind speed, dew points, etc. Climate ranges from being in depth and very descriptive to being as simple as the high and low temperatures for a given season of the year.

==Atmosphere==
; Atmosphere : Earth's gaseous envelope, extending upward from the surface. The top of the atmosphere is ill-defined, and often depends on the purpose, though strictly the boundary is that point at which Earth stops influencing the environment (be it the chemical environment or the electromagnetic environment depends on the application). 

For meteorology, the atmosphere can be defined as the air and its properties in which weather and atmospheric phenomena occur. The atmosphere is divided into layers that have different properties: the troposphere and stratosphere being the most relevant for meteorology. The atmosphere is thin compared to Earth's radius. The stratopause, where the stratosphere ends and the mesosphere begins, located at an altitude of about 50-55 km. The Earth's  diameter, for comparison, is 12,756.3 km (7,926.4 mi).

The diameter of a billiard ball is 5.715 cm. If the whole Earth were that size, how thick would the atmosphere be. Thin indeed!

Can somebody write how to spell each word?

--&lt;br&gt;
In the Verbs section it shows:&lt;br&gt;
To look (for) : Tražiti =&gt; Pogledati?&lt;br&gt;
To search : Tražiti (Never use To look for)&lt;br&gt;
I was born in the states and aparently I speak a dialect of Croatian since my folks are from Dalmatia.  I can't write the language (one of the reasons I want this book to succeed!).--[[User:Trahloc|Trahloc]] 19:32, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== Pronucation ==

There should be something about spelling. I mean, one word can have completely different meaning if it's pronounced wrong. For example, if you say &quot;kada&quot;, it will mean &quot;when&quot;, but when you say &quot;kada&quot; with an extended a (the first one) it will mean &quot;bathtub&quot;.</text>

==Wikibook Survey==
Hello Fellow Wikibookian:

Dr. Curt Bonk and I from Indiana University, Bloomington initiated a study related to Wikibooks in 2006. The result of our initial study reveals many interesting viewpoints that lead us to conduct a follow-up study related to the supports you have in the Wikibooks Website.  As the note below indicates, Erik Moller, the Deputy Director of Wikimedia Foundation, is aware of our research and has endorsed it. Here is his message to you.

Dear Wikibookian,

Dr. Curt Bonk and Suthiporn Sajjapanroj from Indiana University and their colleagues from the University of Houston are in the midst of an important study of Wikibookians.  They conducted a previous study of 80 Wikibookians in 2006 which will be published next month in the spring 2008 issue of the Journal of Interactive Online Learning (see http://www.ncolr.org/jiol/issues/).  In their follow-up study, they are researching issues of Wikibookian identity, communities of practice in Wikibooks, and the overall apprenticeship and support structures that exist in the Wikibooks Website.  Their current survey can be found at:

http://www.surveyshare.com/survey/take/?sid=64648

The Wikimedia Foundation supports efforts like this to understand and study our communities, and we invite you to participate in this survey.  We appreciate any help you can lend to Dr. Bonk and his research team.  Please note that this effort is separate from the Wikimedia Foundation cross-project survey that we will conduct in collaboration with UNU-Merit later this year.

Sincerely,
Erik Möller
Deputy Director, Wikimedia Foundation

The survey contains 50 questions and should take roughly 15-20 minutes to complete.  All respondents will receive a one year free Pro membership in SurveyShare which is sponsoring this research. In addition, at the end of the survey, you will be asked if you want to be considered to win one of two 160 gig video iPods (a $349 value). Since we expect about 120 respondents, your odds are about 1 in 60 of winning one of these iPods.

We would like to thank you for your participation in this follow-up study.  Once again, this new survey can be found at: http://www.surveyshare.com/survey/take/?sid=64648 (If you are unable to click on the link, just copy and paste it into your Web browser.)

All survey data will be collected anonymously on a secure server. Your survey responses will be kept confidential.  We hope that this research will help those developing wikibooks and related e-book communities around the world.  We promise to share the results.  Any questions or problems can be sent to me at ssajjapa@indiana.edu.

Sincerely,

Suthiporn Sajjapanroj, Ph.D. candidate, Indiana University</text>

The big blue wonder, filled with the air we breathe and pollution we create. As most everyone knows, we breathe in Oxygen. It's actually quite amazing that it is not the primary ingredient in the atmospheric mixture known as air, Nitrogen is instead. All kinds of gases make up the atmosphere, but a few stand out in our day to day lives, such as Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, and Ozone.

You hear about Carbon Dioxide polluting the atmosphere on the news, in papers, in books, your parents, friends or teachers, but it isn't all bad. Carbon Dioxide is one of the gases that helps to keep our planet and us warm and not freeze to death. Of course, there is a bad side.  Too much carbon dioxide will cause the earth to heat up and become too hot.

Ozone is a gas that most have heard of but don't know much about. Ozone, or O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is Oxygen that has grouped into a group with three Oxygen molecules reather than the normal two. It helps us keep out harmful Ultra-Violet rays that could possibly burn our skin, cause cancer, or even cause death. Of course, most have heard of the &quot;Ozone hole,&quot; but most don't realise that there is more than one hole and they are constantly growing. We will look into Ozone, the Ozone holes, and the problems it can cause later on.

==Layers==
Just from looking up, you wouldn't be able to tell that the atmosphere has layers. Indeed it does, just as a cake has layers of sometimes different flavours. These layers and the icing that holds them together are found almost exactly similarly in the atmosphere. Each of these layers provides a different purpose to our planet and weather. They will be discussed in depth more in the next section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
There are three core concepts that you will learn in building XForms applications:
# The model is a tree of data elements
# The presentation is a tree of data elements
# To build your form, these two trees need to be wired together - this is called &quot;binding&quot;

Many of the exercises in this cookbook give examples of this binding.  This process is a small example of how this can work.  In practice there are many ways to bind the user interface to the model.

== Screen Image ==

The screen image is similar to input programs from a prior example.  This example has two input fields for a person's first and last name and two output controls.

[[Image:Xforms-input.jpg|frame|center]]

== Sample Program ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot; 
   xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
   xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Your Title Here&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;xf:model&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;data&gt;
               &lt;PersonGivenName/&gt;
               &lt;PersonSurName/&gt;
            &lt;/data&gt;
         &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
         &lt;xf:bind id=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; nodeset=&quot;/data/PersonGivenName&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;xf:bind id=&quot;PersonSurName&quot; nodeset=&quot;/data/PersonSurName&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;xf:input bind=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; incremental=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xf:label&gt;Input First Name:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
       &lt;/xf:input&gt;
       &lt;br/&gt;
       &lt;xf:input bind=&quot;PersonSurName&quot; incremental=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xf:label&gt;Input Last Name:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
       &lt;/xf:input&gt;
       &lt;br/&gt;
       &lt;xf:output bind=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xf:label&gt;Output First Name:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
       &lt;/xf:output&gt;
       &lt;br/&gt;
       &lt;xf:output bind=&quot;PersonSurName&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xf:label&gt;Output Last Name:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
       &lt;/xf:output&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
Here are the two lines in the model that bind the data element paths to identifiers:
&lt;code&gt;
   &lt;xf:bind id=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; nodeset=&quot;/data/PersonGivenName&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;xf:bind id=&quot;PersonSurName&quot; nodeset=&quot;/data/PersonSurName&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Note that bind uses nodeset, not ref to specify the path name to the leaf element in the instance document.

After this is done, each user interface element that inputs or outputs the data elements just adds the bind attribute:
&lt;code&gt;
  &lt;xf:input &lt;b&gt;bind=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

We should also note that in this case there is a single input and a single output for each data element.  This does not need to be the case.  A single input can be bound to many outputs and an output could also depend on many inputs.  An example of this would be using the &quot;calculate&quot; attribute of the bind statement.

== Bind attributes ==
Here are the following attributes of the bind element and a short description of how they are used:

'''type''' 	

* Associate an instance variable with a specific XML Schema data type
* Extend or restrict schema type definitions

'''relevant''' 	

* Enabling or disable controls based on the values of data elements in the model

'''required'''

* Conditionally make fields required based on the values of data elements in the model

'''readonly''' 	

* Disable editing of fields based on model data elements such as role

'''constraint''' 	

* Create complex schema constraints between two or more data elements
* Set the limits of minimum or maximum values of a node-set

'''calculate''' 	

* Creating computational dependency among data elements
* Compute the value of new data elements based on other data elements
* Enable spread-sheet like calculations within XForms

== Overview ==

'''''The Marauders''''' were four Hogwarts students in the same year, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]]. Like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]], they excelled at getting into trouble and causing mayhem of the less harmful variety.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

This book reveals the group's existence, although two members are already known separately. It was the Marauders who created the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] that was given to Harry by Fred and George Weasley. Three members are reunited in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|the Shrieking Shack]] when Lupin and Black combine forces to unmask Pettigrew.

Black and Lupin explain the reason behind the group's nicknames. After discovering that Lupin was a werewolf, the remaining three secretly became [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagi]] to support their friend during his transformations. They adopted the nicknames Moony (Remus Lupin), Wormtail (Peter Pettigrew), Padfoot (Sirius Black), and Prongs (James Potter); the nicknames were derived from their altered shapes: a werewolf, a rat, a black dog, and a stag, respectively.

James Potter, of course, is dead at this point; however, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] is called upon to produce a Patronus, it assumes the same shape as James' Animagus form. This prompts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] to comment, &quot;Make no mistake: Prongs rode again last night.&quot;

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Although two individual members appear in this book, as a group they do not play any role in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

In Snape's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], Harry sees a Marauders episode, one where his father acts rather cruelly towards [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]. This disturbs Harry, damaging his opinion about his father and causing him to take risky measures to communicate with Sirius and Lupin about it.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Although the two remaining Marauders (Lupin and Pettigrew) appear in this book, they are on opposite sides of the battle lines and do not interact.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Although the two remaining marauders are present in this book, they do not interact. We see Pettigrew in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]] twice, the second time resulting in his death; and Lupin appears at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] several times, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] once, and finally falls in the battle at Hogwarts.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

The Marauders seem to consider themselves somewhat a group apart. The one time we see them directly, they are largely discussing a test just past between themselves. When they do interact with others outside the group, it is primarily playing pranks on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], though they do also speak briefly with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]] on that occasion.&lt;!-- Note to editors: the relationship area needs to be for the group as a whole. Individual members of the group have their own pages. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">It began on a frigid Sunday evening, in a land filled with filthy bandits and filthier dictators. However, this particular outcrop of civilization (in a rather blunt sense of the word) harbored a lively farming family, who joyously lived with their two children. Although they were a very simple family, they were able to sufficiently keep up a good living with their enormous mass of land which sat quietly on the gorgeous countryside. Even better yet were the evenings, when the glowing pale moon shone brightly over the diminutive oak and pine trees gathered dejectedly across the plain, illuminating clearings like a search light. This fact, after all, was what gave the country the nickname of Moonlit Arena, and gathered people to vast, grassy clearings for the sole purpose of viewing the aforementioned moon over their heads, smiling upon them as if it was a face floating high into the sky, watching over them intently.

Marc, the first of the two brothers, was just leaving to gather crops from the acre of land behind the house. He was waiting for his brother to finally come out, but after 15 minutes he decided to approach it differently. “Ed!” He called loudly, tapping his foot in impatience. “Get out here, kid! We don’t have all day!”

“I’m coming, Marc! Just let me get the Guide, okay?” Ed called in reply, rushing upstairs to open a box which contained a small, leather-bound book. He put it in his pocket and went back downstairs to where Marc was waiting for him.

They walked out to the cornstalks and apple trees, and began picking out food. Ed found an apple hidden in the grass and ate it while they finished gathering. Dusk was coming quickly, so the boys took all of their findings and wheel-barrowed them inside. Unbeknownst to the brothers, a dark figure was constantly swooping around them ominously.

They arrived at the house about the same time as their parents did. When they went in, their parents were cleaning up a mess that apparently occurred when a bandit or two ransacked the living room. This wasn’t uncommon in the country, but where they lived it was still rather remote for robberies like these. Everything was in utter disorder. While Ed panicked, though, Marc helped his parents check what was missing from the room.

After a moderately extensive search, Ed’s mother approached him. “Nothing of real importance, dear. You can go to your room now,” she said gently. She then went back to the couch and had a nap.

Ed calmed himself slowly, and clamored up to his room while Marc unpacked the food in the kitchen.

Ed stuck to his room for the remainder of the day, and opened the book that was still in his pocket. He began flipping through it solemnly, like he did every day when he was tired. ''The guide’ll definitely comfort me. It always does, it always will,'' he thought subconsciously. ''I know it will.''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">='''Solutions'''=

=='''Solutions and Mixtures'''==

[[Image:SaltInWaterSolutionLiquid.jpg|thumb|250px|Forming a solution of table salt in water. When completely dissolved, the salt crystals can no longer be seen, but the water will taste salty.]]

Before we dive into solutions, let's separate solutions from other types of mixtures. Solutions are groups of molecules that are mixed up in a completely even distribution. Not the easiest way to say it. Scientists say that solutions are homogenous systems. Other types of mixtures can have a little higher concentration on one side of the liquid when compared to the other side. Solutions have an even concentration throughout the system. An example: Sugar in water vs. Sand in water. Sugar dissolves and is spread throughout the glass of water. The sand sinks to the bottom. The sugar-water could be considered a solution. The sand-water is a mixture. No matter how hard you stir, the sand will not disappear into the water the way the sugar will.

=='''Can Anything Be In Solution?'''==

Pretty much. Solutions can be solids dissolved in liquids.  They could also be gases dissolved in liquids (such as carbonated water).  There can also be gases in other gases and liquids in liquids.  If you mix things up and they stay at an even distribution, it is a solution.  You probably won't find people making solid-solid solutions in front of you.  They start off as solid/gas/liquid-liquid solutions and then harden at room temperature.  Alloys with all types of metals are good examples of a solid solution at room temperature.  A simple solution is basically two substances that are combined, called the ''solute'' and the ''solvent''.  The solute is the substance to be dissolved (sugar).  The solvent is the one doing the dissolving (water).  As a rule of thumb, there is usually more solvent than solute.

=='''Making Solutions'''==

So what happens?  How do you make that solution?  Mix the two substances and stir.  It's that simple.  Science breaks it into three steps.  When you read the steps, remember... Solute=Sugar, Solvent=Water, System=Glass.

1. The solute is placed in the solvent and the concentrated solute slowly breaks into pieces. 

2. The molecules of the solvent begin to move out of the way and they make room for the molecules of the solute.  Example: The water has to make room for the sugar molecules. 

3. The solute and solvent interact with each other until the concentration of the two substances is equal throughout the system.  The concentration of sugar in the water would be the same from a sample at the top, bottom, or middle of the glass.

=='''Can Anything Change Solutions?'''==

Sure. All sorts of things can change the concentrations of substances in solution. Scientists use the word solubility. Solubility is the ability of the solvent (water) to dissolve the solute (sugar). You may have already seen the effect of temperature in your classes. Usually when you heat up a solvent, it can dissolve more solid materials (sugar) and less gas (carbon dioxide). Next on the list of factors is pressure. When you increase the surrounding pressure, you can usually dissolve more gases in the liquid. Think about your soda can. They are able to keep the fizz inside because the contents of the can are under higher pressure. Last is the structure of the substances. Some things dissolve easier in one kind of substance than another. Sugar dissolves easily in water; oil does not. Water has a low solubility when it comes to oil.

Chlorine as an element is a pale green, poisonous gas with a suffocating odor. Chlorine as a chemical cleaner (in a solution with water) is a liquid, which is colorless with little odor, and a distinctly chemical taste.

==How was it discovered?==
Chlorine was discovered in 1774 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele.

==Where did its name come from?==
Chlorine gets its name from the Greek word ''chloros'', which means &quot;pale green&quot;.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* Chloride, the ionic form of Chlorine, is the most abundant dissolved substance in seawater.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
In nature, chlorine is mostly found as chloride, the ionic form of chlorine. Chloride is very common in seawater as part of sodium chloride, the scientific name for salt. In a laboratory, chlorine gas can be generated by the rapid combination of a strong base and a strong acid, or by running electricity through a solution of table salt (which is NaCl, the most common salt in seawater and the best-known, and probably the most common, chlorine compound n the world.)

[[Image:Child_in_swimming_pool.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Chlorine is used in swimming pools to kill bacteria.]]

==What are its uses?==
Chlorine is commonly used to purify water so it is clean enough to bath in. Almost all public pools use chlorine as a cleaning chemical for water. Chlorinated water can be toxic at high concentrations. Chlorine as a gas is incredibly dangerous, and has been used as a chemical weapon. Chlorine is also used in bleaches.

==Is it dangerous?==
Yes, when chlorine is concentrated in a gaseous form, it is extremely toxic to humans, killing within minutes of exposure. The gas burns lungs when it is inhaled, and victims of inhalation most often die of a combination of axphyxiation and internal bleeding from damage to the airways.

==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
[[Image:Contaminación_del_agua_cobre.jpg‎ |thumb|left|200px| A small stream and lake with copper dissolved in it]]
Copper is a reddish-orange metal, one of only two metals (the other being gold) which has a color other than silver or gray.

==How was it discovered?==
As early as 10,000 years ago, people found small deposits of native (pure) copper metal in the ground. This copper was then hammered and used to make weapons, tools and decorations. In Northern Iraq, a copper pendant was found that can be dated back to about 8700 B.C.

==Where did its name come from?==
Copper gets its name from the Latin word ''Cuprum'', meaning from the island of Cyprus.  In the Ancient Roman world (whose common language was Latin), most copper was mined in Cyprus.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* Copper used to be the symbol for the Roman goddess Venus, to whom the island of Cyprus was sacred.
* The Statue of Liberty contains 179,200 pounds (81.3 tonnes) of copper.
* When a form of copper dissolves in water, the water turns blue.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==

Copper can be found underground in the form of copper ore.  The main copper ore producing countries are Chile, United States, Indonesia, Australia, Peru, Russia, Canada, China, Poland, Kazakhstan, Zambia, Zaire, and Mexico.  Copper is usually obtained from the ores cuprite (CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), tenorite (CuO), malachite (CuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;*Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), chalcocite (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), covellite (CuS), and bornite (Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;FeS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

==What are its uses?==
[[Image:Pennies.jpg|thumb|left|In many countries, such as the United States and Canada, pennies are made at least partly from copper.]]
As copper is a great conductor of electricity it is used to make wires that carry electricity into homes, schools and businesses. In addition, copper is used to make locks, pipes, doorknobs, pots, bronze and jewelry. Most coins also contain copper, not just pennies (in fact pennies are now mostly zinc due to rising copper prices, but other coins are mostly still copper.)

==Is it dangerous?==
A little copper is necessary for many living things. However, copper in higher levels can be toxic.

==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
Fluorine is usually a pale, yellowish brown gas.  It has a pungent odor.

==How was it discovered?==
[[Image:Henri Moissan.jpg|thumb|left|Henri Moissan]]
Henri Moissan isolated pure fluorine in 1886.  Many other scientists had unsuccessfully tried to isolate fluorine from hydrogen fluoride.  In some cases they accidentally killed themselves by exposure to dangerous compounds.  Moissan's successful method relied on electrolysis &amp;mdash; using an electric voltage to convert fluoride ions to fluorine gas.  He won the Nobel Prize in 1906 and died the next year at the age of 54.

==Where did its name come from?==
Fluorine gets its name from the Latin word ''fluere'', which means &quot;to flow&quot;. Fluorspar ores were used as fluxes, which help ores to flow during smelting. Fluorine was later found to be a present in fluorspar.

'''Did You Know?'''
* Fluorine is the most reactive element.
* Fluorine is the 13th most abundant element in the earth's crust.
* Fluorspar ores can look either like emeralds or amethyst. Fluorine's atomic number is 9
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Fluorine is so reactive that it is not found in its elemental state.  It is always found bonded to a different element.  Some common minerals from which fluorine can be extracted include fluoroapatite, cryolite, and hornblende.  There are currently no working mines in the US that produce fluoride ores.  The last one closed in 1995, so fluorine is imported into the US.

==What are its uses?==

Fluorine is not used much in the elemental form because it is so reactive. One use is in rocket fuel, where elemental fluorine is used in place of oxygen to help fuels burn.

Fluoride, the ionic form of Fluorine, is put in toothpaste and sometimes in water to help prevent cavities in the teeth.

[[Image:PTFE-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|3D model of Teflon]]

Teflon, the non stick material found in frying pans, is a polymer that is 75% fluorine by weight. The scientific name for Teflon is polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE.  This is a chain of carbon atoms with two fluorine atoms attached to each carbon atom.

Fluorine is used in hydrofluoric acid in industry.  The acid is able to dissolve silicate-containing compounds such as glass and computer chips.  Because of this it cannot be stored for a long time in glass containers.  The acid is used for cleaning, purification, and etching.

Fluorine can react with uranium to produce uranium hexafluoride. This compound is then centrifuged to separate out the different isotopes of uranium. This is how enriched uranium is obtained.

A major use of fluorine was in the production of CFCs, the chemicals that lead to the ozone hole.  These were once common in aerosols and cooling fluids, but have been banned in developed countries in accordance with the Montreal Protocol.

==Is it dangerous?==
[[Image:toxic.png|thumb|right|Fluorine and some of its compounds are highly toxic]]

Fluorine gas is extremely poisonous. It can cause chemical burns on the skin. Hydrofluoric acid is very dangerous. It causes burns to the skin like sulfuric acid and other acids do, and is also easily absorbed into the skin. Once inside the body it causes damage to tissues and organs. Exposure of less than 2% of the body to concentrated hydrofluoric acid can be fatal. The small levels of fluoride ions in toothpaste and treated water are not dangerous, although slightly higher levels can cause unsightly (and permanent) mottling of the teeth.

To us, a string such as &quot;&lt;code&gt;Hello world&lt;/code&gt;&quot; looks like a series of letters with a space in the middle. To your computer, however, every String &amp;ndash; in fact, everything &amp;ndash; is a series of numbers.

== ASCII ==

In our example, each [[w:character (computing)|character]] of the String &quot;&lt;code&gt;Hello world&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is represented by a number between 0 and 127. For example, to the computer, the capital letter &quot;&lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is encoded as the number 72, whereas the space is encoded as the number 32. The [[w:ASCII|ASCII]] standard, originally developed for sending [[w:telegraphy|telegraphs]], specifies what number is used to represent each character.

On most Unix-like operating systems, you can view the entire chart of ASCII codes by typing &quot;&lt;code&gt;man ascii&lt;/code&gt;&quot; at the shell prompt. [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia's]] page on [[w:ASCII|ASCII]] also lists the ASCII codes. Using an ASCII chart, we discover that our string &quot;&lt;code&gt;Hello world&lt;/code&gt;&quot; gets converted into the following series of ASCII codes.

 H  e   l   l   o   space  w   o   r   l   d
 72 101 108 108 111 32     119 111 114 108 100

You can also determine the ASCII code of a character by using the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; operator in Ruby.

 puts ?H 
 puts ?e
 puts ?l
 puts ?l
 puts ?o

The question-mark syntax [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1270209/getting-an-ascii-character-code-in-ruby-fails no longer works in Ruby 1.9].  Instead, use the '''ord''' method.

 puts &quot;H&quot;.ord
 puts &quot;e&quot;.ord
 puts &quot;l&quot;.ord
 puts &quot;l&quot;.ord
 puts &quot;o&quot;.ord

Notice that the output (below) of this program matches the ASCII codes for the &quot;&lt;code&gt;Hello&lt;/code&gt;&quot; part of &quot;&lt;code&gt;Hello world&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

 $ '''hello-ascii.rb'''
 72
 101
 108
 108
 111

To get the ASCII value for a space, we need to use its [[../Strings#Escape sequences|escape sequence]]. In fact, we can use any escape sequence with the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; operator.

 puts ?\s
 puts ?\t
 puts ?\b
 puts ?\a

The result:
 32
 9
 8
 7

== Terminal emulators ==

You may not realize it, but so far, you've been running your Ruby programs inside of a program called a terminal emulator &amp;ndash; such as the  [[w:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]] [[w:Win32 console|console]], the [[w:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]] [[w:Terminal (application)|Terminal]] application, a [[w:telnet|telnet]] client, [[w:rxvt|rxvt]], or  [[w:X Window System|X Window System]] programs such as [[w:xterm|xterm]].

When your Ruby program prints out the letter &quot;&lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, it sends the ASCII code for &quot;&lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (72) to the terminal emulator, which then draws an &quot;&lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. When your Ruby program prints out a [[w:bell character|bell character]], it sends a different ASCII code &amp;ndash; ASCII code 7 &amp;ndash; to the terminal emulator. In this case, the terminal emulator does not draw a symbol, but instead will typically [[w:beep (sound)|beep]] or flash briefly. How each of the codes gets interpreted is largely determined by the ASCII standard.

== Other character encodings ==

The ASCII standard is a type of [[w:character encoding|character encoding]]. As mentioned above, ASCII only uses numbers 0 through 127 to define characters. There's a lot more characters than that in the world. Other character encoding systems &amp;ndash; such as [[w:Latin-1|Latin-1]], [[w:Shift_JIS|Shift_JIS]], and the [[w:Unicode|Unicode Transformation Format (UTF)]] &amp;ndash; have been created to represent a wider variety of characters, including those found in languages such as [[w:Arabic language|Arabic]], [[w:Hebrew|Hebrew]], [[w:Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[w:Japanese language|Japanese]].

==1. What ingredients are used to make soap? ==
Ingredients used to make soap are oil, alkali, glycerin, perfumes, dyes

==2. What is the difference between soap and detergent? ==

* A [[W:soap|soap]] is a natural fatty substance (called fatty acids) which has been reacted with lye (sodium hydroxide).
* A [[W:detergent|detergent]] is any type of cleaner which does not contain a soap as its main ingredient.

==3. What causes the cleansing action of soap? ==
Soap is an  excellent cleanser because of its ability to act as an emulsifier.

==4. Write or tell a story about the history and origin of soap.==

A soap like material found in clay cylinders during the excavation of ancient Babylon is evident that soap making was known as early as 2800B.C.  Soap got it name according to an ancient Roman legend, from Mount Sapo where animals were sacrificed.

* '''Early History'''
: The earliest known use of a natural soap-like substance was the powder of the Reeta (Sapindus) nut, which was used by Indians since antiquity. Hindus in India were obliged to bathe at least once a day, every morning, in accordance with Ayurveda. Evidence of manufactured soap use are Babylonian clay cylinders dating from 2800 BC containing a soap-like substance. A formula for soap consisting of water, alkali and cassia oil was written on a Babylonian clay tablet around 2200 BC.

: The Ebers papyrus (Egypt, 1550 BC) indicates that ancient Egyptians bathed regularly and combined animal and vegetable oils with alkaline salts to create a soap-like substance. Egyptian documents mention that a soap-like substance was used in the preparation of wool for weaving.

* '''Roman History'''
: It had been reported that a factory producing soap-like substances was found in the ruins of Pompeii (79 AD). However, this has proven to be a misinterpretation of the survival of some soapy mineral substance, probably soapstone at the Fullonica where it was used for dressing recently cleansed textiles. Unfortunately this error has been repeated widely and can be found in otherwise reputable texts on soap history. The ancient Romans were generally ignorant of soap's detergent properties, and made use of the strigil to scrape dirt and sweat from the body. The word &quot;soap&quot; (Latin sapo) appears first in a European language in Pliny the Elder's Historia Naturalis, which discusses the manufacture of soap from tallow and ashes, but the only use he mentions for it is as a pomade for hair; he mentions rather disapprovingly that among the Gauls and Germans men are likelier to use it than women.

: A story encountered in some places claims that soap takes its name from a supposed &quot;Mount Sapo&quot; where ancient Romans sacrificed animals. Rain would send a mix of animal tallow and wood ash down the mountain and into the clay soil on the banks of the Tiber. Eventually, women noticed that it was easier to clean clothes with this &quot;soap&quot;. The location of Mount Sapo is unknown, as is the source of the &quot;ancient Roman legend&quot; to which this tale is typically credited. In fact, the Latin word sapo simply means &quot;soap&quot;; it was borrowed from a Celtic or Germanic language, and is cognate with Latin sebum, &quot;tallow&quot;, which appears in Pliny the Elder's account. Roman animal sacrifices usually burned only the bones and inedible entrails of the sacrificed animals; edible meat and fat from the sacrifices were taken by the humans rather than the gods. Animal sacrifices in the ancient world would not have included enough fat to make much soap. The legend about Mount Sapo is probably apocryphal.

* '''Muslim History'''
: True soaps made from vegetable oils (such as olive oil), aromatic oils (such as thyme oil) and Lye (al-Soda al-Kawia) were first produced by Muslim chemists in the medieval Islamic world. The formula for soap used since then hasn't changed. From the beginning of the 7th century, soap was produced in Nablus (West Bank, Palestine), Kufa (Iraq) and Basra (Iraq). Soaps, as we know them today, are descendants of historical Arabian Soaps. Arabian Soap was perfumed and colored, some of the soaps were liquid and others were hard. They also had special soap for shaving. It was sold for 3 Dirhams (0.3 Dinars) a piece in 981 AD. The Persian chemist Al-Razi wrote a manuscript on recipes for true soap. A recently discovered manuscript from the 13th century details more recipes for soap making; e.g. take some sesame oil, a sprinkle of potash, alkali and some lime, mix them all together and boil. When cooked, they are poured into molds and left to set, leaving hard soap.

: In semi-modern times soap was made by mixing animal fats with lye. Because of the caustic lye, this was a dangerous procedure (perhaps more dangerous than any present-day home activities) which could result in serious chemical burns or even blindness. Before commercially-produced lye (sodium hydroxide) was commonplace, potash, potassium hydroxide, was produced at home for soap making from the ashes of a hardwood fire.

==5. Name seven forms of soap.==
Seven forms of soap are medical soap, shaving soap, liquid soap, technical soap, toilet soap, complexion soap, and hand soap.

==6. What is scum?==
Scum is the substance which results from the reaction of the hardness mineral in water with common household soaps.  Evident as a bath tub ring or on shower doors.

==7. Carve an object from a bar of soap.==
Here are some pathfinder soap carvings for examples.
&lt;gallery widths=250px perrow=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
Image:Soap carved cat.jpg
Image:Soap carved tulip.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;
You can buy multipacks of soap at reasonable prices at large &quot;warehouse&quot; type stores such as Costco or Sam's Club, or at large retailers such as Target or Walmart.  Ivory soap works pretty well for this, though you may wish to check that none of your Pathfinders are allergic to it before you buy it.

Start by tracing the design onto the bar of soap, etching the lines lightly into the soap with a pointed stick or the tip of a knife.  Instruct your Pathfinders on knife safety before handing out the knives:
# Do not draw the knife towards yourself - cut away from your body.
# Pick up a knife by its handle
# Be aware that folding knives can close when under pressure.
# Offer a knife's ''handle'' to another person when handing it to another person.

Once the design is etched into the soap, begin removing the soap that does not belong there.  Do not remove huge chunks all at once or the soap may break.  You can also use the knife to drill holes in the soap.

==8. Decorate a bar of soap for a gift.==
Soap can be decorated by attaching ribbons with pins.  You can also use pins to attach photos (crop them first), pictures cut from magazines, buttons, doilies, etc.  Be creative!  Pay attention to the colors of the materials you attach to the soap compared to the color of the soap itself.  Soap need not be carved before decorating, but it may help to cut any lettering (such as the brand's logo) off before attaching pictures.

''If you have pictures to contribute, we'd love to add them to this chapter.  Just click the &quot;talk&quot; link at the top of the page!''

==9. Make a scene out of whipped soap, using at least three colors.==  
Reuse the shavings left over from carving or use soap flakes.  Add a little water and whip in a mixing bowl using either a whisk or an electric beater.  When you have plenty of soap whipped up, spoon it into bowls and add food coloring (a different color for each bowl).  Mix the coloring in until it is even.

Once you have all the colors you need, paint it onto a &quot;canvas&quot; with a regular artist's paintbrush.  The canvas can be as simple as a paper plate or piece of construction paper.

''If you have pictures to contribute, we'd love to add them.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TopNav|cat|prev=Getting Started|next=Pattern Matching}}

The basic unit of expressing a value in Erlang is the '''term'''. Terms are comprised of one of Erlang's simple or complex types.

==Integers==

Integer constants are written as numbers, optionally prefixed with a base and the octothorpe (&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;):

&lt;pre&gt;
 1&gt; 2.
 2
 2&gt; 16#ff.
 255
 3&gt; 2#1011.
 11
&lt;/pre&gt;

Erlang uses arbitrary-precision integers, which support integers with any number of digits.

Erlang also provides another syntactic shortcut: you can write an integer as the dollar sign (&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;) and a character, and the value is the ASCII value of that character. This is of use when handling strings, as strings are typically represented in Erlang as lists of integers (see [[#Strings|Strings]], below).

==Floats==

Floats (floating-point numbers) are written as numbers with decimal places, optionally with an exponent separated from the number with the letter &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;
 4&gt; 1.2.
 1.20000
 5&gt; 1.0.
 1.00000
 6&gt; 2.0e-4.
 2.00000e-4
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Atoms==

Atoms are named constants. Atoms begin with a lower-case letter and can contain letters, digits and the underscore character (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;); or they are quoted with single quotes (&lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;).

&lt;pre&gt;
 1&gt; ok.
 ok
 2&gt; 'OKAY'.
 'OKAY'
 3&gt; this_is_an_atom.
 this_is_an_atom
&lt;/pre&gt;

The special atoms '''true''' and '''false''' represent boolean values.

Atoms are often used as the keys in key-value pairs, indicators of success and failure (e.g. '''ok''' and '''error''') and to identify parts of a complicated structure for [[Erlang Programming/Pattern Matching|Pattern Matching]].

==Tuples==

Tuples are terms composed of multiple values, and are of fixed length. Tuples are surrounded by braces (&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;) and the elements of the tuple (any Erlang term, including tuples) separated by commas.

&lt;pre&gt;
 1&gt; {ok, 9}.
 {ok,9}
 2&gt; {true, {127, 0, 0, 1}}.
 {true,{127,0,0,1}}
 3&gt; {box, {width, 10}, {height, 35}}.
 {box, {width, 10}, {height, 35}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The 3rd example shows something called a tagged tuple. Where possible use tagged tuples as
they make it clear what the tuple is supposed to represent. Later on we will look at records
which is just a shorthand for tagged tuples.

==Lists==

Lists are terms composed of multiple values, of varying length. Lists are surrounded by brackets (&lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;) and each member of the list (any Erlang term, including lists) separated with commas.

Lists can also be composed of a head and tail portion, separated by the vertical bar character (&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;): &lt;code&gt;[Head|Tail]&lt;/code&gt;. The Tail can be any valid Erlang term, but is usually ''a list representing the members of the list after the head''.

&lt;pre&gt;
 1&gt; [one, two, three].
 [one,two,three]
 2&gt; [1, 2|[3, 4, 5]].
 [1,2,3,4,5]
 3&gt; [{key1, value1}, {key2, value2}].
 [{key1,value1},{key2,value2}]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Lists in which the smallest possible tail is the empty list (&lt;tt&gt;[]&lt;/tt&gt;) are known as ''well-formed'' lists.

===Strings===

Erlang has no separate string type. Strings are usually represented by lists of integers (and the '''string''' module of the standard library manipulates such lists). Each integer represents the ASCII (or other character set encoding) value of the character in the string. For convenience, a string of characters enclosed in double quotes (&lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) is equivalent to a list of the numerical values of those characters.

&lt;pre&gt;
 1&gt; &quot;one&quot;.
 &quot;one&quot;
 2&gt; [$o, $n, $e].
 &quot;one&quot;
 3&gt; $o.
 111
 4&gt; $n.
 110
 5&gt; $e.
 101
 6&gt; [111, 110, 101].
 &quot;one&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The Erlang shell &quot;guesses&quot; whether a given list is a printable string and prints it that way for convenience.

==Pids==

A Pid or process id is a special type in Erlang. To see what one looks like you can get the pid of yourself with self().

 1&gt; self().
   &lt;0.29.0&gt;

==Refs==

A ref (or reference) is a term which is unique, even across Erlang nodes. You can create a new ref by calling erlang:make_ref(). A reference is only used as a unique tag or identifier. An Erlang reference should not be confused with a reference in C/C++.

 2&gt; erlang:make_ref().
 #Ref&lt;0.0.0.41&gt;

==Other types==

Erlang has other types, such as funs (closures), bit-strings,  binaries (continuous blocks of arbitrary data) and ports (port identifiers), that will be covered in their appropriate sections.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the section &quot;Series recording does not work right...&quot;, the phrase &quot;let it record shows you don't want&quot; needs clarification. Something like &quot;set the XXX to YYY&quot; -- I can probably figure out what it means but I'm still left wondering if I'm guessing correctly.  &quot;Let&quot; and &quot;want&quot; are not appropriate here.  Perhaps even changing the word &quot;shows&quot; to &quot;episodes&quot; would make this a lot more clear and match the terminology used. In which case it really should say &quot;set it to record all episodes&quot;. At least, this is what I assume it is supposed to mean. -- [[User:Abfackeln|Abfackeln]] 06:53, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

Any update on this problem? I have 2 of the 4616 DVR's, and they BOTH have this series recording problem. I have tried all of the settings described above, and I still can't get all the episodes to record. The closest thing to 'perfect' is to set the episode type to 'New Episodes' only and then set the channel to 'All Channels'. This is close, but not perfect.
Very frustrating!!!

== Overview ==

'''''Wizarding money''''' comes in three denominations: bronze Knuts, silver Sickles, and golden Galleons. 29 Knuts make up one Sickle, and there are 17 Sickles in a Galleon.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Wizarding money comes in coins only, there are no Galleon bills; as such, wizards have money pouches that they typically hang off their belts, under their robes, rather than wallets. It is believed that the odd numbers of Knuts in a Sickle, and Sickles in a Galleon, is intended as a comment on British money before decimalization, with pounds, shillings, and pence being in an odd ratio to each other.

== Analysis ==

There are a number of different calculations about the value of the individual pieces of Wizard currency. The author has stated that a Galleon is worth about £3, and also that it is worth about £5, in two separate books, and again that it is worth about £5 in an interview; and internal evidence in the fourth and later books seems to match this. However, internal evidence in the first three books could suggest a value closer to £50 to £200 for the value of a Galleon.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] instructs [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] to pay the owl 5 knuts for his copy of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']]. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 14|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] pays an owl 1 Knut for the ''Prophet''. If the price of the ''Prophet'' is in line with Muggle newspapers, that means that 1 Knut should be about US $0.20 to US$1.00 (the price of a newspaper being about US$1.00 in 1991). This makes a Sickle worth somewhere between $6.00 and $30.00, and gives a Galleon a value of between $100 (£50) and $500 (£200).

It is also mentioned, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']] that Harry paid seven Galleons for his wand; and that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] was using his brother's old wand, with the implication that they could not afford a new one. An expenditure of £35 (at £5 to the Galleon) is relatively small, but in retrospect does serve to indicate Ron's family's grinding poverty, which we also see in later books. Some have said that it would make more sense to have a wand, which is after all usually a once-in-a-lifetime purchase, be valued at £350 to £1400, and this would make it more likely that Ron's family could ill-afford to buy a new wand for Ron, instead giving him &quot;Charlie's old wand&quot;; however, this is not necessary to the story, and makes the Weasleys' lack of funds all the more striking. 

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 21|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] are selling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Canary Cream|Canary Cream]] tricks for 7 Sickles each. Based on the above calculation, that would make the price of these $42 to $210 each. This is rather an excessive amount for a 15-second prank; if a Galleon is worth £5, though, then 7 Sickles would be about £2 ($5), a reasonable value for that joke. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 16|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], the price of a Butterbeer in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] is given as two Sickles, which would be $12 to $60 a bottle by the pricing scheme in the first three books; at £5 to the Galleon, though, 2 Sickles would be about £0.60 ($1.20), a reasonable price.

It is possible that the author simply had not worked out the conversion from Wizarding to Muggle money until time came to write the forewords of ''Quidditch Through the Ages'' and ''Magical Beasts and Where to Find Them'', which came out after the first three books were written. It is also possible that the author, in writing those forewords, confused the values of the Sickle and the Galleon, as the apparent value of the Sickle in the first three books does tally with the stated value of the Galleon. It's certainly true that Wizarding prices in the fourth and later books of the series match the values given in those two books and the interview, with the exception of the price for ''The Daily Prophet''. One wonders if, having arbitrarily set the price of the Prophet as 5 Knuts in the first book, the author was at all concerned that this gave it a street value of £0.05 ($0.10). On the other hand, the use of magic will significantly distort the economy from what we Muggles expect, because chattels can be created and changed to other chattels effectively at no economic cost; so it is entirely possible that the Prophet can still turn a profit at a cost of 5 Knuts (or even 1 Knut) an issue.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#What role does money have in the books, with particular reference to the Weasleys and the Malfoys?
#Are the Weasleys happier than Harry despite having less money?
#How does Harry view the money left to him by his parents in view of the years he has spent at the Dursleys?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The economics of the Harry Potter universe are simpler than the Muggle world, and are also only vaguely defined, as is appropriate for the understanding of the intended audience for (at least) the first few books. It is apparently mostly a public sector economy with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] the seemingly largest employer and supplier of services.  However, the taxation, if any, to finance the Ministry is never mentioned.

Currency is based on precious metal coins minted by goblins requiring no fiduciary reserve. We learn late in the series that some materials, including food, cannot be produced by magic; we must assume that one of these materials is coinage. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Bank]], which is run by goblins and arguably thus also acts as the mint, provides only two services that we see, the vault storage of valuables (mostly gold) and the exchange of Muggle money into wizard money.  There is no apparent interest on deposits, and there seem to be no loans in the Muggle sense.

Although there is a wide variety of consumer goods available in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], there appear to be no factories or other large scale manufacturing capital in the Wizarding World.  Products and goods are manufactured by individual artisans and small firms in a pre-industrial business model.  With the use of magic the productivity of these artisans is sufficient to satisfy the demand of the Wizarding community.  For example, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]] appears to work alone crafting fine wands.  However, even working alone, indications are that he is able to provide wands for most of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry#School population|3,000 to 10,000 wizards in Britain]]. 

Transportation and communication are regulated by the Ministry and in some cases owned and operated by the Ministry (such as the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo Network]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Knight Bus|Knight Bus]], and possibly the Hogwarts Express).  However, most transportation and communication are accomplished by individuals without a public infrastructure.  Examples include [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|apparition]] (which is licensed due to associated risks when used by untutored wizards), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkeys]] (also regulated due to the possibility for misuse), owl post and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|brooms]].

Wealth and poverty are both plot themes in the Harry Potter universe, but how rich families (such as the Malfoys) became wealthy is not known with certainty (although it is likely that this wealth has been accumulated through centuries through inheritance).  Most characters must work for a living (just like the Muggle world).  Wages and salaries vary widely, and many characters are concerned about their finances.  Underpaid workers, such as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]], struggle to support their families.  Unemployable characters (such as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]]) live marginal existences in poverty.  

It is unknown how education at Hogwarts is financed, there is no mention made of tuition costs, though the amount of control the Ministry seems to exert over Hogwarts in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] would suggest significant financial support for school operations from the Ministry.  However, students are responsible for the purchase of uniforms, books and class supplies.  Poorer families (such as the Weasleys) must buy second-hand to afford the expense. There is, we are told, some form of bursary available to the very poorest to enable them to attend Hogwarts; funds were made available to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], for instance. This appears to be done on a very informal basis, however, like much else in the Wizarding universe.

== Calculated Includes and X-Macros ==

I asked this on the wikipedia discussion page and it was suggested that it be brought up here.

There is no explanation of this in this page, and what are some real world examples of how to use it - instead of the simple:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define MACRO &quot;someheader.h&quot;
#include MACRO
&lt;/source&gt;
Is it possible to combine X-Macro capabilities with calculated includes?  How would you do it?

== #define for autoincrementing variables ==

I am missing the preprocessor possibility, how to automaticly generate variables with incrementing &quot;index&quot;, i.e. Var1, Var2, Var3, ... incrementing for every appearence of a special preprocessor directive. Finally the highest index can be used by a further directive. -- [[Special:Contributions/91.96.72.228|91.96.72.228]] ([[User talk:91.96.72.228|talk]]) 14:17, 27 February 2009 (UTC)

: I'm not sure that's very relevant to this book.  There's no built-in way to do what you ask, although __LINE__ combined with token pasting (##) can be used to get a similar effect in many cases.  If the book doesn't mention __LINE__ and __FILE__, it should. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] ([[User talk:James Dennett|talk]]) 19:55, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

: I hear that one can use [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Common-Predefined-Macros.html the &lt;code&gt;__COUNTER__&lt;/code&gt; macro] to get an incrementing index in most popular compilers.
: Some more details, and other approaches to incrementing or decrementing in the preprocessor:
:: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3831952/use-the-c-preprocessor-to-increment-defines &quot;Use the c preprocessor to increment defines?&quot;]
:: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1132751/how-can-i-generate-unique-values-in-the-c-preprocessor &quot;How can I generate unique values in the C preprocessor?&quot;]
:: [http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/language-c-c++-preprocessor-115.html &quot;99 Bottles of Beer using the C Preprocessor&quot;]

: However, most people -- including myself -- have never used the &lt;code&gt;__COUNTER__&lt;/code&gt; symbol or other &quot;preprocessor-incremented variable names&quot;.
: See [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/652815/has-anyone-ever-had-a-use-for-the-counter-pre-processor-macro &quot;Has anyone ever had a use for the __COUNTER__ pre-processor macro?&quot;]
: It always seems that some other approach -- such as using __LINE__ and __FILE__, or using an array Var[1], Var[2], Var[3], or perhaps creating new variables at run-time with calloc() (rather than at preprocessor time), etc. -- always ends up more generally useful. Perhaps the same will also be true in your case. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/DavidCary|contribs]]) 03:04, 21 May 2011 (UTC)

== preprocessor is a part of the compiler (?) ==
I think the wording here is a bit ambiguous:
 &quot;The preprocessor is a part of the compiler which performs preliminary operations (conditionally compiling code, including files etc...) to your code before the compiler sees it.&quot;
 &quot;Directives are handled by the preprocessor, which is either a separate program invoked by the compiler or part of the compiler itself.&quot;</text>

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: flouresent → fluorescent using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">FISH is a technique where you can identify minor changes in chromosomes with the help of fluorescent dyes called probes. These probes are highly sensitive to light. They bind with the specified target and emit signals under the fluorescent microscope and minor deletions and inversions translocations can be identified. This is widely used for prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic diagnosis in identification of trisomies and other structural and numerical abnormalities.Each chromosomes has its own probe.

'''Garden Strawberry''' (''[[w:Fragaria x ananassa|Fragaria x ananassa]]'' and related cultivars) is the most common variety of strawberry cultivated worldwide. Like all strawberries, it is in the family ''[[w:Rosaceae|Rosaceae]]''; its fruit is more technically known as an [[w:accessory fruit|accessory fruit]], in that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries (achenes) but from the peg at the bottom of the bowl-shaped [[w:hypanthium|hypanthium]] that holds the ovaries. 

The Garden Strawberry originated in Europe in the early 18th century, and represents the accidental cross of ''[[w:Fragaria virginiana|Fragaria virginiana]]'' from eastern North America, which was noted for its fine flavor, and ''[[w:Fragaria chiloensis|Fragaria chiloensis]]'' from Chile and noted for its large size.

Cultivars of ''Fragaria x ananassa'' have replaced in commercial production the [[w:Woodland Strawberry|Woodland Strawberry]], which was  the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.

==Description==
Strawberry plants are rosette-forming perennials which spread by thin runners (stolons). The leaves are trifoliate, dark green but paler and haired on the undersides, on long petioles emerging from the crowns. The flowers have yellow centers, with the 5 petals white or occasionally pink, borne underneath the foliage canopy. The fruits need no describing.

Strawberry varieties vary remarkably in fruit size, colour, flavour and shape, the degree of fertility, season of ripening, liability to disease and constitution of plant. Some vary in foliage, and some vary materially in the relative development of their sexual organs. In most cases the flowers appear hermaphroditic in structure, but function as either male or female.

==Cultivation==
[[Image:Strawberry_gariguette_DSC03063.JPG|left|thumb|''Fragaria x ananassa'' 'Gariguette', a tasty cultivar grown in southern France.]]

Strawberries are most often grown in raised beds or containers, though they can also be grown in the field. 

The bulk of modern commercial production uses the plasticulture system. In this method, raised beds are formed each year and covered with black plastic, which prevents weed growth and erosion, under which is run irrigation tubing. Plants, usually obtained from northern nurseries, are planted through holes punched in this covering. Runners are removed from the plants as they appear, to encourage the plants to put most of their energy into fruit development.  At the end of the harvest season, the plastic is removed and the plants are plowed into the ground. Because strawberry plants more than a year or two old begin to decline in productivity and fruit quality, this system of replacing the plants each year allows for improved yields and more dense plantings. However, because it requires a longer growing season to allow for establishment of the plants each year, and because of the increased costs in terms of forming and covering the mounds and purchase plants each year, it is not always practical in all areas.

The other major method is to maintain the same plants from year to year. The runners of established plants should be allowed to root in the soil adjoining the plants, which should, therefore, be kept light and fine, or layered into small pots as for forcing. As soon as a few leaves are produced on each the secondary runners should be stopped. When the plants have become well-rooted they should at once be planted out. They do best in a rather strong loam, and should be kept tolerably moist. The ground should be trenched 50-100 cm deep, and supplied with plenty of manure, a good proportion of which should lie just below the roots, 25-30 cm from the surface. The plants may be put in on an average about 50-60 cm apart.

==Varieties==
Strawberries are often grouped according to their flowering habit. Traditionally, this has consisted of a division between &quot;June-bearing&quot; strawberries, which bear their fruit in the early summer and &quot;Ever-bearing&quot; strawberries, which often bear several crops of fruit throughout the season.  More recently, research has shown that strawberries actually occur in three basic flowering habits: short day, long day, and day neutral.  These refer to the day length sensitivity of the plant and the type of photoperiod which induces flower formation. Day neutral cultivars produce flowers regardless of the photoperiod. Most commercial strawberries are either short day or day neutral.

==Uses==
[[Image:Strawberries in white bowl.jpg|thumb|Strawberries in a bowl]]
Strawberries are often used to flavor other foods, such as ice cream. Apart from its interest as a dessert fruit, the strawberry draws interest due to the peculiarities of its structure, its tendency towards variation, and the gardener's success in exploiting this tendency.

==Maintenance==
[[Image:FraiseFruitPhoto.jpg|left|thumb]]
Most cultivars are somewhat self fertile, but good bee activity has been shown to improve pollination, which results in larger and better shaped berries.  Commercial growers usually place beehives within range of the fields to increase bee populations.

The plantation should be renewed every second or third year, or less frequently if kept free of runners, if the old leaves are cut away after the fruit has been gathered, and if a good top-dressing of rotten dung or leaf mold is applied. A top-dressing of loam is beneficial if applied before the plants begin to grow in spring, but after that period they should not be disturbed during the summer either at root or at top. If the plants produce a large number of flower-scapes, each should, if fine large fruit is desired, have them reduced to about four of the strongest. The lowest blossoms on the scape will be found to produce the largest, earliest and best fruits. The fruit should not be gathered till it is quite ripe, and then, if possible, it should be quite dry, but not heated by the sun. Those intended for preserving are best taken without the stalk and the calyx.

A mulching of straw put between the rows in spring serves to keep the ground moist and the fruit clean, as well as to afford nourishment to the plants. Unless required, the runners are cut off early, in order to promote the swelling of the fruit. The plants are watered during dry weather after the fruit is set, and occasionally till it begins to colour. As soon as the fruit season is over, the runners are again removed, and the ground hoed and raked.

As the plants begin to set fruit, mulch with straw to prevent the fruits from touching the bare soil and to prevent soil being splashed onto the fruit during rain or irrigation.

Strawberries should be cut back to the crown following fruiting, especially if the leaves show signs of disease. They also benefit from being divided and having composts added to the soil.

Runners should be removed if they grow out of the row. These can be used to start new plants in a different row if desired.

Because the foliage of a strawberry patch will retain moisture at the soil surface, care must be taken not to overwater once fruit begins to ripen. An ill-timed rain can result in mold, rot, and slug damage.

==Propagation==
For purposes of both commercial and garden production, the plants are propagated from runners and generally distributed as either bare root plants or plugs. Cultivation follows one of two models, annual plasticulture or a perennial system of matted rows or mounds. A small amount of strawberries are also produced in greenhouses during the off season.

While rarely if ever done commercially, strawberries may also be propagated by seed, and a few seed propagated cultivars have been developed for home use. Seeds are acquired commercially or saved from fruit ripened early in the summer. They may at once be sown, either in a sheltered border outdoors or in pots, or better in March under glass, when they will produce fruits in June of the same year. The soil should be rich and light, and the seeds very slightly covered by sifting over them some leaf-mould or old decomposed cow dung. When the plants appear and have made five or six leaves, they are transplanted to where they are to remain for bearing. The seeds sown in pots may be helped on by gentle heat, and when the plants are large enough they are pricked out in fine rich soil, and in June transferred to the open ground for bearing.

===Forcing for early transplant===
[[Image:strawberry_closeup.jpg|right|thumb|Ripe and unripe strawberries.]]
The runners propagated for forcing are layered into 75 mm pots, filled with rich soil, and held firm by a piece of raffia, a peg or stone. If kept duly watered they will soon form independent plants. The earlier they are secured the better. 

When firmly rooted they are removed and transferred into well-drained 150 mm pots, of strong well-enriched loam, the soil being rammed firmly into the pots, which are to be set in an open airy place. In severe frosts they should be covered with dry litter or bracken, but do not necessarily require to be placed under glass. They are moved into the forcing houses as required. 

The main points to be kept in view in forcing strawberries are:
*use strong stocky plants, the leaves of which have grown sturdily from being well exposed to light, and 
*grow them slowly until the fruit is set. 

When they are first introduced into heat, the temperature should not exceed 8°C to 10°C, and air must be freely admitted; should the leaves appear to grow up thin and delicate, less fire heat and more air must be given, but an average temperature of 13°C by day may be allowed and continued while the plants are in flower. 

When the fruit is set the heat may be gradually increased, till at the ripening period it stands at 18°C to 24°C by sun heat. While the fruit is swelling the plants should never be allowed to get dry, but when it begins to colour no more water should be given than is absolutely requisite to keep the leaves from flagging. The plants should be removed from the house as soon as the crop is gathered. The forced plants properly hardened make first-rate outdoor plantations, and if put out early in summer, in good ground, will often produce a useful autumnal crop.

==Harvest==

Strawberries are ripe when fully red. They should be picked often, as the fruit quickly rots after ripening, and is highly susceptible to gray mold which can spread to other fruits or to the foliage.

After picking, strawberries should be either consumed quickly or frozen, as they are quite prone to molds once picked. If freezing, remove the calyx and stem and freeze fresh.

==Pests and Diseases==
===Fungal diseases===
The most troublesome fungal pests are mildew and leaf spot. The former, like all mildews, attacks the leaves and spreads to the fruit, these being covered with the white mycelium. The fungus is identical with that causing mildew in hops (''Sphaerotheca humuli''), and its development is greatly furthered by exposure of its host to cold draughts or low night temperatures. Spraying the foliage with potassium sulfide (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) (mixed with water at a 1:40 ratio by volume) should hold it in check, but the plants should not be sprayed when the fruit is developing. The &quot;leafspot&quot; is caused by the fungus ''Sphaerella fragariae''. The first symptom of this attack is the appearance of small, circular, white spots on the leaves, having a broad, definite, dark reddish margin.

On these spots a whitish mould develops, and this is followed later by the perfect form of the fungus, the fruits of which appear to the naked eye as small black spots seated on the white dead spot on the leaf. Potassium sulfide may be used as for the mildew, or, perhaps better, Bordeaux mixture. Some recommend cutting off the leaves after fruiting and turn the beds over so as to destroy the fungus in the leaves.

===Arthropod pests===
The grubs of the [[w:cockchafer|cockchafer]] (''Meloloniha vulgaris'') and the [[w:Rose chafer|Rose chafer]] (''Cetonia aurata'') frequently feed upon the roots of the strawberry and do considerable damage, while the larvae of the [[w:Ghost Moth|Ghost Moth]] ''(Hepialus humuli)'' and garden swift moth behave in a similar way. The imago of ''Cetonia aurala'' also frequently damages the flowers of the strawberry by devouring their centres, and is often troublesome in this way in forcing-houses particularly. The carnivorous ground beetles, particularly ''Pterostichus nigra'' and ''Harpalus rufimanus'', when the fruit is ripe attack it at night, returning to the soil in the daytime. They are to be caught by placing jars containing some attractive matter, such as meat and water, at intervals about the beds with their mouths sunk level with the surface of the soil. Millipedes also are often found in the ripe fruit, but occur mostly where the soil is very rich in organic matter and poor in lime. 

===Slugs and snails===
Slugs and snails also snack on the fruit, as do birds. Slug pellets can be used to reduce their numbers, with child and animal safe versions available. Organic solutions to slug attacks include beer baiting. 

===Higher animal pests===
*Birds
*Mice, rats, voles, and squirrels
*White-tailed Deer
*Rabbits

'''''Iris sibirica''''', the '''Siberian Iris''', is a flowering plant, native to eastern and central Europe and northern Asia. It is grown for its showy flowers and good foliage, which is narrower and less coarse than many of the other ''Iris'' species.

==Description==
Siberian iris is an herbaceous perennial plant growing to 50-120 cm tall. The leaves are glaucous green, narrow and fairly rigid, blade-shaped, 40-80 cm long and 2-4 cm broad. The flowers are typical of an iris, borne in late spring or early summer on unbranched or sparsely-branched stems held above the leaves, each flower 4-7 cm diameter. Flowers of the species are mid- to purple-blue, often with a paler whitish or yellowish centre, though cultivars are sometimes much paler or white.

==Growing conditions==
This iris requires full sun and ample drainage. When planting, the roots should be slightly above the level of the surrounding soil (the exposed edges can be hidden with compost or mulch). They will appreciate composts, but nitrogenous fertilizers will encourage heavy vegetative growth and few flowers. 

This plant will not flower in shady locations, and will die in deep shade.

==Varieties==
There are several cultivars selected for flower color and form. Most cultivars of this species are likely hybrids with related species of ''Iris''.

==Uses==
In the garden, siberian iris is commonly grown as an accent plant for its showy flowers and tidy, erect form. The plants are often left up during the winter, as the foliage develops a good color, and the seed pods have ornamental interest.

The long-stemmed flowers are often harvested for the vase as a fresh flower. The seed pods are also used in winter arrangements.

==Maintenance==
After a few years growing in the garden, Siberian iris will develop a &quot;hollow center&quot;, growing in a ring around the old roots. The foliage then begins to point outwards, losing some of its ornamental appeal. When the hollow center develops, simply dig up and divide the plant after flowering. 

The foliage can be left up for winter interest, but as it begins growth early in the spring, it should be cut back in mid- to late winter.

==Propagation==
This plant is easy to propagate through division, though the thick roots can be difficult to separate. An axe or mattock is recommended.

==Harvesting==
Cut flowers should be immediately placed in water.

==Pests and diseases==
Siberian iris has few serious pest and disease issues.

==1. Answer the following questions:==
===a. What is the earth's nearest celestial neighbor? What is its distance from the earth?===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Stars/Nearest neighbor}}

===b. What governs the tides?===
The tides are governed by the Moon, and to a lesser extent, by the Sun.

===c. What causes an eclipse?===
An eclipse is caused when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are in a direct line with one another.  When the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, we see a lunar eclipse, which is the Earth's shadow falling on the moon.  When the Moon is between the Sun and the Earth, we see a solar eclipse, which is when the Moon's shadow falls on the Earth (blocking the Sun).

===d. What is a shooting star?===
A shooting star is not a star at all, but rather a meteor.  A meteor is any celestial body (usually quite small) that falls to the Earth.  Most burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the surface, leaving a bright, short-lived streak in the sky. It is ''not'' a comet.

==2. Make a diagram showing relative positions and movements of the earth, sun, and moon. Show positions and area events for eclipses of the sun and moon.==
One may demonstrate by using an orange, walnut, and marble, or similar objects, to show positions and movements of the earth, sun, and moon when there is an eclipse of the sun and when there is an eclipse of the moon.

Place the &quot;sun&quot; model in the center.  Place the &quot;earth&quot; some distance from the sun, and show how it travels in a near circle around the sun.  The moon travels around the earth, but it always shows the same face to the earth (it's rotation on its axis takes the same amount of time as its orbit around the earth.

==3. Make a diagram of our solar system and be able to name the planets in order from the sun.==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Stars/Planets}}

==4. How fast does light travel? How far does light travel in a year?==

Light travels at 186,000 miles per second (not miles per hour), which is 300,000 kilometers per second. In one year, light will travel 5.88 trillion miles (9.4 quadrillion km). This distance is also called a light-year.

==5. What is the difference between planets and fixed stars? Identify in the sky eight fixed stars.==
The word ''planet'' means ''wanderer'' because the planets appear to wander about the sky relative to the stars.  The stars do not move in relation to one another (although they all appear to move together because of the Earth's rotation on its axis).

Which eight stars you choose to teach your Pathfinders to identify will depend on the season (spring, summer, winter, or fall), although some stars are visible year-round.  

===Stars visible in the Northern Hemisphere===
====Polaris====
[[Image:Finding_polaris.png|thumb|400px|right|Finding Polaris]]
Polaris is one of the most useful stars for a person in the Northern Hemisphere to be able to identify, as it can tell you two things:  which way is north, and what is your latitude (if your latitude is 38°, Polaris will be 38° above the horizon).
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
====Capella====
[[Image:Finding_capella.png|thumb|400px|right|Finding Capella]]
Capella can be found by following the line made by the two stars in the Big Dipper's handle and extending it across the Dipper's bowl.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
====Arcturus====
[[image:Finding arcturus.png|thumb|right|400px|Position of Arcturus]]
Arcturus is the brightest star in the constellation Boötes, and the third brightest star in the night sky.  Arcturus can be found in the summer by following the arc made by handle of the Big Dipper (away from the dipper's bowl).
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==6. What is a constellation? Name and point out six. Name two constellations visible throughout the year.==
A constellation is any one of the 88 areas into which the sky - or the celestial sphere - is divided. The term is also often used less formally to denote a group of stars visibly related to each other in a particular configuration or pattern.

;Ursa Major: Ursa Major is better known as the Big Dipper.  It appears in the north and is fairly easy to identify.  It is illustrated in a previous requirement.

;Ursa Minor: Ursa Minor is better known as the Little Dipper.  Use the instructions given previously for finding Polaris, which is the end of the Little Dipper's handle.  Unfortunately, the stars that make up Ursa Minor are relatively dim, making this one a bit more difficult to find.

;Cassiopeia: Cassiopiea is illustrated in the next requirement and is generally visible (at some time during the night) all year round.  It is on the opposite side of Polaris from the Big Dipper.

;Boötes: Instructions for finding Arcturus, and thus the constellation Boötes are given in a previous requirement.  

[[Image:Summer_triangle.png|thumb|400px|The Summer Triangle, including, Deneb (in Cygnus), Vega (in Lyra), and Altair (in Aquila)]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
;Cygnus, Altair, and Lyra: These are easily identified summer constellations.  The brightest stars in each of these three make up the Summer Triangle.  Once the stars are found, it is easy to find the constellations they are part of.  Vega is the brightest star in the Summer Triangle, and it is a member of the constellation Lyra.  Cygnus is also known as the Northern Cross.  The triangle is completed by Altair which is a member of the constellation Aquila.

[[Image:Wintersky.jpg]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
The Winter Circle is made up of several bright stars visible in the Northern hemisphere's winter.  The easiest constellation to find in the Winter Circle is Orion.  Following Orion's belt will lead to Sirius, the brightest star in the sky and a member of Canis Major (the &quot;big dog&quot;).  Canis Minor (the &quot;little dog&quot;) is clockwise from Sirius.  Continuing clockwise, we come to Gemini, Auriga, and Taurus.

The constellations that are visible throughout the year are the ones near the celestial poles:

==7. For the Northern Hemisphere: draw a chart of the Big Dipper, Cassiopeia, and the North Star. For the Southern Hemisphere: draw a chart of the Southern Cross, Orion and Scorpio.==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Stars/Big Dipper, Cassiopeia, and the North Star}}

{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Stars/Southern Cross, Orion and Scorpio}}

==8. What is the Milky Way? Observe the Milky Way in the night sky.==
A large gathering of stars and bodies making up one of many galaxies.  The portion visible in the night sky of Earth is only a single dimensional or flat view of the galaxy as our solar system is part of the same galaxy we have lack for a broader perspective.

==9. What is the morning star and evening star? Why does it carry both names? Observe the morning and evening star in the sky.==

This is not a star at all but the Planet Venus and draws in part its modern status as the Morning Star and Evening Star from mythology. Venus never appears on the opposite horizon from the sun due to its relative location to the sun and Earth.  Mercury too fits this profile but is rarely actually visible.

==10. Explain zenith and nadir.==
Zenith is the point in space directly overhead.  If you extend a line from the zenith to the point on Earth upon which you are standing, and continue that line through the Earth and out the other side, it would point to the nadir.  In other words, nadir is the direction pointing directly below a particular location. The line connecting the zenith and nadir passes through the point on Earth where you're standing and also passes through the center of the Earth and out the other side.

==11. What is the aurora borealis? What causes it?==
An Aurora is a beautiful natural phenomenon that often occurs in the polar regions of Earth.                                                                                                                                                                

The immediate causes of aurora are precipitating energetic particles. These particles are electrons and protons that are energized in the near geospace environment. This energization process draws its energy from the interaction of the Earth's magnetosphere with the solar wind.

==12. Discuss the statement made by Ellen G. White in Early Writings, page 41, concerning the opening in Orion.==
:''“December 16, 1848, the Lord gave me a view of the shaking of the powers of the heavens. I saw that when the Lord said &quot;heaven,&quot; in giving the signs recorded by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, He meant heaven, and when He said &quot;earth&quot; He meant earth. The powers of heaven are the sun, moon, and stars. They rule in the heavens. The powers of earth are those that rule on the earth. The powers of heaven will be shaken at the voice of God. Then the sun, moon, and stars will be moved out of their places. They will not pass away, but be shaken by the voice of God.''
 
:''Dark, heavy clouds came up and clashed against each other. The atmosphere parted and rolled back; then we could look up through the open space in Orion, whence came the voice of God. The Holy City will come down through that open space. I saw that the powers of earth are now being shaken and that events come in order. War, and rumors of war, sword, famine, and pestilence are first to shake the powers of earth, then the voice of God will shake the sun, moon, and stars, and this earth also. I saw that the shaking of the powers in Europe is not, as some teach, the shaking of the powers of heaven, but it is the shaking of the angry nations.” – Passages from Ellen G. White Early writings, page 41''

The above statement clearly mentions the events that would occur during Christ’s second coming to this earth. The passage also mentions that God’s voice would be heard through the open space in the Orion and also the “New Jerusalem” would descend from that open space. It is in agreement with the Holy Bible in Revelation 3:12 “Him that overcometh will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, '''and the name of the city of my God, which is New Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God''': and I will write upon him my new name.”

The same is also mentioned in the book of Revelation, chapter 21:2 &amp; 3 '''“And I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven''' saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God.”

The passage also mentions on many things that would happen at the end of time whereby it affects nature terribly and also war between world countries with no more peace and safe place for humans.

==Notes==
On August 24, 2006 the International Astronomers Union, a non-governmental entity, reclassified Pluto giving it the status of Dwarf Planet.  This new classification is based on their updated definition of what a planet is.  One reason for the change is because the new definition requires that a planet &quot;dominate&quot; its orbit.  Pluto's orbit crosses and is dominated by Neptune.  Furthermore, scientists are discovering that the region of Pluto's orbit, which is known as the Kuiper Belt, is similar to the asteroid belt.  There are many Pluto-like objects in that region, including one name Eris which is larger than Pluto.  This means Pluto is more like an asteroid than it is like a planet.
